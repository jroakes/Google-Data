Attributes
-
closeReason
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Structured reason for the permanent closure (if any). -
closed
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Indicates whether the place is closed (permanently or temporarily), i.e., not operational in the present, but was in the past. WARNING: New code should prefer go/geo-schema-reference:operational-status. -
endAsOfDate
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto.t
, default:nil
) - The earliest known date of this feature's "end" (e.g. an establishment's permanent closure), if the actual date is unknown; i.e. the best known upper bound of the day end_date would represent. end_as_of_date must be in local (civil) time and of PRECISION_DAY. WARNING: Not necessarily consistent yet withclosed
or the ClosureAttachmentProto. If you believe you need to use this field directly, please go/contact-geo-schema. -
endDate
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto.t
, default:nil
) - -
featureBirthTimestampSeconds
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - DEPRECATED This field is now deprecated (see b/22878252). Please use the Geo Schema GetFeatureBirthTimestamp() API to extract the birth timestamp of a feature. The timestamp in seconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970) when this feature becomes live in the Geo repository. This was the birth date of the place's representation in Google whereas start_date is the birth date of the place's operations in the physical world. -
removed
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Indicates whether the feature is marked as removed in the Geo repository. Removed features are still present in the Geo repository but are considered to be in an inactive state (not valid for lint purposes, not retrievable except explicitly by feature ID, etc.). NOTE: If you have access to a complete FeatureProto, do NOT read this bit directly to find out whether a feature is removed. Instead, rely on the IsFeatureRemoved() API, available in C++ (geostore/base/public/feature.h) and Java (geostore/base/Feature.java). -
removedReason
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Structured reason why the feature is marked as removed. Relevant only when removed == true. -
startDate
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto.t
, default:nil
) - (Initial) start and (permanent) end dates of operations, such that start_date is the first day operational and end_date is the first day when operations have permanently ended. The only allowed precisions are PRECISION_DAY, PRECISION_MONTH, PRECISION_YEAR. DateTimeProto.seconds should have the lowest legal value for the desired date/time and precision. E.g. for PRECISION_MONTH, 2019-02-15 21:10:30 is not valid, it should be 2019-02-01 00:00:00 instead. NOTE: The start_date and end_date are stored in UTC but should be interpreted as being in the local timezone. So clients should convert the DateTimeProto to local (civil) time using UTC+0, and then treat the result as local to the feature.
