View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoodocAnchorLabel (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An anchor label can be attached to any element to give it a reference address. LogicalEntity links (see goodoc-semantics.proto) may use anchor labels to point to goodoc elements (they may also use indices to locate the element, but the indices could become invalid if the goodocs are allowed to mutate). Multiple elements may have the same anchor.
