View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.HtmlrenderWebkitHeadlessProtoAnonTimingStatPair (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
TimingStatPair message stores a timing period name and a time value. This is intentionally vague for doing fine level timing of rendering as what we measure is likely to change as we iterate. The intention is also that these values will just be dumped to varzs for evaluation purposed and not used programmatically.
