View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreOverrideBorderStatusProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This message captures a border status override. For instance, if the TYPE_BORDER feature between China and Hong Kong must be hidden on ditu.google.cn (the Chinese domain for Google Maps) but may be displayed on other domains, we will have a country override border status for "CN" set to STATUS_NEVER_DISPLAY. At least one override restriction must be defined. Currently the only supported restriction is by country code.
Attributes
-
countryCode
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code corresponding to the domain this status override applies to, when rendering the border polyline. -
status
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The override status, from the BorderStatus enumeration. The value here must be different from the main status (otherwise there's no point in providing the override).
