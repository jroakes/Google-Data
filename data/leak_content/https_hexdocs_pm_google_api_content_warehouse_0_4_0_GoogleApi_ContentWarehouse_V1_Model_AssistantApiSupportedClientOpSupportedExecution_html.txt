View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AssistantApiSupportedClientOpSupportedExecution (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Additional properties that client can support for executing the client op. They are surface-specific execution properties and are unrelated to the execution model.
Attributes
-
supportsPartialFulfillment
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - ClientOp execution supports special rendering behavior while the user is in the middle of expressing their query. This behavior includes: 1) New partial output always over-writes prior partial output. 2) Canceling the interaction removes partial fulfilment from any user visible interaction history. If this is true, whether to apply the special rendering behavior will be determined by PartialFulfillmentRenderingParams. More details can be found at go/ma-natcon-pf-api. -
supportsSynchronousExecution
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Client can support synchronous execution of the client op. For tts.OUTPUT client op it means that client would honor |synchronous_playback_args| argument. Please see more at go/synchronous-sounds-design.
