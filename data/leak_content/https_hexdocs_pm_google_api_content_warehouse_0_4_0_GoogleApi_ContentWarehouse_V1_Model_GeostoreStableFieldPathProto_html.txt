View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreStableFieldPathProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Represents a way to traverse nested fields by referencing their token fields. Everything starts relative to a known root message, specified externally. E.g., suppose we have a feature proto that has a lane with token 0x123 which in turn has a lane connection with token 0x456 for which we want to assert something about flowline altitudes. The field path in that case will look like: field_path: { field_num: 31 # segment } field_path: { field_num: 6 # lane version_token: "0x123" } field_path: { field_num: 8 # lane_connection version_token: "0x456" } field_path: { field_num: 3 # flow } field_path: { field_num: 1 # track } field_path: { # Note: pose is repeated. By not specifying a token we refer to all poses # in a track. field_num: 2 # pose } field_path: { field_num: 4 # altitude } This path could also be represented succinctly in a more human-friendly form as something like: segment.lane[@0x123].lane_connection[@0x456].flow.track.pose[*].altitude
