Attributes
-
hasReferencedEntityAtCreation
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether the reminder created has a referenced_entity attached to it or not(go/hub-memory-payload). Since we plan to set this in Assistant reminder creation path flow, in case later the referenced_entity is removed from the reminder, then this bit might still remain true. Also in case referenced_entity is later added to reminder(for example when referenced_entity is attached by Server), then also this bit might remain false. This bit will be used to guess if the user has a memory-enabled AGSA, thus we'll surface the "open memory" button on hubpage. This check is not perfect, as the user might have other phones with older AGSA, so this is just a best guess. This field won't be stored in Memory backend, and will not be populated back when retrieving reminders. -
recordId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Id of record that is associated with Reminder. This will be set for all Assistant reminders created after the first launch of the Reminder Memory integration, see go/reminders-memory for more details. Also, this might apply to all other types of reminders.
