View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SpeechS3LanguageIdentificationResult (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Response proto for the LangId service running on a Greco server in prod. Next Tag: 6
Attributes
-
endTimeUsec
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The end time of the input audio that this result refers to. This value should increase across LanguageIdentificationResult emitted by the Greco server running LangId, and reflects the server having processed more of the input audio. -
rankedTopSupportedLanguages
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SpeechS3Locale.t)
, default:nil
) - Ranked list of top-N language codes. Ranking is based on ConfidenceIntervals of supported languages, and N is defined in the LanguageIdentificationConfig. -
startTimeUsec
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Global start time. This value should be fixed across all LanguageIdentificationResults for a given utterance. -
topLanguageConfidence
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Confidence interval of the top recognized language. -
voicedUtterance
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Identifies when the provided audio sample does or doesn't contain voiced samples. E.g. an unvoice utterance happens when the EOS signal is received before any frame because all frames were filtered by the endpointer. For events where voiced_utterance is false, ranked_top_supported_languages is defined but scores are not to be trusted. All LanguageIdentificationResults contains a valid value of voiced_utterance.
