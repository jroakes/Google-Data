View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeaturePropertyIdProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Message to represent a "feature property" as an abstract construct. Most feature properties are mapped one to one with the EditProto field types. However in some cases the EditProto field type granularity is too coarse to support use-cases that rely on feature properties (such as per-value rights tracking). When that is the case, the feature property is augmented with a secondary field.
