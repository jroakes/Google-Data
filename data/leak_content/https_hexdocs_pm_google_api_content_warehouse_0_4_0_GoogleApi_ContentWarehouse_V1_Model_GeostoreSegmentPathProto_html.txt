View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreSegmentPathProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A segment path describes a path through a short set of segments. The segment path can be used for any purpose. At the moment, only TYPE_ROAD_SIGN features can have associated segment paths: The segment path lists the segments that refer to the sign. These are the segments for which the sign is applicable. The sign's physical location is independent of the segments in the path.
Attributes

(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - Specifies a sequence of feature ids of GeoStore segments. The feature ids are ordered. The path "AB" is not the same as the path "BA".
