View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AssistantApiProtobuf (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Also known as "Extensions Without Extensions" or "The Poor Man's Any", this simple proto is used to transmit arbitrary protocol buffers over the wire. Unlike extensions: - It does not require the proto type to be compiled into the binary. (Useful so that the proto declaration can be inside the conversation package) - It is compatible with all versions of proto, including proto3 and the wack-tastic version used on ChromecastOS. Server libraries for dealing with it live in google3/assistant/protocol/protobuf_lib.h.
Attributes
-
protobufData
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The serialized protocol buffer. -
protobufType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The type of the protocol buffer to use. This must be a resolvable name (Namespace.ProtoName) and refer to a proto which is either compiled in to both client and server (e.g. a base proto type) or to one which is part of the conversation package.
