View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GDocumentBaseOriginalContent (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The original, unconverted document, typically PDF or Word. Copied from OriginalDoc field of doclogs. Unlike "Content", this does not contain any HTTP headers. The content may be compressed using the same method as "Content". In practice it is only compressed in the Teragoogle index. It is never compressed in docjoins because those are compressed at the sstable level. In doclogs content will only be compressed if the Trawler fetchreply is also compressed--which is currently never and unlikely to change for performance reasons.
