View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AnchorsRedundantAnchorInfo (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
NOTE: in docjoins, the following anchor sampling information is only ## available in the first record of a document (under the same docid). The total number of redundant anchors dropped per (domain, text) in linkextractor. If we receive a large number of anchors from a particular domain, then we'll throw out all but a sampling of them from that domain. The data is sorted by the (domain,text) pairs. This field is not populated by Alexandria, which uses cdoc.anchor_stats instead.
