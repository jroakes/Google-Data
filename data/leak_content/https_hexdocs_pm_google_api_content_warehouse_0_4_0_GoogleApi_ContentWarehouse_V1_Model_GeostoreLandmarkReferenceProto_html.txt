View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreLandmarkReferenceProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This protocol buffer represents the association between a segment and a landmark feature. Notes: - References to TYPE_SEGMENT features should always point to the even sibling. - Self-references are allowed but the referencing segment's sibling is required to have a self-reference as well (the above requirement to always reference the even sibling still applies).
