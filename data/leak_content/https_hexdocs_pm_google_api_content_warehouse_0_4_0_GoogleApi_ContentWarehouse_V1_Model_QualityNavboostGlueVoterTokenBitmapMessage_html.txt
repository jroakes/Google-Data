View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityNavboostGlueVoterTokenBitmapMessage (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Used for aggregating query unique voter_token during merging. We use 4 uint64(s) as a 256-bit bitmap to aggregate distinct voter_tokens in Glue model pipeline. Number of elements should always be either 0 or 4. As an optimization, we store the voter_token as a single uint64 if only one bit is set. See quality/navboost/speedy_glue/util/voter_token_bitmap.h for the class that manages operations on these bitmaps.
