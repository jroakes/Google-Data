View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.TrawlerFetchReplyDataDeliveryReport (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Depending on which Data Acquisition API the client uses, the fetched content can be delivered to the client in the RPC, via Goops, or copied to the client's storage system (possibly after transformation). In the latter case, DeliveryReport will contain info about the delivery status, such as whether we have permission error, whether the destination storage is out of quota, etc).
