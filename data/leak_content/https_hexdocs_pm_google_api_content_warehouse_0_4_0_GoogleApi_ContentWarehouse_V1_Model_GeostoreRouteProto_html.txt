View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRouteProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A route is a collection of segments that forms a logical group - usually a named road or highway. Segments can belong to more than one route, and the segments of one route may be a subset of the segments of another route (e.g. I-5 N is a subset of I-5). Segments in the collection that define the route do not need to constitute a single uninterrupted line, there can be disconnects. The standard feature properties are interpreted as follows: name - Routes should have one or more names. (While unnamed roads certainly exist in the real world, we choose not to create route features for such roads. Instead, the unnamed segments are merely not part of any route.) address - This should always be empty. type - Specifies a particular route subtype, see feature.proto. point - This should always be empty. polyline - This should always be empty. polygon - This should always be empty. child - The pairs of segments that belong to this route (a given route should always reference segments in both travel directions).
Attributes
