Attributes
-
deviceContactId
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.FocusBackendDeviceContactId.t)
, default:nil
) - Device contact ID, when available: - The annotation points to a device contact, and the device contact id was correctly populated when the annotation was created. Note that the device contact id is populated once per device contact on a device. It is distinct from RawContactId - a single device contact may have multiple raw contact ids. - The annotation points to a Focus contact that was merged with device contact information in Starlight. When the annotation was created, a device contact id was available on the merged person object. - The contact annotation was created from April 2021 onwards. All prior annotations do not populate this field. ContactPointer creation relies on the client caller to correctly populate the device contact id, and does not enforce any assumptions on availability of this field. This field is repeated because in rare cases Starlight may merge device contact information across different devices into a single merged person object. WARNING: Use with extreme caution! This ID is not stable. For more details see go/fbs-support-for-device-contacts.
