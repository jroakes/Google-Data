View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesMentionPropertiesListEntryInfo (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Contains information about how an entity was presented as part of a list.
Attributes
-
index
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The index of the entity presented to the user. NOTE: Indexing starts from 0. -
lexicalGroundingsId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A string which uniquely identifies the list item this entity represents in the list. For example, consider the "OrderPizza" intent with the "size" slot: U: I want to order a pizza A: Sure. What size do you want: large, medium, or small? U: Gigantic The lexical_groundings_id can be "large" to identify the large item in the list. This lexical_groundings_id together with the semantic role fields (i.e., role.intent_id & role.role_id) can be used to match the nlp_semantic_parsing::LexicalGroundings::ValueTermType to utilize lexical grounding for i18n of static list selection items. Note that this field only needs to be populated when developers expect to provide lexical groundings for the list item this entity represents. Effectively, this field will be populated when this entity is published by ListPresentationFrame and the ::quality::dialog_manager::IntentStageSignals::FieldCandidate.lexical_groundings_id field is populated. See go/lpf-i18nv2 & go/taskstate-ae-sync for more details.
