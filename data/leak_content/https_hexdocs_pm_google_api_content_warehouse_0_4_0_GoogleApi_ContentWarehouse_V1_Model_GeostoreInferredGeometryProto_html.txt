View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreInferredGeometryProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Inferred geometry defines the geometry of a feature as the union or exclusion of the geometry of other features. For instance, the geometry of a timezone can be specified as the union of all the countries it applies to. In this scenario, the timezone will can be considered a "composite feature", while the countries are its "composing features". A composite feature must have a bidirectional reference between itself and all its composing features. A composite feature refers to its composing features via geometry_composition
, while the composing features must refer back to the composing feature via defines_geometry_for
. See: go/inferred-geometry and go/geo-schema:composite-geometry-editor for more details.
