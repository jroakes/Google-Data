View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.DrishtiFeatureSetDataSequence (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This represents a sequence (ordered) of FeatureSetData elements.
Attributes
-
element
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.DrishtiFeatureSetData.t)
, default:nil
) - FeatureSetData contains the features. In most scenarios, you only have one element. However, multiple elements are appropriate in case of videos where each element may correspond to a frame in the video. -
extra
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.DrishtiFeatureExtra.t)
, default:nil
) - Some extra information about this FeatureSetDataSequence. (Almost never used). -
label
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.DrishtiLabelSetElement.t)
, default:nil
) - Global (video-level) labels. In most cases, you only have one LabelSetElement. All the labels will be stored in this single LabelSetElement. Scenarios where you may have multiple LabelSetElement(s) is (for example) when you want to differentiate the labels into various sub-groups - eg, central vs relevant, kg-ids vs queries, etc. -
timestamp
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - If set, must be same length as element. Each entry is the timestamp in microseconds where the FeatureSetData element was extracted.
