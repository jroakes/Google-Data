View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDataSourceProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Every data source used to construct a data repository has an associated feature that provides more information about it. The standard feature properties have the following interpretations: bound - The bounds must includes all features that refer to this data source, so that bucketing MapReduce passes work correctly. name - The provider name associated with this data source. It is expected to remain constant from release to release, and between datasets. address - should be empty. point, polyline, polygon - should be empty. source_info - should not be set. child - should be empty.
Attributes
-
attributionUrl
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUrlProto.t)
, default:nil
) - This is the URL of a website representing this DataSource as a whole. If this DataSource feature is specific to a particular dataset or product, the page may contain information relevant to that dataset or product or may be the main page of the organization. -
copyrightOwner
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A UTF8 string that will be inserted in copyright messages to refer to this copyright owner, e.g. "Tele Atlas". -
copyrightYear
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The copyright year of this data (which may be different than the year of the release date), e.g. 2005. -
description
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A free-form description of this data source. Ideally the description should include: - Where the data was obtained (URL, company name, individual, etc). - Where to find detailed documentation. - A brief summary of the licensing terms. - As much internal and external contact information as possible (e.g. who to ask about licensing questions, interpreting the data, updating the data, fixing bugs in the importer, etc). -
importerBuildInfo
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The build information of the importer binary used to generate this data source. -
importerBuildTarget
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The build target of the importer binary used to generate this data source. -
importerClientInfo
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The Perforce client information of the importer binary used to generate this data source. -
importerMpmVersion
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If the importer was built as an MPM, the version number can be stored in this field. As with build_info, this can be useful when tracking down issues that may be due to the use of a particular binary. -
importerTimestamp
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The timestamp of the importer binary used to generate this data source. -
provider
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The provider type of this data source. -
rawMetadata
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRawMetadataProto.t)
, default:nil
) - For every key that is used in raw_data from this source, there must be a corresponding entry in raw_metadata that describes this key. -
release
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A release string that doesn't have to be a date. This is provided so that we can preserve provider release strings that aren't based on dates. If you don't set it, the release_date will get formatted into this field for debugging purposes. -
releaseDate
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto.t
, default:nil
) - The release date of this data. -
sourceDataset
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A data provider defined string describing the source dataset from which the features of this data source were generated. For example, the MultiNet "fra" dataset produces features for both France and Monaco.
