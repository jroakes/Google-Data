View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryIndexingIQLAttachment (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Mustang/Kgraph attachment to encode IQL expressions annotated by Webref, Pianno, and other applications. This is currently a prototype implementation. The attachment is not yet output in production. Please contact simonz@ for more info. The planned use-cases include: - Pianno page-level intents (go/pianno-design). - Compound entity representations (go/compounds-in-refx). See go/iql-in-wma for more details about IQL attachment and its encoding design. Next available tag: 5
Attributes
-
iqlEncodingVersion
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The version of encoder for the IQL FunctionCalls. We bump up the version when, but not limited to, we change how an IQL is converted to a byte array, or the change of byte compression algorithm. -
iqlFuncalls
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A compressed byte array that represents IQL FunctionCalls. A list of IQL FunctionCalls are first encoded as a byte array. The byte array is then compressed. For more details on the encoding, see go/iql-in-wma. -
piannoConfidenceScoreE2
(type:list(integer())
, default:nil
) - The Pianno confidence scores of all intents of the IQL FunctionCalls. For space reasons this is stored as a [0, 100] integer that represents the confidence up to two decimal points (fixed point). Convert it to confidence_score using the following formula: float pianno_confidence_score = pianno_confidence_score_e2 / 100.0f It should have the same number of elements as the IQL expressions after decoding. For non-Pianno top level intents, this score is 0. -
piannoIqlBitmap
(type:list(integer())
, default:nil
) - A bit map indicating if the intents in the IQL FunctionCalls are top level intents for Pianno (go/pianno). This is a repeated field. In the event of more than 32 intents, the first uint32/ represents the 1st to the 32nd intents, and the second uint32 represents/ the 33rd to the 64th intents, and so on. Within each uint32, the bits are in reversed order, i.e. the right-most bit of the first uint32 indicating if the first intent in IQL expressions is a top level intent for Pianno. The prevailing (unused) bits of the last uint32 are filled with 0s.
