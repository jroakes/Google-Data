View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreJobRelatedCategory (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This is the category that a user picked this job type from at the time of input. The field serves two purposes: 1) The name is used in consumer surface similar to the heading name today (i.e., grouping jobs under the category. 2) The gcid is needed mainly for free-formed entries, for which GMB needs to map them to corresponding categories in the frontend, if applicable. Notice that the name and the id are both not expected to be in sync with gcid deprecation or location category change per product decision. In other words, they are not guaranteed to stay in sync, only guaranteed true at time of creation.
