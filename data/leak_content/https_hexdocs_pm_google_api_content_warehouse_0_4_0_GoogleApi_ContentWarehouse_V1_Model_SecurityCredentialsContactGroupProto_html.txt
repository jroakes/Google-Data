View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsContactGroupProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A group of contacts for a given user, as described in http://cs/p#google3/focus/backend/proto/backend.proto Historically (and in still-existing ACLs), this was used to represent Google+ circles as well as contact groups, but this use is now deprecated. New code should use the CIRCLE principal type to represent Google+ circles.
Attributes
-
groupId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Group ID is unique only relative to the owner's Gaia ID. -
ownerGaiaId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - -
requiredConsistencyTimestampUsec
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If present, then tests for membership in this ContactGroup must use data known to be at least as fresh as the given (FBS-assigned) timestamp. See http://go/fbs-consistent-read-after-important-write Before using this, be sure that any service checking authorization against this group supports checking consistency timestamps. For example, as of 12/2011, Keystore only supports this for the Moonshine configuration, and in others authorization checks will fail if the timestamp is present.
