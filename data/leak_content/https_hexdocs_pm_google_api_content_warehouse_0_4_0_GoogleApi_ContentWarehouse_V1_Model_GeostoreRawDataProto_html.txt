View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRawDataProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A RawDataProto is a key-value pair that represents arbitrary source data from a particular provider. Raw data can be attached to features using their source_info field.
Attributes
-
key
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The key associated with this data item. For source data in shape file format, this will typically be a column name. Keys need to be unique with respect to a particular data source (see DataSourceProto), but they do not need to be globally unique. You can look up the documentation for a key (e.g. a longer label and description) by following the source_id link of the parent SourceInfoProto, which takes you to a TYPE_DATA_SOURCE feature, and then looking up the corresponding RawMetadataProto object for this key in that feature's optional data_source field. -
valueString
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - All data items are represented as strings, the logic being that it is easy to convert other data types to strings, and there is no need to access this data efficiently.
