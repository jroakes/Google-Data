View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.TrawlerClientServiceInfo (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
ClientServiceInfo is meant for trawler/harpoon clients which are in turn services to store some data specific to their clients. E.g., Kodachrome may serve multiple other clients. In this case they can store their client name here. Webmirror may also store the feed name here even though a feed is technically not a service client. ClientServiceInfo is in nature similar to ClientInfo, except it's stored in FetchReplyData (i.e., trawler logs), whereas ClientInfo is copied to FetchReply (outside FetchReplyData), thus it's not stored in trawler logs.
