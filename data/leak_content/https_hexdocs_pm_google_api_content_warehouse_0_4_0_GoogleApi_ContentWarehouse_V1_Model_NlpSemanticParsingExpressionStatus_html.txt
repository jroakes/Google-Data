View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingExpressionStatus (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Status indicating whether the user has finished expressing their intended semantics during a streaming interaction. Semantics are partially expressed when later, unprompted user input is expected to modify the semantics. Future inputs are typically additional speech or continued modification of argument text in form field. These inputs can trigger modifications including adding arguments, changing the intent, or modifying existing arguments. Sensing this status can be done both directly and indirectly. Fluid Actions directly detects this status as the user moves between, or enters and leaves, argument form fields. Understanding indirectly detects this status by the pace of the user's speech, the semantics of the language, and the user's intonation. See go/streaming-nlu-fulfilment-protocol-v1 for details about how it is used in the Streaming NLU Fulfillment protocol.
