View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamNearestNeighbors (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
All nearest neighbors for one data point. Last tag used: 5
Attributes
-
docid
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Data point for which we computed nearest neighbors. This field is set based on the data_id_str field in the QueryRequest GFV (or SSTable key if data_id_str is not present), and thus can be arbitrary data, e.g. docid, URL, query string. -
metadata
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Metadata about the query. This field is populated if and only if: 1) ScaM is running in offline query-database or online mode and; 2) The metadata is directly fetched from the userinfo field inside GFV and; 3) MetadataConfig.userinfo.set_user_info_for_query is set to true. The field name is kept as "metadata" for consistency with neighbors. -
neighbor
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamNearestNeighborsNeighbor.t)
, default:nil
) - All its neighbors. -
neighborSelectionOverride
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamNeighborSelectionOverride.t
, default:nil
) - Propagate neighbor selection override information during offline search. -
query
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamGenericFeatureVector.t
, default:nil
) - The query vector for which we computed nearest neighbors. -
retrievedVersion
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The version ID of the server that responded to this query, if one was specified. This field is not populated for offline (i.e. Flume rather than RPC) search.
