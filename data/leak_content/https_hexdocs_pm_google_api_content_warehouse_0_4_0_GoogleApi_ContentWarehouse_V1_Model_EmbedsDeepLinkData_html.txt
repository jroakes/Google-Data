View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.EmbedsDeepLinkData (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Deep-linking data is used to construct a deep-link URI for an activity or frame's embed, such that on click, the user is taken to the right place in a mobile app. If the app is not installed, the user is taken to the app store. If not on mobile, an analogous web uri is used.
Attributes
-
appId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Application ID (or project ID) from Google API Console. -
client
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.EmbedsPackagingServiceClient.t)
, default:nil
) - The data for a Google API Console client is entered by a developer during client registration and is stored in PackagingService. -
deepLinkId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The ID for non-URL content. Embeds may either have no analogous web presence or prefer a native mobile experience if supported. In the case of no web presence, instead of setting the "url" field of an embed, such developers will set this field and other content fields, e.g. thumbnail, title, description. If set, this field is used to construct the deep-link URI. Note that the native experience is preferred over the web link and the web link is used as a fallback. -
url
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Analogous web presence. Used as desktop fallback or when no native link data is present.
