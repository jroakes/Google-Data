View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.LocalsearchChainId (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An unique identification of a chain. The following are the possible chain id forms: 1) prominent_entity_id only: The entity uniquely represents a chain, which may have multiple sitechunks. 2) sitechunk only: The sitechunk uniquely represents a chain while the chain currently does not have an entity in KG. 3) prominent_entity_id + sitechunk: The chain could be represented by the entity, but not merged at last, and the sitechunks represents the chain better. 4) prominent_entity_id + category: There are multiple subchains for the prominent entity, and category is used to differentiate subchains. NOTE: the size and complexity of the ChainId proto has implications in the serving system and should be thoughtfully kept under control.
