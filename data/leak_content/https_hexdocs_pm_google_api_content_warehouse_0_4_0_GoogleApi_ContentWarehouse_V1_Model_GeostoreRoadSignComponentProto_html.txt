View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRoadSignComponentProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Below is some horrible ASCII art and a description of the components of a road sign. +-------------------+ | A11 E50 Paris | | Chartres | +-------------------+ This sign would be composed of four components (all of them text components, the only option we support for now). The three in the first row would all have a "major_position" of zero. Their "minor_position" values would be zero for "A11", one for "E50", and two for "Paris". The component in the second row would have "major_position" value of one. This message provides the details of a single component of a road sign. A component defines its position within a sign, its type, and its content.
Attributes
-
featureId
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t
, default:nil
) - The id of the feature referred to by this component, typically the route or locality feature this sign points towards. In the ASCII art example above, this field would contain the id for the routes A11 and E50 and the localities Chartres and Paris in the corresponding component. -
featureType
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The type of the feature referred to by this component. If feature_id is specified type of that feature should be the same as this field. -
majorPosition
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - This is the "major" position of this component within the set of components that make up a sign. This number can be thought of as the "row" of the sign on which the component appears, but no guarantees are made that there is a one-to-one mapping between "major_position" and the rows of information on the actual sign being modeled. A "major_position" value of zero would indicate that the component is near the top of the sign. -
minorPosition
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - This is the position of a component within the components of a sign that share a common "major_position". It can be though of as the "column" of the component, but like "major_position", no guarantees are made regarding its mapping to reality. For data sources that don't provide enough information to determine a component's major and minor positions, major position should be populated and minor position should not be present. A "minor_position" value of zero would indicate that the component is near the "beginning" of the sign. In countries where signs are read from left to right, "minor_position" zero would be near the left side of the sign. -
routeDirection
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The direction of traffic for the referenced TYPE_ROUTE feature. -
semanticType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The semantic type of sign. -
text
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreNameProto.t
, default:nil
) - If this sign component is of type "TYPE_TEXT", this field contains the text of the component. A NameProto is used to allow language and flags to be associated with the text.
