Attributes
-
alphaEntityIdf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - This field is only for debugging and link weight experiments. It stores the entity's idf from the alpha model. Alpha idfs are used for link weight computations and available during model omega building via enricher_current_entity_idf_for_link_direction. -
commonNgramProb
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Probability that the entity is a common ngram (e.g. from dictionary). entityIdf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The final (model omega) idf of an entity. Equals log2(1 / probability of the entity to appear in a document). This probability is currently estimated from its names (i.e. it is a sum of the name frequency weighted by P(entity | name)).-
nameCapitalizationProb
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The following field is deprecated and should eventually be removed. It uses data and rules that have not been refreshed for ~10y and KG has changed a lot in the meantime.
