View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamNearestNeighborsNeighbor (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Attributes
-
crowdingAttribute
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If crowding is enabled, the crowding attribute of this neighbor will be stored here. -
distance
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - This could be exact or approximate distance. -
docid
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Neighbor data point. This field is set based on the data_id_str field in the GFV of the data point in the database (or SSTable key if data_id_str is not present), and thus can be arbitrary data, e.g. docid, URL, query string. -
gfv
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.ResearchScamGenericFeatureVector.t
, default:nil
) - The field isn't populated by default, but when enabled (eg, in the ground-truth pipeline), this field provides the original database GFV corresponding to this result. -
metadata
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Metadata about the neighbor. This is returned under some configurations as a serialized proto. The specific proto depends on which metadata is configured to be returned.
