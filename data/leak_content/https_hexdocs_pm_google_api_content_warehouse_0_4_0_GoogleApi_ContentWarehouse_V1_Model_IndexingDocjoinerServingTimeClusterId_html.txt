View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingDocjoinerServingTimeClusterId (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The serving cluster id metadata. Why we cluster the documents. The default value is UNKNOWN. Serving-Side Clustering is used for pages which represent the same content but are not identical (e.g. translated pages, or paginated content). Those documents are not dup-clustered in Alexandria so that all documents (and their tokens) are available to search queries. However, those documents are assigned the same Serving-Time-Cluster-ID (on the same reasontype), which during serving guarantees that only one of them is shown to the user.
Attributes
-
clusterId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The unique id to distinguish members in cluster. It could be generated in different ways according to reason, e.g. LINK_REL_NEXT_PREVIOUS: it is the fingerprint of the URL of index 0; PAGE_PARAMETER_INFO: it is the fingerprint of pagination pattern (pagination_pattern_fp field in PageParamInfo message). -
indexForDebugging
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The member index of this document in cluster. Starts from "0". Note that indices of pages in a cluster may not be consistent with each other, because we may update them at different points in time. Currently only used for debugging. -
reason
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The reason why this document is clustered into this cluster.
