View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySalientTermsSignalTermData (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
SignalTermData is signal-specific term-level information. Stores mostly internal data as it is one of the primary data structures used in the populators.
Attributes
-
bigramDiscountTf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The deduction of bigram counts from its unigram children. This field is only available in debug mode. -
bigramness
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - How much we trust this bigram. For bigrams only. Range: [0.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
centrality
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Measures how topical this term is to a particular signal. A term like "lincoln" in the Abraham Lincoln's Wikipedia page should have a centrality close to 1.0 while non-central terms like "florida" should have a centrality close to 0.0. Range: [0.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
correctedTf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The final term frequency for a particular term. This field is only available in debug mode. -
expectedTf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The term frequency we were expecting for a term given its IDF. Range: [0, observed_volume] This field is only available in debug mode. -
globalNpmi
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Global NPMI. For bigrams only. This is a measure of the quality of bigrams calculated using IDF. Range: [-1.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
idf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The IDF of the label of a particular term. For a canonical term, this is the mean IDF of its originals, weighted by their observed TF. This field is only available in debug mode. -
isBigram
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether or not this term is a bigram. This field is only available in debug mode. -
label
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Raw string that identifies a particular term. This field is only available in debug mode. -
localNpmi
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Local NPMI (normalized pointwise mutual information). For bigrams only. This is a measure of the quality of bigrams calculated using observed TF. Range: [-1.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
observedTf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The observed term frequency in a particular signal. This field is only available in debug mode. -
originalTerm
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySalientTermsSignalTermData.t)
, default:nil
) - The list of the original terms for a canonical. This is used in the pipeline and it is not present in the final output. This field is only available in debug mode. -
rawTf
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The raw term frequency in a particular signal. This field is only available in debug mode. -
salience
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The measure of how important this term is in this signal. Range: [0.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
source
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - source is the type of the signal of this SignalTermData.
