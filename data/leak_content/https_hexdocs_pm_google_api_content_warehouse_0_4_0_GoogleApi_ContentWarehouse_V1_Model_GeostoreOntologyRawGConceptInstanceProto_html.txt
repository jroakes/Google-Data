View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreOntologyRawGConceptInstanceProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A RawGConceptInstanceProto contains all data required by both internal and external clients. We store the 'public' data in a GConceptInstanceProto and the 'private' data inside of RawGConceptInstanceProto. NOTE: this doesn't really match the design we want anymore. Please talk to the Geo Schema team if you are planning to make use of the "private" fields below.
Attributes
-
instance
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreGConceptInstanceProto.t
, default:nil
) - This is the 'public' section of the GConceptInstance. -
isAddedByEdit
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - DEPRECATED Was this GConcept explicitly added by an edit? Examples of gconcepts not added by edits include those inferred through geo ontology and those mapped from legacy category forms by the feature updater. Note that it is possible for both is_added_by_edit and is_inferred to be true - it means this gconcept is added by an edit and there is also another more fine-grained gconcept added by an edit. -
isInferred
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - RESERVED -
provider
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - DEPRECATED These two fields combined describe the source of a GConceptInstance. They are based on geostore/base/proto/datasourceprovider.proto. Their use has been deprecated. Use the FieldMetadataProto inside instance instead. -
sourceDataset
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) -
