This field is going away soon. For a replacement you should probably use the following RPC: cs/symbol:Ytpedia.GetNames please read go/ytks-calling details on how to call it and don't hesitate to write to us for help with this (or in any case before starting to send real traffic to us) at: g/yt-knowledge-service -

, default:nil
) - The ID of the Knowledge Graph entity. Note: this is the primary ID at generation time. See https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/knowledge-graph/data/primary_ids
