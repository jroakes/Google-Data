View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AssistantApiTimestamp (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An absolute point in time independent of timezone or calendar, based on the proto3 Timestamp (//google/protobuf/timestamp.proto). NOTE: THIS IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED TO BE USED. It was originally defined separately from google.protobuf.Timestamp due to incompatibility with proto2 syntax. The incompatibility issues have since been resolved and so the Google-wide standard representation of google.protobuf.Timestamp should be preferred. In fact, google.protobuf.* protos in general are now recommended to be used in new APIs.
