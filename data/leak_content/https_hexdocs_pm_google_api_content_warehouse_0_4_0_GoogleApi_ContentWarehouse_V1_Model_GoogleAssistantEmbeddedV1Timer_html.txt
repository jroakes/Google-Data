Conceptually, timers are clocks that count down from an initial duration and ring when they reach 0. In practice, as a timer is running, it holds a stable expiration time and computes the remaining duration using the current time. When a timer is paused, it holds a stable remaining duration.
Attributes
-
expireTime
(type:DateTime.t

originalDuration
(type:String.t
