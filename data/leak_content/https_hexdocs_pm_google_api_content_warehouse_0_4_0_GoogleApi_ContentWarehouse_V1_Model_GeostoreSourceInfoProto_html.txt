View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreSourceInfoProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Source infos are the canonical way to establish data provenance. They can currently be set on features, edits, and issues. Every feature has a repeated list of SourceInfoProto messages to describe the source data that was used in building this feature. The data includes a feature id that points to additional data about the data source (version, copyright notice, etc), and optional "raw data" that is taken directly from the provider's format and has not been converted to a canonical form.
Attributes
-
attributionUrl
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUrlProto.t)
, default:nil
) - This is the URL of a page representing all the data from this source in this feature. It may have be the ultimate source of the data (in case of scraping) or merely the same data styled according the provider's taste. There is a similar field in DataSourceProto which is NOT cached in this field, since it has a different meaning. -
collectionDate
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDateTimeProto.t
, default:nil
) - The time that this particular piece of data was collected. If different attributes were collected on different dates, this is the date of the most recent edit. -
cookie
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A source info may have a magic cookie whose content and semantics are defined by the specific import process or third-party feed. For feeds that are processed by Distillery, the cookie, when set, should contain the unique identifier for the feature as provided by the feed. -
dataset
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The dataset from which this SourceInfoProto was created. The content of this string will be determined by the data provider (e.g. for MultiNet data, "fra" would indicate the dataset for France). This field is unnecessary for providers that deliver a single dataset per release (e.g. Basarsoft). -
gaiaId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The Gaia ID of the user who provided us with this data. This field should never be set on source infos present on features, but may be set on source infos present on edits. DEPRECATED: Most clients should use the "user" field instead where Gaia IDs are encrypted. -
impersonationUser
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUserProto.t
, default:nil
) - Information about an internal user or system that is operating on behalf ofuser
by way of impersonation. -
layer
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The name of the layer from which this SourceInfoProto was created. -
ogrFid
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The OGR feature identifier from which this SourceInfoProto was created. This is an internal OGR record identifier and has nothing to do with any of the feature's fields or the FeatureIdProto for the FeatureProto containing this SourceInfoProto. This field is present only for debugging purposes and possible use in the match pattern of a FeatureChangeProto designed to fix bad source data very early in the importing process. -
provider
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The data provider from which this source info was generated. The value must be equal to the one on the TYPE_DATA_SOURCE feature referenced by this source info via the source_id reference (see above). -
rawData
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRawDataProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A source info may optionally have a set of key-value pairs that provide "raw data" specific to that source. The types of raw data available will vary from one provider to another and should not be used in production code. Instead, new fields and/or protocol buffers should be defined to represent this information in a canonical form, and the relevant importers should be modified to populate these new fields. -
release
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The data release from which this SourceInfoProto was created. The format for this string is provider-dependent (e.g. a MultiNet release would look like "2008.01"). -
sourceId
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t
, default:nil
) - A source info may have a corresponding TYPE_DATA_SOURCE feature that describes it (provider, copyright information, date of release, etc). In the context of edits and issues, this field should not be set. -
temporaryData
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.Proto2BridgeMessageSet.t
, default:nil
) - A place for clients to attach arbitrary data to a source info. Never set in MapFacts. -
user
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUserProto.t
, default:nil
) - RESERVED
