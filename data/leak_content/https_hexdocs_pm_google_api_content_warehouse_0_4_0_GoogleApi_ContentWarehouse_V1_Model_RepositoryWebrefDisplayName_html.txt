View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefDisplayName (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Per language display name from reliable sources (e.g. Freebase, Wikipedia). The name can be ambiguous (e.g. "Springfield" rather than "Springfield, Idaho"), and is thus to be used in a context which provides sufficient disambiguation. See: http://go/entity-names WARNING: This data is DEPRECATED and any user-visible entity names need to be fetched from TopicServer. Note that any display names included in this proto are merely a pass-through from KG and have no freshness guarantees.
Attributes
-
canonicalName
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - An encylopedia style topic name (e.g. "Dog", not "Dogs"). Corresponds to Freebase /type/object/name and similar sources. -
language
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The language of this name. See http://goto/iii for all the details on the language identifiers. -
subjectName
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A name as it would be used for a news topic, an interest, the subject of a story. E.g. in list of things ("Related topics: Smartphones, computers, accidents". "Interests: Dogs"). Fall back: If the field is not populated, fall back to the "canonical_name" field. This field is usually not populated since (a) in most cases the subject form name is the same as the canonical name, and (b) data coverage of subject-form names is currently much lower than data coverage of canonical names. Note: In some languages (e.g. French) the difference between canonical names and subject names is larger than in English (not just plural vs. singular), but still strictly grammatical (including an article, capitalization, plural vs. singular). Corresponds to Freebase /freebase/linguistic_hint/subject_form.
