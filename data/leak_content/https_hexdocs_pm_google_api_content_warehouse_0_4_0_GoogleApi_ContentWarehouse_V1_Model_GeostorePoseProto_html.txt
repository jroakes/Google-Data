View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostorePoseProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A pose is an object's position in space, as well as its orientation. All fields except lat and lng are optional. All fields are in the WGS-84 ellipsoid, and rotations are right-hand rule (i.e. if the right hand thumb points along a vector, curled fingers indicate positive rotation direction). An un-rotated pose would be pointing due North, along the surface of the ellipsoid. Rotations are applied in the order: yaw, pitch, roll. Note that the rotation axes are rotated along with the model for each rotation step. WARNING: This proto is not meant to be used directly. Please use the provided libraries: //geostore/base/public/pose.h //java/com/google/geostore/base/Pose.java
Attributes
-
altitude
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The height of the pose. A positive height is above the WGS-84 ellipsoid in meters; negative is below. -
index
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The index of the PoseProto in a list of PoseProtos. -
lat
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The latitude of the pose in degrees [-90, 90]. -
lng
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The longitude of the pose in degrees (-180,180]. -
pitch
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The rotation around the longitude line East tangent in degrees [-90, 90]. -
roll
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The rotation around the latitude line North tangent in degrees (-180, 180]. -
yaw
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The rotation around the Up vector, from North, in degrees (-180, 180].
