View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaQuantification (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The quantification of device(s) in the query. For example, "three speakers", "all TVs", etc. Usually, we should have either lexical field or number field. However, there are some special words which we will set both fields. For example, "all 3" will have the semantic: {lexical=ALL, number=3}. Note that "both" is simply modeled as {lexical=ALL}.
