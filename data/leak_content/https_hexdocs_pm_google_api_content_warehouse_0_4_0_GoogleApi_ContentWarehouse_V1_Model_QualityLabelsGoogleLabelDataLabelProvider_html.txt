View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityLabelsGoogleLabelDataLabelProvider (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)

Attributes
-
feed
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - This field is intended to be deprecated. If id == 0 and feed is true it means this label is from a feed. If id == 0 and feed is false, this label is from "Google" If id != 0, feed is meaningless. -
id
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - We are currently using this field to indicate an id of the set of classifiers that produced this label. This deviates from the original intention. Also see ClassifierDescription and refer to http://go/genre-labels-provider-id for further info. -
labelBucket
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - A byte-size value representing 64 * (1 + global_label_value). Use it instead of global_label_value to save on label storage. -
labelValue
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - -
name
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - This name will only sometimes be filled in! Frontends can in general expect this to be filled in, but it will not usually be stored in backends.
