View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityNsrExperimentalNsrTeamWSJData (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This is a wrapper needed for the WSJ corpus. We want the WSJ RPCs to inject both the experimental_data and the keys, and as of June 2022 these need to be first level members of the proto.
Attributes
-
experimentalNsrTeamData
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityNsrExperimentalNsrTeamData.t
, default:nil
) - -
lookupKey
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The key used to lookup this data in the WSJ corpus. The WSJ data is sitechunk-level, however the documents in the MDU shards are simply urls. WSJ does a mapping from url -> {primary_chunk, secondary, fallbacks, etc.} and retrieves all the keys from the corpus. This lookup key field will keep track of which key was used for this particular lookup.
