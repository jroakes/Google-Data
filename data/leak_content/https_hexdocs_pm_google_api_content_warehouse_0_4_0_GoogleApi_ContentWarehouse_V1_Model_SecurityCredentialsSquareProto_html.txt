View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsSquareProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Represents the set of members (of a given type) in a Google+ Square (see http://go/squares). A Square with default member_type is currently (1/2012) identical to the GaiaGroup with the same ID, but that is expected to change soon (see http://go/superglue). Support for this principal type is currently (1/2012) incomplete -- e.g., Keystore does not support it yet (see b/5703421).
Attributes
-

See square.pb (defined in production/config/cdd/socialgraph/mixer_config/prod/node_type_config) for all valid edge types associated with square. Currently required. -
squareId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
