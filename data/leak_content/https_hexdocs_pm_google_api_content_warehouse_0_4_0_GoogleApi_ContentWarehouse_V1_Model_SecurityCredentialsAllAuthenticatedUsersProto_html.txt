View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsAllAuthenticatedUsersProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Represents a principal who has authenticated as any kind of user which the application understands. This is typically used for "wiki-like" security, where anyone is allowed access so long as they can be held accountable for that access. Since the purpose is knowing whom to blame, it is up to the application to decide what kinds of users it knows how to blame. For example, an application might choose to include GAIA users in "all authenticated users", but not include MDB users. Nothing here.
