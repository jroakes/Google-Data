View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsSimpleSecretHolderProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Represents a principal which possesses a particular, presumably secret, string. Useful for things like "auth keys," used for anonymous sharing. Since representing this principal with the actual secret included reveals the secret, it's best if the requisite condition is enforced in some other way, for example via Keystore wrapping attributes (Keystore will unwrap only if the specified secret, aka "attribute", is presented). All that's stored here is an identifying label.
Attributes
-
label
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsSimpleSecretLabelProto.t
, default:nil
) - A descriptive label to help identify a relevant ACL entry or otherwise disambiguate this instance.
