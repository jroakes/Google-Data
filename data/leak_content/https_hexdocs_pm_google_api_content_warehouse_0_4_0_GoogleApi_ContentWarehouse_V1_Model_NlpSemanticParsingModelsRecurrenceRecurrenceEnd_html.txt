View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsRecurrenceRecurrenceEnd (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The end of the recurrence can be represented in one of three ways. 1. An abstract DateTime. (inclusive) 2. An absolute timestamp, in milliseconds from UTC epoch. 3. A number of occurrences. Exactly one of the fields [end_date_time, end_millis, num_occurrences] in this message must be set. Repeating tasks for which the user did not specify an end date are automatically given a reasonable end conditions by the system and auto_renew will be set to true. Similarly, if the user- provided end date is too far in the future to reasonably create all instances, the server will set an auto_renew_until end condition.
Attributes
-
autoRenew
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Should be used in cases where the size of the recurrence is infinite (no end date specified), in which case we rely on an offline process to extend. Set by server only, setting it on a new recurrence will throw an exception. -
autoRenewUntil
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingDateTimeAnnotation.t
, default:nil
) - Used in cases where the recurrence is too large to create in a single transaction. In this case we create a manageable number of instances initially and rely on an offline process to continually extend the recurrence until this date. Set by server only, setting it on a new recurrence will throw an exception. -
endDateTime
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingDateTimeAnnotation.t
, default:nil
) - -
endMillis
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Deprecated - prefer end_date_time.absolute_time_ms. -
numOccurrences
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Note that auto-renewing is not supported in conjunction with num_occurrences. Therefore we impose a hard limit of 1000 when using this field.
