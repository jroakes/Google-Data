View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureHistoryMetadataProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Metadata related to the history of a given feature in the Geo repository.
Attributes
-
featureBirthTimestampUs
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The timestamp (in microseconds since the UNIX epoch) when this feature first went live in the Geo repository. Note that this has no relation to the birth data of that geographical entity in the real world. -
lastModificationTimestampUs
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The timestamp (in microseconds since the UNIX epoch) of the last modification to the feature. Note this includes attachment modifications. The feature's initial creation is also considered as a modification. This is useful for those that consume features via both listening to notifications and reading from repository snapshots. This timestamp can be used to decide whether a feature in the snapshot was already seen in a more recent state through the notifications. -
removalTimestampUs
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The timestamp (in microseconds since the UNIX epoch) of the deletion time of the feature. If the feature is currently removed, this field gets populated with the timestamp the feature first became removed after being live (or being removed from beginning). This field won't be set if the feature is live.
