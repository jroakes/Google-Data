View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.MapsQualitySpecialWordsProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The goal of the special words are to: - Canonicalize the user query by rewriting abbreviations into the canonical version that is indexed. - Figure out at index time for each element which tokens are important. We use this to decide if an address component is matched or not. For instance in "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW" since "NW" is recognised as a directional (and "Ave" is recognised as a street visible type), "Pennsylvania" becomes the name and you can't match this street by just specifying "avenue" or "NW".

(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - Alternate versions of this canonical form. This is mainly abbreviations of the canonical form e.g. "St", "NE", etc. This should be present as it is used in the specified language with the correct capitalization, accents, etc. in UTF-8. -
canonical
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - Canonical versions: the version which is in oyster. This should be present as it is used in the specified language with the correct capitalization, accents, etc. in UTF-8. The canonical can be a single or a multi-token string. There can be several canonicals, e.g. "center" and "centre" in English. -
