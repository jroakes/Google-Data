View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingPersonalReferenceAnnotation (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A collection of any number of QRefAnnotations that designate a Copley Personal Reference and its Resolutions. This is used to handle personalized intents such as "navigate to my hotel" or "when is my mom's anniversary". See go/copley. This Annotation may contain only a reference with no resolutions for the failure case (go/copley-punts). TODO(bhorst) Rename this to remove the Copley codename.
