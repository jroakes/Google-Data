Attributes
-
latest
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Is this the latest issue of this catalog series? This is required to filter results if the latest restrict is on. -
publicationDate
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - time_t date corresponding to the catalog publication date. Approximate when the catalog does not have an exact "date" of publication, e.g. For "Spring 2002", year, month and day are 2002, 03 and 21, respectivley. This value is used to compare catalog issues to determine the latest. The value is stored in seconds-since-epoch, 1/1/1970. This is not a problem for catalogs because we are not dealing with any catalogs from before the 70's. -
