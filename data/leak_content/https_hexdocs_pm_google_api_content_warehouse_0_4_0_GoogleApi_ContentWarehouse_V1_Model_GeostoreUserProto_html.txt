View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUserProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
UserProto identifies a (human) user of Geo Data. Its primary use is in describing the source of pieces of data (e.g. edits). It could be a simple identifier, but isn't so that we can store it in the clear while still preventing correlation between a user's contribution.
Attributes
-
encryptedGaiaId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The user Gaia ID in encrypted form. Wipeout ids take value of "" in bytes. -
encryptionKeyName
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Required. The name of the key used to encrypt the Gaia ID. -
keystoreConfigId
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Required (valid default provided). The config ID of the owner of the above encryption_key_name. This field must be set if the encryption key name is not "mapfacts_gaia_id_encryption_key". -
username
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If possible, writers should set this to a full user email, including the domain. Readers should not assume that this is a well-formed email address. This field may only be set by Atlas, Pushpin and OneRing because they are internal tools which have a PWG exception to store textual usernames in the clear.
