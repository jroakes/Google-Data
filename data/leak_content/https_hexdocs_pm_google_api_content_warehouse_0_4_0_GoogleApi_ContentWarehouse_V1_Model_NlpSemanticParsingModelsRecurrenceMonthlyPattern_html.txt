View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsRecurrenceMonthlyPattern (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Pattern for a MONTHLY recurrence. A MONTHLY recurrence may be specified in four different ways. These fields should be set in a mutually exclusive way, i.e.: ((month_day OR last_day) XOR (week_day AND (week_day_number OR last_week))) 1. Absolute days of the month (i.e. the 1st and 15th) or relative day from the end of the month (i.e. -1 for last day, -2 for second-to-last day). Set month_day. 2. [Deprecated] Relative last day of the month. Represented as a boolean since the last absolute day number is dependent on the month. This is just a short-cut for month_day=-1 and is deprecated. Set last_day=true. 3. The nth (or nth-last) specific weekday of the month. For example, the 3rd Wednesday of the month. This represents the 3rd instance of a Wednesday of the month, regardless of what weekday the month started on. It does not necessarily mean the Wednesday on the 3rd week of the month. 4. [Deprecated] The last specific weekday of the month. For example, the last Thursday of the month. This is a short-cut for week_day_number=-1.
Attributes
-
lastDay
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Special flag to indicate the last day of the month, equivalent to setting month_day to -1. Deprecated, use month_day=-1 instead. -
lastWeek
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Special flag to indicate a week_day in the last week of the month, as this cannot be captured by week_day_number. Deprecated, use week_day_number=-1 instead. -
monthDay
(type:list(integer())
, default:nil
) - Absolute day of the month (if positive) or relative day from the end of the month (if negative). Example: 2nd and 20th of the month [2, 20]. Example: Last day of the month [-1]. Positive values should correspond to actual calendar day number (indexing starts at 1). -
weekDay
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - For capturing the nth weekday of the month. Use together with week_day_number or last_week to specify n. -
weekDayNumber
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The nth occurrence of week_day to match. I.e. For 3rd Wednesday of the month, week_day = WEDNESDAY and week_day_number = 3. Values beyond the end of the month are skipped. If negative, this is interpreted as the nth-to-last occurrence of the week day in the month. I.e. for last Thursday of the month, week_day = THURSDAY and week_day_number = -1.
