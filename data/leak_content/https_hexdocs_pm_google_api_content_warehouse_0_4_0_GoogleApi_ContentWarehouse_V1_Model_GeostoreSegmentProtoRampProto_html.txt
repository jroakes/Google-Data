View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreSegmentProtoRampProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Encapsulates ramp-specific properties.
Attributes
-
maxConnectedPriority
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The highest priority of any TYPE_ROAD endpoint segment which is transitively connected to this ramp via other ramp segments. For instance, if we have two roads connected through a series of ramps (omitting intersections): Road(P=96)-> Ramp 1 -> Ramp 2 -> Ramp 3 -> Road(P=122) -> Road(P=144) Themax_connected_priority
of all three intermediary ramps is 122. It's not 144, since Road(P=144) is connected through another road, not a ramp. This differs from the usualSegmentProto.priority
field, which contains the lowest priority across any connected road segment.
