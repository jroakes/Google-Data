View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialStanzaDeliveryRestriction (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Restrictions that affect the delivery of the stanza. By default, Stanzas are publishable, which means that they are eligible for indexing, aggregation, and other delivery options (Goops, Moonshine, notifications). A stanza can be created in a "do not publish" state; the stanza will not be published anywhere. The restriction can subsequently be removed with an UpdateStanza call, at which point the post will be treated as if it were newly created. A few notes/limitations about this option: 1. Client should keep a stanza unpublishable for a small period of time (if possible to) so that our ranking system does not consider this as a stale post (thus downranking the post). 2. Client should keep the number of unpublishable stanzas to a minimum, to reduce under-serving. 3. Updating a stanza from publishable to unpublishable after creation is not supported 4. At this time, publishing options are only supported on root stanzas; let us know if you require this for child stanzas. 5. Similarly, this is only supported as a global restriction. It may not be set as a per-destination-stream restriction.
