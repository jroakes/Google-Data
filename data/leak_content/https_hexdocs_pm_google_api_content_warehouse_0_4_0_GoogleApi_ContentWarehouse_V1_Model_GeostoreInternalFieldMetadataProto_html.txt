Attributes
-
isAuto
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether or not the piece of data has been generated automatically (i.e., by a bot/automated process based on heuristics/algorithms rather than coming as a fact set by some human user or data provider based on their knowledge). Note that this does NOT imply that the value was set as a result of a bot operation on the repository, since it is conceivable to use a bot/automated process simply as a way of convenience to ingest large amount of canonical/ground truth data. -
sourceSummary
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreInternalSourceSummaryProto.t
, default:nil
) - Information about the source providing the piece of data this metadata is attached to.
