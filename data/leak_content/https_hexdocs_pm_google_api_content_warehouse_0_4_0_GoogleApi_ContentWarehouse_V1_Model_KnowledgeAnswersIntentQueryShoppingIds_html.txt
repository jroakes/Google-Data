View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryShoppingIds (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Additional shopping identifiers related to an entity or IQL function call. This must be passed along to the shopping backend (go/o4) to aid in fulfillment. Because the shopping data models do not always line up 1-1 with KG entities and are not always reconciled with each other, the message may contain multiple ids. Next id: 8 LINT.IfChange
Attributes
-
aspectClusterIds
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - A shopping aspect cluster id. These are attributes mined from mentions in web articles. -
brandEntityId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Brand entity id. Brands are fully reconciled with KG entities so there should never be ambiguity as to which brand applies (those would be separate MIDs). -
bxCategoryIds
(type:list(integer())
, default:nil
) - A category in the shopping browseonomy, a taxonomy of product types that can be found at go/bx. This field is expected to contain the deepest node in the browseonomy that the intent or argument pertains to, which may be an internal node. It does not contain the entire path of categories. -
measures
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryShoppingIdsMeasureValue.t)
, default:nil
) - -
merchantIds
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - List of merchant customer account IDs associated with a merchant entity in KG. NOTE: Soon to be deprecated, see go/merchant_mids_in_indexer design -
merchantSourceIds
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - A shopping merchant source id, i.e. the key used to identify Shopping Merchants as they are imported into KG. For reference, these IDs are populated in: CommerceDB under BusinessIdentification.knowledge_graph.source_id KG using the /shopping/merchant/id predicate -
tagIds
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - Moka attributes of a product. This includes color tags but currently not brand. We allow the possibility for multiple tag ids, as multiple Moka tag ids may map to the same mid, and we may not be able to find a single matching Moka tag. Also, cross-category Moka colors intentionally map a single color mentioned in the query to an expansion of many tags representing points in LAB color space (although this representation is expected to change).
