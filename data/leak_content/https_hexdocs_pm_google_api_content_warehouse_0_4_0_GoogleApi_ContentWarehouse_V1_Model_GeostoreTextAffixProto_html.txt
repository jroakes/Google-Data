Attributes
-
language
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The external form of a Google International Identifiers Initiative (III) LanguageCode object. See google3/i18n/identifiers/languagecode.h for details. These strings should be treated as opaque blobs. You can use LanguageCodeConverter::FromOther to convert the string to a LanguageCode reference. You can then call methods on the LanguageCode class to extract language/script/region subtags (if any). See also http://g3doc/i18n/identifiers/g3doc/using-iii. We place extra restrictions on languages in addition to what the III library requires. See http://go/geo-schema-reference/feature-properties/languages.md -
prefix

, default:nil
) - Text to prepend to the primary text, including any necessary trailing whitespace. At least one of prefix or suffix is required. -
