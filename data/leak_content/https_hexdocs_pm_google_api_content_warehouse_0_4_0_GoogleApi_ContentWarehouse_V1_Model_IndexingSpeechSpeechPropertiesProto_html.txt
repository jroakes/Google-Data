View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingSpeechSpeechPropertiesProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The information about spoken content that's based on purely the media resource contents (and not the embedding page or context, etc).
Attributes
-
audioDuration
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Duration of audio in processed fragment (including non-speech), in seconds. -
audioOnly
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If true, the media file is audio-only. If false, also has video track(s). -
estimatedAudioDuration
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Estimated duration of audio in the whole file (including non-speech), in seconds. If this is greater than 0, then it will either be equal to audio_duration (when truncated_file is false), or to the length of the content (audio or video) according to the file header (when truncated_file is true). -
estimatedAudioDurationConfidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Our confidence in the duration estimate, on a scale from 0 (not confident) to 1 (very confident). An estimate should have a confidence of at least 0.5 if it is to be shown to users. -
languageCode
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The spoken language, see i18n/identifiers/languagecode.h and go/gl2014. This may or may not match the language of the written page. (Examples: "en", "sv", "zh-CN"). -
numWords
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Total number of recognized words in processed fragment. -
recognizerAccuracy
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Measure of the estimated output accuracy from the speech recognition code, from 0 to 1. Based on word-level confidence and possibly other factors. -
speechDuration
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Duration of speech in processed fragment, in seconds. -
truncatedFile
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If true, we may have processed a truncated file (most likely due to a size-cutoff when crawling). As a result, the audio duration is a lower bound and the other fields reflect only the processed prefix of the file.
