View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeGraphTriple (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A Triple is a representation of data with a Subject, a Predicate, and an Object, For example: (Triple, IS-A, "data representation"). Triples are a very good representation of data where the relationship between data points is significant, because the Object of a Triple can be the Subject of another Triple: (Triple, HAS-A, Subject) (Subject, IS-A, "Term of a proposition") The ease with which Triples can represent relationships makes them an excellent candidate for representing graphs.

Attributes
-
isNegation
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If is_negation is set to true then this triple is considered a statement that the fact is false. This allows for the storage of both what we know to be true and what we know to be false. -
obj
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeGraphTripleObj.t
, default:nil
) - obj is the value of a relationship. -
pred
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - pred is an arbitrary node id representing the predicate (name) of a graph relationship. -
provenance
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeGraphTripleProvenance.t)
, default:nil
) - -
qualifierSets
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeGraphQualifierSet.t)
, default:nil
) - WARNING: This is currently defined for experimentation purposes only. Please do not set. Data set in this field will not be published to any systems downstream of Livegraph. Together with the SPO of this triple, each qualifier set here represents a different logical assertion/fact. -
sub
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - sub is an arbitrary node id representing the source entity of a graph relationship.
