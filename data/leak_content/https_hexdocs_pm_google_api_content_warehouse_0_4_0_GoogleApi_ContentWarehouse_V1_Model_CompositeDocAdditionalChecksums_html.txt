Additional checksums of the document.
Attributes
-
NoTransientChecksum96
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Same as ContentChecksum96 but without transient boilerplate. -
SimHash
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Deprecated. Use simhash_v2 and simhash_v2_significance instead. -
SimHashIsTrusted
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - -
simhashV2
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Simhash-v2 is generated by SimHashParseHandler, designed as a complete replacement of simhash-v1 (a.k.a. the original simhash above) from ApproxDupsParseHandler. Simhash-v2 uses a revised algorithm so that it is expected to work better in most cases than simhash-v1. They coexist in current transition period, then simhash-v1 will be retired. -
simhashV2Significance
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Simhash-v2-significance is used to describe the confidence about the corresponding simhash-v2 value. It is defined as the average absolute difference from zero of all internal state components when finalizing a simhash-v2 value in HashMultiSetDotCauchy. We used to compare the significance against some pre-defined threshold (default: 20) to get a boolean value "trusted_simhash_v2". However, it is possible that this field is missing while "simhash_v2" is present, in such case (1) Use "SimHashIsTrusted" instead if it is present, AND/OR (2) Assume "simhash_v2" is trusted if its value is non-zero.
