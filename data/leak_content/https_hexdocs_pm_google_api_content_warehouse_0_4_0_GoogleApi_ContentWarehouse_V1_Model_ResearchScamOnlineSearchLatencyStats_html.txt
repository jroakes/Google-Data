cpuTime
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - An estimate of the CPU time used for this query on the machine associated with task_id, from when the query was received to when the response was ready to send, in seconds. Caveats: 1. Does not account for CPU time spent serializing, deserializing, compressing or decompressing protos within Stubby. 2. Does not account for cleanup time after response has been sent. -
taskId
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Task number associated with response time measurements. -
wallTime
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Wall time taken on the machine associated with task_id from when the query was received to when the response was ready to send, in seconds. This time excludes the time spent sending the response and the time to perform cleanup operations after the response is sent.
