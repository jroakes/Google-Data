View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanLocaleViewability (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
How a volume may be viewed in a particular locale. Next available ID: 25 (ikkwong)
Attributes
-
accessRights
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanVolumeAccessRights.t
, default:nil
) - These capture "commercial" contract related access rights provided by partners for a volume. -
allowAddingFrontmatterToPreview
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Are we allowed to add all the front matter to the preview in addition to the preview amount that is from percent_book_shown? This means the front matter becomes freely previewable and does not count towards the previewable amount based on the percentage. -
allowContinuousBrowse
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - By default, we allow continuous browse. PFE provides a means for partners to opt out entirely or just specific books. -
allowRetailSyndication
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - whether OFE should display this volume in syndicated search results -
bibkey
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The bibkey upon which this viewability information is based. -
canDisplayAds
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether we can show ads with this book in this locale. -
canDownloadEpub
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - In future, we will generate epub iff can_download_epub = true irrespective of viewability or download pdf state. -
canDownloadPdf
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - In future, we will generate PDF iff can_download_pdf = true irrespective of viewability. -
canShowLibraryLinks
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether to show library links for the books in this imprint. -
canShowPhotos
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether we can show photos for this book in this locale. -
canUseMetadataCover
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - It should be OK to use metadata covers normally, but we allow publishers to explicitly disallow them. -
clientId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The client who provided the rights for this bibkey, and who should receive revenue derived from this book in this locale. This will only be present when we receive explicit rights from a publisher. -
computedAccessRights
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanVolumeComputedAccessRights.t
, default:nil
) - Volume related access rights that are computed by Goovols Syncher from partner and book metadata. This complements VolumeAccessRights. This message is used to capture "commerical" contracts that are computed from other sources. Any future computed rights that are not related to volume access should go into a new message. -
dates
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanLocaleViewabilityDates.t
, default:nil
) - -
displayDetails
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanVolumeDisplayDetails.t
, default:nil
) - Volume display specific attributes are kept in display_details -
metadataViewMayIncludeInfoFromScans
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - This only applies when view_type == VIEW_METADATA and controls whether we're allowed to include scanned info (keywords, toc, etc). in the metadata-view. For books in metadata view because they have been opted out, this would be false. -
metadataViewSampleAllowed
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - This only applies when view_type == VIEW_METADATA and controls whether we're allowed to include a text sample even for a metadata view book. -
percentBookShown
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - How much of the book can be viewed in this locale. Will be 100 for VIEWFULL; 0 for VIEW_SNIPPET, VIEW_NONE and VIEW_METADATA; and some value between 0 and 100 (exclusive) for VIEW_PARTIAL. -
publicDomain
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If present, this is the rights policy's determination of the public domain status. (Of course, this determination is generally conservative (i.e. false negatives are likely), though exactly how conservative may depend on parameters to the rights policy.) If absent, public domain status can be inferred from view_type and view_reason, but that isn't quite perfectly reliable: view_type should always be VIEW_FULL for public domain, but view_reason might be REASON_PUBLIC_DOMAIN (definitely public domain, obviously), some other value, or absent. In the future, new viewabilities should always have this field whenever possible. -
sourcedetails
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OceanLocaleViewabilitySourceDetails.t
, default:nil
) - -
viewReason
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The reason for the view_type. -
viewType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The viewability specified for this locale.
