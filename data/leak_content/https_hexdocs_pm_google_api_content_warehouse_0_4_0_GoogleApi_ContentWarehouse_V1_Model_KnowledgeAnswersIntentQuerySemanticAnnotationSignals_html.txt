domain
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Name of the subgrammar domain. -
features
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQuerySemanticAnnotationSignalsFeature.t)
, default:nil
) - -
score
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Numeric value associated with each subgrammar annotation. Used for in-domain ranking inside the Aqua Analyzer. This field is not guaranteed to be in any range. Furthermore, this field should never be compared for annotations with differing 'domain' value. The field is included here for making the Aqua Analyzer work with subgrammar annotations that have been generated in a different Aqua Analyzer (typically by TUIG SemanticAnnotationServlet). TL;DR: Consumers of this message are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from using this field.
