View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.OfficialPagesOfficialKey (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This proto is used as the key for official pages data. WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING PAY ATTENTION HERE! The query field contains a specially NORMALIZED query, NOT a raw one. You can get a normalized query in several ways: 1. from an squery with NormalizedQueryFromSquery 2. from a CJK-segmented and punctuation-stripped query with NormalizeText (NOTE: navboost queries are already CJK-segmented and punctuation-stripped, you can just pass them to NormalizeText) 3. from user text/query with CanonicalizeText (this will do the CJK segmenting, punctuation stripping and character normalization for you) All of these functions are in ./utils/external-utils.h
