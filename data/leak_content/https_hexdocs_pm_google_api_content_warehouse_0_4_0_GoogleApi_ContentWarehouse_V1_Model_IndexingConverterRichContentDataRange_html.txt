View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingConverterRichContentDataRange (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Stores an ordered list of ranges of content from the original, processed, and intermediate content, such that: 1. The original content can be reconstructed from the ranges of type ORIGINAL_AND_PROCESSED, ORIGINAL_ONLY, and ORIGINAL_AND_INTERMEDIATE. 2. The processed content can be reconstructed from the ranges of type ORIGINAL_AND_PROCESSED and PROCESSED_ONLY. 3. The intermediate content (if present) can be reconstructed from the ranges of type ORIGINAL_AND_INTERMEDIATE and INTERMEDIATE_ONLY.
Attributes
-
rangeType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - -
size
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Range size when uncompressed, in bytes. -
sourceType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The source of this range of content. Present iff 'type' is PROCESSED_ONLY or INTERMEDIATE_ONLY. Note: 'source_type' is not present for ORIGINAL_AND_PROCESSED, ORIGINAL_ONLY, and ORIGINAL_AND_INTERMEDIATE because for those range types the source of their content is the original crawled content. -
sourceUrl
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The source URL of this range of content. Present iff 'source_type' is present and 'source_type' is FRAME or FLASH or IFRAME. -
text
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The content of the range, compressed with 'text_compression_method'. Present iff 'type' is ORIGINAL_ONLY or ORIGINAL_AND_INTERMEDIATE or INTERMEDIATE_ONLY. Useful to reconstruct the original content or the intermediate content. Note: 'text' is not present for ORIGINAL_AND_PROCESSED and PROCESSED_ONLY because the processed content is already stored separately (in the contents column, and in CompositeDoc.doc.Content.Representation). -
textCompressionMethod
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Method used to compress the 'text' field. May be present only when the 'text' is present.
