View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.VideoAssetsVenomTransition (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
As video mutations are reconciled by Venom, we can tell if the ingredient did or did not reach certain objectives. When processing has completed, all objectives will have a corresponding transition. All transitions are reset for every mutation, but will take into account assets outside of that mutation. For example, if Asset X fails, and was part of "OBJECTIVE_PRIMARY_ASSETS_DONE", a rerun of Asset Y is destined to result in OUTCOME_FAILED, regardless of the fate of Asset Y. Some phenonema have effects on most or all Objectives. For example, a bad input file will result on OUTCOME_INFEASIBLE across the board (eventually, for now it's just GO_LIVE and DO_ALL, work in progress), and a failure to produce Format 18 will cause OUTCOME_FAILED across most Objectives.
