Attributes
-
isSet
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If true, this entity is a synthetic entity created to represent a "set" in a cluster, i.e. to represent a set of entities (its children in the cluster graph) when we cannot disambiguate among them. This is similar to a KG Collection, but this is not in KG. -
ruleInstance
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefClusterProtoRuleInstance.t
, default:nil
) - Explanation of where this cluster, and this entity, come from. All entities in a cluster have this, not just entities that have been created because of the cluster.
