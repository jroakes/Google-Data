hasAmbiguousResolutions
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - True if there are more than one possible resolutions to the RD. -
hasResolvedDeviceId
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - True if there's at least one device id that gets resolved. Note this is different from is_grounded = true: it is possible that is_grounded = false (num_grounded_args =0) but there is resolved device ids. E.g.: "turn on the blue light" Power_on(device_object = [d1, d2]:RD(category=DeviceObject(name='blue light')) where there are "blue light 1" and "blue light 2" hence two resolved device ids. But since the quantifier is single, GB can't resolve the ambiguity and would set num_grounded_args = 0 to indicate such unresolved ambiguity. -
