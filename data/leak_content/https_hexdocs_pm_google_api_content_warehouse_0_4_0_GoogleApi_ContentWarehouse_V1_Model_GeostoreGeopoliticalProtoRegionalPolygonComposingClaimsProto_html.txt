View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreGeopoliticalProtoRegionalPolygonComposingClaimsProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The polygon composition recipe for a specific region's view of this feature's geometry, based on disputed area claims asserted by this country. Note that the included / excluded claims listed for a given region's view of this feature may not match up exactly with which claims the region recognizes / does not recognize for this feature. Claims may only be included or excluded for regions that themselves are a party to the dispute, i.e. a region's view of itself will include its own claims, and a region's view of another feature will exclude its own claims. See current Geopolitical policy at go/geopolitical-policy-primer.
Attributes
-
regionCode
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Region code (or other identifier) for the region. -
regionExcludedClaims
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - TYPE_DISPUTED_AREAs claimed by this feature excluded from this region's view of the feature's geometry. (The TDAs must have polygonal geometry and be referenced in this feature's political.claim field.) The polygons of these claims will be subtracted to this feature's base polygon when this feature is viewed from the specified region. -
regionIncludedClaims
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - TYPE_DISPUTED_AREAs claimed by this feature and included in this region's view of the feature's geometry. (The TDAs must have polygonal geometry and be referenced in this feature's political.claim field.) The polygons of these claims will be added to this feature's base polygon when this feature is viewed from the specified region.
