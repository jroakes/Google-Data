View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.TrawlerEvent (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Event is for logging interesting events that happen during a url fetch. Interesting events include "fetch start", "url rejected", etc. The events are written to binary logs together with the request and reply messages. If the same event occurs multiple times consecutively, We record the time of the first three instances in EarliestTimeStamp but omit the rest. We keep track the total number of occurrences in NumOccurrences and the timestamp of the last occurrence is kept in TimeStamp field.
