View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoogleInternalAppsWaldoV1alphaOutOfOffice (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The status indicating the user is out of office.
Attributes
-
comeBackTime
(type:DateTime.t
, default:nil
) - The closest time when the user will be available after this OOO block. This might be different from the end of the OOO block in Calendar, since the OOO block might end on Friday evening, and then the user is outside working hours. -
committedUntil
(type:DateTime.t
, default:nil
) - The time when the user will either stop being committed or change commitment type (i.e. InMeeting, DoNotDisturb, Busy or OutOfOffice < Xh). Note that the goal of this field is to provide information to help users decide how to communicate with a user (see also http://shortn/_wXYXtZScgh). Note that if this OOO block is large (>=Xh), committed_until is not set. -
eventSummary
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The summary of the corresponding OOO block in Calendar. This is entered by the user, so we return it "as is" - no i18n.
