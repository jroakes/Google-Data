This describes the alarm sound resource enum and the alarm sound label for the on device alarm sound. On-device ringtones are product specific, hence Opal/UI layer will be responsible for populating this metadata at creation/edit. The enum map will be used to convert to an internal resource id used by libassistant for accessing the asset which are not exposed to UI.
