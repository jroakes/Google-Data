View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreVehicleAttributeFilterProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A set of vehicle attribute conditionals (ex: weight >= 20T && num_trailers = 2) used to define a slice of all possible vehicles. This can be useful for filtering one or more vehicles by a predicate.
Attributes
-
axleCount
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreCountComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "count < 4" AND "count >= 2" means "2 <= count < 4"). -
hasTrailer
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether the applied vehicle types have a trailer attached to them. -
hazardousGoods
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - List of prohibited hazardous goods for a vehicle to carry. A repeated value here is treated as an OR operation, meaning that they may not carry ANY of the goods listed. -
numTrailers
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreCountComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "count <= 4" AND "count > 2" means "2 < count <= 4"). -
trailerLength
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDimensionComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "length <= 53ft" AND "length > 48ft" means "48ft < length <= 53ft"). -
vehicleHeight
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDimensionComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "height > 3m" AND "height <= 5m" means "3m < height <= 5m"). -
vehicleLength
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDimensionComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "length <= 40m" AND "length > 35m" means "35m < length <= 40m"). -
vehicleWeight
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreWeightComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "weight < 8T" AND "weight >= 3T" means "3T <= weight < 8T"). -
vehicleWidth
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreDimensionComparisonProto.t)
, default:nil
) - A repeated value here is treated as an AND operation. This allows for ranges to be represented by two values (ex: "width < 4m" AND "width >= 2m" means "2m <= width < 4m").
