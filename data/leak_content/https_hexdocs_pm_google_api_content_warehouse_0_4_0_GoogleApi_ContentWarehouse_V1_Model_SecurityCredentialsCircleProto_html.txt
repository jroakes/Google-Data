View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SecurityCredentialsCircleProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Represents a Google+ Circle. Currently (12/2011), a Circle is identical to the ContactGroup with matching parameters, but Circle must only be used for true Circles and not other Focus groups, and should be preferred over ContactGroup where applicable. Soon it may become more efficient to check membership in a Circle than in a ContactGroup (see http://go/superglue). Support for this principal type is currently (12/2011) incomplete -- e.g., Keystore does not support it yet (see b/5703421).
Attributes
-
circleId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Circle ID is unique only relative to the owner's Gaia ID. Currently required. -
ownerGaiaId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The owner of the circle. Currently required. -
requiredConsistencyTimestampUsec
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If present, then tests for membership in this circle must use data known to be at least as fresh as the given (FBS-assigned) timestamp. See http://go/fbs-consistent-read-after-important-write Before using this, be sure that any service checking authorization against this circle supports checking consistency timestamps. For example, as of 12/2011, Keystore only supports this for the Moonshine configuration, and in others authorization checks will fail if the timestamp is present.
