View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityNavboostCrapsCrapsClickSignals (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Click / impression signals for craps. The tag numbers are the same as they were in the original CrapsData (below). This is deliberate.
Attributes
-
absoluteImpressions
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Thus far this field is only used for host level unsquashed impressions. When compressed (e.g., in perdocdata.proto, CompressedQualitySignals), this value is represented individually and thus is generally incompatible with the other values which are compressed as click-ratios. -
badClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
clicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
goodClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
impressions
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
lastLongestClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
unicornClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - The subset of clicks that are associated with an event from a Unicorn user. -
unsquashedClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - This is not being populated for the current format - instead two instances of CrapsClickSignals (squashed/unsquashed) are used. We are migrating to the new format where this field will be populated. -
unsquashedImpressions
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - This is not being populated for the current format - instead two instances of CrapsClickSignals (squashed/unsquashed) are used. We are migrating to the new format where this field will be populated. -
unsquashedLastLongestClicks
(type:float()
, default:nil
) -
