View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.TrawlerFetchStatus (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Attributes
-
Reason
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The Reason field gives further clarifying details about why or how the fetch had the given outcome. For instance, if State is URL_ERROR - was it a 404/NotFound or a DNS error? The Reason field is present iff State != URL_CRAWLED. For a given crawl status of URL_FOO, the Reason value will be one of the various FetchFooReason enum values from crawler/trawler/trawler_enums.proto -
State
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The State field describes the basic outcome of a fetch (URL_CRAWLED, URL_ROBOTED, URL_ERROR, etc). The value is one of the UrlStatusType enum values from crawler/trawler/trawler_enums.proto Note, there are several combinations of this Status/Reason tuple that could mean that your content is crawled or can be bucketed in a particular type of error. So instead of comparing the enumeration values manually, we suggest to use the predicate functions such as IsContentCrawled() provided in crawler/trawler/public/basictypes.h (see details there).
