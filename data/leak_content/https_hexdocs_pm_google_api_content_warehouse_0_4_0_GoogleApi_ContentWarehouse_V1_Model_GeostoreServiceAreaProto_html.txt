Attributes

servedFeature
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - The features that make up the service area for this establishment. These features are subject to the following constraints applied by editing middleware (notably, not strictly enforced by lints in storage): 1. The following feature types (and their subtypes) may be used: + TYPE_ISLAND + TYPE_POLITICAL, except the following prohibited subtypes: - TYPE_CONSTITUENCY - TYPE_LAND_PARCEL + TYPE_POSTAL 2. There is a maximum limit (currently 20) to the number of areas which may be provided. This is due to serving efficiency limitations. 3. There are no additional geometry requirements for these features beyond the requirements based on the feature types above. In practice this means that these features will either have polygonal or point-based geometries. 4. These referenced features are generally required to have names, though this is not strictly enforced.
