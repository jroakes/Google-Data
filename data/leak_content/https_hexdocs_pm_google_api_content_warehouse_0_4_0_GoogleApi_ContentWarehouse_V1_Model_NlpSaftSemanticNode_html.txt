View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSaftSemanticNode (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Semantic node for annotating semantic constructions in documents. A set of SemanticNode instances represents a directed acyclic graph with an adjacency list representation. Each node can optionally be connected to some existing type system, such as PropBank. Each node can optionally be connected to one or more concrete elements in a SAFT document, specifically, an entity mention, a measure and/or a token span (Phrase). Next available id: 23
Attributes
-
arc
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSaftSemanticNodeArc.t)
, default:nil
) - The arcs from this node. For example, if this node is the root of a subgraph representing a predicate-argument structure, this node will typically refer to the predicate, and there will typically be one arc per argument. -
confidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Confidence score for the annotation. -
description
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Human-readable description of the information in the subgraph represented by this node. This field is only meant for display purposes. -
entity
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The entity and mention fields specify a unique entity mention referred to by this semantic node. -
implicit
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Indicates whether the semantic node is not explicit (grounded) in the text (e.g. pro-drop for a text author or an implicit predicate node for interpreting a compound noun), rather than any explicit phrase or text inside the document. -
info
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.Proto2BridgeMessageSet.t
, default:nil
) - Application-specific information about this node. -
kind
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Encodes the kind of this node and, possibly, the entire subgraph rooted at this node. For example, if this node represents a predicate-argument structure in PropBank, then this node's kind will be PROPBANK, its phrase field will be set to correspond to the span of tokens corresponding to the predicate (such as a verb) and it will have one arc per argument. If the kind is MONOTONIC this node corresponds to a semantic graph node, and arcs correspond to semantic graph edges outgoing from the node. If the kind field is not set, then this node is not directly connected to any type system. In such a case, this node may still optionally have a concrete "payload" in the form of references to an entity mention, measure or span of tokens (Phrase) in a SAFT document. The values or existence of the kind field need not be identical in any subgraph. For example, even if this node's kind field is not set, it may still be the destination node of an arc from some other node whose kind field is set. -
measure
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The index of the measure referred to by this semantic node. -
mention
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - -
phrase
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSaftPhrase.t
, default:nil
) - Phrase (span of text) for this node. This field does not need to be set, but if it is, this node has a textual "payload" corresponding to the specified token span. For example, if this node is the root of a subgraph corresponding to a predicate-argument structure, then the phrase field will be set to be the span of tokens corresponding to the predicate (e.g., a verb). -
type
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Arbitrary type string for this semantic node, or for the subgraph rooted at this node. This type string might come from an external resource, type system or ontology that contains a predefined set of types. -
value
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Arbitrary value string for this semantic node.
