View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersEntityType (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An EntityType configures a value whose type is intended to be an entity. Entities may be specified using either the collection(s) to which they belong, or explicitly via a list of KG-ids. Both collections and ids can be specified, in which case the type will be the union of the id(s) and all mids within the collection(s). Next available tag: 10
Attributes
-
collection
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - This field specifies that containing entity must be: - in any 'collection' if 'in_all_collections' is false (default) - in every 'collection' if 'in_all_collections' is true. The collection field contains strings of the form '/collection/'. If no collections are specified, this value can be filled with any entity. A collection specified as an empty string has a special meaning for Aqua induction, which is that the type includes all entities. -
componentSpecificContracts
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpMeaningComponentSpecificContracts.t
, default:nil
) - Contains data about the contracts that this ValueType level is available for. For more information see go/contract-based-conformance. -
excludedCollection
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - The entity that this value is filled with must not be any of these collections (denoted by a /collection/* id). This restriction does not affect parsing; it is used only to filter attributes in the extraction flow. -
id
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - The entity that this value is filled with must be one of the following explicitly specified KG-ids. -
identifier
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryIdentifier.t)
, default:nil
) - The entity that this value is filled with must be of the explicit type and/or contain the explicitly specified id. This field can not be used for kg mids, which should directly use the id field above. -
inAllCollections
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - -
includeGeolocationData
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If this is set to true for a slot and the entity is a location, the latitude and longitude will be available in variables $SlotName_Latitude and $SlotName_Longitude, respectively. The latitude and longitude data comes from KG. -
remodelings
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpMeaningMeaningRemodelings.t
, default:nil
) - Contains data about current schema remodelings at this ValueType level. For more information see go/meaning-remodeling-framework.
