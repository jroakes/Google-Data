View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialCommonUserMentionData (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Person metadata, for USER_MENTION segments. Should always contain at least one of user_gaia_id, user_id, email or user. The exact set of populated fields may differ depending on the context and the level in the serving stack; for example, emails will be elided on the viewing path. But as a general rule, a proto having any one of the four is valid, subject to the standard constraints of the applied annotations -- that is, communication between servers and clients will ignore jspb.ignore fields, and communication between servers and other servers (or between servers and storage) will ignore client_only fields. For more on the annotations, see the comments in social/common/segment_annotations.proto
