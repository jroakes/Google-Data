A collection of information that applies to a toll cluster.
Attributes
-
intersection
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - The list of gcid:toll_intersection features that this toll cluster. A toll cluster can consist of either a single or a group of intersection points called toll intersections at the end of various road segments in MapFacts that represent one or more lanes passing through a toll fixture that all go to the same routing destination. This relationship is reciprocal, as a toll intersection also stores a reference to the toll cluster it belongs to. A toll cluster must have a reference to one or more toll interections (i.e. toll_cluster.intersection should always be populated).
