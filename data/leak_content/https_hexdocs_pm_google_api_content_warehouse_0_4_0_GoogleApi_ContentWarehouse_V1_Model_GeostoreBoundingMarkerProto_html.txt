NOTE: BoundingMarkerProto could be compared against one another by canonicalizing them via GetCanonicalBoundingMarker() in google3/geostore/base/internal/lane.cc. Any fields that don't contribute to the definition of a bounding marker in the real world should be bundled with the annotative fields near the bottom and excluded in GetCanonicalBoundingMarker().

Attributes
-
boundingMarker
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t
, default:nil
) - References to any gcid:physical_lane_marker features that bound this lane or lane connection. -
boundingMarkerToken
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A token that can be used to identify the version of the data about this bounding marker. -
flowlineAdjacencyBeginFraction
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Which part of the flowline does this association refer to? These should be between 0 and 1. These are optionally set, but can be approximated geometrically if they aren’t set. NOTE: These refer to the geometry of this feature. -
flowlineAdjacencyEndFraction
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
markerAdjacencyBeginFraction
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - Which part of the marker track does this association refer to? These should be between 0 and 1. These are optionally set, but can be approximated geometrically if they aren’t set. NOTE: These refer to the geometry of the marker feature. -
markerAdjacencyEndFraction
(type:float()
, default:nil
) - -
side
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Which side of the flowline does the marker occur on.
