View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreVerticalOrderingProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A proto representing a vertical ordering of a feature. NOTE: This shouldn’t be used if a more specific field can be used instead. E.g., for TYPE_SEGMENT features grade_level field should be preferred. For indoor features RELATION_ON_LEVEL should be preferred. See go/aboutgrades for comparison of various types of levels available.
Attributes
-
level
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The level represents the relative vertical ordering of a feature among all overlapping features. For example, we may have features along freeway surface have level = 0, and features on an overpass have level = 1. NOTE: It’s assumed that all features have level 0 by default, so that it’s not necessary for all overlapping features to have this set.
