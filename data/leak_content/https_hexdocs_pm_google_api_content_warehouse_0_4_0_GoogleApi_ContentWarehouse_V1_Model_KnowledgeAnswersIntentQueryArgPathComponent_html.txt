LINT.IfChange(ArgPath) Given a FunctionCall and an Argument somewhere in it, an ArgPath is a list of name-index pairs that uniquely determines the path down to that Argument. For each pair, the |index|, starting from zero, distinguishes between "sibling" (i.e. belonging to the same sub-FunctionCall) Arguments with the same name. For example, given the following FunctionCall: A(X=D(W=5), Z=B(Z=6), Z=C(Y=7)) The path to the Z=6 argument is {{"Z", 0}, {"Z", 0}} It's the first of two Z "siblings" under A, then the only Z under B. The path to the Y=7 argument is {{"Z", 1}, {"Y", 0}} It's the second of two Z "siblings" under A, then the only Y under C. The path to the Z=B(...) argument is {{"Z", 0}} It's the first of two Z "siblings" under A.
