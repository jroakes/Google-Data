Attributes
-
intentOnlyNoPii
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - QU dectects a sensitive intent with no sensitive content (eg., [Send email]). This flag is only used to trigger a sensitive feature because as a precaution all sensitive features should check current sensitivity mode before triggering; but will NOT block any backends, which means all other features can compete fairly. -
rewrittenQuery
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The rewritten query this sensitivity is for. Note different query rewrites could produce different sensitivities.
