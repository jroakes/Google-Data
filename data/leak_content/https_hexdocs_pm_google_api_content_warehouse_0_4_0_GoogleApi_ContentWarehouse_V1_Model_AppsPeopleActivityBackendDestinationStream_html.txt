A DestinationStream is a /namespace/id[0]/id[1]/.../id[n] that represents a collection of Activities. Example destinations: -The Profile Stream on http://plus.google.com/+JohnDoe/posts -A Square Stream on http://plus.google.com/squares/123 -A "comment Stream" (Fountain) on http://www.youtube.com/watch?id=123 It's possible for a single Activity to show in each of these destinations - and it might behave/look slightly differently for each one. Destinations can have their own business logic associated with them at both write-time and read-time server-side (these are documented below). Each DestinationStream is indexed and can be retrieved using the GetDestinationStreamRequest. For the repeated ID space indexing happens at all levels, e.g. if you have: /square/123/abc /square/123/efd /square/456 You can fetch /square/123/abc directly or /square/123 (which includes all Activities in both /square/123/abc and /square/123/efd), or even /square which retrieves all Activities in the Square namespace (visible for that user). On the storage layer, we represent DestinationStream as Channel (http://cs/#google3/social/common/channel/channel.proto), since the storage does not have the concept of a Stream. Both terms are used interchangeably within the service layer, but client of Social Infrastructure should use the term DestinationStream. Next ID: 3
