Attributes
-
alpha
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: pixel color = alpha (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) (background color) This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. If omitted, this color object is to be rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given with a value of 1.0). -
blue
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1]. -
green
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1]. -
red
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
