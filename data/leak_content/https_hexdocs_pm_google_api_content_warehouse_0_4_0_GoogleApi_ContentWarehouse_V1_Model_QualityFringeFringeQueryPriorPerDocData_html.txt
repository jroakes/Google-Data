Attributes
-
encodedCalibratedFringeSitePriorScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - -
encodedChardXlqHoaxPrediction
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An encoding of the Chard XLQ-hoax prediction in [0,1]. -
encodedChardXlqTranslatedPrediction
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An encoding of the Chard XLQ prediction on translated content in [0,1]. -
encodedChardXlqYmylPrediction
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An encoding of the Chard XLQ-YMYL prediction in [0,1]. -
encodedDaftScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An encoding of the Document About Fringe Topic (daft) score in [0, 1]. -
encodedDocumentFringeVulnerability
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An estimate of the vulnerability of this doc to show fringe content, based on the context around the document. Can be interpreted as a 'safe' QScore threshold to use (see go/doc-fringe-vulnerability for more info). Encoded for compactness and to restrict visibility. Please contact fringe-ranking@ to get access to quality_fringe::DocumentFringeVulnerabilityEncoding to decode this field. -
encodedEntityPriorScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Highest entity prior seen for document's Headline and SingleTopic entities (see go/topicality-score for definitions of entity topicalities). Represents probability that a query is fringe, given that the entity is in the result set with topicality >= Headline. Scores scaled to integers between 0 and 1000 for compactness. Scores must be interpreted through FringeQueryPriorEncoding::Decode API. -
encodedFringePriorScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Probability that a query is fringe, given this document is in the result set. Scores scaled to integers between 0 and 1000 for compactness. Scores must be interpreted through FringeQueryPriorEncoding::Decode API. -
encodedFringeSitePriorScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Probability that a query is fringe, given this document's site is in the result set. Scores scaled to integers between 0 and 1000 for compactness. Scores must be interpreted through FringeQueryPriorEncoding::Decode API. -
encodedFringeSitePriorScoreForQfsTraining
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Probability that a query is fringe, given this document's site is in the result set. Does not use signals with a dependency on the QueryFringeScore of a document. Scores scaled to integers between 0 and 1000 for compactness. Scores must be interpreted through FringeQueryPriorEncoding::Decode API. Will NOT be present if the fringe_site_prior_score_for_qfs_training is not significantly different from the site_prior_score. -
encodedPredictedXlqScoreAndConfidence
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - A combined encoding of the pXLQ score in [0,1] and the confidence with which that score should be interpreted in [0,1]. -
encodedProximityScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - A score in [0, 1] representing the similarity of this doc to known fringe-vulnerable 'seeds'. See go/fringe-proximity for more information. Encoded for compactness and to restrict visibility. -
encodedPseudoraterPxlqScore
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - An encoding of the XLQ pseudorater severity score translated into pXLQ score space in [0,1]. The encoding includes the pseudorater version and confidence. -
sensitiveEntitiesIndices
(type:list(integer())
, default:nil
) - Indices on the repository_webref::WebrefEntities::entity field of entities that represent a person or a group of people (aka sensitive entities). Will be deprecated once sensitive_entities_mids is fully launched (see b/290268614). -
sensitiveEntitiesMids
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - MIDs of entities that represent a person or a group of people (aka sensitive entities). See b/290268614 for reference why this is needed in replacement to sensitive_entities_indices.
