View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreInternalFeatureProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
InternalFeatureProto represents fields for data that are more about other data within the FeatureProto than about the feature itself. This could be data that's set by editors directly(ish) (e.g. trust or rights data), or data set internally by MapFacts based on other data (e.g. polygon shape IDs).
Attributes
-
polygonShapeId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A unique identifier for this feature's polygon data which is being held externally in Shapestore (see go/shapestore). -
restOfWorldPolygonShapeId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A unique identifier for this feature's rest-of-world view polygon data which is being held externally in Shapestore (see go/shapestore). This is part of the feature's geopolitical geometry. -
rightsStatus
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRightsStatusProto.t
, default:nil
) - Per-field rights for this feature. See http://g3doc/geostore/g3doc/developers-guide/inputs/rights-tracking for more information. -
selfPolygonShapeId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A unique identifier for this feature's self view polygon data which is being held externally in Shapestore (see go/shapestore). This is part of the feature's geopolitical geometry. -
trust
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreTrustSignalsProto.t
, default:nil
) - Trust signals/annotations for the feature. In an input feature, these signals are computed at the beginning of the pipeline and are immutable during the processing. In output features, this proto may define the rules/criteria that a newer edit should meet, in order to be applied. -
waterRemovedPolygonShapeId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A unique identifier for this feature's water-removed polygon data which is being held externally in Shapestore (see go/shapestore).
