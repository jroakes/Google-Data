View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreSourceTrustProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Trust related information about the input source (feed or user) to help feature summarization. Typically, the values in this proto are either based on source's previous observations (e.g., a blocked LBC user or a trusted feed) or their status (Google hired operator or admin user). The proto can later contain a more granular trust score or correctness probabilities. A higher enum value indicates a more trusted source. Leaving room in the value space for adding more granular enums, if they become necessary later.
