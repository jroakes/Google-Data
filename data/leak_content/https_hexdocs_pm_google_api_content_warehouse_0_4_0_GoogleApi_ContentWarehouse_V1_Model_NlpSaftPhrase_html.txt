(type:String.t

head
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The head token in the phrase is the id of the top-most token within the phrase. It either has an arc from outside the phrase going to it, or it is a root token of the sentence. A value of -1 indicates that the head has not yet been computed for the phrase (not the same semantics as the head of a token!). Note that even when it is uniquely defined, there is no guarantee that the head is set for entities and measurements within a document: you may need to explicitly compute it. -
start
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - First and last token in the phrase. The phrase goes from start to end (inclusive).
