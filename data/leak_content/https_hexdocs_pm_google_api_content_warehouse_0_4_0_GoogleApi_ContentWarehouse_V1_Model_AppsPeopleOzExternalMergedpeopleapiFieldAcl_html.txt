Note: The set of authorized viewers for a given FieldAcl may depend on the user's account type and domain configuration. For example, a PRIVATE_READ FieldAcl could have any of the following authorized viewers: Consumer user: [IDENTITY_ACL_ESTABLISHED] Dasher user without domain contact sharing: [IDENTITY_ACL_ESTABLISHED] Unicorn user: [SAME_UNICORN_FAMILY] Hafez user: [] -
