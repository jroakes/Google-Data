View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityDialogManagerReminderClientType (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Define Reminder Client Type. This field is for the purposes of 1) UX Customization: Reminder frontends can be configured to have a slightly different UX (e.g., A customized button on Hubpage. A customized notification layout.) 2) Metrics: Client can count how many Reminders with a certain client type are retrieved/mutated. (e.g., VEIDs in go/oparaw.) 3) Index: ListReminder can list all Reminders with a certain client type. 4) Visibility control: some frontends (identified by provenance type, shortn/_xVC9nY2Eb8) only have access to a subset of client types.
