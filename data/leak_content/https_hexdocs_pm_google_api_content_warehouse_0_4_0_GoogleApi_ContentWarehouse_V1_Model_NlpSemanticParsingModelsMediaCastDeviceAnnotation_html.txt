View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaCastDeviceAnnotation (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Media device. Like, Chromecast, TV or Chirp. When emitted from the cast_device domain, you should expect it to be one of 3 different forms: 1) Personal Device: The annotation comes from a device we found in the user's home. device_id and name should be set, cast_device_type is set if device type is mentioned in query. e.g. "Dima's Pineapple Chirp" device_id: FOOBAR name: "Dima's Pineapple" cast_device_type: CHIRP 2) Common Device Name: The annotation comes from a model of the common names of user's device. name and cast_device_type should be set but device_id will not be. cast_device_type can be UNKNOWN. e.g. "John's Living Room" name: "John's Living Room" cast_device_type: UNKNOWN 3) Device Type: The annotation comes from a model of common cast device types. Only cast_device_type will be set. e.g. "TV" or "chromecast" cast_device_type: CHROMECAST Next ID: 9
