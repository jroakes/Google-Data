View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersIntentQueryOnDeviceAnnotationSignals (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Signals coming from on-device annotators.
Attributes
-
provenance
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Provenance of the annotator. Equivalent to theprovenance
field in OnDeviceParserInput::AnnotationInfo. This is used to map from AnnotationInfo to nlp_sage.ScoredAnnotation, since nlp_sage.ScoredAnnotation doesn't have a nativeprovenance
field. Note in the (very) long term, we'd like to replace ScoredAnnotation with Argument altogether.
