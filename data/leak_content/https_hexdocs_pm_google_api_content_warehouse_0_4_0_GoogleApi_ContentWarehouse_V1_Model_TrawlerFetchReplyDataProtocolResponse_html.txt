Group with protocol specific response (determined by the protocol of the url that generated the content we return).
Attributes
-
Code
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Response code. We emulate the HTTP response codes for all protocols that we know. -- HTTP: response code for the downloaded page. -- FTP: similar with HTTP: 200 - OK, 40X - errors (not found, etc), 500 - server unavailable -
ContentType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Content type as inferred by the fetcher (webutil/http/content-type.proto) -
CutoffSize
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Where did we cut off? Includes headers plus truncated but uncompressed content. Present if and only if we truncated the document. -
HttpVersion
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - DEPRECATED, see field 113. Stores the HTTP version we used in the final hop. -
ProtocolVersionFallback
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - DEPRECATED, see field 114. Whether we fallback from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 during fetch. The fallback could happen in any hops and there can be at most one fallback because once fallback happens, we will not try HTTP/2 anymore. -
UnTruncatedSize
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The amount of data we got from the webserver before any truncation, but after undoing any HTTP gzip/deflate encoding. For HTTP, this includes headers and uncompressed content. Content size is excluded if content was not successfully fetched. See description above TotalFetchedSize for comparison.
