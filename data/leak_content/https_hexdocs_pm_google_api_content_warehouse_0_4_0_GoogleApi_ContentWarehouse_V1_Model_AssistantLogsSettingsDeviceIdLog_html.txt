Attributes
-
agsaClientInstanceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The client_instance_id on devices with GSA. See 'client_instance_field' in go/androidids. -
alloDeviceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Allo Id. Corresponds to the GBotRequest.Sender.sender. This ID type should be deprecated by now, yet we've observed it serving prod traffic in GB. -
canonicalDeviceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A unique device ID for Assistant devices as proposed by go/ocelot-team. -
castDeviceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - If set, indicates that the device is a cast device, and contains the UUID of the cast device. Corresponds to the device_id field of the CastDevice proto. -
clientInstanceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - DUSI (go/dusi) is used as the identifier here. This identifier is unique to the user and device. This will help identify which device or application the user's request originated from. This is not to be confused with the client_instance_id that android devices provide. This is currently used by surfaces that use the assistant-legacy-nexus and assistant-legacy-clockwork pipelines. DUSI is created and set in S3. This field is only filled for GAIA requests. -
deviceConfigId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The unique DeviceConfig to the specific third party device. It is also used by Android Auto Embedded first party device. See go/opa-ids. -
homeGraphDeviceId
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The unique device ID for HomeGraph devices. This is the HomeGraph ID, created when the device is registered into HomeGraph. It is immutable for the same device unless it is completely deleted and recreated. See go/home-graph for details. } -
libassistantDeviceId

, default:nil
) - The unique ID for libassistant based devices. -
