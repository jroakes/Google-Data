restriction
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreRestrictionProto.t)
, default:nil
) - The set of restrictions that apply to a zone. These restrictions may limit the routability of every segment contained within the defined feature.polygon. Repeated restrictions are treated collectively as an OR meaning that segments in the zone are only routable if none of the restrictions apply. If any segments within the defined polygon should not have these restrictions applied, they must list this regulated area's feature id in their feature.exempt_regulated_area field.
