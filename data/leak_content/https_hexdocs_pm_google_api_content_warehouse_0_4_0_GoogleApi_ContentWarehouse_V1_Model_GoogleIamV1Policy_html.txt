View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoogleIamV1Policy (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A Policy
is a collection of bindings
. A binding
binds one or more members
, or principals, to a single role
. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
is a named list of permissions; each role
can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
can also specify a condition
, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true
. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation. JSON example: { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }
YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3

Attributes
-
auditConfigs
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoogleIamV1AuditConfig.t)
, default:nil
) - Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy. -
bindings
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoogleIamV1Binding.t)
, default:nil
) - Associates a list ofmembers
, or principals, with arole
. Optionally, may specify acondition
that determines how and when thebindings
are applied. Each of thebindings
must contain at least one principal. Thebindings
in aPolicy
can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if thebindings
grant 50 different roles touser:alice@example.com
, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to thebindings
in thePolicy
. -
etag
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) -etag
is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of theetag
in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: Anetag
is returned in the response togetIamPolicy
, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request tosetIamPolicy
to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include theetag
field whenever you callsetIamPolicy
. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version3
policy with a version1
policy, and all of the conditions in the version3
policy are lost. -
version
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are0
,1
, and3
. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version3
. This requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include theetag
field whenever you callsetIamPolicy
. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version3
policy with a version1
policy, and all of the conditions in the version3
policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation.
