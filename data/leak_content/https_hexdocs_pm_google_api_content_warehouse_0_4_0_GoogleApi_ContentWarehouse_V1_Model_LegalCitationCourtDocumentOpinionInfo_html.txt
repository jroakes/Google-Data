We have one OpinionInfo for each opinion About the "CONCURRING" opinion type: It means that a judge "concurs" to the conclusion (judegment) of the majority of the court, however, he may not agree with the argument in the primary opinion. If multiple judges "concur" or "dissent" the primary opinion, then one judge delivers their opinion, and other judges are said to "join" him.
