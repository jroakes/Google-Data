Attributes
-
actionType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The action type of this action metadata. -
hasPrimarilyFoodIntent
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If true, it indicates that the merchant has a primarily food intent. This field will only be set when enable_food_gcid_strict_check in FoodOrderingRestrictionProto is true, see go/togo-unified:overlapping-for-le. See go/togo-unified-gcid for how this is calculated. -
isOutOfOperationalHours
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - If set, indicates that the food ordering service is out of operational hours. This could only be populated if the request explicitly asks for ignore_operational_hours in request (universalsearch/rpc/geo/food_ordering_restriction.proto). Design doc: go/fo-persistent-v1. -
isWhitelistedExternalRestaurant
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - When true, indicates that this is a whitelisted restaurant from a first party (but non FO) partner, i.e. a merchant from the orderig app, who is Google owned first party food ordering platform. Design doc: go/onboard-mavn-to-fo. Tracking bug: b/150331855 -
nextOpeningTime
(type:DateTime.t
, default:nil
) - Next opening time when the food ordering service will be available. This is only present if the unavailability reason is OUT_OF_OPERATIONAL_HOURS. -
onlyOrderAheadServicesAvailable
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Indicates whether only order ahead services are available. Order ahead services allow only to place order for future and ASAP order can not be placed via them. -
serviceInfo
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.LocalsearchProtoInternalFoodOrderingActionMetadataServiceInfo.t)
, default:nil
) - Aggregated service information by service type. Each service type would only have one ServiceInfo. Optional. -
supportedServiceType
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Food ordering service type. -
unavailabilityReason
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Reason for unavailability of internal food ordering action. This is only present when FOPA is unavailable for a particular restaurant. When this is set, all other fields in this proto will not be populated. Note(fo-search): If there are log only partners and this particular restaurant is only supported because of log only partners, this field will not be set to NOT_INTEGRATED_WITH_FOPA.
