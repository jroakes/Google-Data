View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialCommonSegments (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Segments (go/social-segments) represent structured social content, e.g. the contents of a G+ stream post or chat message. A single post or message may consist of a sequence of segments, each representing a type of content, e.g. plain text, hash tag, mention, etc. Segments correspond approximately to units of content delimited by HTML tags, so that a piece of bolded text would be a distinct Segment, a link would be a distinct Segment, and so forth. A single Segment may have multiple such qualifiers; e.g. it may be a bold link; in this case, information about all such qualifiers will be encoded in the Segment proto.
