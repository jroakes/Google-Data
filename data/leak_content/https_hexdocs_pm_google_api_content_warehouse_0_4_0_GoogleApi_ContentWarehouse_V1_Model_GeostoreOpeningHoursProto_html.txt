Attributes
-
exception
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreExceptionalHoursProto.t)
, default:nil
) - Date delimited exceptions to the typical recurring opening hours. May only be present if regular weekly hours are also specified. -
regularHours
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreBusinessHoursProto.t
, default:nil
) - Typical recurring opening hours, expressed as a weekly schedule. NOTE: this field was introduced to have a more client-friendly format for representing weekly hours but, as of November 2018, it's not used for the main opening hours of TYPE_ESTABLISHMENT features (instead, the data is stored in theEstablishmentProto.hours
field, see b/23105782 tracking the possible schema migration). It is however used in other contexts whereOpeningHoursProto
appears in the Geo Schema. In openinghours.h there is a utility functionGetOpeningHoursFromFeature
that mergesEstablishmentProto.hours
into this proto.
