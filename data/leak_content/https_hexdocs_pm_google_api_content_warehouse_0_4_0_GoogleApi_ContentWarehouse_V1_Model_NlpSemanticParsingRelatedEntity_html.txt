View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingRelatedEntity (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A message that stores relations between this annotation and another entity. Stores the mid and the kind of relationship. These links may be consumed downstream for various purposes, including support transfer and other business logic. An example is for the Honda Civic entity. It may have an mdvc_relation that is a generalization_of the 2015 Honda Civic entity. So the Honda Civic would have the following: RelatedEntity { mid = 2015 Honda Civic Mid mdvc_relation = GENERALIZATION_OF } It has no equivalent_relation because it is by default NO_EQUIVALENT. The Honda Civic entity might then have a separate relation to the Old Honda Civic entity, as they are considered the same entity, or the following relation: RelatedEntity { mid = Old Honda Civic Mid equivalent_relation = EQUIVALENT }
