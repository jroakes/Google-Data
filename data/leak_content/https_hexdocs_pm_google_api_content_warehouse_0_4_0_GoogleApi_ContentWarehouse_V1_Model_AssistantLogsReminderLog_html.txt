Attributes
-
createdSecondsAgo
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The reminder is created N seconds ago. This helps tracking how the user issues follow-up actions after reminder is created. For example, whether the user likes to issues another [show reminders] query right after reminder is created? -
retrievedRankingClass
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - If the reminder is retrieved by a ranking class (see go/opa-reminders-ranker), this will be populated with the class info. Refer to assistant.productivity.ReminderRankingClass.RankingType. Since that proto is in proto2 format, we can only wire by int type.
