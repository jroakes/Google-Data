The ArgumentValue reference to Mention.CompoundMention.Component. Next available tag number: 4
Attributes
-
debugEntity
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Optionally the freebase_mid of the WebrefEntity which the Component identifies via entity_index. This is purely to help humans diagnose the WebrefEntities structure, may not always be present and should not be used by production code. Use QueryJoinToMeaningStructConverter to compose a proper value in place of the component reference. -
funcallName
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The WebrefEntity referenced byindex
is equivalent to this function call in this context, but not universally such that we don't want to recursively expand its MRF. Use this for example if an entity corresponds to a category in an Intersect: CellPhones() & RelatedTo(/m/foo), where /m/cell_phones is equivalent to CellPhones() (and may or may not have an annotated span), but we don't want to generally assert that /m/cell_phones == CellPhones(). This cannot be an actual FunctionCall to avoid a circular dependency. -
index
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - The index of the Component of the CompoundMention which has the mrf_index of this MRF expression in WebrefEntity. Required.
