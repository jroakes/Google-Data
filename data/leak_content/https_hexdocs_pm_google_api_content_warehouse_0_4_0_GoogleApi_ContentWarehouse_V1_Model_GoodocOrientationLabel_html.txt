View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GoodocOrientationLabel (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
OrientationLabel groups the details about orientation and reading order.
Attributes
-
deskewAngle
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - After rotating so that the text orientation is upright, how many radians does one have to rotate the block anti-clockwise for it to be level? We guarantee: -Pi/4 <= deskew_angle <= Pi/4 -
mirrored
(type:boolean()
, default:nil
) - Whether a text line is mirrored (e.g. reflected in a shiny surface or seen through the opposite side of a storefront window). The intent is that this is a quality of the text line image. It needs to be reflected according to a vertical axis along the direction of upright characters to make it readable. This does not affect the shape of the bounding box. A mirrored line with top to bottom writing remains top to bottom. A mirrored horizontal line will flip left to right. However any child entities (symbols) will remain in the same order, and the writing direction imposed by the language (ltr or rtl) will remain the same. -
