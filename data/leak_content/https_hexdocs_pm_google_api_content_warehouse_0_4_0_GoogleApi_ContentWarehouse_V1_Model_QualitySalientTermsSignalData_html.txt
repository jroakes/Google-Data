View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySalientTermsSignalData (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
SignalData stores signal-specific salient-term-set-level information. Stores mostly internal data as it is one of the primary data structures used in the populators.
Attributes
-
bias
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - A fixed bias for this signal, the higher the stronger. This can be used to balance the weight of signals independently of the confidence we give it. This field is only available in debug mode. -
confidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The measurement of how much we trust this signal. Range: [0.0, 1.0] This field is available is both debug and non-debug mode. -
halfSalience
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Raw saliences equal to half_salience will be equal to 0.5 normalized. Range: [0, volume]. This field is only available in debug mode. -
noiseCorrection
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The minimum TF for a term not to be considered noise. While the possible range of values for this field is [0, observed_volume], it is expected to be a somewhat small percentage of observed_volume (e.g. 5%). This field is only available in debug mode. -
observedConfidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The measurement of how much we trust this signal, calculated using the observed volume. Range: [0.0, 1.0] This field is only available in debug mode. -
observedVolume
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of signal we observed for a document. Range: [0.0, +infinity) This field is only available in debug mode. -
rawVolume
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of raw signal we observed for a document. Range: [0.0, +infinity) This field is only available in debug mode. -
source
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - source is the type of the signal of this SignalData. -
volume
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - The amount of signal left after applying all corrections. Range: [0.0, +infinity) This field is only available in debug mode.
