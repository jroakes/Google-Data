View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.KnowledgeAnswersPlexityRequirement (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
Plexity is a conceptual distinction between viewing something (a slot filler, for example) as a single individual, or as a complex concept consisting of multiple individuals or subparts. Note that plexity is not the same as (or correlated with) either grammatical number or with distributive and collective interpretations of the slot. The PlexityRequirement proto and Plexity enum are defined outside ValueType as we may move the plexity specification to a different place in the intent protos in future.
