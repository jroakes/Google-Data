Attributes
-
agentIds
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - For FunTime alarms and timers, the media resources are provided through AOG apps during their ringtone. Multiple AoG agents can satisfy a label. So a random agent will be chosen from those that are supplied. See go/funtime-engdesign. -
animationBlob
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - These bytes may represent the blob of the Rive animation that we pass to the Opal App. We will deprecate this field if we figure out a solution to load the animation from the web. -
animationUrl
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Url for Rive animation that is brought up on ring. Rive is a lightweight animation library that is compatible with Flutter on Opal. See https://rive.app/. -
timerHeroUrl
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The url used to load the image that is at the center of the timer during timer countdown visuals. -
ttsServiceRequestBytes
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - This is used to call S3 to realize the TTS. Is in the form of bytes because of a circular dependency issue in libassistant protos. It is a serialized proto of type speech.s3.TtsServiceRequest.
