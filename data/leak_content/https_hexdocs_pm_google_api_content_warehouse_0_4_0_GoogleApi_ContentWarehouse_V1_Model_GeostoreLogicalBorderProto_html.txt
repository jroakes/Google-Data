View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreLogicalBorderProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
A logical border is a grouping of border features, which together model a divide between two regions. The borders within this grouping share common attributes, such as the regions they divide, and may represent a conceptual group of borders, of which may be wholly disputed, wholly undisputed, or a mixture of disputed and undisputed. Note that any borders within this group may be part of multiple logical borders. A logical border is required to have a name describing what the grouping represents (e.g. "US - Mexico Border", "Kosovo - Serbia Border (Disputed)").
Attributes
-
borderSegment
(type:list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)
, default:nil
) - All the border segments which make up this logical border. Border segments must be TYPE_BORDER features which have the same left/right features. This is a many-to-many bidirectional relationship, so any border segment within this list might be part of another logical border. -
status
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The logical border status identifies its legal status. This is similar to the BorderStatus present within border segments, but applies to the group as a whole.
