Attributes
-
confidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Confidence of the category in the range [0.0, 1.0). If a page has the category "NBA" with high confidence we also expect it to have the "Basketball" with high confidence. Categories with a confidence lower than 0.05 are omitted. This can be interpreted as a confidence of 0, i.e. a strong signal that the category is not relevant for the page. For some categories this score is calibrated per-category to estimate the true precision. E.g., 70% of documents retrieved within the confidence range [0.7 - eps, 0.7 + eps] will be relevant when eps is close to 0. -
cumulativeConfidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Calibrated cumulative confidence guaranteeing maxmial recall for a precision target. E.g., At least 90% of documents retrieved with cumulative_confidence >= 0.9 will be relevant. This score is always calibrated per-category to estimate the true cumulative precision and is not set for uncalibrated categories. -
experimentalConfidence
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - Note: For testing the next version. May change at any time. Experimental confidence of the category in the range (0.0, 1.0).
