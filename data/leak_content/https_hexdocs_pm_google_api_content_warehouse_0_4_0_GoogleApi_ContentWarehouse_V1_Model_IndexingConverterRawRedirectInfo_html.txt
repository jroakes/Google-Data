View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingConverterRawRedirectInfo (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The proto to be stored in raw_redirect_info column of document table.
Attributes
-
rawFinalTargetFromRendering
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Final redirect target found from rendering. It is the same as the last element of raw_redirect_chain_from_rendering. It is used as an input source for the indexable fragment detection pipeline and also downstream phases. -
rawFinalTargetFromTrawler
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - This is with-fragment version of redirect_with_contents. This field is populated only if there was a fragment. This field is used by indexing::mobile::GetRedirectTarget() defined in indexing/mobile/internal/smartphone-util.cc, which extracts the redirect target for smartphone optimized pages. The extracted target in turn is served in search results for smartphone users. We need with-fragment version because with-fragment url can return different content than fragment-stripped url. For example, http://www.example.com/m#article=11 and http://www.example.com/m can return different content. These cases are most typical for Ajaxy sites. This fragment does not have to be indexable. -
rawRedirectChainFromRendering
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingConverterRedirectChain.t
, default:nil
) - Redirect chain generated from redirect events in rendering. At the beginning of it, there could be some redirects from trawler (i.e. could be partial or entire trawler redirect chain), other redirects have their RedirectParams::is_redirect_from_rendering fields set to true. Redirects here have no RedirectChain::Hop::raw_target fields populated, and targets stored in RedirectChain::Hop::target fields are likely cleaned while keeping fragments (also sometimes they could be uncleaned ones because of cleaning failures), fragments could be indexable or non-indexable. -
renderingRedirectLimit
(type:integer()
, default:nil
) - This is used to describe how many redirect hops from Webkit were kept in the raw_redirect_chain_from_rendering. If it is -1, it means it kept all the hops from Webkit in redirect chain.
