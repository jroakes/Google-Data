View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialCommonAttachmentAttachment (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
An Attachment represents a linked entity associated with a piece of social content. This may be a 1st-party or 3rd-party entity. In the Papyrus context, an Attachment is part of a Cent, and sits alongside the main content of the cent, which is represented as a sequence of Segments. Right now an Attachment is just a wrapper around an Embed, but we provide the extra layer of abstraction since, as Embeds move to separate storage in Briefcase, we may want to add additional fields that are not part of the Embed proper, but that (for example) relate to the usage of the linked content within the particular post/cent.
