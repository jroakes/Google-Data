View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualityNsrNsrChunksProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
The NsrChunksProto corresponds to the NSRChunks class. The data saved by the proto and the class is the same. We provide utilities to go from one to the other.
Attributes
-
primaryChunk
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Primary NSR sitechunk. In most of the cases it's same as HOST_LEVEL_V3 sitechunked canonical url of the document. In rare, but important cases it's based on page markup (see quality/nsr/util/sitechunker.h for details). -
secondaryChunks
(type:list(String.t)
, default:nil
) - Secondary NSR sitechunk. When present, it provides more granular chunking than primary sitechunks (see quality/nsr/util/sitechunker.h for details). Note that the NSRChunks class does not store trivial secondary chunks. Be aware of this when constructing NsrChunksProto from scratch.
