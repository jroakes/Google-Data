Represents the properties of a mention. Next ID: 13
Attributes
-
deviceId
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AssistantApiCoreTypesDeviceId.t
, default:nil
) - The unique device on which the mention occurred. For example, if the user has two Google Home devices, this indicates which of the two was used. -
eventId
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.EventIdMessage.t
, default:nil
) - ID of the event that resulted in this entity mention. For user and system turn AEs, this is taken from the ConversationSnapshotId of the snapshot containing this mention. For client AEs, this is empty. This can be used to join back this particular mention to the specific "turn" in which this mention took place. -
factoidScore
(type:number()
, default:nil
) - If this mention corresponds to a WebAnswer, then this defines the score associated with that answer. -
listEntryInfo
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesMentionPropertiesListEntryInfo.t
, default:nil
) - If present, this entity was mentioned as part of a larger list. -
recency
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - Estimates the recency of the mention. This is internally computed at runtime on a turn-by-turn basis. -
role
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesSemanticRoleId.t
, default:nil
) - The semantic role that the entity was used in. -
salience
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - How salient this mention is. This field will only be set if the mention is derived from a SearchAnswerValue. See go/webresultsdata-as-aes for more details. -
source
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesMentionPropertiesSource.t
, default:nil
) - Contains metadata about the source of the mention. -
spatialProperties
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesSpatialProperties.t
, default:nil
) - If present, properties of visual mentions (e.g., how they are displayed to the user, visibility, etc.). -
surfaceForm
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AttentionalEntitiesSurfaceForm.t
, default:nil
) - Details about how this mention was presented. -
timestamp
(type:DateTime.t
, default:nil
) - Unix timestamp noting (approximately) when this mention occurred. We do not guarantee that the time will correspond precisely to when the user uttered/heard a response. If mentions within a single turn have different timestamps, they should accurately reflect the order in which the mentions occurred. If that order is unknown, they should all have the same timestamp.
