View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreSweepProto (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This protocol buffer represents the 2D polygon connecting two segments at an intersection. Collectively, sweep polygons represent intersections for real road width rendering. Notes: - Sweeps represent geometry between the end of one segment and the end of the other segment (modulo retraction values). - Sweeps are strongly referenced, meaning geometry is stored on both segments involved in the sweep. For example, in the diagram below, the sweep between A and B would be stored on both segment A and segment B. | B | v --A--> - Sweeps are not strictly stored on adjacent segments. Disconnected segments (e.g., segments separated by an intersection group) may also contain sweeps.
Attributes
-
otherSegmentFeatureId
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t
, default:nil
) - The segment feature connected to this segment via the sweep geometry. -
polygon
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostorePolygonProto.t
, default:nil
) - Polygonal geometry representing the area between this segment and the other segment. -
sweepCurve
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreCurveConnectionProto.t
, default:nil
) - Describes parameters for generating the edge of this sweep that starts at edge_follows_segment_end_fraction. The other side of the sweep should be described on the sweep present on the sibling pair. -
sweepToken
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - A token that can be used to identify the version of the data about this sweep.
