View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefClusterProtoRuleInstance (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
When we apply a rule to define a particular cluster, we have a RuleInstance. Some kinds of rules for clusters define more than one cluster. In those rules we say things like "for each entity X with this property, we create a cluster where..."; each particular cluster that we create is the result of an instance of that rule, where the argument X has been bound to a particular entity (note that this also applies to rules that define only one cluster; in that case, there are no arguments). An entity that is part of a cluster plays a "role" in such a cluster. This message describes such an instantiation of a rule with a role and with concrete values for the arguments.
