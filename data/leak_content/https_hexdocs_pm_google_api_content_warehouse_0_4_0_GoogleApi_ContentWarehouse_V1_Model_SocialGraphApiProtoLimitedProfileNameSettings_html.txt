Attributes
-
partialNameOptions
(type:GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.SocialGraphApiProtoPartialNameOptions.t
, default:nil
) - Required. Describes which shortening option the user implicitly chose for their limited profile. E.g., if 'John Doe' chose 'John D.', they implicitly chose: partial_name_options { given_name_spec { show_all: true } family_name_spec: { show_initial: true truncation_indicator: PERIOD } } While we'll in all cases serve the actual name chosen by the user for limited profiles (stored below), we'll use this information to recompute the default limited profile to be rendered to users when they change their core name. -
verbatimFullName
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - The actual textual name that was chosen by the user in the UI. E.g., if 'John Doe' chose 'John D.', this holds 'John D.'. Whilepartial_name_options
allows the limited profile name to be computed from the core name, the resulting shortened name might change across different versions of the name shortening logic, and we want to preserve the user's choice verbatim whenever possible. This field will be cleared when the two conditions below are met: (1) A successful core name change is not accompanied by a limited profile settings update and (2) The shortened name computed frompartial_name_options
yields a different result than what is originally stored inverbatim_full_name
. When this happens, the limited profile is effectively disabled. E.g., if 'John Doe' from the example above changes their name to 'Jane Doe' and no LimitedProfileSettings are provided,Jane D.
is the resulting shortened name. Thereforeverbatim_full_name
will be cleared and the limited profile settings will be disabled. On the other hand, if they change their name toJohn DÃµe
, the resulting shortened name remainsJohn D.
, andverbatim_full_name
is kept as is.
