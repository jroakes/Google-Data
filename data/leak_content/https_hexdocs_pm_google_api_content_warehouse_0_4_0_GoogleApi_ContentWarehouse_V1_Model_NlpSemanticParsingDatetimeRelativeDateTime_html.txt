View Source GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingDatetimeRelativeDateTime (google_api_content_warehouse v0.4.0)
This provides a semi-abstract description for relative datetime expressions. - ShiftedRelativeDateTime encodes datetimes that arise from before/after expressions (e.g. [three days ago], [2 days after March 1st]). - FetchedRelativeDateTime encodes expressions that are retrieval-type statements (e.g. [next weekend], [the last two Mondays]). Next field: 5

modifier
(type:String.t
, default:nil
) - When a relative datetime which resolves into a range is being used as the endpoint of a range (begin_relative/end_relative), its begin/end will be taken accordingly unless this modifier indicates the opposite: begin_relative with relative range and modifier == AFTER means that its end will be taken as the beginning of the resulting range. Similarly, end_relative with a relative range and modifier == BEFORE means that its begin will be taken as the end of the resulting range. E.g. "after next month" will be a range with a begin_relative that will take the end of "next month" as its starting point (exclusive). values other than AFTER and BEFORE in the specific conditions explained here will be ignored and have no effect in the resolution of RelativeDateTimes. -
