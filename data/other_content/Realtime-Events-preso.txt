News Clusters catch-up plan ?
If we were to improve News Clusters to get to where RTBoost Events is right now.
(Hypothetically without using Hivemind or RTBoost Spikes for the sake of argument.)


 ●     Use modern-day document tokens: Entities and Salient Terms
 ●     Improve Granularity and Time precision
         ○    Understand them in much more detail than we currently do
         ○    Spikes inside the current NewsCluster granularity ?

 ●     Make cluster id stable (no splitting or merging)
 ●     Build links between clusters (Stories)
 ●     Integrate NB, CV, MiniSessions data pipelines into NewsClusters
 ●     Build correlations with Temporal topicality
         ○    Use TF-DF over background distribution of terms in the corpus (in realtime?)


We would need to work on all of these integrations, to get to the same point we are with RTBoost Events.

RealtimeBoost Events - Known Issues
 ●   Underclustering - Sometimes too fine grained
      ○   likely a bug in the clustering




 ●   Entity Intrusion
      ○   Some articles contains Anchors to other non-related
          headlines in the middle of the centerpiece text.
      ○   Fix is not hard.
                                                                Boy died of caffeine overdose.
                                                                Some articles contained a link to the SpaceX

                                                                The entity leaked to the caffeine Event.

Model-T Cost
Currently we use the Freebie Quota: 10 QPS
We already requested 40KQPS for production deployment.

 ●   Average Document Size:
      ○   Realtime Event Corpus: 400KB / doc
            ■   Can be much smaller if we want

      ○   Newsstand corpus : 45KB / doc
 ●   Indexing Memory Usage
      ○   Realtime Event: 4GB
      ○   Newsstand: 64GB
 ●   Muppet CPUs Per Query
      ○   Realtime Events: 0.4 CPUs / Query [link]
            ■   Also can be improved

      ○   Newsstand: 1.1 CPUs / Query [link]

Ready for Launch

Need greenlight from leads to go ahead with 40KQPS for production deployment.

ModelT Query API is ready and available here.

Integration inside FCS Stories is to be decided with AlexK.

Model-T Events Retrieval

Online Retrieval
   Flexible (can do complex queries)
          ●   Trending events per Location etc
   Breaking news events is guaranteed to be quickly indexed, retrieved, ranked
   Can’t index singleton-documents or non-spiking topics



Document annotation
   Plays well with current ranking systems (FCS etc)
   Rank singleton-docs and topics vs Events
   Already contains all per-doc ranking signals we want
   Might miss very fresh breaking news due to lack of signals on fresh docs
          ●   Can be fixed with Spark / Crowding per Event-ID etc...

Timelines - Hierarchy
Timelines
 ● Model-T allows retrieval by cosine similarity of
       ○ Entities / Salient Terms / News Cluster ID / etc…
       ○ Start with Event-ID-X and retrieve Events by similar Entities etc ...


RealtimeBoost Spike Events vs News Clusters
 ●   Coarse grained - News Clusters has longer time-span and contains multiple spikes
 ●   Fine grained - Spikes are punctual in time, lasting 3 to 4 hours

We can use these ideas to build the Hierarchy
