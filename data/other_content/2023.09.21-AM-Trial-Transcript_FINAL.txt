(Open court)
BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:
Q

10

Good morning, Dr. Lehman.
Yesterday, the plaintiffs asked you a number of

11

questions about Google's use of clicks and different ranking

12

components.

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

What is the relationship between, on the one hand,

Do you remember that?

15

the number of ranking components that utilize clicks in some

16

way and on the other, the volume of clicks those components

17

need?

18

A

So I guess I would make two notes about that.

One

19

is maybe sort of obvious, which is that it's not additive.

20

That is, if you have 20 components, you don't need 20 times

21

as many clicks.

22

number of clicks for those different components.

23

it's all the same clicks.

24
25

We've shown the chart showing all the

There is a more subtle aspect.

Again,

I think yesterday

we talked about the difference between memorization systems

1896
1

and generalization systems.

2

example of a memorization system.

3

particular search query and a particular web page user did

4

or did not click.

5

So now boost would be an
It remembers for a

But the primary effort in use of clicks over the

6

last 10 or 15 years has been on generalization systems.

7

There, the goal is to generalize from situations where we

8

have data to situations where we don't.

9

of like filling in the holes where we don't have data.

So these are kind

10

So I think in terms of how these systems respond

11

to different quantities of available data, a factor to keep

12

in mind is that even though we're adding more systems, many

13

of these are generalization systems.

14

are designed to fill in holes in data.

15

a kind of a robustness to the system in that if you reduce

16

data, those systems can patch up the holes.

17

They're systems that
So I think that adds

Some of the -- those older versions of systems

18

themselves need quite a bit of data train, but the new ones

19

require far less.

20

THE COURT:

21

The systems that you've described as generalized

Can I ask a question?

22

systems, in the development of those systems, was ClicData a

23

component of how those systems were developed?

24

THE WITNESS:

25

Roughly, those systems tried to find patterns

Yes, yes.

1897
1

typically in the ClicData so that you can say, Well, I see,

2

for 300 cases like this, people tended to do this kind of

3

click, and hours here's the 301st case which, well, it's

4

sort of like that, so I'm going to bet people click sort of

5

the same way.

6

And the notion of same varies from one

7

generalization system to another.

8

of move to deep learning, the kinds of patterns these

9

systems could look for to generalize ClicData got more and

10

more complex.

11
12
13
14

THE COURT:

Got it.

And gradually, as we sort

Thank you.

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:
Q

Dr. Lehman, are you familiar of a principle called

diminishing returns?

15

A

Yes.

16

Q

And how, if at all, does that principle impact the

17
18

value Google obtains from user data?
A

So I think there's sort of good empirical evidence

19

that Google's query stream has a certain distribution called

20

Zipfian, Z-i-p-f, and that produces this long tail effect

21

that we talked about previously.

22

I guess one way to think about it is that you can

23

imagine, you start up your search engine one day and so you

24

start processing queries, and over time, the number of

25

queries that you see grows and grows and grows sort of

1898
1

linearly.

2

And then you can say, Well, what is the

3

probability, when I get a new query, that I've seen it

4

before.

5

And I think a reasonable model, it's pretty

6

well-established over decades, is that it grows

7

logarithmically, that is, sort of a classic diminishing

8

returns curve.

9

Q

And what implications, if any, does that have for

10

the value of additional user data to Google and with respect

11

to the quality of Google's search engine?

12

A

Well, for a system like navboost, as the volume of

13

queries that Google has seen in the past grows, the

14

percentage of situations that we've seen before begins to

15

level off, and so you get diminishing returns.

16
17

Q

We've talked about navboost, and you just

referenced it there.

18

With respect to queries that Google has seen only

19

a few times, how does navboost treat that relative to

20

queries that it's seen hundreds, thousands, tens of

21

thousands, millions of times?

22
23

A

Right.
So for many queries in navboost, there's a large

24

number of queries that we've seen a small number of times, a

25

small number of queries that we've seen a large number of

1899
1

times, and for a query that we've seen a small number of

2

times, we'll have scraps of data.

3

bit of a hint, but they come with caveats.

4

have too of many of them, it's hard to draw a strong

5

conclusion.

6

So each click is a little
And if you don't

So, for example, there might be a search query

7

where one person clicked on one result, two people clicked

8

on another result, but, you know, maybe this current user is

9

in Australia and both of those clicks came from people in

10

the United States.

11

not.

So maybe we should trust them, maybe

12

Maybe some other results seem plausible to our

13

other search components, but we're not sure that anybody

14

actually even sort of looked far enough down the page to see

15

them.

16

So that's sort of the typical picture for one of

17

these queries that -- for which we don't have much data.

18

And so I think navboost does kind of the natural thing,

19

which is, in the face of that kind of uncertainty, you take

20

gentler measures.

21

document but more mildly than if you had more data.

So you might modify the score of a

22

THE COURT:

23

So the world is ever evolving.

24

THE WITNESS:

25

THE COURT:

Can I ask another question, I'm sorry.

Yep.

How do -- how does the search engine

1900
1
2
3
4

handle new developments in the world?
Here's a terrible example but one that I will
understand and some of you may.
A lot of people put Taylor Swift into the search

5

engine, right?

6

connections for Taylor Swift but apparently she's now dating

7

Travis Kelce who's a football player.

8

the latest on that, how does the search engine -- how does

9

it -- how is it able to identify these new developments and

10

get people to those relevant links?

11

So you've already got in navboost lots of

THE WITNESS:

Yeah.

So if I want to get

So this is a complex question

12

within Search, we talked about it as the problem of

13

freshness.

14

And there's no single simple answer.

15

Some systems respond very quickly to new

16
17

developments in the world, while others, others don't.
So one kind of system that actually responds very

18

quickly is the sort of the old school techniques.

19

do Taylor Swift, and I don't know, maybe some other term

20

about her relationships or whatever, then the old systems

21

will still be looking for web pages that talk about Taylor

22

Swift and relationships.

23

But at least they'll work.

24
25

So if you

Now, they could be dated pages.

And I think that's important when something like
COVID happens.

Like the word "COVID" wasn't even a word so

1901
1

a lot of our systems didn't know about synonyms for COVID,

2

COVID-19 or whatever.

3

work, which is why it's kind of nice to keep them around.

4

There is a special sort of freshness component

But still these old school systems

5

that tries to look at things like, often news articles will

6

have by-line dates so you can say, well, how old is this

7

article versus this one.

8

relationship two years ago, this is one two weeks ago.

9

so it can sort of boost the more recent ones more

10

aggressively.

This is about Taylor Swift's
And

11

Does that answer the question?

12

THE COURT:

13

But it sounds like there are different components

I think so.

14

that would evaluate these variables.

15

navboost or -- there are multiple systems that operate to

16

identify -- or help promote fresh results?

17

THE WITNESS:

18

And Clicks is one of them.

It's not simply

Yes.
You know, like once we

19

start to get Clicks on a topic, there's sort of a fast

20

response system that tries to make use of those as quickly

21

as possible.

22

But it's something we struggled with for a long

23

time.

24

to think about freshness in all our search components.

25

don't know if we've 100 percent succeeded with that though.

And, you know, I think one argument was we should try
I

1902
1

There's some that -- particularly around COVID, there was a

2

crash effort to try to update our systems to ensure that we

3

had relevant information.

4

perfectly, that wouldn't have been necessary but it wasn't.

So if everything were working

5

THE COURT:

Got you.

6

All right.

Thank you.

7
8

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:
Q

I just want to go back to that concept you were

9

talking about, the weighting of navboost between long-tail

10

queries and what you described yesterday as head queries.

11

Sort of without getting into like the nitty-gritty of the

12

mathematics of it, how does the system do that?

13

A

So qualitatively for these head queries that we've

14

seen many times and for which we have ClicData, we're more

15

confident in that boost data and we can adjust the scores of

16

documents more dramatically or as for queries that are in

17

the long-tail where we have little scraps of data, it's

18

ambiguous, it's harder to figure out what to include.

19

Navboost will adjust the scores of documents more mildly.

20
21

Q

If you could turn to document UPX228 which is in

your binder and we'll just put the cover page on the screen.

22

A

228?

23

Q

It should be in the first section, yes.

24

A

Right.

25

I got it.

THE COURT:

Sorry, Counsel, I was still taking --

1903
1

what's the number?

2

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

3

It's 228.

4

THE COURT:

5

Certainly.

Thank you.

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:

6

Q

And yesterday, Dr. Lehman, you said there was a

7

somewhat complicated story behind why you gave this

8

presentation.

9

A

10

What was that story?

Right.
So this was an opportunity for me to talk to the

11

whole Search leadership, which is a rare opportunity for me.

12

And the people to whom I was really targeting this

13

talk were the people who do design of the sort of the user

14

experience of Search, how things look on the screen.

15

also the more senior Search people who make decisions about

16

how many special features we put on the page and how busy it

17

is.

And

18

And the reason that I was speaking to those

19

audiences implicitly is that I was concerned about the

20

connection between the way Search results are visually

21

presented and the ranking of Search results.

22

And I don't think that connection was widely

23

appreciated and so that's something I was trying to drive

24

home in this presentation.

25

In particular, my concern was that our Search

1904
1

results page could get too busy, and sometimes results could

2

be presented in ways that were a little bit hard for people

3

to understand.

4

And because Clicks are an important signal in

5

ranking, if the page is too complicated, then it's hard to

6

interpret Clicks.

7

Remember, the point of Clicks is that we're asking

8

people to sort of read by proxy for us.

9

read.

10

query and everything else on the page and then we observe

11

their reactions, and those observations are Clicks.

Computers couldn't

So we have people read the search results and the

12

But as the page gets busier and more complicated

13

and if Search result previews aren't really clear, then we

14

observe users doing things but we don't know how to

15

interpret them and extract information from them.

16

So my message was to people who work in sort of

17

the visual presentation of results and decide the layout of

18

the page, no, you need to think about this.

19

learn from our users in the form of Clicks.

20

And I think this was not obvious.

We need to

I mean, Search

21

is a huge organization with thousands of people, and I'm

22

getting up as somebody who's kind of a data wonk who deals

23

in algorithms and that kind of stuff and I have to talk to

24

people from a very different world, the sort of user

25

experience people who are kind of more thinking about human

1905
1

behavior and art and visual presentation and say, no, we

2

need you.

3

And so one thing I was trying to do in this talk

4

is motivate those people to help us.

5

them.

6

I can't just browbeat

And so that's why I sort of introduced this notion

7

of Magic.

8

get Google to do these magical things, these things that

9

seem otherwise impossible.

10

the people in those organizations to work a little bit

11

differently, work with us so we can make this really cool

12

stuff.

13
14

So I wanted to say, if you help us, then we can

So these are intended to be inspirational
examples.

15

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

16

witness?

17

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:

18
19

So I'm trying to sort of inspire

Q

Your Honor, if I may approach the

Dr. Lehman, I put in front of you a document that

has been marked as UPX203 which is in evidence.

20

And take a look at the cover slide.

21

What is this presentation?

22

A

So periodically there will be all-hands meetings

23

where everyone from an organization is invited to attend.

24

This looks like it was from the fourth quarter, the end of

25

the year in 2016, it was an all-hands presentation for the

1906
1
2
3

Search organization.
Q

All right.

And if you go in a page, there is an

agenda; is that right?

4

A

Yes.

5

Q

And under "Ranking," there's the name Eric.

6

that you?

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

Much less formal at Google than in court?

9

A

Yes.

10

Q

And if you go forward in the deck to the page that

Right.
Was

11

ends in 904, and is this the portion of the presentation

12

that you gave at the end of 2016?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

All right.

15
16

And if you go forward one more slide, this is the
first slide in your presentation.

17

What's the topic that you're addressing in your

18

presentation?

19

A

So this is a time when sort of the first wave of

20

deep learning had arrived and we were starting to try to

21

understand, you know, what are the implications for the

22

future.

23

And I think as we've discussed, you know, the

24

biggest problem in Search is you're given a web page and a

25

query and you need to figure out whether or not that web

1907
1

page is relevant to the search query.

2

always been, well, computers can't read so we have to do all

3

these workarounds.

4
5

And the challenge has

But we're starting to wonder if that might
possibly change.

6

And I guess the first line here, "Search is a

7

great place to start understanding language."

8

are two sides to that.

9

really powerful driving application for this fundamental

10

scientific problem of how you get computers to understand

11

language, how do you get computers to read.

12

Maybe there

One is that Search was, I think, a

And in this presentation, I also thought Google

13

was a great place to begin exploring that problem, not only

14

because of the motivation but because of the resources.

15

have access to large amounts of text, and we also had access

16

to lots of user data, which at this time I thought would

17

probably be an important asset.

18
19
20
21
22

Q

All right.

We

And if you turn the page to 905, what

are you saying there?
A

Right, so this is, I think, a thing that's come up

quite a bit lately.
So with this fundamental problem of determining

23

whether a web page is relevant to a query, as of this

24

presentation, after just the first wave of deep learning

25

systems, we really couldn't read documents.

It was -- our

1908
1

ability was minimal.

2

proxy.

3

and we adopt them as our own.

4

So we played this game of read by

Show the text to people, we observe their reactions

And this approach, it has limitations, though,

5

that we've talked about.

6

people search results, they don't actually read the whole

7

web page, they just read the preview.

8

results that are lower quality than we'd like to show, and

9

yet, at this time, that was a really important technique.

10

So user data, you know, is an important source of data and

11

use was used in many Google systems.

12
13
14
15
16

Q

They tend to click on

And there you're describing today which is in the

context of this document, December of 2016, correct?
A

That's right.

Sort of after the first wave of

deep learning systems.
Q

17
18

So, for example, when we show

If you turn to the page that ends in 919.
And on the top of the slide you're positing a

task; is that right?

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

And what is that task?

21

A

So in this presentation, we're -- I was starting

22

to contemplate the possibility that rather than this whole

23

mechanism of read by proxy, have people read for us and try

24

to learn from Clicks, that we might -- I guess here I'm

25

saying, we might maybe someday, we might get to a point

1909
1

where -- with a computer we'd be able to understand a

2

document, like a web page or a passage, there are just a few

3

sentences instead of a web page, based just on the content

4

alone.

5

us.

6

document or a passage just based on the words.

That is, we wouldn't need humans to interpret it for

We could get computers to directly understand a

7

And, you know, I think this was a little bit of a

8

crazy idea at the time, and I think I felt pretty anxious

9

about presenting this.

10

You know, the history of artificial intelligence,

11

I guess I would like to say that to sum up the first

12

history, the first 50 or 60 years of AI research, I would

13

say not much happened.

14

field, the idea that we could actually do something like AI,

15

it was almost embarrassing to suggest it.

17

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

18

THE COURT:

19

And so I think for people in the

It felt like AI

Your Honor, if I may approach?

I guess before you get to the next

document, though.

20

So finish your thought, Dr. Lehman.

This was

21

your -- this was the view of the world at the end of 2016.

22

So how has that changed in the ensuing six years?

23
24
25

THE WITNESS:

It's been kind of a complicated

journey.
The next big milestone for me was the arrival of

1910
1

BERT around 2018, and that was just a shock to me on

2

multiple fronts.

3

One was that -- so BERT was developed in

4

connection with something called WebAnswers.

5

when you do a search, sometimes Google will try to guess the

6

answer to your search and put it at the very top.

7

WebAnswer.

8

passage instead of a full web page involved.

9

So, you know,

That's

So that's a case where there's just a short

And so BERT was developed, and that was its first

10

application.

11

what we found out just before that is BERT beat all of our

12

existing systems combined by a large margin.

13

everything else irrelevant.

14

moment for me.

And there was like a Christmas holiday, and

It just made

So that was kind of a milestone

15

And then, you know, in some ways, WebAnswers is

16

sort of like the junior version of Web Search, because you

17

only have to work with just a small passage instead of full

18

web pages.

19

So I think at that point, it started to become

20

clear that we were looking at a change that would kind of

21

knock all the pieces off the board of search probably at

22

some point within the next few years.

23

And then things began to pick up speed, so I -- it

24

felt like at first maybe there would be a breakthrough every

25

four years, and then it got to be like, Hey, wow, every year

1911
1

there's a breakthrough.

2

months.

And then it's just like every few

3

And it's just accelerated and accelerated.

4

So I was just noticing in the news that the

5

quality of systems that take text as input and produce

6

images that are described by that text has actually jumped

7

significantly since lunch yesterday.

8

So I think one of the big surprises to me is --

9

was that -- and I still don't have my head wrapped around

10

it, is that these systems could learn from text alone.

11

I believe, and I think there may be presentations

12

here, that language acquires meaning because it means

something to people.

14

page.

15

language in a humanlike way, they would have to learn from

16

seeing people interact with data.

17

data would be essential to helping machines learn language.

18

But it turned out not to be the case.

Otherwise, it's just symbols on a

And so I thought that for machines to understand

And so I thought user

It turned

19

out that these very large machine learning systems can learn

simply from text.

21

milestone.

So that was another sort of huge

22

And I guess when I left Google, things had begun

23

to accelerate so fast, and it looked like the implications

24

were just going to be staggering, and not just for search

25

but for the world at large.

1912
1

And I did my very best with it, but at some point

2

I feel like I needed to back away and hand it over to

3

someone who's younger and ready to deal with it, I guess.

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:

5
6

Q

And, Dr. Lehman, you have in front of you what's

been marked as DX237, which is already in evidence.

7

You talked about BERT in your response to the

8

judge.

9

in terms of these large language models?

10

A

What was the next sort of milestone in the journey

Yeah, let me sort of informally say there was sort

11

of these first-generation systems around 2014.

12

BERT around 2018 as a sort of second generation.

13

least, this was sort of the third generation.

14

MUM, which was sort of completed and started to get ready

15

for production use in 2021.

16

There was
For me, at

So this is

I guess this is a presentation of MUM to the head

17

of search at that time, Prabhakar Raghavan.

18

kind of a monster document, particularly to give to a senior

19

executive, but I think this one he read through thoroughly.

20
21
22
23

Q

I think it's

And I used a term there, "large language model."

What is a large language model?
A

So it's a computational system that tries to, in

some way, capture patterns in language.

24

And the name is maybe a little bit deceptive.

25

Language models could be something as simple as noticing

1913
1

that like adjectives usually come before nouns, and united

2

is often followed by states, things like that.

3

And people would try to capture these as models of

4

language, it's sort of systems that reflect the patterns in

5

language.

6

And then people started building larger language

7

models that could capture more patterns in language, and

8

they got larger and larger and larger.

9

And then strange things started to happen.

It

10

seemed that these systems began -- in their effort to find

11

patterns in language, they began to, in some ways, it

12

appears mimmick the cognitive processes of the people who

13

created that language, you know.

14

A sort of trivial example is if you give one of

15

these systems a bunch of school worksheets or something like

16

that where it says 3 plus 5 is 8, 4 plus 7 is 11, and so on,

17

then in its search for patterns in language, it will learn

18

to do math, and so it can begin to do arithmetic questions

19

that it's never know seen before.

20

And that one's fairly clearcut, but then it can do

21

some of the more qualitative cognitive things that people

22

do.

23

then, but it was quite startling to us.

24
25

And it's limited.

Q

It's not AI.

Or at least it wasn't

This, as you describe, is a long, complicated

document, it contains many trade secrets.

But if you go to

1914
1

the third page of the document, there's a section that's

2

marked "TL;DR."

3

acronym used within Google?

Not what those letters mean, but how is an

4

A

As sort of executive summary.

5

Q

Okay.

6

And in the -- about halfway through the paragraph,

7

you write, "These models are significantly more powerful

8

than BERT, demonstrating a large improvement on SuperGLUE

9

benchmarks, and let's just pause there for a second.

10

What is a SuperGLUE benchmark?

11

A

So as people were trying to make computers

12

understand language, and by people here, I mean people at

13

Google, people in academia, people in other U.S.

14

corporations, corporations around the world, particularly in

15

China, they wanted a way to measure progress that we could

16

all agree upon.

17

called GLUE, and it was a set of several language

18

challenges.

19

And so some folks set up some -- a system

And then whenever someone had a new computer

20

system that they believed could understand language better,

21

they could use this GLUE system to check the progress of

22

their work.

23

So they would check how well their system worked

24

on each of those challenges.

25

take an average.

There would be taken -- they'd

And there was sort of a leader board

1915
1

saying, Who's gotten the highest score across all tasks,

2

who's second highest and third highest.

3

of a lot of people competing.

4

And there were sort

And then BERT came along and just demolished

5

everything.

6

variants of BERT.

7

that for those tasks, it was performing above human level.

8

But the tasks weren't that hard, so that wasn't that

9

impressive.

10

So everything on that leader board became
And the performance of BERT was so strong

So the creators of GLUE created a new set of

11

reading comprehension challenges, which they called

12

SuperGLUE that was designed to be the BERT killer.

13

even stickier.

14

BERT exhibited fairly weak performance.

15

about 60, and they speculated this would be much harder for

16

machines.

17

It's

So they were much harder challenges, and
It was scoring

However, within a matter of, I don't know, about a

18

year or so, a system called T5, which later evolved into

19

MUM, among other systems, achieved essentially human-level

20

performance.

21

Q

And in your answer, you mentioned BERT, T5, and

22

MUM.

23

of those systems, if any?

24
25

What was Google's involvement in the creation of each

A

So BERT was developed by Google researchers

working with the WebAnswers team, and then they later

constructed sort of the Version 2 of rank embed, which

T5 was a significantly more powerful system that

got very high scores on the SuperGLUE benchmark.

Q

Dr. Lehman, if you could turn forward to the slide

16

that begins 448, and this just is to orient you.

17

reads "MUM, a major milestone in language understanding."

18

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

19

forward to the next slide.

20

BY MR. SMURZYNSKI:

21

Q

The slide

And, Alan, if you could go

And we'll go through these, but just at a general

22

level, could you describe for the Court what is being

23

communicated in this slide?

24
25

A

This looks like a few high-level bullet points

about the MUM model, the sort of third-generation language

1918
1
2

understanding system.
Q

3
4
5

Okay.
And in the first bullet there, what is being

conveyed with regard to the comparison between BERT and MUM?
A

So when working with language, I think we found

6

that if you need to memorize a lot of facts about the world,

7

you need a lot of memory but not a lot of computation and

8

systems like QBST work well.

9

But if you want to do reading comprehension and

10

sort of reasoning tasks, you need to do a lot of

11

computation.

12

And what this is saying is that the amount of

13

computation per unit of text is about a thousand times

14

greater in MUM than BERT, and the consequence is that it

15

should be able to understand language more deeply, perform

16

reasoning more effectively.

17
18

Q

"understand and generate human language."

19

What data does MUM use in order to achieve that

20

task?

21

A

22

And in the third bullet, there's a reference to

So MUM was trained on large volumes of text drawn

from the Internet.

23

Q

24

Google had?

25

A

Was MUM trained on click-and-query data that

No, and as I mentioned, it was a shock to me that

1919
1

that's possible, but no, there was -- there are no -- no

2

user data.

3

Q

4

And the next bullet down refers to "Few-shot

learning requiring far fewer data inputs than BERT."

5

And these data inputs, again, are raw text from

6

the Internet?

7

A

This may be a little bit different.

8

So with these sort of language systems like BERT

9

and like MUM, typically you train them initially on lots of

10

language, and in the process, they understand the structure

11

of language and acquire some kind of reasoning abilities.

12

It's a little hard to tell what they're doing, they're just

13

giant masses of numbers.

14

them to some particular task.

15

And then typically you would apply

With BERT, the procedure for applying them to a

16

particular task would be a process called fine-tuning, where

17

after they understand the basic structure of language, you

18

give them some inputs and desired outputs, and that modifies

19

the internal structure of the model a little bit so that it

20

gets really good at that one specific task.

21

So, for example, if BERT were being adapted for

22

WebAnswers, the task that they used for fine-tuning would

23

be, here's a query, this passage is relevant; here's another

24

query, this passage is not relevant.

25

bunch of those examples, and then it would get very good at

And you would go to a

1920
1

that task.

2

For large language models, they can be adapted to

3

specific tasks in a very different way.

4

text as input and you would just give a few examples written

5

as text as your initial input and then pose your new problem

6

also in text and, based on just those just few examples, in

7

many cases they could just begin to perform that new task.

8

Q

9

learning is?

10

A

These things take

And is that what the reference to few-shot

Yes, that's few-shot, each shot is like an example

11

and sometimes, you know, two or three or something are

12

enough.

13

Q

14

And that's all you need, two or three in order to

accomplish this with MUM?

15

A

Yeah.

16

Q

If you could go to the next slide.

17
18

Yeah.

And to remind you, this is as of July of 2021, we
saw on the first slide.

19

And without reading the number out loud, you see

20

halfway down the page, there's a reference to the number of

21

search related teams that are using MUM to improve existing

22

products.

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

And to your knowledge, that number is accurate as

25

Do you see that?

of July of 2021?

1921
1
2
3
4

A

It seems about right, that number started growing

very fast and so I don't know exact value, exact dates.
Q

Fair enough.

In July of 2021, as of the time you

left Google, was that number higher or lower?

5

A

It was higher.

6

Q

Dr. Lehman, I put in front of you a document

7

that's been marked as UPX197 which is in evidence?

8

A

Yes.

9

Q

And I'd like to direct your attention to the top

10

of that email.

11

December 26th, 2018.

And it's an email you write on

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

And then you write, I'd like to offer a thought

14

for contemplation over the break.

15

And then you set forth something in bold text

16

there.

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

And what did you write at the end of 2018 to the

Do you see that?

19

various folks in search leadership who are identified in the

20

top of this email?

21

A

So this is over the Christmas holiday.

And we had

22

just seen the results of BERT for this web-answered problem.

23

We've just seen that it had outperformed everything that

24

we'd done, you know, dozens of engineers over roughly a

25

decade.

1922
1

And so I sent this email to reflect on what the

2

implications of that were for the future.

3

shock.

4

big advantage is that by focusing on Search for essentially

5

so many years, we developed this deep body of theory and

6

practices and we made a lot of mistakes but we learned over

7

time.

8

It was quite a

I always felt that Google's -- you know, it's really

And I thought that was kind of our treasure chest.
And then along comes this system and just like,

9

no, never mind, beats everything.

10

just seen that this kind of, sort of junior problem,

11

WebAnswers, had experienced this just dramatic disruption,

12

where machine learning made everything previous kind of

13

irrelevant.

14

And at this point we had

And the thought I'm considering here is that

15

that's going to happen to Web Search, too.

16

that these kinds of advances would -- yeah, just kind of

17

clear the table of all past work.

18

Q

I was guessing

And if you could scroll down, Alan, to the

19

Q

24

A

25

And, Dr. Lehman, could you read that paragraph for

"One consideration is that such a deep ML system

could well be developed outside of Google - at Microsoft,

1923
1

Baidu, Yandex, Amazon, Apple, or even a startup.

2

impression is that the translate team experienced this.

3

Deep ML reset the translation game; past advantages were

4

sort of wiped out.

deep ML largely paid off, and we excelled in this new game.

Nevertheless, our new ML-based translator was still beaten

Q

My

That could have heavy

And you wrote this at the end of 2018 with BERT.

14

By November of 2022, with the introduction of MUM and

15

further advances in ML, what's your view?

16

A

I think by 2021, with the arrival of MUM, it seems

17

like this is the path we're going down.

18

was a big deal in 2021 but now these large language models

19

are everywhere.

You can download them from the web and run

20

on a large PC.

So I think indeed we have seen such deep ML

21

systems developed outside of Google at pretty much, I think,

22

almost every major tech company in the U.S. and many abroad,

23

and a notable startup like OpenAI.

24
25

And I think, MUM

So, yeah, I think this is largely come to pass and
it's a story that's still unfolding, but I think it seems

like this is a road we're still on.

So, Dr. Lehman, could I ask you to

19

project out five years, ten years from now, what would you

20

guess to be the relationship between these deep ML systems

21

and user data in terms of search?

22

THE WITNESS:

23

So my guess, and it's really hard to

guess --

24

THE COURT:

25

THE WITNESS:

Fair enough.
-- is that search engines will shift

1925
1

largely from a reliance on user data and all these other

2

tricks we built up over the years to systems that draw upon

3

these deep learning systems largely.

4

I think there will still be a role for user data

5

but I think it will be much diminished, but I think user

6

data does still bring some things.

7

would be popularity.

8

Maybe the clearest thing

So, for example, you know, I don't know, I search

9

for toothpaste.

10

toothpaste.

11

relevant and a machine-learning system can say, oh, they're

12

relevant.

13

I think user data can still help inform something like that.

14

Well, there are a lot of kinds of

And so all those associated web pages are

Okay, but they're not all likely popular.

And

So I think there will still be a role for user

15

data but, you know, trying to get a high resolution picture

16

of the world from user data requires a vast amount, trying

17

to figure out which is the most popular toothpaste and a

18

bunch of things like that I think will require much, much

19

less user data.

20

So generally I think a lot of the function of user

21

data will be replaced but probably not all of it.

Parts of it, I question what he's talking
Alex is a

Well, my biggest question is, you said, "I'm

15

pretty sure that navboost alone was/is more positive on

16

Clicks and likely even on precision/utility metrics by

17

itself than the rest of ranking."

18

A

Right.

19

So there's several assertions there.

20

So the first part is navboost alone was/is more

21

positive on clicks.

22

And that is, I think, true but kind of misleading.

23

So I think at some point we looked at a chart and

24

we talked about how components of ranking could be evaluated

25

using, I call it "live traffic experiments."

1928
1

And the idea of those experiments is, for a given

2

ranking component, you ask, are the search results at that

3

system boosts getting more or fewer clicks than the search

4

results that would otherwise be there.

5

such a system, if such a system -- if a component boosted

6

results that got more clicks than results that were

7

previously there, then we would say it is "positive on

8

clicks."

And so that would be

9

The navboost system is by far the most positive on

10

clicks; that is, it boosts results that in experiments then

11

get lots of clicks.

12

But that is somewhat misleading, and so clicks are

13

not usually used to evaluate navboost.

14

misleading is because it's almost circular.

15

And the reason it's

The navboost system, what it does is observe

16

documents that in the past got lots of clicks, and then it

17

boosts those.

18

So the near circularity is there's some documents

19

or web pages that got clicks in the past, they get boosted

20

up by navboost and then this goes into the evaluation system

21

which says, ah, I see navboost has boosted all these

22

documents and they get lots of clicks.

23

do.

24
25

Well, of course they

What that measurement of navboost on clicks is
really telling you is that people tend to click on the same

1929
1

results over time.

2

future.

3

So the past is fairly predictive of the

And one way to see why that's kind of a bad type

4

of analysis, I think we've talked about how people often

5

click on low quality results, bad search results, it's not

6

super often but there's a tendency.

7

So you imagine what's going to happen with those

8

clicks on bad search results.

9

going to observe these bad results, got clicks, it's going

10

to boost them, and then an evaluation system, these bad

11

results will be boosted, and they'll continue to get clicks.

12

Well, the navboost system is

And so navboost will look even more positive on

13

clicks even though it's doing something that's actually

14

damaging search quality.

15
16
17

So, yes, it's true that navboost alone is very,
very positive on clicks, but that's deceptive.
Q

We can go ahead and put this document aside.

18

I'd like to go back to UPX203, which your counsel

19

showed you, and specifically the page ending in 907, which

20

is Slide 51.

21
22
23

And this is the portion of UPX203 that you wrote
for the ranking section, correct?
A

24
25

Let's see.
I'm just needing a minute to find it.

Q

Of course.

It is not in the binder.

Your counsel

1930
1

handed you binder clipped copies.

2

thickest one.

3

A

4
5

Okay.

Okay.
Q

6
7

The big one.

I believe it's the

And it's page 57, but it ends in Bates 8907.
It's a graphic of some people with arrows to each

other.

8

Do you see that, Dr. Lehman?

9

A

Yes.

10

Q

And the graphic says, "Each searcher benefits from

11

responses of past users and contributes responses that

12

benefit future users," right?

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

And you wrote, "So if you search right now, you'll

15

benefit from the billions of past user reactions we've

16

recorded.

And your responses will benefit people who come

17

after you.

Search keeps working by induction."

18

A

Yes.

19

Q

Okay.

Right?

20

We can go ahead and put 203 aside.

21

Now, you talked a little bit about MUM with your

22

counsel.

23

computation needed by a system like MUM is that it adds

24

latency?

25

A

Is another consequence of the amount of

That's a little bit of a complicated question.

1931
1

Certainly computation takes time.

2

repertoire of techniques for trying to reduce the time

3

required by these language systems on -- when used in a

4

large-scale application like search.

5
6
7
8

There's kind of a whole

But, yeah, computation takes time.
Q

And time is latency in terms of how long it takes

to pull up a search result?
A

Yes.

And, again, we should be careful because

9

when you do a search, many, many things happen in parallel.

10

So, for example, the DeepRank system which runs on

11

BERT, I believe that adds no latency to Google's search

12

results because we found a spot where we could run it in

13

parallel with other activities that take more time.

14
15
16

Latency is a challenge, but there are ways to
manage it to a degree.
Q

Okay.

17

And another consequence of the amount of

18

computation needed by a system like MUM is expense, right?

19

The systems are expensive?

20

A

Yes, these systems are expensive.

21

Q

When MUM was launched, Google still used more

22

traditional ranking systems, right, with respect to navboost

23

and QBST, certainly?

24

A

Yes, definitely.

25

Q

And you mentioned BERT again.

Any competitor can

1932
1

use BERT, correct?

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

But Google had a nice head-start on using BERT

4

because of the amount of user data available to Google,

5

right?

6

A

7
8

I don't think that's true.
I think Google's biggest advantage in using BERT

early was that it invented BERT.

9

The first two applications of BERT were in

10

WebAnswers, where I -- I don't -- I'm not sure if they used

11

user data at all.

12

WebAnswers.

13
14

ClicData isn't very useful for

And then the second application was DeepRank,
where we hustled, we got it launched.

15

I think Microsoft may have, after we launched and

16

announced it, said in some kind of press release, Well, we

17

did it first, but maybe my memory is not clear.

18
19

Q

If I could show you UPX193, which is a redacted

document, and it's in evidence.

20

MS. MURDOCK-PARK:

21

THE COURT:

22

BY MS. MURDOCK-PARK:

23

Q

If I may approach, Your Honor?

Yes.

And this is a document, Dr. Lehman, titled "Bullet

24

Points for Presentation to Sundar."

25

Do you see that?

1933
1

A

Yes.

2

Q

This is a document that was in your files.

3

If we could highlight Bullet 4 where it says, "Any

4

competitor can use BERT or similar technologies.

5

Fortunately, our training data gives us a nice head-start.

6

We have the opportunity to maintain and extend our lead by

7

fully using the training data with BERT and serving it to

8

our users.

9

hardware resources (mainly TPUs)."

10

A

11
12

This needs multiple orders of magnitude more
Right?

Uh-huh.
MS. MURDOCK-PARK:

No further questions,

Your Honor.

13

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

Your Honor, since this document

14

was introduced for the first time on redirect, I'd like to

15

ask the witness one or two questions on it.

16
17

THE COURT:
Dr. Lehman first?

18
19

When you say "training data" in this bullet point,
what are you referring to?

20
21
22

Could I just ask a question of

THE WITNESS:

Yeah, I think that's a significant

thing.
So this document appears to be talking about the

23

application of BERT to WebAnswers, which was the first

24

application.

25

"Applying BERT to WebAnswers demonstrated this huge coverage

So, like, I think it says in Bullet Point 2,

1934
1

increase."

2

And then the third bullet point says, "Early

3

experiments with BERT apply to several other areas of

4

search."

5

So I think it's talking about the use of BERT in

6

WebAnswers primarily and saying that we started exploring

7

its use in other areas.

8
9

So I think here, training data refers to the first
application, which is in WebAnswers.

10

So in that case, the training data would be this

11

large bank of query passage pairs, where people employed by

12

vendors hired by Google have marked the answers as good,

13

bad, or somewhere in between, and Google built up that bank

14

of training data over some years.

15

it's referring to here.

And I think that's what

16

I don't think it's referring to ClicData because,

17

for these cases where we show our best attempt at an answer

18

at the top of search results, ClicData is not very helpful

19

because if we show somebody an answer and it answers their

20

question, then they don't need to click.

21

Click is usually at least a weak indication that

22

they're not satisfied with the answer we provided.

23

there's a little bit of information.

So

24

My understanding of the value of user feedback in

25

this WebAnswer system is that it's much less than a ranking

1935
1

of search results.

2

about a tenth.

3

I haven't worked on it and I don't know exactly.

4
5

Another person disagreed and said it's more.

But to answer your question directly, I think this
training data refers to human-rated answers.

6
7

One person told me a click is worth

THE COURT:

Do you have any follow-up questions,

Counsel?

8

MS. MURDOCK-PARK:

No, Your Honor, but we would

9

object to Google having a re-redirect since we asked

10

questions directly relevant to their cross, used a document

11

to do so.

12

MR. SMURZYNSKI:

Your Honor, you asked the

question I was going to ask, so I have no further questions.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

Good morning, Mr. Weinberg.

My name is Ian

19

Hoffman, and I represent the United States of America in

20

this case.

21
22
23

Could you state your name and spell your name for
the Court, please.
A

24
25

Sure.
Gabriel, G-a-b-r-i-e-l, Weinberg, W-e-i-n-b-e-r-g.

Q

And where do you currently work, Mr. Weinberg?

1937
1

A

I work at DuckDuckGo.

2

Q

And what is your role at DuckDuckGo?

3

A

I am the CEO, and I founded the company too.

4

Q

And in what year did you found DuckDuckGo?

5

A

2008.

6

Q

And where are DuckDuckGo's headquarters?

7

A

Paoli, Pennsylvania.

8

Q

And can you tell the Court what DuckDuckGo is?

9

A

Sure.

10
11

So DuckDuckGo is the leading Internet privacy
company.

12
13

We're most well-known for our private search
engine.

14

Over the last several years, we have expanded the

15

product vision to be more the easy button for privacy is

16

what we call it.

17

our free browser, which is a replacement for Chrome.

18

the private search engine built in, along with about

19

12 other privacy protections that also protect your

20

browsing, email, other online activity.

21

Q

Our flagship kind of product experience is

And how many people --

22

THE COURT:

2

THE COURT:

Oh, same name, okay.

The browser and

the search engine are the same name?

3

THE WITNESS:

Yeah.

Our basic pitch is to be the

4

easy button.

5

product, it's just like pressing the easy button.

6

download DuckDuckGo, you get everything.

8

And so not have multiple products, we have one

THE COURT:

Got you.

You

Thank you.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

9

Q

And how many people does DuckDuckGo employ today?

10

A

Right about 250.

11

Q

And how many searches does the DuckDuckGo search

12

engine run every day?

13

A

About a hundred million.

14

Q

One hundred million?

15

A

Yes.

16

Q

Okay.

17
18
19

How does DuckDuckGo generate its results?
A

So to kind of appreciate that, it might be useful

to give a little context.

20

Q

Sure.

21

A

It -- when search engines started back in the

22

'90s, there was like one index of links, and I think that's

23

how people still think about them.

24
25

But since about the mid-2000s, search engines
increasingly put these boxes on top of the results.

1939
1

Sometimes they're on the side, down below, but a lot on top.

2

I'm going to call these search modules, but other

3

people refer to them as one boxes, sometimes the knowledge

4

graph collectively, instant answers.

5

So these search modules actually have their own

6

indexes.

7

maps, directions, weather, news, images, things like that.

8
9

So -- and there's about -- these are things like

I'd say there's about 20 of them that are
essential now.

10

So a search engine today doesn't really just have

11

one index, they're really operating with all of these kind

12

of dozens of indexes.

13

So when I started the company, this was one of the

14

thesis of the company originally was I thought these search

15

modules were the future of Search and I wanted to focus on

16

that because it was the innovative portion.

17

license the traditional links as soon as I could, at the

18

beginning, that was with Yahoo!.

19

it's pretty much the same.

20

from Microsoft, along with some other content, most notably

21

ads, and then we do most of the modules ourselves, which

22

means indexing, calling, as well as working with other

23

partners like we work with Apple for apps, for example.

24
25

Q

So I tried to

Fast-forward to today,

We license the traditional links

And when you say you license content from

Microsoft, is that from Microsoft's search engine Bing?

1940
1

A

The Bing division within Microsoft.

2

Q

Okay.

3
4
5
6
7
8

And can you explain for the Court how search
results on DuckDuckGo differ from search results on Bing?
A

Sure.
Another kind of a nonintuitive piece of context

may be useful here.
So when you have a search results page, it's

9

intuitive that the further down the page you get, the less

10

things are going to be clicked on.

11

that -- you might expect it to be the case that, you know,

12

things on the top of the first page may be clicked on two or

13

three times more than the bottom.

14

like 100X.

15

So it might be the case

But in reality it's more

And the reason for that is the function that we

16

see empirically is about one-half -- things right below the

17

thing above it get about one-half the clicks.

18

things gets, like, 100 clicks, the next thing will get 50,

19

25, et cetera.

20

So if the top

So when you have -- with that context, if you take

21

two pages that look to a casual observer nearly identical

22

and you just flip the top two things, in practice, that's a

23

much different search experience.

24

that those things are linking to would get much -- a lot

25

different traffic.

And also from the pages

1941
1

So with that in mind, we actually choose a lot of

2

different search modules to put on top of the page so that

3

creates a pretty distinct experience from Bing.

4

I just mentioned, most of the search modules, we don't

5

actually get from Bing ourselves so that makes it more

6

different.

And as

7

And then there's some other differences like the

8

links that we get from Bing and the ads are just sometimes

9

different.

So we display less ads on our site than Bing.

10

Also because we're private, you know, the links

11

themselves aren't changed around based on any profiling so

12

that'll make some differences.

13

And then finally like visual treatments are

14

different.

15

Also subtle effects, there, can have huge differences on

16

what people click on.

17

Q

So fonts, colors, layouts, that kind of stuff.

And with respect to the web index from Bing that

18

DuckDuckGo uses, why is it that DuckDuckGo licenses Bing's

19

web index rather than create its own?

20

A

Well, initially as I mentioned, like we had

21

limited resources and I wanted to focus on the -- what I

22

considered to be the innovative portion which were these

23

search modules.

24

Today, it's similar.

25

proposition that we can't really afford.

We -- it's a very expensive

1942
1

But in addition, I'd say we get it from Bing with

2

the ads.

3

engine, you need ads.

4

network effect which is coalesced into two search ad feeds.

5

So in addition to links to monetize a search
The ads itself have a very strong

And then we kind of get the result -- get those

6

link results with the ads which is kind of further incentive

7

not to invest in that when we can invest in search modules.

8

Additionally we invest in other privacy technology

9

as well to make this privacy easy button that I was

10

mentioning earlier.

11
12
13
14

Q

And who does DuckDuckGo consider to be its search

engine competitors?
A

Really most of our users switch from Google.

So

like far and away, we consider Google just our competitor.

15

Other search engines that compete with us are

16

Bing, Yahoo!, Ecosia, and Brave are probably the main ones

17

in the U.S.

18

Q

Does DuckDuckGo consider vertical search engines

19

such as Amazon to be competitors that users are likely to

20

switch to or from?

21

A

No, not really.

22

Q

And today, what is DuckDuckGo's percentage share

23

of the overall U.S. search market?

24

A

We're about two and a half percent in the U.S.

25

Q

And which search engine has the largest percentage

1943
1

of the U.S. search market?

2

A

Google.

3

Q

And does DuckDuckGo try to distinguish its search

4
5

engine from Google's search engine in any way?
A

Yeah.

6

I mean, in a word, it's privacy.

7

You want me to expand on that?

8

Q

Go ahead, please.

9

A

Sure.

10

I mean, so when you go online today, if you don't

11

do anything to protect yourself, it's as if someone is, you

12

know following you around everywhere you go, everything you

13

do and recording that, really, every second.

14

All this information is then added together into,

15

you know, what I would think of as a huge dossier about you

16

or what we would call an online profile.

17

So if you use Google, that is, you know, your

18

search history and most of your browsing history based on

19

what you click on, and from their other products, location

20

history, purchase history as well.

21

basically be directly used to cause you harm.

So these profiles can

22

So, for example, the ad targeting that is enabled

23

by them have been tied to discrimination for just access to

24

essential goods and services like jobs, housing, education,

25

healthcare, even financial products.

1944
1
2

Additionally, it can be used to charge you
different prices as based on your profiles.

3

And then for Search in particular, I mean, there

4

are many of these harms but relating to Search, as I

5

mentioned earlier from Bing, you know, results may differ

6

based on your profile.

7

from our perspective at least, based on your user profile

8

without you knowing about it which can bias your kind of

9

conclusions from your search results.

10

So your results may be manipulated,

So generally we find that a large percentage of

11

Americans would like to avoid these harms.

12

distinguish that on DuckDuckGo, we don't do any profiling at

13

all.

14

or search histories.

15

you search on DuckDuckGo, it's like it's your first time or

16

sometimes we say, you know, if 100 people search for cat

17

pictures today, we don't really know whether it's like one

18

person or 100 different people.

And so to

In fact, we don't have any individual user, browser,

19

A way to think about it is every time

And then I would say also besides harms, just

20

privacy gives you benefits.

21

research we do, do not like ads that follow them around the

22

Internet all the time.

23

search engine, you effectively avoid what we call these kind

24

of creepy ads, and that's just a more pleasant experience

25

overall.

A lot of people from some

And so if you use our browser and

1945
1

Q

And do any of DuckDuckGo's search engine

2

competitors offer by default the level of privacy that

3

DuckDuckGo's search engine offers?

4

A

5

No, I don't believe so.
I mean, there are some other private search

6

engines to varying degrees, like Brave offers some privacy,

7

Ecosia offers some privacy, but we don't think to the level

8

that we do.

9

Q

10

And does Google offer by default the level of

privacy that DuckDuckGo's search engine offers?

11

A

No.

12

Q

Does Google offer, even if a user selects the most

13

secure privacy options, the level of privacy that DuckDuckGo

14

offers its users by default?

15

A

I don't believe so, no.

16

Q

And why is that?

17

A

Because we've done several studies over the years,

18

for example, this notion of changing results around when,

19

based on your user profile, which we would call the filter

20

bubble, because it kind of puts you in a bubble based on

21

your profile and other results are filtered out -- we did

22

two pretty deep studies of that in 2012 and 2018, and in

23

that study we looked at people who were signed out, in

24

incognito mode on Chrome, and found still individual results

25

they were getting were very similar to the signed-in mode

1946
1

relative to other people right around them that were not.

2

And so we controlled for things like location, time of day,

3

missing -- all variables we could think of and that was the

4

only thing remaining.

5

Q

6

done.

7

So you described some studies that DuckDuckGo has

Has DuckDuckGo conducted any studies to evaluate

8

search engine users' level of concern about Internet

9

privacy?

10

A

11

Yeah.
I mean, when we started, there really wasn't a lot

12

of consumer privacy research.

13

probably since around 2016 when we got really serious about

14

working on this easy button, we've probably done over 50

15

large scale surveys of the American population.

16

Q

So I'd say just in the last,

And before you go on and tell us at a high level

17

what those studies have found, can I ask you to describe how

18

DuckDuckGo performs those studies?

19
20

A

Sure.
We generally commission them with a survey panel

21

company who then demographically adjusts them for the

22

American population.

23

We don't conduct them ourselves.

And, you know, we have our own user insights team

24

who -- kind of professional survey people.

25

sometimes we've also commissioned the entire survey from an

And then

1947
1
2

external research firm.
Q

3
4
5

Okay.
And now back to the question.

At a high level,

what have these studies shown?
A

So at a high level, it shows about 30 to

6

40 percent of Americans have a strong preference for search

7

privacy.

8

question, if a new search engine were to come along, pick

9

the top factor that would motivate you to switch search

10

engines.

11

that factor.

To give you some color to that, we often ask a

And if you've already switched before, what was

12

So factors include, there's a little more precise

13

language than this in the question, but they're essentially

14

better results; better privacy; fewer ads; better connection

15

to the social values of the company, like climate change;

16

better design; better customization options; and an other

17

category.

18

the number one thing that people pick.

19

find.

20

So you might expect that better results would be
That is not what we

Consistently, we find better privacy as the pick,

21

the number one factor, about 40 percent of the time.

Better

22

results comes in at number two at about 25 percent.

Fewer

23

ads is at 15 percent.

24

categories, so that ads up to 80, are about 20.

25

one data point.

And then all the rest of the
So that's

1948
1

The second one that I would give you would be --

2

because people -- often what we hear from that is, like,

3

what people say or people do online may be different.

4

also try to ask very specifically, like, what people are

5

doing and recite back behaviors to us.

6

like, do they regularly clear cookies, do they -- have they

7

ever downloaded a privacy app or extension.

8

subscribed to, like, a privacy app or service.

9

a number of these.

So we

So we ask things

Have they ever
And we have

10

If people say they've done several of them, we put

11

them in what we consider more our target market which is the

12

care and act on privacy group, so they not only have

13

expressed concern, but they've expressly taken actions that

14

show that concern.

15

That comes out about right now at least around a

16

third of Americans and it's been steadily climbing since we

17

started doing this about ten years ago.

18

triangulate around the same, I'd say between 30 to

19

40 percent of Americans showing a pretty strong privacy

20

preference for search engines.

Please be seated,

Thank you, Your Honor.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

Mr. Weinberg, when we left off, you were answering

13

the question of whether DuckDuckGo had done any studies

14

about users' concerns about Internet privacy.

15

finished your answer?

16

A

Had you

I think so.

17

I mean, I -- conclusion is about 30 to 40 percent

18

of Americans express a strong preference for search privacy.

19

Q

20
21
22
23
24
25

Okay.
Then let me ask you this:

Has DuckDuckGo always

been a privacy-focused search engine?
A

We became privacy focused in around 2010.

So

about a year and a half after I started the company.
Q

And in 2010 when DuckDuckGo began to emphasize

Internet privacy, did that affect the number of searches run

1950
1
2

on DuckDuckGo?
A

3

Yeah.
I mean, early on, we had very little searches,

4

just all around.

5

for a variety of reasons, including like the search modules

6

I was referring to earlier.

7

And mainly early adopters are coming to us

Over that time period, privacy became the salient

8

feature and the reason why most people were switching to

9

DuckDuckGo, and it's just been increasing since.

10
11
12

Q

Were there any events you observed that made

privacy more relevant to consumers?
A

Yeah.

13

I mean, so it was a -- it was more of a hidden

14

issue that people weren't really talking about, I'd say

15

before Snowden in 2013.

16

2013, that -- the Snowden revelations created an

17

international press moment for -- really for an entire year,

18

and that educated a lot of people about certainly government

19

surveillance going on.

20

And then, really from then, awareness of privacy

21

has ticked up slowly over time, over that entire decade,

22

2013 to now.

23

The other big moment where there was a really

24

increased amount -- I'd say a lot of this was driven by,

25

again, press -- was Cambridge Analytica in 2018.

So that

1951
1

really kicked off almost two years, up until the pandemic

2

started, of nonstop privacy revelations in news -- you know,

3

in the media.

4

Q

5
6

And you referenced the Snowden revelations.

At a

high level, what were those?
A

Edward Snowden was a whistleblower who released a

7

lot of secret documents that showed a bunch about government

8

surveillance programs.

9

One of the programs called -- which is relevant to

10

this, called PRISM, was about the government requesting kind

11

of direct access to big technology companies, including

12

Google, so they could get -- easily search email history,

13

that kind of thing.

14

Q

And you referenced Cambridge Analytica and

15

revelations there.

16

revelations were in Cambridge Analytica?

17
18

A

Can you tell the Court what the

Sure.
Cambridge Analytica was more about Facebook, and

19

some researchers had been using some Facebook data to

20

profile American citizens and for political purpose and,

21

arguably, influence the election.

22

I think it opened up people's eyes a bit wider,

23

though, to kind of what user data was out there, how

24

companies could get access to it through APIs, how it was

25

kind of floating around.

1952
1

And so since then, the coverage has been way wider

2

as to what data is out there, how does it get leaked, how

3

does it line up in other places, that kind of thing.

4

Q

So we've talked about the level of privacy the

5

different search engines provide.

6

level of privacy that Internet browsers provide.

7
8

Let's talk now about the

In your experience, Mr. Weinberg, do leading
Internet browsers generally have privacy modes?

9

A

10

privacy mode.

11

privacy protection, but they have a mode.

12
13
14

Q

I would say, yeah, most major browsers have a
I don't necessarily believe it provides much

And can you explain why you don't believe that

most privacy modes offer privacy protection?
A

15

Yeah.
I mean, historically when they started -- this is

16

kind of another -- things were different a long time ago,

17

right?

18

So when the private mode first kicked off, there

19

wasn't as much online tracking going on.

And so the mode

20

was more about wiping your local history.

And so if you

21

used the private browsing mode and then closed the window,

22

that history would be wiped such that, you know, your spouse

23

or someone in your household couldn't see your browsing

24

history.

25

But over time, the real privacy threats were more

1953
1

online and websites tracking you behind the scenes.

2

privacy modes did nothing to prevent any of this tracking.

3

The

I'd say after many years of complaining about this

4

and at least one class-action lawsuit, major browsers have

5

started to put some privacy protection in privacy mode but

6

definitely not enough to stop the privacy harms I was

7

talking about earlier, and generally no search privacy in

8

the mode.

9

Q

10

And just for reference, do you know the name that

Apple gives the privacy mode in its Safari browser?

11

A

I think they just call it private mode.

12

Q

Okay.

13

And the same question for Google's Chrome browser?

14

A

Google calls it incognito mode.

15

Q

And do you know the name that Mozilla's Firefox

16

browser uses?

17

A

18
19

I'm not sure if they have a name for it.

it's just like new private tab, new private window.
Q

20

Okay.
And you said earlier that DuckDuckGo also operates

21

a browser.

22

A

23
24
25

I think

Does DuckDuckGo's browser have a privacy mode?

Our goal is to offer privacy by default.

So all

our privacy protections are available in all of our windows.
Q

Okay.
And when you say privacy by default, what does

1954
1

that mean?

2

A

I mean, when you install the product, you don't

3

have to go into a privacy mode or mess around with settings

4

to make the browser private, it just starts with the privacy

5

protections on by default.

6

Q

Now, Mr. Weinberg, is it possible that even if a

7

browser is set to privacy mode, that a search engine could

8

still track a user's private information?

9

A

Yes.

10

I mean, oftentimes the browser and the search

11

engine are different companies, and so they're not even

12

coordinating.

13

private mode, the browsers aren't stopping online tracking.

14

And so they wouldn't be stopping the search engine that you

15

visit, which could be any search engine, from doing anything

16

on their website.

17

Q

It just -- generally when you go into a

And are there ramifications for the privacy of a

18

consumer who pairs a browser set to privacy mode with a

19

search engine that tracks personal information?

20
21

A

Yes.
I mean, all the harms I was talking about earlier,

22

a lot of them stem from searching and search privacy.

23

you know, if you search for something in private mode, it

24

could follow you around.

25

ads, it could -- those ads could be discriminatory.

So,

Like we were talking about with
Things

1955
1

could still be added to your profile that could be used for

2

changing your search results, like I was talking about,

3

incognito mode.

4

happening.

5

Q

All of those, tracking could still be

Earlier you described some studies that DuckDuckGo

6

has commissioned.

7

regarding consumer misconceptions about privacy protections

8

offered by browsers set to a privacy mode?

9

A

Has DuckDuckGo commissioned studies

Yes.

10

Specifically we went pretty deep into this issue

11

in 2016, and put out a detailed white paper in 2017, that

12

was based on a number of surveys.

13

In general, we found that usage of these modes was

14

very high.

15

saying they used them at some point.

I recall something like 45 percent of people

16

There was wide misconceptions about what they do.

17

So we kind of asked people to check off what it did, and the

18

majority of people could not identify what it actually did.

19

A primary misconception was this search privacy

20

issue you're asking about where people thought their

21

searches would be anonymous in private browsing mode, when

22

they're not.

23

We then went on to ask people -- to tell people

24

what it actually did and then ask people how they felt about

25

it and to identify kind of from a range of emotions, and

1956
1

people generally, again, the majority, felt kind of a range

2

of negative emotions, confused, misled, that kind of thing.

3

Q

And did DuckDuckGo study whether informed

4

consumers would prefer to pair a browser in privacy mode

5

with a search engine that does not track private

6

information?

7

A

8

Yes.
I mean, generally -- and that was part of the

9

reason why we're doing this study in particular was, we had

10

a hunch that that was the case.

11

trying to make the case to browsers to use us in private

12

mode, and so that is what we found.

13

Q

And, you know, we were

And for a consumer who prefers pairing a browser

14

in privacy mode with a privacy-focused search engine, is it

15

easy for them to switch device defaults to a search engine

16

like DuckDuckGo?

17

A

No.

I mean, it's generally impossible.

There's

18

no -- there's generally no separate setting for a search

19

engine in private mode versus regular mode.

20

Q

All right.

Well, let's talk about potential

21

methods of extending the reach of DuckDuckGo's search

22

engine.

23
24
25

Has DuckDuckGo sought to have its search engine
included as an option on any choice screen menus?
A

Yes, in Europe.

1957
1

Q

And what happened there?

2

A

There was an antitrust case in 2018, and Google

3

put forth their own remedy of a choice screen, which we --

4

we have no formal role in this process.

5

asked about it.

6

in the negotiations.

7

of immediately flawed.

We weren't kind of

The EC Commission didn't really include us
So from our point of view, it was kind

8

The first version, they wanted to charge us money

9

to participate way more than the profits we make per user.

10
11

So that and many other things, issues with it,
we've been complaining about.

12

The only thing that's really changed is it became

13

free, but we think it's still not designed very well.

14

we participate now because it's free.

15

Q

16
17

But

Okay.
Is DuckDuckGo a non-default search option in any

browser?

18

A

Yes.

19

Q

And how effective is it for gaining traffic to be

20
21

a non-default search engine in a browser?
A

In general, just being made the option we found

22

not very helpful because users find -- we can't very well

23

instruct people to go to those settings.

24
25

There's one exception to that, which is there are
browsers where -- and iOS is one of these -- where it is

1958
1

impossible to set the search engine unless you're an option.

2

And so that gives us some boost because otherwise, it was

3

completely impossible.

4
5
6
7
8

But generally, we find just being an option
doesn't give us that much.
Q

Do you find any roadblocks that consumers have in

resetting defaults?
A

9

Yeah.
I mean, I -- so I'd say broadly, the search

10

defaults are kind of the primary barrier for people

11

expressing their search privacy.

12

They're -- like -- as I was just saying, they're

13

extremely powerful.

14

people to switch.

15
16
17

Q

We find it empirically hard to get

And could you expand on why it's difficult to get

people to switch defaults?
A

Sure.

18

So I think there's a few nuances to this.

19

First, it just -- as a practical matter, there's

20

too many steps to get a full substitution of DuckDuckGo to

21

Google.

22

This is because -- Google to DuckDuckGo.

23

This is because there's just so many devices and

24
25

search defaults.
So if you think about it, a typical user is going

1959
1

to have multiple devices they interact with across home,

2

work, family, phone, tablet, desktop, laptop, somewhere

3

between three to seven devices, I would say routinely.

4

Each one of these devices has multiple search

5

defaults on it, the browser defaults and the operating

6

system defaults, some people use multiple browsers,

7

et cetera, sometimes there's multiple search results per

8

device.

9

And so if you just switch one default, say, like,

10

the Android widget, that's just a small fraction of the

11

users' queries, that's not a full substitution of Google to

12

DuckDuckGo, because they're still using and interacting with

13

all their other browser and search defaults.

14

So to really get them to have a real substitution,

15

a real substitute of products, you'd have to switch all the

16

search defaults that they regularly interact with.

17

now on the order of like 30 to 50 steps, not like three to

18

five.

19

we're seeing empirically.

And it's just too many steps.

That's

So, like, that's what

20

We have survey data, we don't have any user data,

21

but we do these surveys of the American population again --

22

we do a lot of surveys because we don't have any user data

23

to see what usage DuckDuckGo gets and, like, how people are

24

using it.

25

users.

We can segment those surveys by our most avid

So these are users who love our search results, they

1960
1

are recommending us multiple times a month to friends and

2

family.

3

This is like the top end of the range.
These people still aren't switching all their

4

search defaults.

5

they're full-time on, say, mobile but not Desktop or they're

6

full-time on one browser but not another.

7

I say kind of empirically, it just is not happening.

They are routinely reporting to us that

And so that's why

8

Two other nuances that might be worth mentioning

9

is -- that we run into is, I think you just said, you know,

10

it resets sometimes.

11

on browser and operating system updates, the default can

12

reset.

13

of like a de facto reset.

14

or it's a little different, and so there's a justification

15

to kind of reset it.

So that definitely happens.

So like

Search functionality can also change which is kind
There's a new access point added

16

What this means essentially is, if you switch some

17

of these defaults, eventually you're going to be forced back

18

on to Google if you do nothing.

19

And then finally I'd say, it's all just way harder

20

than it needs to be.

21

currently 15 plus steps, there's more taps if you count all

22

the taps, just to switch everything you can and not

23

everything is switchable like the assistant, for example.

24
25

So on Android, we find it takes

But it could be easy.

So it could be the case.

Imagine for a second that you had an operating system

1961
1

setting that switched all the search defaults across the

2

device in actually one step, and now imagine that if you

3

downloaded our app or website, we could take you -- or you

4

downloaded our app or went to our website, we could take you

5

to that setting in one click.

6

but it just doesn't work that way.

That's how easy it could be,

7

Q

Is that your choice that it doesn't work that way?

8

A

No.

9

Q

Is there any browser where DuckDuckGo is the

10
11
12

default option today?
A

I believe we're the default in the Tor browser,

which is a privacy focused browser.

13

THE COURT:

14

THE WITNESS:

15
16
17
18
19
20

I'm sorry, can you spell that browser?
T-o-r.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

And what percentage of the U.S. browser market

does Tor have today?
A

Some immeasurable small amount.

I don't know if

it's measurable.
Q

Well, what have you found to be the most

21

successful method of distributing DuckDuckGo's search

22

engine?

23

A

24
25

When we've been the default for brief periods in

different times, that's been the best method.
Like in this Tor example, even, we weren't the

1962
1

default and then we were the default.

2
3

Brave made us the default in some countries for a
brief period of time.

4

And so we had kind of a taste of what that looks

5

like.

6

Q

7
8

I'd say that's the best way.
And is DuckDuckGo search engine the default in the

DuckDuckGo browser?
A

9

Yes.
I would say that, as I was mentioning earlier,

10

like, it's an all in one privacy product.

11

search privacy is essential to get the value proposition of

12

the product.

13

Q

14
15

So we believe

And are there any challenges in trying to

distribute the DuckDuckGo browser?
A

16

Yeah.
I mean, so, in fact, we made the browser in

17

part -- in large part because of the friction in search

18

defaults.

19

people to adopt our browser than to get people to try to

20

convince them to switch to different search defaults.

21

So believe it or not we find it easier to get

The browser faces its own issues, though, like,

22

for example, it's hard, in some case, to switch the browser

23

default in a similar way.

24
25

Also, we face competition from Google's use of
their other properties, like if you go to Gmail or YouTube,

1963
1

they'll ask you to download Chrome constantly if you're on

2

another browser.

3

THE COURT:

I just want to add, just as a

4

practical question, if I go to an app store and download

5

DuckDuckGo, the DuckDuckGo app is both a browser and search

6

engine or is it just search engine?

7

gets downloaded?

8
9

THE WITNESS:

Can you tell me what

Yeah, I mean, I think that it's a

browser, but it has the search engine built in.

10

I mean, all the browsers since about 2010 have

11

that address bar where you just type, search right into the

12

address bar.

13

THE COURT:

14

THE WITNESS:

15

THE COURT:

16

THE WITNESS:

17

THE COURT:

18
19

Right.
So it's both.

It's both.
Yeah.

I wanted to confirm that.

Thank you.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

Now, Mr. Weinberg, without naming names and we'll

20

get into that in the closed session later, has DuckDuckGo

21

ever pitched the idea of being the default in a browser's

22

private browsing mode?

23
24
25

A

Yes.
I mean, we -- after doing -- we had the hunch

about people's expectations there, we confirmed it in our

1964
1

research.

2

browsers honestly where -- and the pitch was essentially,

3

hey, we have direct evidence that we think you're misleading

4

your users, like, your users think they're getting search

5

privacy in this mode but they're not, you should really use

6

a private search engine and we really took that pitch pretty

7

far and wide.

8

Q

9
10

And so we thought it was a great pitch to

And when DuckDuckGo made that proposal to

different browsers, did it face any obstacles?
A

11

Yes.
I mean, we generally saw a lot of interest.

12

I mean, I think there was a lot of genuine concern about

13

search privacy.

14

But pretty much with all the major browsers, at

15

least, we hit an obstacle with their people's Google's

16

contracts.

17

And we ultimately decided, this was after like

18

three years of trying this, that it was a quixotic exercise

19

because of the contracts.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay, Your Honor, at this time, that

21

concludes the questions that I think I'm allowed to ask in

22

open court.

23

open court questions and then we could resume in closed

24

session?

25

I think my colleague from the states has some

THE COURT:

Okay.

1965

MR. CONRAD:

Good morning, Your Honor.

Joseph

Conrad for the State of Nebraska and for the plaintiff

THE COURT:
BY MR. CONRAD:
Q

7
8

Good morning, Mr. Weinberg.
First, if you could just satisfy my curiosity,

I've been sitting there just curious.

9
10

Good morning.

What prompted you to name the company DuckDuckGo?
A

Oh.

11

Unfortunately it was not a great story.

12

The mascot -- the idea for a mascot came before

13

the name, wanted a cute mascot, tried to think of a name

14

that would go with the cute mascot.

15

Q

16

Got it.

Thank you.

So you talked with my colleague, I think, about

17

what you referred to as search modules.

18

explain where you get the content that fit into those

19

modules?

20
21

A

And could you

Sure.
I mean, as I was saying, there really are many

22

dozens of distinct types of search modules, and each one has

23

its own index, so if you want to get really complicated, set

24

of indexes sometimes.

25

And so because of their vertical nature they're

1966
1

going to come, each one is going to be pretty different as

2

to what the content is going to be.

3

I referenced Apple for maps.

You know, we

4

partnered with Tripadvisor, some of them, like, FAQs -- some

5

of them, like, Calculator, we'll just make ourselves.

6

Something like info about people and places, we generally

7

get from Wikipedia but that's from indexing ourselves, not

8

from them directly.

9
10
11

Q

And what motivated DuckDuckGo to first develop

these features, or excuse me, those modules?
A

Well, I actually started myself.

The whole reason

12

for starting the company myself was to improve my own Google

13

results initially.

14

actually going to Wikipedia a lot.

15

ended up writing was crawling and indexing Wikipedia and

16

making search models for Wikipedia and putting them on top

17

of the search results.

And part of the initial motivation was
So the first code that I

18

Q

And how did that strategy develop over time?

19

A

We -- I thought it was the future.

20

We ended up really making that a core strategy of

21

the company early on from, like, 2000 maybe -- let me get

22

the dates wrong, '11 to '14 maybe.

23

a whole open source platform where developers could code all

24

sorts of different search modules for us and the idea was to

25

get pretty niche modules.

And we actually created

We ended up with basically

1967
1

thousands of these in the end.

2

All sorts of things, like, if you were into a

3

certain programming language, you might have the programming

4

language for that -- modules for that programming language

5

documentation.

6

something, we could have a Pokémon directed search module.

7

It ended up not being as attractive a way to get

8

people to switch search engines as I would have liked so we

9

stopped focusing on it as much but that was kind of the

10

strategy at that time.

11
12
13

Q

Or if you were really into Pokémon cards or

And does DuckDuckGo continue to develop these

modules?
A

Yeah.

14

We -- I had mentioned earlier there's about 20

15

that I think are essential so we now focus our efforts on

16

those essential ones and we continue to develop them.

17
18

Q

And does DuckDuckGo do any testing or

experimentation with regards to these modules?

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

And can you just explain for the Court what this

21
22
23

testing or experimentation looks like?
A

Sure.
I mean, there's not just one type of

24

experimentation or test.

25

would be like an AB test or what they call a split test

We will -- I think the most common

1968
1

where you have two versions of something going on at once

2

and you're looking at what people are clicking on or

3

engaging with on both versions and seeing which one is

4

better by whatever endpoint you want.

5

We also will do other things, though.

6

qualitative test by having people walk through things and

7

tell us what they're thinking or seeing.

8

tests, like I was -- like, surveys like I was talking about

9

before.

10

use.

11

We'll do a

We'll do survey

There's a wide range of methodologies you could

Q

And does the number of users that DuckDuckGo

12

impact the quality of the testing or experimentation it

13

conducts?

14

A

15

Yeah.
I mean, we are very limited in the amount of

16

on-site experimentation we can do, which is partly why we

17

use all these other methodologies to try to be a proxy for

18

what we could get if we could run more AB tests live on the

19

site.

20

Q

21

Thank you.

Those are my questions.

THE COURT:

Can I ask one question, one additional

22

question, which is -- and you may have answered this, I

23

apologize.

24
25

In terms of search quality and the quality of
results, what does DuckDuckGo do with the data it receives

1969
1

from Bing to create its own search results page?

2

THE WITNESS:

3

THE COURT:

4

So --

And to distinguish its search results

page?

5

THE WITNESS:

6

So we're only getting some of the information that

Yeah.

7

we need to make a search result page from Bing.

8

mainly getting the traditional links and ads.

9

search modules we have to do ourselves.

We're

So all these

10

And so we have to develop -- and I'd say a large

11

part of the technology is developing a relevancy engine of

12

where to place what on the page.

13

top of the links here, or should you put it under the third

14

link.

Like, do you put maps on

15

And if you don't put the thing that people want on

16

top, because of the way people click, so much -- and it gave

17

so much more than the thing on top, you have a perceived

18

quality issue.

19

I would also say, though, that, like, I don't

20

believe there's an overall metric for quality.

21

it's -- each query is kind of subjective to some degree,

22

and, you know, each vertical has its own metrics.

23

not like we're -- we can make a topline measurement of it.

24
25

THE COURT:

I think

So it's

So if somebody were to enter a query

that would fall outside the modules that you've referred to,

1970
1

the 20 or so that you focus on, what would the search

2

results be and where would they come from?

3

THE WITNESS:

4

I mean, I would say they're mainly from Bing at

5

Yeah.

that point.

6

Most searches, I think, now have modules on them.

7

And so, like, if you -- say my Google and Bing, if you

8

search almost any query, there's going to be other stuff on

9

the page.

10
11

So that's becoming a more rare experience.
But if you just have traditional links, we would

be getting those from Bing.

12

There are some changes, like I was saying, that

13

might be different.

14

they would display for themselves might be different because

15

of, say, like privacy.

16
17

There are also some other differences that there
might be, we have some flexibility around that.

18
19

The ones that Bing sends us and what

THE COURT:

And when you say "traditional links,"

I'm not -- can you expound on what you mean by that?

20

THE WITNESS:

21

Otherwise referred to as kind of the 10 blue

Yeah.

22

links.

23

when they think about search engines.

24

think about the modules, which is why I was talking about

25

them.

I think those are the links that people think about
They don't often

1971
1

And so I just mean like regular links to websites.

2

THE COURT:

3

as sort of organic --

4

THE WITNESS:

5

Right.

What we've been referring to

Organic links.

Yeah, that would be

a good term, yeah.

6

THE COURT:

All right.

7

All right.

Thank you.

8

All right.

So why don't we go ahead and then move

I appreciate that.

9

into closed session, and we'll ask if you are not associated

10

with any of the parties or with DuckDuckGo, to please exit

11

from the courtroom.

Thank you.

12

(Sealed closed session)

13

THE COURT:

All right, Counsel.

It's going to

14

take a -- we've got the courtroom connected to a media room

15

downstairs.

16

are with technology.

17

to get that line disconnected before we can proceed.

That's how -- that's about how sophisticated we
So it's going to take us a few minutes

18

THE WITNESS:

19

(Pause)

20

THE COURT:

Got it.

We're still waiting.

21

take a couple minutes.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

(Pause)

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

25

witness with a binder?

Sure.

It's going to

Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, may I approach the

1972
1

THE COURT:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

You may.
May I approach the bench,

Your Honor?

4

THE WITNESS:

5

THE COURT:

Can I look at this?

He'll direct you to certain documents

6

when he's ready.

7

(Pause)

8

THE COURT:

9

We're ready to go.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11
12

Sorry it's taking so long.

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

Mr. Weinberg, when we left off, I asked you if

13

DuckDuckGo had ever pitched to different browsers that

14

DuckDuckGo could be the default in their private browsing

15

mode.

16

Now, specifically let me ask you if DuckDuckGo

17

ever proposed to Apple that DuckDuckGo could be the default

18

in Safari's private browsing mode?

19

A

Yes, many, many times.

20

Q

And when did DuckDuckGo first make that pitch to

21

Apple?

22

A

23

Safari first.

24

happened in 2014.

25

So we had been trying to become a search option in
That took, itself, several years, and that

As I mentioned before, if you don't have a

1973
1

contract with Apple, you can't be a search option.

2

got that first search contract in 2014.

3

So we

Shortly after that, I believe even in 2014, we

4

started pitching this idea for a DuckDuckGo search and

5

private browsing mode.

6

We did it in 2014, '15.

7

our first kind of response back.

8
9

Our take was that they were actually really
interested in this.

10
11
12
13
14

I think in 2016, we got

The people we were talking to were generally
DuckDuckGo users themselves interested in privacy.
Q

Just so it's clear, the people you were talking to

at Apple were -A

At Apple, yeah.

15

So at that time, this was mainly Rhonda Stratton,

16

who became our partner, manager, at Apple, and Brian Croll,

17

who was an executive in product marketing.

18

kind of primary high-level contacts.

19
20
21

Those were our

They both were DuckDuckGo users, deeply interested
in privacy, thought this was a good idea.
From those conversations, we kind of identified

22

Craig Federighi was the executive, the main -- highest level

23

project executive.

24

THE COURT:

25

THE WITNESS:

I'm sorry, what was the name?
Craig Federighi.

1974
1
2

He's -- I'm not sure exactly their titles.
like an SVP on their main leadership page.

3
4

He's

They -- so we tried to push to get a meeting with
him, really to pitch this.

5

That did occur in 2017.

6

Q

And where did this meeting in 2017 take place?

7

A

It took place -- most all our meetings took place,

8

including this one, at Apple headquarters because, you know,

9

that was before Apple Park so it was like in the main

10

Cupertino place.

11

Q

12
13
14

Okay.
And do you remember what month of 2017 this

meeting took place?
A

15

Yeah, it was in October.
Generally we had been coming back once a year

16

around that.

17

releasing iPhones and iOS and Mac iOS.

18

in September.

19

about what they're going to do in the fall.

20

hurriedly program it in the spring.

So they have a yearly cycle of their -- of
And so it comes out

They announce things in June.

They think
And then they

21

And so we tried to come back in the fall and kind

22

of make our pitch at the time when they were thinking about

23

roadmapping for the next cycle.

24
25

Q

So now we're talking about a meeting at Apple

headquarters in Cupertino in October 2017.

Can you tell me

1975
1

who you recall notable from Apple that attended this

2

meeting?

3

A

4

Yeah.
I mean, it was a big meeting.

We were in a really

5

big conference room, so we did get the meeting with Craig.

6

There were other -- a bunch of other executives

7

there.

8

longtime Apple person.

9

original Macintosh team.

10

fellow executive type.

11
12

Bud Tribble I remember being there.

He's a very

I think he was on, like, the
So he's kind of like a senior

The head of Safari was there at the time,
Darin Adler.

13

Brian Croll was there.

14

I believe there were some Siri folks there that we

15

never saw again, so I don't remember who they are.

16
17
18
19

And some people from privacy, too.
Q

And what do you recall the substance of this

October 2017 meeting at Apple headquarters to be?
A

20
21

Rhonda, who I mentioned.

So -MR. SAFTY:

Your Honor, objection to the extent

this is eliciting hearsay testimony.

22

THE COURT:

I think he was just asking generally

23

what the subject was.

I don't think he asked what anybody

24

said.

25

Go ahead.

1976
1

THE WITNESS:

Yeah, so we were -- we essentially

2

wanted to level up our pitch because we hadn't been

3

successful yet, and so we were hoping to make the most

4

compelling pitch we could to Craig.

5
6
7

So we did -- we basically did two things in our
pitch that we hadn't done before.
One is, I mentioned -- you had asked me previously

8

about private browsing research we did.

9

motivation for that was for -- for these and other meetings

10

like this.

So part of the

11

And in particular, we segmented the data by Apple

12

users so we could specifically tell Apple what their users

13

thought about private browsing mode, what they expected from

14

it, you know, do they want it, private search for private

15

browsing, et cetera, and that data was pretty compelling

16

from our perspective so we put that up.

17

The second part of our pitch was, we thought we

18

could, in partnership with them, make DuckDuckGo the best

19

search option on Apple devices for Apple users by

20

integrating their content into search modules.

21

example, in particular, we had pitched Apple News, Apple

22

Maps, Apple Music, Apple TV.

23

And so, for

And if you think about like maps for a second, if

24

you go on Google, you get Google Maps.

25

user and like Apple Maps, you would prefer to see Apple Maps

If you're an Apple

1977
1

for a couple reasons.

2

One is, when you click into the Apple Maps, it's

3

going to be seamless, it's going to look the same.

4

not just that it looks the same, it's like different

5

directions, points of interest can differ.

6

much more seamless appearance if the search modules match

7

the apps you're going to click in.

8

And it's

So it's just a

And same for music, TV, news, et cetera.

So our

9

general pitch was, Work with us, let's incorporate all of

10

Apple content into the search engine, and it will be a more

11

compelling search experience overall.

12

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

13

Q

14

went?

15

A

16

And what was your impression of how this meeting

My impression of the meeting is it went very well.
I mean, so I've pitched lots of things to Apple

17

over the years.

18

basically silence.

19

silences.

20

If there's no interest, their move is
I mean, there's lots of awkward

And so you have to, like, you know...
So this case, I actually had to move things along

21

because there was so much engagement.

22

the pitch about the content, I remember having to, like,

23

let's go talk about this because there was so much talk

24

about the private browsing.

25

The second half of

Craig in particular kind of led discussion from

1978
1

Apple's side, but, yeah, there were lots of discussions

2

around implementation, what implementation could look like,

3

about DuckDuckGo itself that people in the room weren't

4

totally aware of, like some of those questions like the

5

judge was asking me, like how exactly the results worked,

6

the search modules, et cetera.

7

Q

Okay.

8

And this October 2017 meeting that we were talking

9

about, did it lead to another meeting with Apple to discuss

10

options for Safari's private browsing mode?

11

A

12
13

Yeah.
So I would say we -- it kind of accelerated

everything.

14

Our general idea was, you know, we didn't think

15

Craig was going to be involved in everything day to day

16

because he had so much to do, but if he gave kind of

17

blessing to the team to go and figure this out, we could

18

then progress with the rest of the people in the room.

19

That's essentially what happened.

20

So we came back the next summer and --

21

Q

22

Cupertino?

23

A

24
25

And when you say "back," is that back to

Yeah, back to Cupertino.
And there had been talk about implementation.

And

so we flagged that as like we thought that was going to be a

1979
1

primary concern of theirs.

2

So when you say private search or private browsing

3

mode, that could mean a lot of different things the way it

4

looks and how users interact with it.

5

So we came back with a presentation that offered

6

several alternatives to give them some ideas.

7

would say, is also very visual.

8

what it's going to look like.

9

looks like in their product, so we tried to design it fully,

10

like take the full screens as to like something they

11

would do.

Apple, I

So they really want to see

They want to imagine what it

12

And so we offered several ideas for this, like a

13

drop-down, like we're the default but there's a drop-down

14

where you can change it, or you could toggle something that

15

said, like, you want to turn on private search or private

16

browsing when you open private browsing mode.

17

We offered one that was, like, you could activate

18

it.

19

educating consumers, and if you click "activate," it would

20

take you to a setting that you could toggle.

So there was, like, a message about private search

21
22
23

So we presented all of this basically at the
meeting.
Q

And I didn't get a chance to ask you but

24

do you remember any notable Apple executives at this meeting

25

in the summer of 2018?

1980
1

A

So the crowd for this was, again, Rhonda and Brian

2

and Darin, now, kind of picked up as another executive that

3

we worked on this with, also expressed to be a DuckDuckGo

4

user who was running Safari at that time.

5

Q

And when you say Rhonda, that's Rhonda Stratton?

6

A

Rhonda Stratton, yeah.

7

Q

Darin is Darin Adler?

8

A

Darin Adler, Rhonda.

9

I'd say at all of our meetings, there were other

10

Apple people there often, like, sometimes somebody from

11

privacy, sometimes somebody from legal.

12

because we also discussed things about our other privacy

13

technologies, so sometimes there's like API or extension

14

people there.

15

have been at this meeting.

16
17
18

Q

Sometimes --

Like, I remember John Davis, I think, might

And we're talking about this summer 2018 meeting.

What was your impression of how that meeting went?
A

My impression from this point on -- or our

19

impression was that they were really serious about a

20

potentially for the next year's release.

21

So this is 2018.

And part of the reason I think

22

that is we had been going back once a year basically, you

23

know, to Apple headquarters.

24

But Darin asked us in the meeting to come back

25

basically as soon as possible to brainstorm what privacy

1981
1

integrations could look like, including this one, kind of a

2

full integration of DuckDuckGo technology into Apple Safari.

3
4
5

And they also made references to roadmaps and
things like that.
Q

And you mentioned a presentation you prepared for

6

Apple for this summer 2018 meeting.

7

that presentation to Apple after the meeting?

8

A

Did DuckDuckGo send

Wouldn't have been me who did it, but that was our

9

protocol, was to send all our materials to the external

10

party after the meeting.

11

Q

And, Mr. Weinberg, I'll direct your attention to

12

the tab UPX0818 in your binder, and I'll ask Mr. Barkey to

13

display UPX0818 on the screen.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And, Your Honor, we have

15

DuckDuckGo's 902(11) declaration for this document but

16

I understand Google has a hearsay objection.

17

THE WITNESS:

18

see it on the screen.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

MR. SAFTY:

No objection to admitting this

22

THE COURT:

So UPX818 will be admitted.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

THE COURT:

21

25

I don't see it in the binder, but I

Okay.

exhibit.

binder?

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.

Do you not have it in your

THE WITNESS:

2

THE COURT:

3

THE WITNESS:

Would it be the tab?

It should be behind the tab, yes.

4

Yeah.

I don't see 818.
(Plaintiff's Exhibit UPX818
received into evidence.)

5
6

THE COURT:

Can you all just check and make sure

7

he's got the exhibit in front of him.

8

but...

9

THE WITNESS:

10

behind another tab.

11

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

12

Q

Now, I do see it.

I've got it.

Okay, great.

It's on the screen

It's hidden

My bad.

And you can use the binder or you

13

can use the monitor.

14

may be more interested in the monitor.

I'm guessing with your profession, you

15

A

Yeah.

16

Q

Do you recognize this document?

17

A

Yeah.

18

Q

And can you tell the Court what it is?

19

A

Sure.

20

This is kind of what he says.

This is a summary

21

of our meeting sent by Prakash who was leading this media

22

engagement -- business development engagement at the time.

23

Q

When you say Prakash, what is Prakash's last name?

24

A

Swaminathan, I think, is how you pronounce it.

25

Q

And attached to this email, was there the

1983
1

presentation that you described you prepared for Apple at

2

the summer 2018 meeting?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

So now I'll direct your attention to page 3 of

5

this document.

It has the Bates number ending in 552.001.

6

A

Yep.

7

Q

Do you recognize this document?

8

A

Yeah.

I mean, on the screen is Apple logo and the

9

DuckDuckGo logo.

We generally put this up at the beginning

10

of a presentation, you know, to be like let's work together

11

kind of thing.

12

Q

13

Okay.
And then I'll ask you to flip to the next page

14

which is Bates number ending 552.002.

15

recognize this page.

16

A

Yep, same thing.

I'll ask you if you

We put this at most of our

17

presentations to just reinforce that we feel similarly about

18

privacy.

19

Q

20
21

Okay.

And, finally, I'll ask you to turn to page 11 of
this exhibit which is 552.009.

22

And I'll ask you if you recognize these

23

depictions.

24

A

25

Thank you.

Yeah, these were the different implementations,

ideas I was referencing.

And then we kind of ended with the

1984
1

one we thought might be most appealing to them where we --

2

this is the way their private browsing mode looked at the

3

time.

4

so we would, in this idea, we would add this private search

5

piece underneath.

And so they had this explanation of it at the top and

6

Q

7

right now?

8

A

Are you talking about the phone screen on the left

Yes, phone screen on the left, where a user then

9

could understand, try to understand their search is more

10

private than private browsing mode unless they activated

11

private search and private browsing.

12

"activate," it would take them over to the OS operating

13

system search setting where there would be this toggle that

14

they could activate it.

15
16
17

Q

If they clicked

Can you describe for the Court what the phone

screen on the right depicts in this exhibit?
A

Yes, that is the Safari search engine setting

18

screen with our addition to it at the bottom where it says

19

private browsing mode, where you would be able to enable

20

private search and private browsing mode.

21
22
23
24
25

Q

So was this the way Safari appeared at the time of

your presentation or was this your proposal to Apple?
A

This was a proposal to Apple.
And I would say that we weren't -- we never

proposed them to use exactly what we did.

I mean, this is a

1985
1

depiction of what they could potentially do.

2

to give them visual ideas that they could take back and

3

think about how they wanted to do it.

4

Q

Okay.

Thank you.

We're trying

You can put that exhibit aside.

5

THE COURT:

6

Why was it designed this way or why did you

Can I ask you a question?

7

propose a design to, it looks like it would actually require

8

the user to activate it as opposed to having it already be

9

set as the default in privacy mode?

10

THE WITNESS:

We had already experienced some

11

conversations around some understanding that they wouldn't

12

do a default in private browsing mode because of their

13

Google contract.

14

something that would work.

15
16
17

And so we were already trying to get

THE COURT:

Thank you.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

So we were just talking about the presentation

18

that was prepared for the summer 2018 meeting.

19

summer 2018 meeting with Apple lead to another meeting with

20

Apple to discuss Safari's private browsing mode?

21

A

22

Did that

Yes.
So I mentioned Darin had asked us to come back

23

pretty much immediately and brainstorm how our integrations

24

could work.

25

for it.

And so we did that as soon as we could prepare

So we came back about a month and a half later, it

1986
1
2

was in September of that year.
Q

Okay.

3

So now we're talking about a September 2018

4

meeting that, again, is in Cupertino; is that right?

5

A

That's correct.

6

THE COURT:

7

THE WITNESS:

8

THE COURT:

9
10
11
12

I'm sorry, '18 or '19?
'18.

'18.

Okay.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:
Q

And what do you recall the substance of this

September 2018 meeting at Apple's headquarters to be?
A

So we -- it was really about -- you know, they had

13

asked us to give them all their ideas for what -- or give --

14

present ideas for how DuckDuckGo privacy technology could be

15

integrated into Safari and especially private browsing mode.

16

So we also produced a lot of other privacy

17

technology that kind of blocks different hidden trackers

18

across the web.

19

And if you think about when I -- when you

20

originally asked me about how DuckDuckGo works and we have

21

are these different privacy protections and they're on by

22

default, you know, the thought was if they offer this

23

privacy mode, maybe they could offer a lot more privacy

24

protection in addition to private search in this mode.

25

And what of all of our technology might they

1987
1

integrate.

2

So we came with a bunch of ideas, leading with the

3

private browsing one -- private search and private browsing

4

one, I mean, but also thinks about using our tracker

5

blocking list to kind of block hidden trackers on private

6

mode.

7

And so we covered all that.

Increasing encryption is another thing that we do.

8

And there was -- I seem to remember this meeting

9

because it was Darin's meeting and his team is mainly all

10

engineers, and so there were a few non-engineers there but

11

it was stacked with engineers who are just -- who talk very

12

differently.

13

speak, I would say.

14

focused, that kind of stuff.

15
16

Q

19

The more frank, more engineering

And, again, we're talking about this

September 2018 meeting at Apple headquarters.

17
18

I mean, I'm used to it, but not normally Apple

What was your impression of how this meeting went?
A

We were very excited about this meeting.
I mean, they expressed that they were -- it was

20

the first meeting where anyone had expressed they were

21

really considering this for the 2019 release, not just like

22

going to talk about it at a roadmap meeting but they're

23

trying to put it on the roadmap.

24

want to do it, which had never happened before.

25

They're interested, they

So we were coming out very excited.

1988
1

The -- I'd say they hadn't figured out the design

2

yet so we're still presenting the designs and talking about

3

that.

4

And they hadn't figured out, even with this design

5

or the designs they wanted to do, which they didn't really

6

tell us, how it would work with their Google contract.

7

Q

8

Okay.
So you said you were excited.

Despite the

9

excitement, did you leave the meeting thinking that Apple

10

had any concerns about implementing your proposal?

11

A

12

Yeah.
I mean, the explicit next step was, I mentioned

13

about the contract, was they were going to -- they had

14

identified pretty clearly that the people in the room could

15

not resolve this issue around their Google contract and that

16

the next step was they were going to go figure that out.

17

Q

18
19
20

Okay.
And you mentioned the Google contract a few times.

What do you understand to be the Google contract?
A

I understand what I'm referring to --

21

THE COURT:

22

Basis?

23

MR. SAFTY:

I'm sorry.

Objection.

To the extent it's calling upon the

24

witness to speculate about things that are beyond his

25

personal knowledge.

1989
1

THE COURT:

Well, I think he was asked about what

2

his understanding is.

He wasn't asked to speculate beyond

3

that, so...

4
5

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

If he's seen the Google

contract, that would be shocking.

6

THE COURT:

Well, I suspect he's not going to

7

quote the text of it, but has a general understanding of

8

what its terms are.

9

THE WITNESS:

10

What I'm referring to is -- I'm sure the contract

11

is even wider -- but the search portion of the contract and

12

allowing things to be or not be default.

13

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

14
15

Q

Did DuckDuckGo -- and, again, we're talking about

the September 2018 meeting.

16
17

I have not seen the Google contract.

Did DuckDuckGo prepare a write-up of the
September 2018 meeting with Apple?

18

A

You mean like internally?

19

Q

Yes.

20

A

Yeah.

21

I mean, we would typically make a write-up for all

22

major external meetings.

23

charge of the meeting usually -- we have multiple people go

24

in, so somebody there is actually in charge of listening and

25

taking notes, and they would write up what happened, next

So the person who's kind of in

1990
1

steps, all that kind of stuff.

2

Q

Was this a standard practice at DuckDuckGo?

3

A

Yes, standard practice and -- and now.

4

Q

Okay.

5

And what is the purpose of preparing these

6

write-ups?

7

A

8

Multiple reasons.
Make sure everyone's on the same page.

Make sure

9

we capture all the action items.

10

aren't there can be up-to-date on what happened because a

11

lot of people, like, for example, this, participated in this

12

presentation, couldn't actually go.

13

Q

14
15

Make sure people who

Okay.
And in what format are these write-ups prepared?

A

We use a software, a piece of software called

16

Asana, which is a project management tool that we organize

17

kind of the whole company around.

18

We don't -- we don't really use email.

19

anything you think would be in an email would be on Asana

20

instead.

21

we have that too, but this is more for permanent record and

22

conversation that everyone can see.

23

It's got threaded conversations.

So

It's not chat,

We're a distributed company, so it's important

24

that we write everything down, and people are in all

25

different time zones and most things are async in this

1991
1

company.

2

THE COURT:

When you say you are a distributed

3

company, what do you mean by that?

4

THE WITNESS:

We have been -- we've never -- we

5

have this mailing address, and you could call it our central

6

office, but we've been -- all of our team members have been

7

around the world since day one.

8

THE COURT:

9
10

Q

Okay.
Now, Mr. Weinberg, I'd ask you to turn in your

binder, or to look on the screen, at UPX0666.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

that.

15

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

16
17
18
19

Okay.

BY MR. HOFFMAN:

11
12

I see.

Q

And I'll ask Mr. Barkey to display

And I'll ask you, Mr. Weinberg, if you recognize

this document.
A

Yes, this looks to be the contemporaneous meeting

notes we're talking about from that meeting.

20

Q

The September 2018 meeting?

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

Okay.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

And, Your Honor, we have

24

DuckDuckGo's 902(11) declaration for this document as well.

25

And I understand that Google has an objection.

1992
1

MR. SAFTY:

Your Honor, we object to the

2

introduction to the extent that plaintiffs intend to rely on

3

the embedded hearsay for the truth of the matter;

4

specifically, statements purportedly made by Apple

5

employees.

6
7

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, do you intend to point

him to any out-of-court statements?

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

At the bottom of page 1, there's a paragraph that

10

begins with "Private browsing opt-in," and the statements in

11

here we're not offering for the truth of the matter but to

12

corroborate the conversations that DuckDuckGo had with

13

Apple, and to give a complete picture of the negotiations,

14

and then to show the effect that they had on Mr. Weinberg

15

and DuckDuckGo going forward.

16

MR. SAFTY:

I do, Your Honor.

Your Honor, if I may be heard on that

17

point?

18

They're offering it to corroborate the verbal hearsay that

19

he's been testifying about for the last 20 minutes.

20

They are offering it for the truth of the matter.

THE COURT:

Well, he hasn't actually testified

21

about any hearsay, Counsel, let's get that straight.

22

hasn't offered any statement from out of court that would

23

qualify as hearsay.

24
25

It's 12:25.
think about this.

He

Let's take our lunch break so I can

We'll return at 1:30.

1993
1

Mr. Weinberg, during the lunch break, I'll ask you

2

not to discuss your testimony with anyone other than speak

3

to your counsel, of course, and we'll see everybody at 1:30.

4

Thank you.
