EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Google Inc. ("Google") is the world's dominant Internet search engine and seller of 
search advertising. Staff has investigated several allegations of anticompetitive conduct by 
Google. Four of the five main areas are addressed by this memorandum, while Google's 
mobile conduct will be addressed in a supplemental memorandum. 
Staffs recommendations are premised on our conclusion that Google has monopoly 
power in three relevant antitrust markets in the United States: Horizontal Search; Search 
Advertising; and Syndicated S·earch and Search Advertising. 
First, Staff has investigated whether Google has unlawfully preferenced its own 
content over that of rivals, while simultaneously demoting rival websites. Complainants 
have alleged that this conduct has impaired their ability to compete effectively in the markets 
for general search and search advertising. Although it is a close call, we do not recommend 
that the Commission proceed on this cause of action because the case law is not favorable to 
our theory, which is premised on anticompetitive product design, and in any event, Google's 
efficiency justifications are strong. Most importantly, Google can legitimately claim that at 
least part of the conduct at issue improves its product and benefits users. 
Second, Staff has investigated whether Google has unlawfully ~'scraped/' or 
appropriated, the content of vertical rivals in order to improve its own vertical products. We 
conclude that Google's conduct should be condemned as a conditional refusal to deal under 
Section 2 because (i) Google's prior voluntary course of dealing with vertical rivals offers 
clear evidence that the relationship was mutually beneficial, (ii) Google's threats to remove 
rival content from its general web search results was designed solely to coerce rivals into 
allowing Google to user their content for Google's competing vertical product, and (iii) the

I 
natural and probable effect of Google's conduct is to diminish the incentives of vertical 
websites to invest in, and _to develop, new and innovative content. In the alternative, 
Google's conduct may be condemned as a stand-alone violation of Section 5. Google has 
presented no efficiency justification for its conduct. 
Third, Staff has investigated whether Google has employed anticompetitive 
contractual restrictions on the automated cross-management ofadvertising-campaigns. 
Google's main rival (Microsoft) has alleged that Google is denying Microsoft critical scale 
by employing these restrictions, and thus impairing Microsoft's ability to compete effectively 
in the markets for general search and search advertising. We conclude that these restrictions 
should be condemned under Section 2 because they limit the ability of advertisers to make 
use of their own data, and as such, have i~duced innovation and increased transaction costs 
among advertisers and third-party businesses, and also degraded the quality of Google's 
rivals in search and search advertising. Google's proffered efficiency justification for these 
restrictions appears to be pretextual. 
Fourth,. Staff has investigated whether Google has entered into anticompetitive, 
exclusionary agreements with websites for syndicated search and search advertising services. 
We conclude that Google's agreements should be condemned under Section 2 because they 
foreclose some portion of the market, and, although the agreements result in only modest 
anticompetitive effects on publishers, the impact of the agreements in denying scale to 
competitors is both competitively significant to its main rival (Microsoft) today, as well as a 
significant barrier to entry for potential entrants in the longer term. While Google presents 
efficiency justifications for these agreements, on balance, Staff finds them to be non
persuasive.

 iii 
Staff has identified several possible remedies to Google's conduct. Specifically, for 
Google's scraping conduct, Google could be required to provide an "opt-out" feature to 
remove "snippets" of website content (i.e., user reviews, ratings) from. Google's vertical 
properties, while retaining the snippets in Google's web search results and/or its Universal 
Search results on the main search results page. Google could also be required to more 
generally limit the use of the content it indexes for its web search results. For Google's 
campaign management restrictions, Google could be required to remove the problematic 
contractual restrictions from. its license agreements. For Google's exclusionary syndication 
agreements, Google could be enjoined from. entering into exclusive agreements with search 
syndication partners, and required to substantially loosen restrictions surrounding syndication 
partners' use of rival search advertisements. 
There are a number of substantial risks associated with bringing a case against 
Google. Most notably, GooglewiH be able to argue that Microsoft's most efficient 
distribution channel is Bing.com.; and that any scale Microsoft might gain through the 
elimination of the challenged restrictions and agreements will be immaterial to improving 
Bing's competitive position. 
Nevertheless, Staff concludes that Google's conduct has resulted - and will result - in 
real harm. to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets. 
Therefore, Staff recommends that the Com.mission issue the attached com.plaint.

HISTORY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS 
A. 
FTC INVESTIGATION 
The Commission authorized the use of compulsory process in this investigation on 
June 13, 2011.1 Since then, the Commission has issued subpoenas to Google, Microsoft, and 
Yahoo!, along with multiple Internet content providers (such as Amazon, eBay, and 
NexTag), mobile device manufacturers (such as Apple, Motorola Mobility, and Samsung), 
and wireless carriers (such as Verizon and AT&T).2 
Over the course of Staffs investigation, we have received well over two million 
documents (over 9.5 million pages) in total- and have reviewed many thousands of those 
documents - from Google and a myriad of third parties. In addition, Staff reviewed 
documents produced to the Department of Justice in the Google-Yahoo! (2008) and ITA 
(2010) investigations, and documents produced in response to the ongoing investigations 
being conducted by the European Commission and a number of U.S. states (see below). 
Staff has also met with and interviewed dozens of parties, including vertical 
competitors in the travel, local, finance, and retail sectors; major U.S. advertisers and 
advertising agencies; many of Google's largest U.S. syndication and distribution partners; 
and mobile device manufacturers and wireless carriers. 
To date, Staff has conducted 17 investigational hearings of Google executives and 
employees, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, former CEO Eric Schmidt, chief 
economist Hal Varian, and other key executives spanning search, advertising, syndication, 
and mobile. 3

B. 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION INVESTIGATION 
The European Commission ("EC") has been conducting a parallel investigation of 
Google since November 2010. On May 21, 2012, Commissioner Joaquin Almunia issued 
Google a letter, signaling the EC's possible intent to issue a Statement of Objections ("SO") 
against Google for abuse of dominance in violation of Article 102 of the EC Treaty. The 
letter set out the EC's concern in four areas: (1) Google's "favourable treatment of its own 
vertical search services as compared to those of its competitors in its natural search results"; 
(2) Google's "practice of copying third party content" to supplement its own vertical 
offerings; (3) Google's "exclusivity agreements with publishers for the provision of search 
advertising intermediation services"; and ( 4) Google's "restrictions with regard to the 
portability and cross-platform management of online advertising,campaigns."4 
In his letter, Commissioner Almunia offered Google the opportunity to resolve the 
concerns prior to the issuance of an SO by coming forward "with a written description of 
possible solutions" to the EC's concerns.5 
On June 30, 2012, Google submitted a settlement proposal to the EC. Although 
Google denied any infringement of European Union ("EU") competition law, Google 
proposed to enter into several "commitments," designed to address the EC' s stated concerns. 6 
FTC staff has coordinated closely with EC staff throughout the course of our parallel 
investigations. Staff has received waivers from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and a handful of 
other parties to discuss and exchange information with the EC. Staff has had regular 
telephone calls with EC staff, where we have updated one another on theories and evidence. 
We have also exchanged documents of mutual interest.

C. 
MULTI-STATE INVESTIGATION 
Several states, including Texas, New York, California, Ohio, and Oklahoma have also 
been conducting a joint parallel investigation.7 Texas has been investigating Google since 
approximately June 2010, and is the leader of the multi-state working group. The other states 
joined the investigation more recently, in the summer of 2011. 
FTC staff has been working closely with the states, granting access to FTC 
documents, as well as conducting joint meetings and interviews of third parties. In addition, 
Staff has had regular telephone calls with the states, where we have updated the states on our 
theories, evidence, and investigational plan. We have also exchanged documents of mutual 
interest. Representatives from the states have attended FTC· staffs investigational hearings 
of Google executives. 
The states have not yet reached a conclusion as to whether to pursue litigation against 
Google.8 
D. 
PRIVATE LITIGATION 
Several private lawsuits have been brought against Google relating to the conduct at 
issue in Staffs investigation. All have been dismissed. 
The cases can be divided into two categories; those challenging manipulation of 
Google's search rankings,9 and those contesting increases in minimum prices for AdW ords 
search advertising.10 In both Kinderstart.com LLC v. Google, Inc., 11 and SearchKing, Inc. v. 
Google Tech., Inc., 12 plaintiffs alleged that Google unfairly demoted their websites on 
Google's search results page, which significantly impacted their businesses. In dismissing 
the plaintiffs claim, the SearchKing court found that Google's rankings were constitutionally 
protected opinion, and that even malicious manipulation of the rankings would not expose

Google to tort liability.l3 The Kinderstart court also dismissed the plaintiffs complaint, 
rejecting the claim that Google's search results were an essential facility for vertical 
websites, because Kinderstart had not been eliminated from the downstream market and 
continued to get high rankings from other search engines.14 
The AdW ords cases address a common fact pattern, but are decided on alternate 
grounds. Plaintiffs in these cases argued that Google increased the minimum bids for the 
keywords the website had purchased, which made those keywords effectively unavailable, 
thus depriving the plaintiff website of traffic. The complaint in TradeComet.com, LLC v. 
Google, Inc. 15 was dismissed for improper venue, while the allegations in Google, Inc. v. 
myTriggers.com, Inc. 16 were dismissed on grounds that they failed to describe harm to 
competition as a whole. Both cases were dismissed with little discussion of the merits. 
In Person v. Google, Inc., 17 Judge Fogel of the Northern District of California 
criticized the plaintiffs market definition, finding no basis for distinguishing the alleged 
"search advertising market" from the larger market for Internet advertising.18 The Ninth 
Circuit affirmed the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to raise the 
allegations in its complaint beyond a speculative level, but did not address market 
definition.19 
II. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. 
THE PARTIES 
1. 
Google 
Google is an Internet search technology company, founded in 1998 and headquartered 
in Mountain View, California. Google's products and services include a general "horizontal" 
search engine, as well as numerous integrated "vertical" websites that focus on specific 
Obtained by POLITICO

content areas, such as product or shopping comparison, maps, finance, books, and video.20 
Google also sells search advertising through its AdWords program, as well as search and 
search advertising syndication services through its AdSense program. Additionally, Google 
offers computer and software applications, such as Google Toolbar ( a graphic user interface 
that is integrated into a browser and provides direct access to Google's search page from any 
web page), Gmail (Google's internet mail program) and Chrome (Google's Internet 
browser). Google also offers the Android operating system for mobile devices, along with a 
host of applications for those devices. In addition, Google recently completed its purchase of 
Motorola Mobility, which manufactures, among other things, mobile devices (including 
Android devices), and now owns a large portfolio of mobile patents.21 
Google employs more than 32,000 people worldwide,22 and had annual revenues in 
2011 of just under $38 billion.23 
2. 
General Search Competitors 
a. 
Microsoft 
Microsoft introduced its general search engine, MSN, in 1998,24 and rebranded it as 
Bing in May 2009.25 In 2011, Microsoft filed complaints with the FTC and with the EC, 
alleging that Google has unlawfully monopolized markets for search and search 
advertising. 26 
b. 
Yahoo! 
Like Google and Bing, Yahoo! - founded in 1994-offers a range oflntemet 
services.27 Since 2010, Yahoo! has maintained a search partnership agreement with Bing.28

Major Vertical Complainants 
Staff has met with, interviewed, and subpoenaed numerous vertical websites offering 
shopping, travel, local, and financial services. We identify here some of the main 
complainants. In general, these companies complain that Google's practice ofpreferencing 
its own vertical results over the complainants' websites on Google's search page has 
negatively impacted the complainants' ability to compete for users and advertisers. 
a. 
Amazon 
Amazon is the world's largest online retailer, and also produces consumer 
electronics, notably the Amazon Kindle e-book reader and the Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon's 
product search feature competes with Google Product Search. 
b. 
eBay 
eBay operates an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses 
buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. eBay has expanded from its 
original "set-time" auction format to include "Buy It Now" standard shopping, and a variety 
of other services. eBay's product search feature competes with Google Product Search. 
c. 
NexTag 
NexTag is a shopping comparison website in the U.S. that competes with Google 
Product Search. 
d. 
Foundem 
Foundem is a shopping comparison website in the United Kingdom that competes 
with Google Product Search. We understand that Foundem was the first vertical website to 
publicly accuse Google of preferencing its own vertical content over that of competitors on

T 
I.:.. 
Google's search page. Foundem's complaint to the EC, among others, prompted the EC to 
open its investigation into Google's web search practices. 
e. 
Expedia 
Expedia is a travel website in the U.S. that books airline tickets, hotel reservations, 
car rentals, cruises, vacation packages, various attractions, and related services. Expedia 
competes with Google's fledgling Google Flight Search property. 
f. 
Trip Advisor 
TripAdvisor is a travel website in the U.S. that assists customers in gathering travel 
information, posting reviews and opinions of travel-related content, and engaging in 
· interactive travel forums. Users provide most of the content, including reviews. TripAdvisor 
competes with Google Local (formerly Google Places). TripAdvisor has complained that 
Google has appropriated, or "scraped," its user-generated reviews, placing them on Google's 
own local property.

Yelp is a user review and local search website in the U.S. Yelp contains listings for 
businesses, such as restaurants and shops, among other venues, and - like TripAdvisor - is 
largely built on user-provided content. Yelp has complained that Google has appropriated, or 
"scraped," its user-generated reviews, placing them on Google's own local property. 
4. 
Facebook 
Facebook is the preeminent U.S. social networking site, founded in 2004, with over 
900 million users as of May 2012.31 While Facebook does not fit the traditional mold of 
vertical complainant, it has played a considerable role in shaping Staffs views of the relevant 
markets and of Google's conduct within those markets. Facebook competes with Google's

recently introduced social networking site, Google Plus. Facebook has complained, among 
other things, that Google's preferencing of Google Plus results over Facebook results on 
Google's search page is negatively impacting its ability to compete for users. 
B. 
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
1. 
General Search 
The Internet is a vast, largely unorganized collection of constantly changing 
information. If the Internet can be roughly analogized to a huge and highly dynamic library, 
then algorithmic search engines are the card catalog. 
Unlike a traditional library, the Internet is too large and changes too rapidly for 
traditional cataloging. 32 Instead, search engines (like Google) deploy computer programs 
that constantly "crawl" the web, building and updating automated indexes of web content. 
Similarly, the process of finding relevant information inside these web indexes is automated. 
Sophisticated algorithms evaluate the content of the end user's request for information to 
determine which parts of the web index may contain relevant responses. The identified 
potential responses are then ranked by additional algorithms based on the predicted 
likelihood of their relevance, and displayed to the end user in response to his or her query. 
Critically, all of this complex activity occurs rapidly and automatically, without any direct 
human intervention. 
As users search for information on the Internet, they necessarily provide the search 
engine with valuable information - the precise topic users are interested in at that moment. 
Although a user does not pay for the web search service, the user's focused interest - or 
intent - is very valuable to advertisers, because users are effectively identifying themselves 
as potential customers through the content of their queries. For example, a business selling

 8 
r 
L 
r 
camping equipment can, with the search engine's assistance, advertise just to those users who 
type the query "new tent" into the search engine. Thus, in a sense, the user is both a 
consumer of the product and the product itself. 
Today, there are two broad categories of search engine. A "horizontal" ( or general) 
search engine, such as Google, allows users to enter any text string as a search request, and 
returns a comprehensive list of search results regardless of topic. By contrast, a "vertical" 
search engine (sometimes referred to as an "aggregator") focuses on a specific category of 
content, such as consumer products (e.g., NexTag) or travel (e.g., Expedia), and only accepts 
and returns results for search queries within that narrow category. 33 
Vertical search engines, even in aggregate, are not a complete substitute for 
horizontal search engines due to the limited pool of information they contain. However, 
vertical search engines do offer potentially attractive alternatives to advertisers, because 
visitors to vertical properties routinely express the same kind of focused commercial interest 
(e.g., "Nikon camera" or ''flights to San Diego") that is expressed by users of a horizontal 
search engine.

Online Advertising 
Search engines earn revenue from the sale of advertising. Online advertising has 
emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional advertising formats, such as print and 
broadcast media. 34 
Google's "core business" is search advertising (through its AdWords platform).35 
Google earned 96 percent of its nearly $3 8 billion in revenues last year from the sale of

advertising. 36 The growth of the Internet has created entirely new business models that can 
take advantage of ways, unique to the Internet, to identify and reach potential customers with 
advertising. 37 Among the reasons advertisers have shifted budget online is the high degree of 
tracking possible and the quantifiable, superior return on investment.38 
Online advertising is primarily made up of display and search advertising, although 
some other types of advertising (e.g., contextual, re-targeted display, and social media 
advertising) also have some presence. Display advertising typically consists of banner ads 
containing graphics and other rich media appearing on white space on a web page. Search 
advertising consists of text ads (displayed on the right-hand side of the search results page, at 
the top of the page above the search results, and below the search results) matched to specific 
keyword queries entered into the search engine by the user. 
Search advertising makes up the bulk of online advertiser spend, primarily because 
advertisers believe that search advertising provides unprecedented precision in identifying 
potential customers, measurability, and the highest return on investment.39 Simply put, "it is 
the most effective marketing ever."40 Search advertising is highly valued by advertisers 
because they learn crucial information about the user from the query alone: they learn that 
the user is interested in a particular subject, right now.41 Thus, search advertising is a highly 
effective method of re.aching users who are interested in learning about or purchasing 
products. Search advertising is often called "direct response" advertising, as it "is intended 
to elicit a response from a consumer, such as the purchase of a product or signing up for a 
service."42 
With pure display advertising, all the advertiser knows about the user is that he or she 
is viewing a particular web page (similar to the information an advertiser may have about a 
Obtained by POLITICO
r 
l 
television audience, for example), with no information about the user's present intent. 
Display ads are not targeted enough to be as effective as search at eliciting direct responses 
from its audience. Thus, the primary purpose for display advertising is to build brand 
awareness.43 
Online advertising continues to evolve, and new offerings have appeared that do not 
fit squarely into the traditional search and display categories. Contextual advertising places 
display ads on web pages containing content relevant to the ad.44 For example, a user 
reading an article about Jamaica in the travel section of the New York Times website may see 
advertisements relating to Jamaica and travel.45 Re-targeted ( or behavioral) advertising 
allows an advertiser to target users with display ads based on the user's browsing history.46 
Social media advertising is another emerging ad platform that allows more focused targeting 
of ads, in this case based on user interests as identified by the social media platform (e.g., 
things that a user "likes" in Facebook).47 These newer ad products do not account for a 
significant portion of online advertising, and, today, with the exception of social media 
advertising, appear to have only limited potential for growth.48 
3. 
Syndicated Search and Search Advertising 
In addition to providing general search and search advertising services through their 
own websites, general search engines also "syndicate" their search or search advertising 
platforms to other websites and website publishers. Thus, when a user goes to a website 
such as AOL or Askcom, he or she can run searches on that website through a search box, 
which is "powered" by a search provider, such as Google (through its AdSense platform). 
A number of advantages flow to both the search provider and the website publisher 
from this arrangement. The publisher keeps the user on its own website rather than watching

the user leave to go to a dedicated search website like Google or Bing; the search provider 
picks up incremental search volume, as some users will not bother to run a search if they 
have to leave the publisher's website to do it; and, most importantly, the resulting search 
traffic can be monetized through search advertising in the same way as a search run on 
Google or Bing. 
The process works very similarly to a web search conducted on Google. Google 
receives queries from the third-party website, evaluates them against a subset of its web 
index, and then delivers web search results to the user on the third-party publisher's 
website.49 As with web search on Google.com, the consumer pays for none of these services. 
Instead, publishers pay Google for syndicated search either on a cost-per-user-query basis 
(for example, $.95 per 1,000 queries), or by accepting search advertisements from Google 
and splitting the revenues from the search advertisements run on the publisher's website. 
The resulting revenue sharing arrangement is often referred to as the "traffic acquisition cost" 
( or "TAC"). 
Publishers are generally able to select the web search and search advertisement 
syndication services separately or together. Thus, publishers that do not wish to offer web 
search generally (or Google's web search, specifically) can - and do -participate in 
Google's AdSense prngram to receive search advertisements without the corresponding web

Mobile Search51 
In recent years, the focus of search ( and related advertising) has begun shifting from 
the traditional desktop model to the rapidly emerging - and lucrative - frontier of mobile ( or 
"smartphone") devices. At the forefront of this shift is Google's mobile operating system,

l 
f 
Android,52 which has - in a few short years - eclipsed Apple's iPhone in the number of U.S. 
smartphone subscribers. 53 Smartphones have transformed the way that users interact with 
their mobile phones and led to a dramatic growth in mobile web usage. As smartphone usage 
has increased, so has the availability of mobile search and other mobile applications. 
Moreover, because smartphones are equipped with GPS technology, smartphone usage has 
created opportunities for advertisers to target users with location-based search ads, which 
have the ability to target a user's present intent even more precisely than desktop search ads. 
Google and others have undertaken significant efforts to expand their search and 
search advertising capabilitie~ into the mobile sphere through distribution agreements with 
mobile device manufacturers and wireless carriers. As a result of such agreements, when a 
user purchases a mobile device, that device typically comes pre-installed with search 
functionality, along with a number of other applications. 
C. 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SCALE IN INTERNET SEARCH 
"Scale" - both user queries and advertising volume - is important to the competitive 
dynamics of Internet search. Microsoft asserts a need for greater scale on two fronts. 
1. 
Search Query Volume 
Microsoft asserts that it requires additional search query volume in order to improve 
the quality of Bing's search algorithms. Additionalq~ery volume can be used to improve the 
quality of a search engine's algorithms in a number of ways: logs of user queries are used to 
help improve the quality of answers to "tail" - or rarely seen- queries generally,54 and to 
improve specific features of the search engine, such as "instant" search results, 
"suggestions," and "spell correct."55 User queries can also be used to identify trends (for 
example, fresh news stories). 56

( 
[ 
In addition, click data (the website links on which a user actually clicks) is important 
for evaluating the quality of the search results page. As Google's former chief 9f search 
quality Udi Manber testified: 
The ranking itself is affected by the click data. If we discover that, for a 
particular query, hypothetically, 80 percent of people click on Result No. 2 
and only 10 percent click on Result No. 1, after a while we figure out, well, 
probably Result 2 is the one people want. So we'll switch it.57 
Testimony from Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt confirms that click data is important for many 
purposes, including, most importantly, providing "feedback" on whether Google's search 
algorithms are offering its users high quality results. 58 
Finally, search providers run experiments on large volumes of users. Search engines 
conduct experiments on everything from ranking of search results to user interface and 
design decisions. 59 As Larry Page and Sergey Brin stated in their 2005 annual letter to 
shareholders: 
Our teams are more productive once they get real users and feedback. We 
have learned that the best way to make something great is to actually launch it 
to the public. That's why we have the Google Labs and 'beta' labels - these 
are our experiments. 60 
Multiple experiments are conducted simultaneously.61 The more search users there are at any 
given time, the more experiments can be run, the faster they can be completed, and the more 
improvements that can be made to the search algorithms.62 According to Microsoft chief 
economist (and Harvard professor) Susan Athey, Microsoft's search quality team is greatly 
hampered by having insufficient search volume to conduct experiments.63 
With improved search quality, particularly for "tail" queries, Bing asse1is that it will 
be better positioned to compete with Google for users (and, thus, for advertisers), and so to 
Obtained by POLITICO
 14 
constrain the exercise by Google of monopoly power.64 In 2009, Google's former head of 
search quality Udi Manber explained: 
The bottom line is this. If Microsoft had the same traffic we have their quality 
will improve *significantly*, and if we had the same traffic they have, ours 
will drop significantly. That's a fact.65 
2. 
Advertising Volume 
· Microsoft also asserts that it requires additional advertising volume in order to 
improve the relevance and quality of the search advertising it serves to users. More 
advertisements help to improve the relevance and quality of the ads served for several 
reasons: with greater volume, a search engine has more choices of which ads to serve to 
users;66 there is more coverage of queries (i.e., a larger perc·entage of queries will actually 
return search results pages with advertisements);67 and- similar to the user feedback loop on 
search queries - increased user engagement (that is, users clicking on more ads) educates the 
ad-serving algorithms on what advertisements to serve, how to rank those advertisements, 
and how to price them.68 An increase in quality, and thus click-through rate, typjcally 
increases the "conversion rate" of advertisements,69 and thus, an advertiser's return on 
investment ("ROI"), which means that advertisers are more likely to invest, and re-invest, in 
that advertising platform.70 
An increased volume of advertisers ( and advertisements) on a platform also means 
increased competitiveness for advertising opportunities and, thus, more revenues for the 
search engine.71 This, in turn, means that the search engine can do two things: amortize its 
costs and re-invest in its own capabilities, 72 and provide greater advertiser coverage, and 
thus, revenues (through revenue-sharing agreements) to its syndication partners (website 
publishers).73 Greater revenues to publishing partners, in turn, attracts additional publishers,

 15 
and - importantly - also serves to attract more advertisers, that, generally speaking, prefer 
their advertisements to reach as broad an audience as possible. 74 
In sum, Bing asserts that a larger volume of advertisements - and the improved 
coverage, quality, conversion rates, and revenues that come from such an increased volume 
will allow it to better compete with Google for both advertisers and website publishers, and 
so to constrain the exercise by Google of monopoly power. 
3. 
The Scale Curve 
Google acknowledges the importance of scale in the abstract. Google documents are 
replete with references to the "virtuous cycle" among users, advertisers, and publishers; 75 
and testimony from Google executives confirms the continuing viability of the "cycle."76 
However, Google argues that, while scale matters, it only matters up to a point, beyond 
which there are substantially "diminishing returns" to increasing volumes of both queries and 
advertisements.77 For example, Sergey Brin testified that a "rough rule of thumb" might be, 
as query volume doubles, a search engine might expect to see a one percent increase in 
quality.78 
Google argues that Bing's query and advertiser volume have passed the point at 
which scale should - or would - matter significantly to Microsoft, and that any volume gains 
made by Bing would yield minimal improvements in either Bing's search quality or its 
monetization ability.79 Microsoft does not dispute the notion that there are generally 
diminishing returns to scale. 80 The main bone of contention between Google and Microsoft 
is where on this scale curve Microsoft currently operates. This is an important question, but 
one which evades easy answers. This is, in part, because neither party can identify a fixed 
number of queries or ads that constitutes the "minimum efficient" point of operation. 
Obtained by POLITICO
 16 
As the Internet grows, 81 and as both Google and Bing increase in size, the relative 
scale gap may matter more than either party's absolute size. Microsoft chief economist 
Susan Athey notes that, where firms compete on the basis of quality, with increased scale 
returning dividends - not just in user engagement, but also in ad dollars, monetization, and 
publisher participation, all feeding back into user engagement (recall "the virtuous cycle")
the relative gap in quality and monetization matters far more than any minimum volume 
threshold.82 In short, Athey asserts: "the fact that Bing's scale is similar to Google's five or 
six years ago does not alleviate the challenge faced by Bing in competing with Google at this 
moment in time."83 
Neither party can provide a precise quantification of the issue.84 • However, Microsoft 
asserts that even a 5 to 10 percent increase in query traffic would be "very meaningful" to 
Microsoft because Bing is at the lower part of the scale curve where "each percentage point 
is critical."85 Microsoft notes that, in 2010, when it gained access to Yahoo!'s query and 
advertising volume, Bing made significant gains in both search quality and monetization. 86 
For example, the influx of data from Yahoo! significantly improved Bing's "auto suggest" 
feature. From July 2010 (immediately preceding access to Yahoo!' s query volume) to 
September 2011 (following the incorporation ofYahoo!'s query volume), click rates for 
Bing's "auto suggest" feature increased from 44 percent to 61 percent, according to Susan 
Athey, "directly due to the addition of Yahoo! data into Bing's algorithms."87 Microsoft also 
claims that its search quality has improved as a result of the significant increase in the 
number of experiments Bing can run over Yahoo!' s user volume. 88 
In addition, Microsoft asserts that, in modeling the economic benefits it expected to 
receive from the addition ofYahoo!'s advertising volume into Microsoft's AdCenter

platform, it calculated that Bing would receive a 20 percent boost in revenue per search 
("RPS") on the basis of Yahoo! 's additional volume.89 Although Bing's RPS (and 
consequently, RPM) has improved with the addition of Yahoo! query and ads volume, it has 
not improved as substantially as Microsoft initially forecast.90 
In this investigation, the question of how and why scale matters has taken a 
prominent position in several allegations advanced by complainants: specifically, whether the 
conduct under review denies Google's main competitor-Microsoft-the scale it needs to 
successfully constrain Google's monopoly over search and search advertising. These 
allegations are discussed in detail in the following section. 
D. 
GOOGLE'S SUSPECT CONDUCT 
Staff has conducted a comprehensive investigation into several areas of alleged 
anticompetitive conduct. Below, we lay out four of the five main areas of Staffs 
investigation.91 
1. 
Google's Preferencing of Google Vertical Properties Within Its 
Search Engine Results Page ("SERP") 
Staff has investigated whether Google is unlawfully preferencing its own vertical 
properties, while demoting rival vertical properties, in order to maintain, preserve, or ~nhance 
Google's monopoly power in the markets for search and search advertising. Complainants 
allege that Google's conduct is anticompetitive because it forecloses alternative search 
platforms that might operate to constrain Google's dominance in search and search 
advertising. Although it is a close call, we do not recommend that the Commission issue a 
complaint against Google for this conduct.

Overview of Changes to Google's SERP 
Google makes frequent changes to both the user interface and the algorithms which 
control the content of its SERP. Some changes, such as changes that purportedly remove 
spam, are implemented unilaterally, with no user testing. 92 Other changes are implemented 
through a launch review process, which typically includes: (1) internal testing by Google 
engineers (in what Google has termed the "sandbox");93 (2) side-by-side ("SxS") testing by 
external raters, who compare the existing set of results with the proposed set of results for 
some sample set queries;94 (3) testing on a small percent (between 1 and 2 percent) oflive 
traffic;95 and ( 4) the preparation of a "launch report" for presentation to the Launch 
Committee. Once the launch report is presented to the Launch Committee, the proposed 
change is approved, rejected, or sent back to engineers for modification.96 
In 2010, Google claims to have conducted 10,000 "sandbox" tests, 8,000 SxS 
comparison tests, and 2,500 "live" click tests. Of the changes proposed and tested, 
approximately 500 algorithm changes were launched.97 Google's stated goal is to make its 
ranking algorithms better in order to provide the user with the best experience possible.98 
b. 
Google's Development and Introduction of Vertical 
Properties 
Google launched its various vertical properties in stages, dating back to 
approximately 2001, with the introductions of Google News, Froogle (shopping), Image 
Search, and Groups.99 For each vertical property, Google maintains separate indexes (also 
known as databases or corpora), in which it stores specific types of data.100 
Beginning around 2005, Google recognized that vertical search engines (i.e., 
"aggregators") in certain highly commercial categories posed a nascent "threat" to its 
dominance in general web search. Google feared that these websites offered users better

[ 
search capabilities within specific commercial categories, and thus might cause users to shift 
their searches in those categories away from Google's general web search platform. As users 
moved to vertical search websites, those websites could, in turn, become more attractive 
vehicles for advertisers, thus resulting in potentially significant revenue losses to Google. In 
short: 
Vertical search is of tremendous strategic importance to Google. Otherwise 
the risk is that Google is the go-to place for finding information only in the 
cases where there is sufficiently low monetization potential that no niche 
vertical search competitor has filled the space with a better alternative.101 
A 2008 presentation, entitled "Online Advertising- Challenges: Rise of the 
Aggregators," further highlights the problems faced by Google with regard to the leading 
UK-based finance vertical website, MoneySupermarket: 
Issue 1. Consumers migrating to MoneySupermarket. Driver: General 
search engines not solving consumer queries as well as specialized 
vertical search. . . . Consequence: Increasing proportion of visitors 
going directly to MoneySupermarket. . . . Google Implication: Loss of 
query volumes. 
Issue 2: MoneySupermarket has better advertiser proposition. Driver: 
MoneySupermarket offers cheaper, lower risk (CPA-based) leads to 
advertisers. Google Implication: Advertiser pull: Direct advertisers 
switch spend to MoneySupermarket/other channels.102 
Partly in response to this new competitive threat - the "rise of aggregators" - Google 
decided to hone in on certain "key" vertical search areas (shopping, local, finance, and travel) 
and invest in developing existing- or creating new-vertical properties.103 In certain areas 
where Google already had existing vertical properties, such as shopping and local, 104 Google 
saw a critical need to invest further and take measures to increase user traffic· to those 
properties.105 In potentially lucrative areas where strong verticals already existed and where

106 
The Evolution of Display of Google's Vertical Properties on 
the SERP 
Initially, Google provided tabs at the top of its website to permit users to search 
within each of its verticals. In 2003, then-director of consumer web products Marissa 
Mayer107 began to develop a new user interface called "Universal Search" to expose the 
content in these corpora to users directly on Google's SERP.108 As she wrote at the time: 
Universal Search is an effort to redesign the user interface of the main 
Google.com results page so that Google deliver[s] the most relevant 
information to the user on Google.com, no matter what corpus that 
information comes from. This design is motivated by the fact that very 
few users are motivated to click on our tabs, so they often miss 
relevant results in the other corpora. 109 
While the idea of "Universal Search" was proposed in 2003, Google did not launch 
Universal Search until 2007. In the interim, Google relied on "OneBoxes," which 
incorporated vertical content directly into Google's SERP via actual boxes that were set 
above the natural search results. If Google determined that a user query related to content 
from one or more of its vertical indices, Google sent the query to its indices, returned any 
relevant results, and displayed those results in OneBoxes on the SERP above any web 
links.110 
Google ultimately redesigned and launched its Universal Search results in May 
2007. 111 As part of the redesign, Google began sending queries to all Google indices to 
determine whether any of them had relevant results.112 Google then combined all of the 
results - from both its vertical indices and its general web search results - onto the SERP .113 
However, Google faced problems in ranking the Universal Search results against each other

[ 
and against its natural search results, because the web index and other indices all had their 
own ranking algorithms and scores.114 Google referred to the difficulty of comparing these 
ranking scores as an "apples to oranges" problem.115 Google did, however, frequently 
compare the quality of its vertical results to that of its competitors using other scoring 
methods. 116 
The verticals were initially placed in one of three locations: if Google deemed the 
vertical content to be highly relevant, it would go into position one, above the natural search 
results; if Google deemed the content somewhat relevant, it would go into position four ( or 
midway down the first page of natural search results); and if Google deemed the content only 
marginally relevant, it would go into position 10 ( or at the bottom of the first page of natural 
search results).117 In 2012, Google claims that it changed its algorithms to display Universal 
Search results in any position on the SERP, depending on the same initial relevancy 
screen.118 
A screen shot showing an example of a Universal Search result is provided on the 
next page.

information, listing Google Finance first. Below that, the SERP displays a Google News 
Universal Search result, with links to three articles. Next, Google includes its natural search 
results, i.e., a listing of links to websites ranked in order of relevance, as determined by 
Google's search algorithms.

Google's Preferential Display of Google Vertical Properties 
on the SERP 
Google utilized its control over the Google SERP both to improve user experience for 
searches and to maximize the benefit to its own vertical properties. First, Google sought to

maximize the percentage of queries for which it displayed Universal Search results.119 
Evidence shows that Google sought to increase such "triggering" of Universal Search results 
not only to provide users with the "right" answer to their queries, but also to drive traffic to 
Google properties. 120 Google recognized that the frequent display of its vertical properties on 
the SERP was necessary to drive traffic to its properties, and thus, grow user share in highly 
commercial areas such as shopping and local.121 Google continued to trigger Universal 
Search results frequently ~ and prominently - even when it determined that showing such 
results in the top position would "cannibalize" revenue from the top ads, as the company was 
willing to lose short-term revenue with the long-term goal of retaining and growing vertical 
search query share. 122 
Second, Google embellished its Universal Search results with photos and other eye
catching interfaces, recognizing that these design choices would help steer users to Google's 
vertical properties. 123 Third party studies show the substantial difference in traffic with 
prominent, graphical user interfaces. 124 These "rich" user interfaces are not available to 
competing vertical websites.125 Moreover, Google's Universal Search results often were not 
labeled as being provided by Google affiliated services, but were integrated directly into the 
search results. 
Third, Google displayed its Universal Search results at or near the top of the SERP.126 
This desirable positioning of Google's Universal Search results pushes all other web search 
results down, which significantly decreases click-through to the websites displayed in 
Google's natural search results.127 Google displays its Universal Search results in these 
prominent positions without comparing the quality of Google's vertical content to that of its 
vertical competitors, 128 or evaluating whether users would prefer to see Google's content or

the displaced web search results. Vertical search competitors have alleged numerous ways in 
which their content is superior to Google's verticals .129 
Preliminary analysis of click-through data collected by eBay indicates that, over the 
three-month period of January-April 2012, when Google Product Search was displayed on 
Google's SERP, it appeared in one of the top five positions 64 percent of the time. 130 
Notably, eBay's data shows that, for queries that returned Google Product Search at any 
position on the page, Google Product Search received a lower percentage of clicks compared 
to the web search result shown in the same position.131 For example, when an eBay result 
appeared in the first position in response to a shopping query, users clicked on that result 38 
percent of the time. Conversely, when Google Product Search appeared in the first position 
in response to a shopping query, users clicked on Google Product Search only 21 percent of 
the time. The full results of the eBay study are set forth below:132

Although Google tracks user click-through rates (and relies on such click-through 
data to improve its web search results in a number of ways, see supra p. 14), Google has not 
relied on click-through data to rank its Universal Search results against other web search· 
results.134 According to Marissa Mayer, Google did not use click-through rates to determine 
the position of the Universal Search properties because it would take too long to move up on 
the SERP on the basis of user click-through rate.135 
Rather than comparing its content with that of competitors, Google used the 
occurrence of competing vertical websites in its natural search results to automatically boost 
the ranking of its own vertical properties above that of competitors.136 For example, where 
Google's algorithms deemed a comparison shopping website relevant to a user's query, 
Google automatically returned Google Product Search - above any rival comparison 
shopping websites.137 Similarly, when Google's algorithms deemed local websites, such as 
Yelp or CitySearch, relevant to a user's query, Google automatically returned Google Local 
at the top of the SERP. 138 
Google also dedicates space at the top of its SERP to its social network vertical, 
Google Plus. Google provides links to Google Plus pages that might be relevant to a query 
on the right-hand side of the SERP, and "auto suggests" Google Plus pages for user queries, 
regardless of which social media sites are the most relevant, comprehensive, or have the. 
freshest results in response to any given user query.139 Google also displays prominent links 
to Google Plus pages when users make navigational queries to many companies' websites. 
For example, in response to the navigational query "Dell" a user is presented with the SERP 
shown on the next page.

The SERP shows a block of links to sites within Dell.com ( called a "megasitelink") at 
the top of the natural search results.140 In addition, the entire right hand column contains a 
link to Dell's Google Plus page with a prominent "Dell" logo.141 · Google displays no content 
or links to Dell's other social media content (such as Facebook or Twitter) that might be 
more relevant to the query in this prominent space, and, in combination with the 
megasitelink, any natural search links to those websites are pushed below the fold.142 
Most recently, in May 2012, Google converted all of its "Google Places" pages (now 
Google Local) to Google Plus pages, creating Google Plus pages for every business in its 
local results. All of Google's local Universal Search results now link to businesses' Google 
Plus pages. In order to write reviews or read full reviews on Google Local, users must open 
Google Plus accounts. 
Fourth, Google launched commission-based vertical properties -mortgage search, 
flight search, and offers143 - in ad space on Google's SERP that it reserved exclusively for its 
own properties. Google labeled these ads as "Comparison Ads" (mortgages), 144 "Ads"

(offers),145 or "Sponsored" (the new paid Google Shopping ads),146 and other times provided 
no label (flight search).147 In May 2012, Google announced that its shopping property, 
Google Product Search - which will now be known as Google Shopping - will be 
transitioned to a paid listing model in the fall of 2012.148 Under the paid model, merchants 
will pay Google directly to appear in Google Shopping, and Google will no longer include 
product listings for merchants who do not pay for placement.149 
Google's dedicated ads do not compete with other ads through Google's AdW ords 
auction for placement on Google's SERP. Instead, they enjoy automatic placement in the 
most effective advertising places on the SERP, usually above the natural search results.150 
Google also does not compare the quality of its own ads to the quality of competitors' ads 
that provide the same vertical service. For example, although it displays its flight search 
above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most 
flight options for travelers.151 As with Google's Universal Search results, Google's rich user 
interfaces for its ads-based vertical offerings, which are unavailable to competitors, lead to 
higher clicks for Google's ads.152 
e. 
Google's Demotion of Competing Vertical Websites 
While Google embarked on a multi-year strategy of developing and showcasing its 
own vertical properties, Google simultaneously adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to 
display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories. According to 
Google, the company has targeted for demotion vertical websites that have "little or no 
original content," or that contain "duplicative" content.153 
Similarly, Google has identified comparison shopping websites as undesirable to 
users, and has developed several algorithms to demote these websites on its SERP. Through

L 
an algorithm launched in 2007, Google demoted all comparison shopping websites beyond 
the first two on its SERP.154 And, in 2011, Google's heavily-publicized "Panda" algorithm, 
purportedly aimed at eliminating "low quality" sites, 155 demoted a large number of 
competing vertical websites, including - once again - comparison shopping websites. This 
algorithm had the effect of undoing the 2007 algorithm, no longer automatically "saving" the 
two highest-ranked comparison shopping websites. Instead, Google manually selected 
websites that would be "whitelisted" out of the demotion. Comparison shopping websites 
that had been previously returned (under the "two most popular" calculation) could now be 
demoted off of the SERP, while less high-ranking sites that had been previously demoted 
might now be "whitelisted" by Google and appear more highly ranked. 156 
Google's own vertical properties (inserted into Google's SERP via Universal Search) 
have not been subject to the same demotion algorithms, even though they might otherwise 
meet the criteria for demotion.157 Google has acknowledged that its vertical websites provide 
auto-generated "aggregations'·' of web search information without offering any original 
content, 158 and that they are - essentially - "search results within search results,"159 exactly 
the kind of websites Google's search quality algorithms seek to demote.160 Indeed, Google's 
web spam team refused to add Frooglesearch result pages (i.e., those pages listing products 
responsive to a query) in Google's web index because "[ o ]ur algorithms specifically look for 
pages like these to either demote or remove from the index."161 The same team also refused· 
to index Google's local property.162 
Generally, Google creates very little original content for its vertical properties, 
essentially copying, or "scraping," its content from other sites. Google has launched several

algorithms that demote sites that "scrape a large percentage of their content from other 
sites."163 These algorithms are not applied to Google vertical sites. 
Google's vertical properties would rank poorly if they were crawled and indexed by 
Google because they have never been "engineered" for ranking by the search engine.164 
Unlike Google's vertical competitors, who expend considerable resources on optimizing their 
websites in order to rank highly on Google's SERP, Google does not expend the time and 
resources to optimize its own vertical properties; it simply places them on the SERP. 
f. 
Effects of Google's SERP Changes on Vertical Rivals 
Vertical websites, such as comparison shopping and local websites, are heavily -dependent on Google's web search results to reach users.165 Thus, Google is in the unique 
position of being able to "make or break any web-based business."166 
Google's prominent placement and display of its Universal Search properties, 
combined with the demotion of certain vertical competitors in Google's natural search 
results, has resulted in significant loss of traffic to many competing vertical websites. Data 
from various comparison shopping and other competing websites shows drops in traffic that 
correlate to changes implemented by Google to its SERP.167 Google's internal data confirms 
the impact, showing that Google anticipated significant traffic loss to certain categories of 
vertical websites when it implemented many of the algorithmic changes described above.168 
While Google's changes to its SERP led to a significant decrease in traffic for the 
websites of many vertical competitors, Google's prominent showcasing of its vertical 
properties led to gains in user share for its own properties.169 For example, Google's 
inclusion of Google Product Search as a Universal Search result took Google Product Search 
from a rank of seventh in page views in July 2007 to the number one rank by July 2008.170 
Obtained by POLITICO
 30 
L 
Google product search leadership acknowledged that "[t]he majority of that growth has been 
driven through product search universal."171 By June 2010, 85 percent of the traffic to 
Google Product Search was clicked through from the Product Universal.172 
Beyond the direct impact on traffic to Google and its rivals, Google's changes to its 
SERP have led to reduced investment and innovation in vertical search markets. For 
example, as a result of the rise of Google Product Search (and simultaneous fall ofrival 
comparison shopping websites), N exTag has taken steps to reduce its investment in this 
area.173 Google's more recent launch of its flight search product has also caused NexTag to 
cease development of an "innovative and competitive travel service."174 
2. 
Google's "Scraping" of Rivals' Vertical Content 
Staff has investigated whether Google has "scraped" - or appropriated-the content 
of rival vertical websites in order improve its own vertical properties so as to maintain, 
preserve, or enhance Google's monopoly power in the markets for search and search 
advertising. 175 We recommend that the Commission issue a complaint against Google for 
this conduct. 
As Google developed its own vertical properties, in addition to displaying them 
prominently on its SERP, Google also began "scraping" content - that is, reproducing 
content without permission- from already-popular vertical websites (e.g., Yelp and 
TripAdvisor in local; Amazon in products) in order to improve its own vertical offerings. 176 
Google recognized that, when first launching certain vertical properties, it could compete 
most effectively by using product information, rankings, locations, and user reviews from 
vertical competitors.177

Google considered several options for obtaining information for display on its own 
vertical properties: developing its own content; obtaining licenses from other content 
creators; and obtaining content by crawling the world wide web (in the same way that 
Google crawls the world wide web for its general web index). Ultimately, Google settled on 
a combination of all three of these alternatives. 
Much of Google's vertical content is currently obtained through feeds from various 
websites, pursuant to free licenses from those sites for Google to use that data. Google's 
standard license agreement allows Google to use third parties' data feeds for any purpose. 178 
Many website publishers, such as Shopzilla, have agreed to these terms because they believe 
they do not have the leverage to negotiate with Google regarding the terms of their licenses, 
because they want the benefits of appearing in Google's vertical. 179 
In addition to the feeds it receives, Google's use of crawled content is pervasive. 
Indeed, the content of any website that Google crawls for indexing purposes (for Google's 
web search) may be used by Google for any of its vertical search properties.in a number of 
different ways. For example, Google has often included "snippets" (or excerpts) of user 
reviews from local or shopping properties on its own vertical properties. Google also uses 
the rankings of various businesses or products to aid its own determination regarding the 
order in which those businesses or products should be ranked within its own vertical 
properties. For example, Google calculates the popularity of a product for the purpose of 
ranking it in Google Product Search based on three factors: (1) Amazon Sales Rank; (2) the 
number of merchants offering the product for sale; and (3) the quality of those merchants. 180 
Because Amazon did not provide competitively sensitive information such as Amazon Sales

r 
\ 
l 
Rank to Google through its product feeds, Google obtained the information from its crawls of 
Amazon's website.181 
As discussed earlier, many vertical websites are heavily dependent on Google for 
their user traffic, and therefore must allow Google to "crawl" their content.182 Most websites 
approve of Google's use of their content in Google's vertical properties because it leads to 
increased traffic to their websites.183 Google does not provide web publishers with any 
assurances regarding the ways in which it makes use of their data.184 
However, several third-party content providers have complained about Google's use 
of their content to build competing vertical properties that seek to displace the very websites 
Google has relied upon to build its properties. Google's "scraping" ofrival content in order 
to create and improve its own vertical offerings has come to the forefront in two main areas: 
local and shopping. 
a. 
The "Local" Story 
Some local information providers, such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and CitySearch, 
disapprove of the ways in which Google has made use of their content.185 Google uses third
party local content in three distinct areas: ( i) in its natural search results in response to user 
queries, where links to third parties are returned;· (ii) in its "local merge" interface, or the 
Universal Search interface that is located on Google's main SERP (generally above the 
natural search results), which includes "snippet" references to user- reviews and other content; 
and (iii) in its separate local property (Google Local), i.e., the web page users are taken to 
when they click on Google's Universal Search interface (and are taken to a separate web 
page).

For Google Local, Google needed photos, addresses, hours, and reviews. Google 
originally obtained this content through licenses with these websites. In late 2006, Google 
decided that it wanted more control over its local content.186 Google recognized that review 
content, in particular, was "critical to winning in local search," but that Google had an 
"unhealthy dependency" on Yelp for much of its review content.187 Google feared that its 
heavy reliance on Yelp content, along with Yelp' s success in certain categories and 
geographies, could lead Yelp and other local information websites to siphon users' local 
queries away from Google.188 
In order to acquire direct access to a large storehouse o'f user content, managers 
working on Google Local attempted to convince Google executives to purchase Yelp, but 
they were rebuffed.189 Instead, Google decided to launch a redesigned version of Google 
Maps, in which users could submit reviews directly to Google.190 
Google understood that the existence of a critical mass of user reviews (like. those 
users had already submitted to websites like Yelp and Trip Advisor) was important in 
attracting additional user reviews.191 Google also knew that its partners - such as Yelp and 
Trip Advisor-would be unhappy about Google's use of their content to collect Google's 
own content. 192 Indeed, upon learning of Google's intent to collect its own reviews and to 
develop this now-directly competing property, Yelp discontinued its data feed to Google, and 
asked Google to remove all Yelp content that Google featured on Google Local.193 
Initially, Google agreed to remove - and did remove - Yelp's content. However, 
after offering its own review site for more than two years, Google recognized that it had 
failed to develop a community of users - and thus,.the critical mass of user reviews - that it 
needed to sustain its local product.194 In an attempt to gain quick access to a large storehouse 
Obtained by POLITICO
 34 
of original content, and after unsuccessfully attempting to purchase Yelp, 195 Google changed 
its tactic. 196 
In April 2010, Google introduced Google Places results on its SERP .197 The listing 
for each business that came up as a search result linked the user directly to Google's Places 
page, with a label indicating that hundreds ofreviews for the business were available on the 
Places page (but with no links to the actual sources of those reviews).198 On the Places Page 
itself, Google provided an entire paragraph of each copied review ( although not the complete 
review), followed by a link to the source of the review, such as Yelp (which it crawled for 
reviews) and TripAdvisor (which was providing a feed). 
In July 2010, Yelp noticed what Google was doing - specifically, that Google had 
again begun featuring Yelp's crawled reviews in its local product, and that it was also 
including the number of Yelp reviews in Google's overall review count. Google was now 
featuring Yelp' s content without a license - or, indeed, any form of permission - from Yelp. 
Yelp immediately protested Google's use of Yelp reviews on this now clearly-competing 
website.199 
Around the same time, TripAdvisor also became concerned that Google's new local 
property was attempting to drive traffic to itself as a "destination site," rather than to 
TripAdvisor and the partners that actually supplied Google with all of its "original" 
content.200 When TripAdvisor' s license came up for renewal, TripAdvisor chose not to 
renew its license with Google.201 TripAdvisor did, however, continue to provide a feed to 
Google as it sought an amicable resolution to the situation.202 
After much internal discussion, Google implemented a new policy that essentially 
gave rival local websites - such as Yelp and TripAdvisor - a choice: allow their content to be

included in Google Places or not have their property appear in Google web search results at 
all.203 Critically, for Google, this meant that it could now force local websites - that needed 
access to Google's web search to reach users - to accede to Google's use of the large 
storehouse of reviews that Google's rivals had built in order to develop its own user base.204 
Indeed, Google almost simultaneously launched a new review_s-collection product 
Hotpot c
to ( again) try to solicit original user reviews, this time seeding it with reviews from 
third-party websites with no attribution. 205 Yelp, TripAdvisor, and CitySearch all complained 
to Google.206 All of these parties sought removal of their user review content from Google 
Places/Hotpot, as well as·the removal of their reviews from Google's aggregated review 
count on the main SERP.207 This time, however, Google told each company that if Yelp, 
TripAdvisor, and CitySearch wanted to have their content removed from Google 
Places/Hotpot, they would have to exclude their websites from being crawled by Google 
altogether, which meant complete exclusion from Google's SERP.208 This was not 
technically necessary - it was just a policy decision by Google.209 
Like many other vertical websites, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Citysearch relied heavily 
on Google's web search results to reach users, and thus could not risk removal_ from Google's 
web search index.210 Instead, they each attempted to negotiate with Google, seeking removal 
from Google Local (without simultaneous removal from Google's web search results), or at 
least a user interface that provided sufficient attribution of their content.211 
Facing what seemed to be an all-or-nothing choice, Yelp also began widely 
publicizing Google's refusal to remove Yelp content from Google Local (including filing a 
complaint with the Commission), and ultimately, in July 2011, sent Google a Cease and 
Desist letter.212 In its letter, Yelp clearly indicated that it expected to remain in Google web

search results, including the "local merge" Universal Search interface on the main SERP .213 
After receiving the letter (and while under investigation in both the U.S. and E.U.), then
Google executive Marissa Mayer responded to Yelp on July 21, 2011, stating that Google 
would partly accommodate the request by removing Yelp content from the Google Places 
pages, but that Google was also going to remove the content from the "local merge" interface 
on the SERP.214 
Although it previously claimed it was technically infeasible, Google did eventually 
agree to retain Yelp results in its web search results.215 However, Google continued to 
maintain that it was not technically feasible to remove Yelp content from Google Places, 
while leaving Yelp in the "local merge".interface on Google's main SERP.216 Staff believes 
that this assertion is false, as Google maintains numerous "blacklists" that keep content 
within Google's search index, and merely prevent the content from appearing in specific 
locations, such as Google Product Search.217 Mayer later admitted during her investigational 
· hearing that Yelp' s request was in fact technically feasible, but that Google feared that, by 
allowing websites to "opt out" of Google Places while remaining in the "local merge" on the 
main SERP, Google might open itself to liability by accidentally including a website that 
opted out.218 Yelp contends that Google's continued refusal to link to Yelp on Google's 
"local merge" interface on the main SERP is simply retaliation for Yelp seeking removal 
from Google Places. 
Publicly, Google framed its changes to Google Local as a redesign to move toward 
the provision of more original content, and thereby, to remove all third-party content and 
review counts from Google Local, as well as from the prominent "local merge" Universal 
Search interface on the main SERP.219 But the more likely explanation is that, by July 2011,

Google had already collected sufficient reviews by bootstrapping its review collection on the 
display of other websites' reviews. It no longer needed to display third-party reviews, 
particularly while under investigation for this precise conduct. 
b. 
The "Shopping" Story 
Much of Google Product Search content is obtained through feeds from various 
websites with corresponding license agreements, from crawls, and to a lesser extent, by 
generating its own content.220 · As Google sought to develop a stronger shopping offering 
beginning around 2006, Google recognized the need to improve its data in several areas. 
Google decided to supplement its feeds with additional merchant reviews, product 
reviews, and product listings it could get from crawls, particularly from Amazon.221 Amazon 
had a license agreement with Google starting in June 2009. Pursuant to this agreement, 
Amazon provided Google with only a limited data feed of information about its products, and 
sought to limit how Google used the data, because Amazon has always feared that Google 
would use Amazon's comprehensive product catalogue and original review content to 
develop a strong competitor in shopping.222 
Shortly thereafter, claiming that Amazon's data feed to Google Product Shopping was 
too limited, Google decided not to rely on the feed, but instead, crawled Amazon's website to 
scrape the much more detailed product information - including star ratings and user 
reviews. 223 Google also relied on Amazon's web pages that indicate the ranking of products 
within Amazon. Google used - and continues to use - this information to determine the 
order in which to rank products within Google Product Search. 
In August 2010, around the same time that Yelp requested that Google remove Yelp's 
content from Google Local, Amazon requested that Google stop using Amazon's crawled 
Obtained by POLITICO
 38 
product reviews in Google Product Search. 224 Amazon gave Google a one-week deadline to 
remove its ratings and reviews from Google Product Search.225 Google complied with 
respect to product reviews,226 and has not used Amazon reviews since. Google refused, 
however, to cease crawling and using Amazon's star ratings and aggregating that information 
into Google's average product ratings, and continues to do so.227 
Amazon has asked Google repeatedly to remove its product data from Google 
Product Search and its companion mobile products, Google Shopping for Mobile and Google 
Shopper. Google has told Amazon that, due to technical barriers, Amazon's content can only 
be removed from Google Product Search and the related mobile applications if Amazon is no 
longer crawled for natural search results.228 Therefore, Google continues to scrape Amazon 
product listings for use in Google Product Search and the companion mobile products.229 
Amazon has attempted to negotiate the removal of its content in exchange for a limited data 
feed, but Google has, thus far, refused to agree to this solution.230 
In addition, Google uses its crawl of Amazon to create its comprehensive product 
taxonomy for classification of all products. A product taxonomy is an organization of 
products that allows a computer database to understand the nature of each product. For 
example, for the system to recognize the name "Harry Potter" as both a book and a movie, 
each type of product must be classified separately. With millions of different types of 
products, a product taxonomy allows the system to understand all the types of products and 
to easily add new products. 
Google had various options for obtaining such a classification: purchasing one, 
paying to generate one, or copying a classification from another website. Google attempted 
to purchase classifications, but the available classifications were not sufficiently

comprehensive.231 Google also attempted to pay a company to generate a new hierarchy, but 
this was taking a long time, and also was not sufficiently comprehensive.232 
Ultimately, Google decided to crawl Amazon's product web pages, read embedded 
information on Amazon's pages indicating Amazon's classification system, and to use that 
information to create Google's classification.233 This was critical to Google because Froogle 
had failed partly due to Google's inability to accurately classify the millions of products from 
feeds and crawls, and to return correct search results.234 Amazon considers its classification 
system an important competitive advantage that it spends tremendous resources to develop, 
and does not approve of Google's use of Amazon's system to develop its own.235 
With Google's migration to a paid shopping model,236 Google has stated that it will 
only use reviews from companies that provide licensed feeds of their content. It appears, 
however, that Google may continue to crawl, and rely upon, rivals' product classifications to 
generate its own, and on rivals' rankings to determine rankings of products within Google 
Shopping. 
c. 
Effects of Google's "Scraping" on Vertical Rivals 
Because Google scraped content from these vertical websites over an extended period 
of time, it is difficult to point to declines in traffic that are specifically attributable to 
Google's conduct. However, the natural and probable effe~t of Google's conduct is to 
diminish the incentives of companies like Yelp, TripAdvisor, CitySearch, and Amazon to 
invest in, and to develop, new and innovative content, as the companies cannot fully capture 
the benefits of their innovations. 237

Google's API Restrictions 
Staff has investigated whether Google's restrictions on the automated cross
management of advertising campaigns has unlawfully contributed to the maintenance, 
preservation, or enhancement of Google's monopoly power in the markets for search and 
search advertising. Microsoft alleges that these restrictions are anticompetitive because they 
prevent Google's competitors from achieving efficient scale in search and search 
advertising.238 We recommend that the Commission issue a complaint against Google for 
this conduct. 
a. 
Overview of the AdWords Platform 
In order to set up a Google AdW ords campaign, advertisers prepare extensive bids, 
consisting of thousands - even hundreds of thousands - of keywords. For example, DirecTV 
might bid on common keywords such as "television," "TV," and "satellite," along with 
specific television show names, such as "Friday Night Lights," and common misspellings of 
these words or related phrases. The advertisers' bids can be calibrated by time and location 
(i.e., DirecTV could seek to focus its "Friday Night Lights" campaign to Friday nights in 
Texas during football season), and even by changes in inventory. Advertisers then prepare 
advertisements ( called "creatives" in industry parlance), and match those with various groups 
of keywords. After an ad campaign is up and running, the advertiser receives data from 
AdW ords that enables it to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. Based on that 
information, the advertiser can modify bids, add or drop keywords, and modify its creative .. 
When done manually, this iterative process, known as ad campaign "optimization," is very 
expensive and time-intensive.239

"
Initially, Google offered advertisers two ways to access the AdW ords system and 
manage their campaigns: the AdWords Front End and the AdWords Editor. The Front End is 
a web page that advertisers could log into and manage their campaigns. The Editor is a 
program advertisers can download. It allows advertisers to download campaign information 
from Google, make bulk changes offline, and then upload the changes back into AdWords. 
These two access points eventually proved to be insufficient because large advertisers and 
agencies were taxing the existing system. They would access the system and make so many 
changes to their campaigns that the system's capacity would be exceeded, causing it to be 
unavailable temporarily or even to crash. 240 
In response, in 2004, Google introduced a third method for accessing the AdW ords 
system: the AdWords API. The API (application programming interface) allows advertisers 
and agencies direct programmatic access to the AdW ords platform. The API contains a set 
of specifications that allows advertisers and agencies to develop their own software programs 
to interact with the API and allow them to set up and optimize their ad campaigns. APis are 
now an essential feature of campaign management for advertisers and agencies managing 
multiple accounts.241 All three major search advertising platforms (Google, Microsoft, and 
Yahoo!)242 have APis that allow this direct, automated interaction with ad platform features. 
Google anticipated that the API would have several benefits, including: (1) reduced 
Google operating expenses (Google personnel having to provide manual processing and 
troubleshooting for large bulk sheets); (2) increased advertiser spend due to reduced 
advertiser operating costs; and (3) rapid development of advertiser and third party tools 
supporting AdW ords campaigns 243

 42 
f

By all appearances, the API has been a success. Advertisers using the API have 
increased their spend rate faster than other advertisers.244 Usage of the API has grown 
significantly. 245 · 
b. 
T4e Restrictive Conditions 
Users of the Google AdW ords API must agree to the terms and conditions Google 
imposes. The terms are non-negotiable and apply to all users. Two of those terms and 
conditions, which have been in place since the API was released, restrict advertisers' use of 
their own AdW ords campaign data. The campaign data consists of data input by the 
advertiser into the API (including keywords, keyword groupings, and bid parameters) and 
data from the API reporting on the performance of the advertiser's campaign (including ad 
placement, clicks, and costs per keyword).246 
As a condition of using the AdW ords API, advertisers are prevented from using their 
campaign data in two ways, both of which inhibit their ability to manage ad campaigns on 
multiple search networks. First, advertisers cannot use a tool developed by a third party, or 
have a third party use such a tool on their behalf, to copy their campaign data directly from 
the AdW ords API into an advertising campaign on another search network. Second, they 
cannot use a tool developed by a third party, or have a third party use such a tool on their 
behalf, to comingle AdW ords campaign data with campaign data from another search 
engine.247 (We will refer to these conditions collectively as "the restrictive conditions.") 
These restrictions essentially prevent any third-party tool developer or advertising 
agency from creating a tool that provides a.single user interface for multiple advertising 
campaigns. Such tools would facilitate cross-platform advertising. However, the restrictions 
do not apply to advertisers themselves, which means that very large advertisers, such as

Amazon and eBay, can develop- and have developed-their own multi-homing tools that 
simultaneously manage campaigns across platforms.248 The advertisers affected are those 
whose campaign volumes are large enough to benefit from using the AdW ords API, but too 
small to justify devoting the necessary resources to develop in-house the software and 
expertise to manage multiple search network ad campaigns. 
c. 
Effects of the Restrictive Conditions 
i. 
Effects on Advertisers and Search Engine Marketers 
("SEMs")249 
As noted above, the immediate effect of the restrictive conditions has been to. prevent 
the development and marketing of tools that would allow advertisers to manage ad 
campaigns on multiple search advertising networks simultaneously. Google routinely audits 
its API clients to determine compliance with the restrictive conditions. On several occasions, 
Google has required SEMs to remove functionality that would facilitate simultaneous 
management of search advertising campaigns.250 Other SEMs have stated that, but for the 
restrictive conditions, they too would develop and offer such functionality.251 They would 
also be freer to innovate the tools they offer based on their clients' demands.252 Google 
anticipated that the restrictive conditions would eliminate SEM incentives to innovate.253 
Many advertisers have said they would be interested in buying a tool that had multi
homing functionality.254 Such functionality would be attractive to advertisers because it 
would reduce the costs of managing multiple ad campaigns, giving advertisers access to 
additional advertising opportunities on multiple search advertising networks with minimal 
additional investment of time. The advertisers who would benefit from such a tool appear to 
be the medium-sized advertisers, whose advertising budgets are too small to justify hiring a

full service agency, but large enough to justify paying for such a tool to help increase their 
advertising opportunities on multiple search networks. 
The restrictions do not prevent users from manually exporting data from Google 
AdWords into a CSV (or plain-text) file, and then uploading that data onto a competing 
advertising platform. Microsoft and Yahoo! offer instructions on how to upload data 
exported from AdW ords, although Microsoft maintains that this process is quite slow and 
burdensome.255 Nonetheless, publicly, Microsoft does encourage users to import their 
AdWords campaigns to AdCenter, saying "it's not that hard to do," and providing a checklist 
of 14-16 steps to follow.256 
Despite Google's claims to the contrary, the AdWords Front End and AdWords 
Editor are not as effective as the API because access to data via the AdW ords Front End and 
AdWords Editor is manual, while access via the API is "programmatic," i.e., it can be 
automated.257 Thus, the API alone is "scalable," which is an important attribute for 
developers and advertisers.258 In fact, Google has consistently found that the spending 
growth of advertisers using the API has exceeded the spending growth for other advertisers, 
suggesting that the API is a more efficient portal into the AdW ords auction than these other 
methods.259 Programmatic access makes possible the development of tools that can interact 
swiftly and automatically with AdWords, as compared to the slow, manual process of 
downloading data, modifying it on spreadsheets, and then uploading the changes. 
Removing the restrictive conditions from the AdWords API Terms and Conditions 
would allow copying and synchronization of ad campaigns in mass,260 and reduce advertiser 
costs.261

Effects on Competitors 
It seems likely that the removal of Google's API restrictions would increase the 
amount of advertising spend directed towards search networks that compete with Google. 
The rationale is that many advertisers would be willing to advertise on Bing or Yahoo! if 
they could do so without incurring significant transaction costs. As noted above, optimizing 
a search advertising campaign is time-intensive. It may not be worthwhile investing such 
efforts for additional, smaller search networks. Microsoft contends that if management tools 
that allowed advertisers to optimize their campaigns on multiple search networks 
simultaneously were available, many more advertisers would choose to advertise on the 
networks that compete with Google. 
Data on advertiser "multi-homing" may show some of the effects of the restrictive 
conditions. "Multi-homing" refers to advertisers that advertise on multiple search networks. 
The data indicate that nearly all of the largest advertisers multi-home, but the percentage of 
multi-homing declines as the advertisers' spend decreases. According to a 2011 study by 
Microsoft, which divided the advertiser base into deciles based on total number of clicks 
(such that the largest nine advertisers comprise a decile - or 10 percent of total clicks - unto 
themselves), the distribution of multi-homing was as follows:262 
Decile Advertisers ( from smallest % multi-homint()j 
to largest)

Thus, outside of the two deciles composed of the smallest advertisers, the percentage of 
advertiser multi-homing is very high. However, given the very large number of advertisers 
in those two deciles, it turns out that less than 37 percent of all advertisers multi-home.264 
If there were no incremental transaction costs, it would be reasonable to assume that 
all rational advertisers would multi-home. It may therefore be surmised that transaction costs 
are driving the smaller advertisers to choose not to multi-home. In this light, Microsoft's 
contention can be restated as follows: the restrictive conditions increase the transaction costs 
for cross-network campaign management, and thus decrease demand for all non-dominant 
networks. The multi-homing data support Microsoft's contention. 
The multi-homing data do not reflect another potential form of harm: some 
advertisers who are multi-homing are likely doing so with less intensity on the non-dominant 
networks, which may cause them to spend less than they otherwise would on non-dominant 
networks relative to their share of total search. For example, Microsoft has conducted a 
study showing that even multi-homing advertisers bid on significantly more keywords on 
Google's AdWords platform than on Microsoft's AdCenter platform.265 Microsoft also 
claims that, while multi-homing advertisers optimize their Google campaigns on an almost

daily basis, the same advertisers optimize their Microsoft campaigns far less frequently, on a 
weekly or bi-weekly basis.266 
Staff conducted a series of interviews of randomly selected small advertisers to gather 
their anecdotal perspective on these issues. These interviews strongly tend to support the 
thesis that many small advertisers would extend their advertising to other search networks if 
they had access to a cross-platform optimization tool. Nearly all small advertisers 
interviewed showed interest in such a tool.267 They believed such a cross-platform 
optimization tool would be central to addressing their core constraints: time, sophistication, 
and money.268 When these transaction costs are coupled with Bing's limited volume, some 
small advertisers refrain from using Bing altogether.269 Furthermore, even those that do use 
Bing may not be fully optimizing their Bing campaigns because the benefits of Bing's 
limited user volume may not outweigh the transaction costs associated with full 
optimization.270 
d. 
Internal Google Discussions Regarding the Restrictio:Qs 
Internal Google documents support the notion that the removal of the restrictions 
would increase advertiser spend on competing networks. In 2007, when considering whether 
to offer a cross-network management tool, an API product manager wrote (and director of 
product management Richard Holden endorsed): 
Ifwe offer cross-network SEM in [Europe], we will give a significant boost to our 
competitors. Most advertisers that I have talked to in [Europe] don't bother running 
campaigns on [Microsoft] or Yahoo because the additional overhead needed to 
manage these other networks outweighs the small amount of additional traffic. For 
this reason, [Microsoft] and Yahoo still have a fraction of the advertisers that we 
have in [Europe], and they still have lower average CPAs [cost per acquisition].271 
This last point is significant. The success of Google's AdW ords auctions has served to raise 
the costs of advertising on Google. With more advertisers entering the AdW ords auctions,

l

\,t,. 
the prices it takes to win those auctions have naturally risen. As a result, the costs per 
acquisition on Google have risen relative to the costs per acquisition on Bing and Yahoo!. 
Despite these higher costs, as this document notes, advertisers are not switching to Bing and 
Yahoo! because, for many of them, the transactional costs are too great. 
In December 2008, a Google team led by Richard Holden evaluated the possibility of 
relaxing or removing the restrictive conditions, and consulted with Google chief economist 
Hal Varian. · Based on that meeting, Holden wrote a series of significant observations: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Advertisers seek out SEMs and agencies for cross-network management 
technology and services; 
The restrictive conditions make the market more inefficient; 
Removing the restrictive conditions would "open up the market" and give 
Google the opportunity to compete with a best.:.in-class SEM tool with "a 
streamlined workflow"; 
Removing the restrictive conditions would allow SEMs to improve their 
tools as well; 
While there is a risk of additional spend going to competing search 
networks, it is unlikely that Google would be seriously harmed because 
"advertisers are going where the users are," i.e., to Google.272 
Thus, internally, Google recognized that removing the restrictions would create a 
more efficient market, but acknowledged a concern that doing so might diminish Google's 
grip on advertisers. Nonetheless, following up on that meeting, Google began evaluating 
ways to improve the DART Search program. DART Search was a cross-network campaign 
management tool owned by DoubleClick, which Google acquired in 2008.273 Google 
engineers were looking at improving the DART Search product, but had to confront 
limitations imposed by the restrictive conditions. During his investigational hearing, Richard 
Holden steadfastly denied any linkage between the need to relax the restrictive conditions

l 
and the plans to improve DART Search.274 However, a series of documents-'-- documents 
authored by Holden - explicitly link the two ideas. 
In December 2008, Holden, senior vice-president of ad products Susan Wojcicki, and 
others met to discuss the issue. Of the meeting, Holden wrote: 
[O]ne debate we are having is whether we should eliminate our API T&Cs 
requirement that AW [ AdWords] features not be co-mingled with competitor 
network features in SEM cross-network tools like DART Search. We are 
advocating that we eliminate this requirement and that we build a much more 
streamlined and efficient DART Search offering and let SEM tool provider 
competitors do the same. There was some debate about this, but we 
concluded that it is better for customers and the industry as a whole to make 
things more efficient and we will maximize our opportunity by moving 
quickly and providing the most robust offering. 275 
In February 2009, Holden wrote the ex~cutive summary for a DART Search product 
review, in which he advocated that Google "alter the AdWords Ts&Cs to be less restrictive 
and produce the leading cross-network toolset that increases advertiser/agency efficiency." 
Such a move, he wrote, would "[r]educe friction in the search ads sales and management 
process and grow the industry faster."276 In April 2009, in light of evident disapproval from 
Larry Page about the idea of removing the co-mingling restriction, Holden wrote: "We've 
heard that and we will focus on building the product to be industry-leading and will evaluate 
it with him when it is done and then discuss co-mingling and enabling all to do it."277 
In September 2009, the API product manager again raised the possibility of 
eliminating the restrictive conditions as a way to help DART Search, this time with the added 
argument that DART Search was not able to compete effectively against other SEM cross
network tools that might be violating those restrictive conditions.278 Before the issue was 
raised up the ladder to Susan Wojcicki, the API product manager asked Richard Holden's 
advice:

 50 
( 
f 
L 
I think the core issue on which I'd like to get Susan's take is whether she sees 
a high risk of existing spend being channeled to MS/Yahoo! due to a more 
lenient official policy on campaign cloning. Then, weigh that risk against the 
benefits: enabling DART Search to compete better against non-compliant 
SEM tools, more industry goodwill, easier compliance enforcement. Does 
that seem like the right high level message?279 
It appears that Holden agreed that the concern of spend being channeled towards 
Google's competitors was part of the appropriate "high level message," because the issue 
was flagged in a powerpoint eventually presented to Larry Page in January 2010: "SEM 
tools will tout this official policy change strongly encouraging users to channel new or 
existing spend to other networks. "280 . 
The documents make clear that Google was weighing the efficiency of relaxing the 
restrictions against the potential cost to Google in market power. At a January 2010 meeting, 
Larry Page decided against removing or relaxing the restrictive conditions.281 However, 
there is no record of the rationale for that decision or what weight was given to the concern 
that relaxing the restrictive conditions might result in spend being channeled to Google's 
competitors. Larry Page has not testified. 282 Holden testified that he did not recall the 
discussion.283 The participants.at the meeting did not take notes "for obvious reasons."284 
Nonetheless, the documents paint a clear picture: Google rejected relaxing the API 
restrictions, and at least part of the reason for this was fear of diverting advertising spend to 
Microsoft.

advertising syndication ( or "search intermediation"). We recommend that the Commission 
issue a complaint against Google for this conduct. 
a. 
Publishers and Market Structure 
The buyers of search and search advertising syndication services are website 
publishers. In effect, any website that has content that it would like to monetize via ads is a 
potential buyer of syndication services. While there are thousands of these websites, a 
handful of the largest websites on the Internet account for the vast majority of syndicated 
search traffic and revenue. 285 Google served approximately 118 billion AdSense (search 
syndication) queries in 2011, but just 10 websites generated almost 80 percent of that 
traffic.286 
The biggest customers for search and search advertising syndication services are e
commerce retailers (e.g., Amazon and eBay), traditional retailers with large associated 
websites (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy), and Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"),287 which 
operate their own web portals. 288 
Below this small group of very large publishers, there are another roughly 25 
companies with significant query volume. These mid-tier companies include vertical e
commerce site·s such as Kayak (travel), along with smaller retailers and smaller ISPs such as 
EarthLink. None of these mid-tier companies generate even one percent of Google's total 
AdSense query volume. Below these companies, publisher size drops off rapidly to well 
under 0.1 percent of Google's query volume.289 
The search provider pays the publisher (website) a percentage of the revenue 
generated from user ad clicks on the publisher's website. In the industry, these agreements 
are known as "revenue sharing" arrangements. The higher this percentage, the more the

publisher earns per click. But, for the publisher to earn any money, the user must first click 
on an advertisement. The actual payment received by the publisher is actually a function of 
three critical variables: (1) the volume of user clicks on one of the syndicated advertisements; 
(2) the· "CPC" or "cost-per-click" the advertiser is willing to pay for each click on its content; 
and (3) the revenue sharing percentage. In industry parlance, the rate of user clicks and CPC 
are aggregated together to form the "monetization rate." 
b. 
Development of the Market for Search Syndication 
Google entered into its first AdSense for Search (AFS) agreements with Internet 
portals AOL and Earthlink in 2002.290 Google's goal then was to develop and grow the 
nascent industry of syndicated search advertising.291 At this time, Google was bidding 
against incumbent search advertising firm Overture (later acquired by Y aJ;ioo ! ) for exclusive 
agreements with syndication partners.292 
Google's early syndication deals were characterized by generous terms that favored 
the publishers.293 Because Google wanted to establish a presence on these websites, it 
offered large, up-front financial guarantees to website publishers. For example, to win major 
deals in 2002 (such as AOL and Earthlink), Google offered financial guarantees without 
knowing for certain whether the websites could actually deliver the traffic necessary to cover 
the guarantees.294 To protect itself; Google required exclusivity so that Overture could not 
cherry-pick more valuable website traffic and undermine Google's attempt to return a profit 
on these deals.295 
c. 
Specifics of Google's Syndication Agreements 
Today, the typical AdSense agreement contains terms and conditions that describe 
how and when Google will deliver search, search advertising, and other ( contextual or

domain related) advertising services. There are two main categories of AdSense agreements: 
AFS (search), which provides search advertising to publishers, and AFC (content), which 
provides contextual advertising to publishers. Staffs investigation has focused on Google's 
AFS agreements. 
Within the AFS category, there are two types of agreements: (i) Google Service 
Agreements ("GSAs"), which are individually negotiated agreements with large partners; and 
(ii) standard online contracts, which are non-negotiable and non-exclusive agreements that 
any publisher can sign.296 Standard online agreements make up the bulk of Google's AFS 
partners, but only a small portion of AFS revenues.297 The bulk of the revenues come from 
the GSAs with Google's 10 largest partners, which collectively comprise almost 80 percent 
of Google's overall AFS query volume in 2011.298 All of Google's GSAs contain some form 
of exclusivity or "preferred placement" for Google, and the GSAs typically last from one to 
three years.299 
Google's exclusive AFS agreements effectively prohibit the use of non-Google search 
and search advertising within the sites and pages·designated in the agreement.300 Some 
exclusive agreements cover all properties held by a publisher globally; other agreements 
provide for a property-by-property (or market-by-market) assignment.301 
By 2008, with its market presence clearly established, Google began to migrate away 
from outright exclusivity in all of its agreements toward what Google terms "preferred 
placement" in many of its agreements. 302 In essence, the "preferred placement" provision 
requires the publisher to display three Google ads or the same number of ads the publisher 
acquires from any competitor (whichever is greater); that Google's ads be displayed in an

 54 
[ 
unbroken block; and that Google's ads receive "preferred placement" - or rather, that they 
occupy the most prominent position on the publisher's website.303 
Notably, Google maintained "preferred placement" restrictions in both its GSAs and 
its standard online agreements until July 2012, when Google eliminated the "preferred 
placement" language from its online agreements. Google maintains that it was not aware of 
the presence of this provision in its standard online agreement until the rec~nt investigational 
hearing of Google's vice-president for search services, Joan Braddi, where Staff questioned 
Braddi about this particular provision. 304 
d. 
Effects of Exclusivity and Preferred Placement 
Staff interviewed both large and small customers for search and search advertising 
syndication services to understand how and why they contract with Google, whether their 
contracts are exclusive or restrictive, and the customers' appetite for using multiple 
syndication providers. We summarize the key findings from these interviews below. 
i. 
Common Publisher Responses 
All interviewees report that Bing's search and search advertising syndication product 
is not competitive across-the-board with Google today. We found universal agreement that 
Bing's syndication product is markedly inferior to Google's offering. For example, Amazon 
reported that Bing's product monetizes at less than half the rate of Google's.305 
Business.com, a smaller e-commerce site, told us that Google would have to cut its revenue 
share to Business.com from 64.5 percent to somewhere in the 30 percent range before the 
company could seriously consider shifting from Google to Microsoft, and even that would 
require Microsoft to provide a 90 percent revenue share because Microsoft's platform has 
such low monetization in comparison to Google's platform.306

The customers generally confirmed Microsoft's claim that Bing's search syndication 
offering is inferior, at least in part, because Microsoft's network of advertisers is smaller than 
Google's. With a significantly larger advertiser base, Google is more likely to have a 
relevant, high-quality advertisement for any given query, which greatly improves its 
monetization rate relative to Microsoft.307 
A smaller publisher reported that, essentially, the only websites exclusively using 
Bing's search syndication service today are those that have been kicked out of Google's 
syndication network for violating its terms of service. 308 While we know from other 
interviews that this comment is an exaggeration, it does capture the general tenor of the 
comments we received about the relative quality of Microsoft's search and search advertising 
syndication product. 
Many publishers reported that Microsoft was not aggressively trying to win their 
syndication business. One mid-tier publisher stated that Microsoft did not even return its 
inquiry calls during the publisher's last contract renewal discussions with Google. 309 A 
Microsoft executive acknowledged that Bing needs a larger portfolio of advertisers in order 
to present a competitive offering to publishers, and so the company has not been focused on 
winning new search syndication business.310 
Another common theme we heard from many (but not all) of the publishers is that 
serving advertising is a relatively minor part of their business and not a significant strategic 
focus for them. For example, Wal-Mart operates its website principally as an extension to its 
retail operations (letting Wal-Mart customers buy products either in-store or from the website 
at their preference).311 Best Buy's principal goal for its website is to be the provider of 
presale information, as 60 percent of its customers do online research before coming to the

store.312 Customers, like Wal-Mart and Best Buy, with large unrelated business goals for 
their websites tend to view search and search advertising syndication as a source of valuable 
incremental revenue, but these websites are not operated or optimized to generate syndication 
revenue. 
Many of the publishers Staff interviewed had little interest in using multiple providers 
of search and search advertising syndication services. Most had not seriously considered the 
possibility because Bing monetizes so much more poorly than Google does today.313 A few 
publishers also reported that Microsoft itself sought various forms of exclusivity in their 
negotiations with publishers.314 Some large publishers reported that a "mix-and-match" 
arrangement would be complex and difficult for them to build and implement.315 Even 
Amazon, which actually does manage to use both Bing and Google advertisements today, 
faces some challenges in using multiple syndication providers. Amazon will use a single 
syndication provider on each page that it serves because of the risk that mixing and matching 
providers inside the same page will result in ad duplication. This is a significant issue 
because showing multiple versions of the same ad on a single page is viewed as a highly 
undesirable end user experience.316 
Beginning in 2008, Google undertook a systematic effort to lower the revenue share 
percentage for its AdSense partners. 317 Many publishers have seen significant declines in 
their revenue share percentage over time as they renewed their contracts with Google.318 In 
total, Google reduced its payments (traffic acquisition cost, or "TAC") to its AFS partners 
from 80.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 74.0 percent in the first quarter of 2010.319 
Some partners have experienced reductions in their revenue share of 10 percent or more. 320 
The publisher reaction to these declines varied, but none of the publishers viewed the

reductions in their AdSense revenue share percentage as large enough to justify shifting their 
business to Bing or to begin serving more· display advertisements instead of search ads. 321 
ii. 
Publishers' Views of Exclusivity Provisions 
When asked whether their AdSense contract with Google was exclusive, the 
publishers gave widely varied answers. A number of the large publishers reported that their 
AdSense contract with Google was exclusive,322 but some reported that their AdSense 
contracts were not exclusive. 323 Most of the publishers that reported exclusivity provisions 
did not complain to us about them. 
Staff's interviews did identify a fairly small, but significant, group of publishers that 
were deeply concerned by the exclusivity provisions in their Google AdSense agreements. 
All of these customers view search and search advertising syndication income as a 
substantial part of their business, and all have the technical sophistication to integrate 
multiple suppliers into their on-line properties. We summarize these concerns below. 
eBay. eBay is Google's largest search and search advertising syndication partner, 
accounting for just over 27 percent of the syndicated U.S. queries answered by Google in 
2011. 324 Section 14 of eBay' s AdSense agreement states that the agreement is not 
exclusive.325 However, the contract requires preferential treatment for Google AdSense ads, 
which eBay has characterized as equivalent to exclusivity.326 The preferential treatment 
terms include requirements that eBay show as many Google AdSense ads on each page as 
third-party advertisements, that no third party advertisements appear above the Google 
AdSense advertisements, that Google AdSense advertisements cannot be interspersed with 
third party advertisements, and that Google AdSense advertisements cannot be less 
prominently displayed than third party advertisements. 327 . 
Obtained by POLITICO
 58 
eBay sought to have this provision deleted during the company's last contract renewal 
in 2011, and was rebuffed. 328 eBay agreed to continue with this provision, in part, due to 
Google's willingness to leave the revenue share percentage unchanged, despite lowering it to 
most other publishers. 329 
eBay sought relief from the restrictions in its Google AdSense agreement in its last 
renewal because it has done some testing that leads it to believe that Bing's advertising 
platform has become competitive in certain sectors (e.g., technology advertisements), and 
eBay believes that it could make more money by working with multiple providers of search 
syndication service.330 In other words, in areas where Bing's search and search advertising 
syndication platform monetizes at roughly the same level as Google's platform, Bing could 
offer a higher revenue share than Google, increasing eBay' s revenue. 
NexTag. NexTag is a comparison shopping website and a Google syndication 
customer. In 2010, NexTag was Google's 15th largest AFS customer. Historically, NexTag 
had an exclusive agreement with Google. 331 Although N ex Tag was able to remove the 
exclusivity language in its Google contract in 2010, NexTag was forced to agree to a series 
of restrictions that it characterizes as essentially the same thing as exclusivity.332 These 
restrictions include a requirement to show Google advertisements on the same page as any 
third-party provider's advertisements, and always to show the Google content above the 
competing content.333 NexTag reports that moving away from explicit exclusivity even to 
this kind of de facto exclusivity required substantial, difficult negotiations with Google. 334 
Today, NexTag does not use any non-Google provider of search and search 
advertising syndication services.335 NexTag has had conversations with both Yahoo! and 
Bing, and would like to use their product "on a filler basis," but has been unable to do so

because it would have such poor placement on the NexTag site due to the Google contract 
restrictions. 336 
Business.com. Business.com is a "B2B" lead generation/vertical site. In effect, the 
site marries commercial customers looking for products (such as business phone systems) 
with providers of those products.337 Business.com is several orders of magnitude smaller 
than the other complainants, barely making it onto a list of the top 60 providers of AdSense 
query volume. Business.com reports that it has an exclusive AdSense agreement with 
Google.338 This agreement materially limits how Business.com can design its web pages. If 
Business.com were relieved from its exclusive arrangement, it would test Bing and Yahoo! 
by product category, and place their advertisements in a more prominent position in those 
categories where their performance warranted. 339 The company would also likely take 
advertisements from both Google and Bing/Yahoo!, and show them on the same page, with 
placement dictated by relative performance in each category.340 Loosening up Google's 
exclusivity restrictions would allow Business.com to improve its revenue, and also allow it to 
introduce some new features that would make the site more accessible and user-friendly.341 
Amazon. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce site342 and the second largest 
AFS customer after eBay. On a worldwide basis, Amazon earns roughly $175 million from 
search syndication services, with $169 million of that total coming from Google's AdSense 
search product. 343 Amazon does not have an exclusive agreement with Google, and actually 
splits its inventory among Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.344 However, Amazon finds that the 
Bing and Yahoo! 's advertisements monetize at about 46 percent the rate of Google's 
advertisements. 345 Because of the very large monetization gap, Amazon can only afford to 
use Bing and Yahoo! for a very small percentage of its total search syndication needs. 346 
Obtained by POLITICO
 60 
l 
f 
Amazon splits its search syndication business by full page only. 347 In other words, 
Amazon does not mix and match Google and Bing or Yahoo! content within the same 
page.348 
Amazon uses Bing and Yahoo! despite the relatively poor performance because 
Amazon is worried about being so dependent on a single supplier for such an important 
revenue source. 349 Because Amazon's basic business operates on very thin margins, its $17 5 
million in syndication revenues represents a material source of profit for the company. 350 
Amazon is concerned that it will be forced to sign an exclusive agreement with 
Google during the next contract renegotiation. 351 During the last renegotiation, Amazon 
wanted a five-year deal, but Google would only give Amazon a one-year extension unless it 
agreed to send Google 90 percent of all its queries, which Amazon refused to agree to as part 
of a formal agreement, although Amazon already sends in excess of 90 percent of its queries 
to Google. 352 
IAC. IAC is an umbrella Internet content company that operates roughly 50 different 
websites, including the Ask.com search engine site, Newsweek, CityGrid, and Urbanspoon. 353 
IAC was the third largest source of syndicated query volume to Google in 2011, representing 
9.6 percent of Google's total U.S. AFS traffic. 354 IAC has an exclusive agreement with 
Google for search and search advertising syndication. 355 However, the agreement does not 
require every IAC property to use Google's AdSense product. Rather, each property may 
elect whether to use Google's search syndication product, and if it does, it must do so on an 
exclusive basis. 356 
In 2008, IAC explored the possibility of partnering with Yahoo! and Microsoft as 
alternatives to Google, before renewing with Google. 357 All of the parties IAC contacted

during the negotiation period wanted an exclusive arrangement.358 Ultimately, Google's 
offering was the most lucrative, and IAC re-signed with Google.359 
However, IAC expressed concern about Google's requirement of exclusivity for 
subsidiary properties, such as local website CityGrid, that wanted to explore "mix-and
match" options with other search advertising providers. Indeed, in 2008, IAC declined to opt 
CityGrid into its larger exclusive agreement, attempting to forge an alternative route with 
other search advertising providers (including CityGrid's own ad network). Ultimately, 
however, CityGrid determined that it could not completely replace Google's syndication 
network, even with a patchwork of other providers. Since then, CityGrid has been forced to 
"opt in" to IAC's larger exclusive agreement. Although CityGrid wants the option of using 
other networks (including its own), and supplementing those ads with Google ads, it cannot 
do so under IAC's existing agreement with Google. More generally, IAC expressed concern 
about the lack of competition in search and search advertising syndication because there are 
no good substitutes for search advertising.360 
While IAC initially seemed supportive of the story we heard from the other 
concerned publishers, during a recent follow-up call, IAC's tone changed substantially. One 
of the key complainants on the initial call was the president of IAC subsidiary CityGrid. 
That executive has since left IAC, and our more recent call was with another executive, who 
· was in charge of business development for IAC. This executive was far less sanguine as to 
IAC's likelihood of splitting their business in the abse·nce of exclusivity. He noted that, 
while he was also concerned about the lack of competition in the market, he could not see 
moving incremental traffic to Bing or other search advertising providers unless the 
monetization gap narrowed significantly. The departure of the.key executive with the closest

 62 
[ 
knowledge of the issues and the most detailed concerns suggests we may have significant 
issues obtaining clear, unambiguous testimony from IAC that reflects their earlier expressed 
concerns. 
iii. 
Effects on Competitors 
Microsoft reports that it could substantially benefit from serving even a portion of the 
query and advertising volume from some of Google's largest syndication customers.361 
Microsoft asserts that even a 5 to 10 percent increase in its overall query traffic would be 
"very meaningful" because Bing is at a lower part of the scale curve where "each percentage 
point is critical."362 Thus, Google's exclusive and restrictive agreements serve to deny 
Microsoft incremental scale that Microsoft argues will make it a more efficient competitor. 
In addition to the impact on Microsoft, specialty search advertising platforms may be 
hampered by exclusivity provisions. When IAC complained to us, they told us that they 
sought to build their own platform to serve local search advertising. 363 Such platforms would 
not be able to serve a full panoply of search advertising, but only certain niche categories. 
Google's exclusivity provisions make it less likely that small local competitors like IAC's 
nascent offering can viably emerge. 
III. 
LEGAL ANALYSIS 
A monopolization claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, has two 
elements: (i) the "possession of monopoly power in the relevant market" and (ii) the "willful 
acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a

An attempted monopolization claim requires a showing that (i) "the defendant has 
engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct" with (ii) "a specific intent to monopolize" 
and (iii) a dangerous probability of achieving or maintaining monopoly power. 365 
A. 
GOOGLE HAS MONOPOLY POWER IN RELEVANT MARKETS 
"A firm is a monopolist if it can profitably raise prices substantially above the 
competitive level. . . . [M]onopoly power may be inferred from a firm's possession of a 
dominant share of a relevant market that is protected by entry barriers."366 Google has 
monopoly power in one or more properly defined markets. 
1. 
Relevant Markets and Market Shares 
A properly defined antitrust market consists of "any grouping of sales whose sellers, 
if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger, could profitably raise prices significantly above 
the competitive level."367 Typically, a court examines ''such practical indicia as industry or 
public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar 
characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, 
sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors. "368 
Staff has identified three relevant antitrust markets. 
a. 
Horizontal Search 
Horizontal, algorithmic web search (hereafter "horizontal search") likely constitutes a 
properly defined relevant market. As discussed earlier, horizontal search engines, such as 
Google, attempt to cover the content of the Internet as widely as possible, and are specifically 
designed to return a comprehensive list of search results on any topic. By contrast, "vertical" 
search engines focus on more narrowly-defined categories of content, such as product

l

L 
shopping or travel. Vertical search engines are not viable substitutes to horizontal search for 
many types of queries. 
Staffs investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that vertic~l websites, even 
in aggregate, could replace a horizontal search engine. None of these websites attempt to 
crawl the web comprehensively, and none have built the kind of sophisticated algorithms that 
would be necessary to search and organize the entire web effectively. As discussed in greater 
detail below, there are formidable barriers to vertical search engine firms expanding into . 
horizontal search. 
Nevertheless, it is conceivable that these narrow, vertical search properties could pick 
up additional query volume in response to a small, but significant, non-transitory increase in 
price ("SSNIP") in horizontal search, thereby potentially disciplining horizontal search 
providers. 369 As discussed earlier, our investigation has revealed that Google views vertical 
websites with some concern, and has ~oved aggressively to build its own vertical 
offerings.370 Sergey Brin, among others, testified that vertical websites are substitutes "[f]or 
some kinds of queries."371 
Critically, however, Staffs investigation has identified no mechanism for vertical 
search properties to broadly discipline a hypothetical monopolist in horizontal search. Web 
search queries are monetized through search advertising, and that advertising is sold by 
individual keywords which each have their own independent demand functions. This means 
that, at best, a hypothetical monopolist in horizontal search might be inhibited from imposing 
a SSNIP on a narrow set of keywords where there is strong vertical competition. But for the 
literally billions of other queries where no strong vertical exists ( or is likely to arise), there 
would be nothing to constrain a hypothetical monopolist from imposing a SSNIP. In other

[ 
words, to the extent vertical websites compete with horizontal search providers within their 
limited areas of competence, nothing prohibits price discrimination between those narrow 
areas and the broader web. 
Even in the narrow areas where vertical websites have subject matter competence, 
they face challenges in competing effectively with horizontal search providers. This is 
because comprehensive coverage of all topic areas appears to be a very important driver of 
demand, even to websites focusing on specific topic areas. The ability to offer 
comprehensive search results was characterized as "fundamental" by Google's former CEO, 
Eric Schmidt. 372 Schmidt explained that the company needs to build brand equity with its 
customers by providing consistently good results regardless of the content of the query, and 
that strong results across-the-board lead to specific queries in commercial search: 
So if you, for example, are an academic researcher and you use Google 30 
times for your academics, then perhaps you'll want to buy a camera ... So long 
as the product is very, very, very, very good, people will keep coming 
back ... The general product then creates the brand, creates demand and so 
forth. Then occasionally, these ads get clicked on.373 
In effect, users are habituated into using Google for all their queries because of its 
comprehensive scope, and so they may be more likely to tum to Google when they have 
commercial queries, instead of starting at a vertical website. Schmidt's testimony is 
corroborated by the representations of several of the vertical search firms, who note that they 
are dependent on horizontal search providers for significant amounts of their traffic, because 
even many vertical search users tend to begin their search with a query on Google, Bing or 
Yahoo!.374 
When asked to identify his competitors in web search, Schmidt did not mention any 
vertical property: "[ A ]s far as I can tell, the industry has two main horizontal however you 
Obtained by POLITICO
 66 
want to call them, Web search indices players. And they would be Google and Microsoft. 
There used to be three. And as you know, Microsoft and Yahoo did a deal which pretty 
much collapsed their activities together."375 
Schmidt's testimony echoes internal company documents. Numerous Google 
documents describing the market for web search discuss only Google, Microsoft's Bing, and 
Yahoo!. Google circulates monthly market share reports for Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.376 
Google also regularly monitors and compares the quality of these three services.377 Sergey 
Brin testified that he was not aware of such quality comparisons being performed against any 
vertical competitors, at least not on any regular basis. 378 All of this evidence is consistent 
with the proposition that horizontal search constitutes its own, separate relevant market. 
The relevant geographic market for web search is limited to the United States. Search 
engines are optimized to return results ( and advertisements) relevant to the users in the 
country they are serving. Countries have different languages, interests, and cultural norms 
that are all reflected in their search results. For example, a user in London typing the word 
"tube" into a search engine is likely looking for subway information, while a dairy farmer in 
Iowa with the same query is probably not interested in the London Underground. These 
issues mean that users in the United States are unlikely to view foreign search engines as 
viable substitutes for national search engines that are optimized to their language and culture. 
Although Google itself has successfully crossed some international borders (for example, 
Google is extremely popular in Europe), this is a relative rarity, and other major international 
search engines - like Baidu (China) and Yandex (Russia) - have not managed the same feat. 
In a prior investigation, the Department of Justice concluded that national boundaries

properly define the scope of the geographic market for web search. Our investigation has 
uncovered no basis on which to deviate from this conclusion. 379 
Google is clearly the dominant provider of "general search" services in the United 
States. Google's own sites have a 66.7 percent share of the market as of May 2012, 
according to ComScore, a leading industry measurement firm. 380 Google also provides 
search services to two small, formerly independent web search operators (Ask.com381 and 
AOL382), which collectively account for another 4.6 percent of the relevant market according 
to ComScore. 383 In sum, the total Google-powered query share in the United States is 71.3 
percent, according to ComScore. 384 
The balance of this market is controlled by the MicrosoftNahoo! search alliance. 
Yahoo! holds approximately 15 percent of the market, and Bing ( owned by Microsoft), holds 
approximately 14 percent.385 As noted earlier, since 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! have been 
partners in what essentially amounts to a long-termjoint venture for search, where Microsoft 
powers the algorithmic search results for both Yahoo! and Bing, while Yahoo! handles the 
direct relationships with large advertisers for the combined service. 386 Advertisers that want 
to purchase search advertising on Yahoo! or Bing cannot buy access to these properties 
separately, but rather must purchase advertisements that run on both sites simultaneously. 387 
So, in effect, there are just two providers of horizontal search: Google and the Bing/Yahoo! 
search alliance.

Google's market share (depending on whether it is calculated using Google.com share 
alone, or inclusive of the other search engines it powers) meets or exceeds "the generally 
accepted floor" for monopolization.388 Defendants with market shares in this range have 
previously been found to possess monopoly power.389 • 
b. 
Search Advertising 
Search advertising likely constitutes a properly defined relevant market. 390 As 
discussed earlier, search advertising is displayed inresponse to specific keyword queries 
entered by the user. Search advertising is distinguishable from other forms of online 
advertising, such as display advertising, contextual advertising, behavioral advertising, and 
social media advertising due to its "inherent scale, targetability, and control."391 According 
to Google, "[ t]hey are such different products that you do not measure them against one 
another and the technology behind the products is different. "392 
Advertisers often refer to a "purchase funnel" to describe the various types of 
advertising and their purposes. An example is illustrated below:393

. As illustrated by the funnel, search advertising responds directly to users' revealed

[ 
are typically more interested in developing user interest - or "branding" - than in eliciting a 
direct response from the consumer, whereas the primary attraction of search advertising is its 
propensity to generate direct responses. 394 As Hal Varian, Google's chief economist put it, 
"[o]ne way to think about the difference between search and display/brand advertising is to 
say that 'search ads help satisfy demand' while 'brand advertising helps to create 
demand."395 
The different manners in which display and search advertising are priced is consistent 
with their distinct overarching goals. Search advertisements - whose main goal is to directly 
drive user purchases - are priced on a "cost-per-click" basis (i.e., an advertiser only pays if a 
user clicks on the ad). Conversely, display advertisements -whose main goal is to spark 
interest and drive awareness - are priced based on the number of times the ad is displayed. 
Display and search advertising are also separately managed, measured, and tracked 
internally at Google.396 Similarly, for advertisers and agencies, display and search are 
different categories.397 The ad types require different creative, targets, budgets, and 
tracking. 398 Most advertisers spend in both categories, as they consider display and search 
advertising to be complements. 399 
Evidence suggests that search and display are indeed complements rather than 
substitutes. Google has observed steep click declines when advertisers have attempted to 
shift budget to display advertising. For example, when automobile manufacturer Chevrolet 
decided to suspend its search advertising campaign for two weeks, and rely on display 
advertising alone, it lost 30 percent of total clicks on its website.400 
In recent years there has been some perceived convergence between the functions of 
display and search advertising.401 With varying degrees of success, both display and search 
Obtained by POLITICO
 70 
advertising can be used for branding and awareness, and both can be used for direct 
response.402 Nevertheless, search ads remain distinct because they lack the media-rich, 
flashy graphi~s and interactivity of display ad formats. 403 Conversely, display advertising is 
far less successful at generating direct sales because, unlike search ads, display ads are not 
targeted to potential customers at the moment of purchase.404 As noted earlier, users click on 
display ads far less frequently than on search ads. 405 
As online advertising continues to evolve, new offerings have appeared that do not fit 
· squarely into the traditional search and display categories: contextual advertising; re-targeted 
display ( or behavioral) advertising; and social media advertising.406 Of all forms of online 
advertising, only search advertising allows advertisers to show an ad based on what the user 
is expressing an interest in at the moment the ad is shown. 407 Numerous advertisers have 
confirmed this point.408 Because of this critical advantage, search advertisements "convert" 
at much higher rates than other types of advertisements, 409 and are considered by many 
advertisers to be, by far, the most effective form of online advertising available.41° For 
example, according to Amazon, "no other advertising channel comes close, and none can 
substitute for search advertising."411 
Numerous advertisers report that they would not shift advertising spend away from 
search advertising, even in the face of large price increases.412 In formal responses to 
interrogatories, advertisers have stated that "there is no substitute for search advertising," and 
that, in response to price increases far more significant than SSNIP, they would continue to 
invest in search advertising.413 For example, it would take at least a 100 percent increase in 
the cost of search advertising before Living Social would begin shifting spend to other forms

of advertising.414 However, a minority of advertising agencies and advertisers said they 
would move advertising ~ollars away from search advertising in response to a SSNIP.415 
Google's internal documents and testimony confirm that there is currently no viable 
substitute for search advertising. Both AdWords vice-president of product management Nick 
Fox and chief economist Hal Varian have previously stated that search advertising spend 
does not come at the expense of other advertising dollars.416 And former Google CEO Eric 
Schmidt has twice testified unequivocally - in both this investigation and in a prior 
Department of Justice investigation - that search advertising is "the most effective tool for 
reaching the customers that are actually prepared to buy,"417 and "has the best ROI of any 
advertising as best we can determine."418 
Both the Commission and the Department of Justice have previously found online 
"search advertising" to be a distinct product market. Specifically, in 2007, the Commission 
noted that "advertisers purchase different types of ad inventory for different purposes," and 
concluded that "the sale of search advertising does not operate as a significant constraint on 
prices or quality of other online advertising."419 The Department of Justice found that search 
advertising was a relevant antitrust market in 2008, and again endorsed search advertising as 
a relevant market in 2010.420 
While no court has yet determined that search advertising constitutes a relevant 
market, courts have repeatedly recognized narrow advertising markets. For example, in 
Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States,421 the Supreme Court identified newspaper 
advertising as a unique antitrust market. There, the Court held that there were two "separate 
though interdependent markets" - one market for selling news and ads to readers and a 
Obtained by POLITICO
 72 
separate market for selling the readership to newspaper advertisers.422 Courts have followed 
that lead, typically identifying advertising markets within media separately.423 
However, a recent district court case concluded that search advertising is not a 
distinct market for antitrust purposes.424 In reaching this conclusion (on a motion to dismiss), 
the judge appears not to have considered any of the unique characteristics of search 
advertising.425 The analysis, in any event, was very limited. On balance, we believe the 
evidence points strongly toward search advertising as a separate market. 
Like the relevant geographic market for horizontal search, the relevant geographic 
market for search advertising limited to the United States.426 
Google, through its AdWords platform, is the dominant provider of search advertising 
in the United States, with between 76 and 80 percent of the market, according to several 
in<!1=1~try-wide markettrackers,4~7 and son1e 13111illion advertisers in the U.S.428 Google's 
principal rival is the combination of Bing-Yahoo!, which, as noted earlier, operate a joint 
search advertising network, and combine to represent between 12 and 16 percent of the 
market.429 Bing and Yahoo! together have approximately 313,000 advertisers.430 
c. 
Syndicated Search and Search Advertising ("Search 
Intermediation") 
Syndicated search and search advertising ( or "se_arch intermediation") likely 
constitutes a properly defined product market. As described earlier, horizontal search 
providers sell - or "syndicate" - their services to other websites. Thus, when a user goes to a 
website, he or she can run searches on that site through a search box, which is "powered" by 
a search engine. The search engine can also return search advertisements to the website. 
When the user clicks on an advertisement, the search engine and the website share the 
revenues.

The consumers in this market are the publisher websites that wish to provide search 
services and return search advertisements on their websites, while the sellers are the 
horizontal search providers, Google, Bing, and Yahoo! .431 
Staff has interviewed a number of publishers of various sizes, and they provide very 
consistent responses on the issue of cross-elasticity of demand. Publishers report that search 
and search advertising syndication monetizes better than display advertising or other content 
that they might place on their websites.432 The publishers do not view other forms of 
advertising as viable substitutes for search and search advertising syndication.433 None of the 
publishers told us that a modest ( 5 to 10 percent increase) in the price for search and search 
advertising syndication would cause them to shift away from search and search advertising 
syndication in favor of other forms of advertising or web content.434 
Further support for this relevant market comes from Google's efforts to 
systematically reduce TAC, or the amount of money Google shares with the publisher from 
syndicated searches. A decline in revenue share is effectively a price increase to the 
publishers. A number of the publishers have seen their revenue share from Google decline 
significantly in recent years as a result of Google's efforts.435 Of the publishers Staff has 
interviewed, none have reduced or eliminated their use of search and search advertising 
syndication in response to these price increases.436 In effect, Google's successful efforts to 
systematically to reduce revenue share constitutes a natural experiment to determine the 
likely response to a SSNIP. The publishers' response to Google's price increases has been 
universally consistent with the proposition that search and search advertising syndication 
(search intermediation) is a relevant market.

The evidence gathered in Staffs investigation is consistent with the Department of 
Justice's conclusion on the same issue. The Department of Justice previously recognized 
"search syndication" as a distinct product market, with only three significant market 
participants: Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft.437 
Like the relevant geographic markets for both horizontal search and search 
advertising, the relevant geographic market for search and search advertising syndication 
(search intermediation)~ the syndication of these same services - is limited to the United 
States.438 
Google, through its AdSense platform, is the dominant provider of search and search 
advertising syndication services, with some 75 percent of this market, according to 
ComScore.439 Microsoft and Yahoo! collectively account for at least another 22 percent.440 
2. 
Substa11t~3:! Barriers. to Entry E:xist. 
The provision of Internet search and search advertising, and consequently, the 
syndication of these services, are characterized by substantial entry barriers. Specifically, 
developing and maintaining a competitively viable search or search advertising platform 
requires substantial investment in specialized knowledge, technology, infrastructure, and 
time. These markets are also characterized by significant scale effects. 
a. 
Technology and Specialization 
A search engine requires algorithmic technology that enables it to search the Internet, 
retrieve and organize information, index billions of regularly changing web pages, and return 
relevant results instantaneously that satisfy the consumer's inquiry.441 Developing such 
algorithms requires highly specialized personnel with high levels of training and knowledge 
in engineering, economics, mathematics, sciences, and statistical analysis.442

b. 
Substantial Upfront Investment 
Along with specialized algorithms, search and search advertising platforms require 
enormous investments in the technology and infrastructure required to crawl and categorize 
the entire Intemet.443 For instance, in 2011, Google spent more than $5 billion on research 
and development, although this figure is inclusive of all of Google's divisions.444 And, in 
2010, Microsoft invested more than $4.5 billion into developing its algorithms and building 
the physical capacity necessary to operate Bing. 445 
c. 
Scale Effects 
As discussed at length earlier, Internet search, search advertising, and search 
syndication are markets that are characterized by substantial scale effects. As more 
consumers use a general search engine, its search algorithms are honed to improve its 
accuracy in retrieving the information that consumers want. More users also leads to an 
increased number of advertisers. And, as the number of advertisers that place ads - and the 
number of consumers who click on those ads - increases, the ad-serving algorithms improve 
their ability to predict what advertisements stimulate consumer "clicks." This, in tum, 
increases monetization for the search engine, its advertisers, and its syndication partners, 
which leads to the cyclical effect of greater participation by both advertisers and publishers. 
This effect, which has been termed the "virtuous cycle," represents a significant barrier for 
. 1 
any potentrn entrant. 
446 
Indeed, according to Microsoft, its greatest barrier is obtaining sufficient scale 
through its collection of search and advertising data, and it faces an enormous task in trying · 
to catch up with Google. Despite substantial investments in technology and infrastructure, 
Microsoft has yet to make a significant dent in Google's market share, and has been losing 
Obtained by POLITICO
 76 
l 
r 
some $2 billion per year as it attempts to effectively compete against Google.4~7 Indeed, the 
continuing viability of Bing - the only competing horizontal search platform to Google - is 
today in question. 448 
d. 
Reputation, Brand Loyalty, and the "Halo Effect" 
New entrants may face a significant barrier in attempting to supplant Google as the 
household name in search. Google has used its reputation and brand name to its advantage, 
introducing a myriad of new products and services that work to keep users within the Google 
world, through what Microsoft has termed the "halo effect."449 This refers to the 
phenomenon that consumers who use a vertical website owned by a general search engine 
may be more likely to use the affiliated general search engine than a competing search 
engine.450 
Accorcling to ,Microsoft, the fact that Google directs users to its own - as opposed to 
its competitors' -various vertical websites tends to drive general search traffic back to 
Google.com, magnifying scale effects, and reinforcing Google's position in the search and 
search advertising markets. This is confirmed by Google. · As former Google CEO Eric 
Schmidt has previously attested: 
"One of the things that we've learned is that ifwe have a powerful so called 
vertical site that does something really, really neat, that person is more likely 
to use Google in its traditional ways and therefore click on our ads."451 
e. 
Exclusive and Restrictive Agreements 
. Google's exclusive and restrictive agreements pose yet another barrier to entry, as 
many potential syndication partners with a high volume of customers are locked into 
agreements with Google. These agreements act as barriers that prevent Bing and Yahoo! 
from offering competing syndicated search and search advertising platforms to highly

trafficked websites, which, in tum, magnifies the problems of scale effects. In addition, the 
exclusive agreements act as barriers to smaller, more specialized search advertising platforms 
(e.g., a network specializing in local Washington, D.C.-based advertising, or in specific 
categories, such as travel). 
B. 
GOOGLE HAS ENGAGED IN EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT 
Conduct may be judged exclusionary when it tends to exclude competitors "on some 
basis other than efficiency," i.e., when it "tends to impair the opportunities ofrivals" but 
"either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive 
way."452 In order for conduct to be condemned as "exclusionary," Staff must show that 
Google's conduct likely impairs the ability of its rivals to compete effectively, and thus to 
constrain Google's exercise of monopoly power.453 
1. 
Google's Preferencing of Google Vertical Properties Within Its 
SERP 
As described earlier, Staff has investigated whether Google is unlawfully 
preferencing its own vertical content over that of rivals, while simultaneously demoting rival 
vertical websites, in order to maintain, preserve, or enhance its monopoly power in the 
markets for search and search advertising. Although we believe that this is a close question, 
we conclude that Google's preferencing conduct does not violate Section 2. 
a. 
Google's Product Design Impedes Vertical Competitors 
"As a general rule, courts are properly very skeptical about claims that competition 
has been ha1med by a dominant firm's product design changes .... Judicial deference to 
product innovation, however, does not mean that a monopolist's product design decisions are 
per se lawful. "454 In United States v. Microsoft, the D. C. Circuit concluded that several 
Obtained by POLITICO
 78 
l 
r 
technical actions undertaken by Microsoft, in order to integrate its Internet Explorer browser 
into its Windows operating system, were anticompetitive.455 
Here, we evaluate Google's conduct through the Microsoft lens of monopoly 
maintenance: whether Google took these actions in order to impede a nascent threat to 
Google's monopoly power in the markets for search and search advertising.456 Google's 
internal documents explicitly reflect - and testimony from Google executives confirms - a 
concern that Google was at risk of losing, in particular, highly profitable queries to vertical 
websites. As vice president of product management Nicholas Fox noted in May 2009, 
Google's 
inability to serve this segment [ of vertical lead generation] well today is 
negatively impacting our business. Query growth among high monetizing 
queries (>$120 RPM) has declined to ~0% in the UK. US isn't far behind 
(~6%). There's evidence (e.g., UK Finance) that we're losing share to 
~ggregators.457 
, 
The potential competitive threat to Google addressed here is not that the vertical 
websites will displace Google entirely, but that, collectively, they will undercut Google's 
power over the most lucrative segments of its search and search advertising portfolio. 
Additionally, the vertical websites could help erode barriers to growth for general search 
competitors, such as Microsoft, that are positioned to compete with Google acro'ss the board 
rather than in a few smaller, distinct categories. This theory- advanced by Microsoft
posits that the proliferation of vertical websites creates a healthy "ecosystem." In tum, this 
ecosystem allows a provider of general search to compete with Google by partnering with 
various vertical websites, rather than having to serve the market at multiple different levels to 
attract users and, in turn, advertisers.458

The theory of harm to competition is mainly one of reduced innovation: that, when 
faced with Google's seamless ability to enter into highly monetizable categories of 
commerce and simultaneously to disadvantage its competitors, existing competitors cannot 
innovate at the same pace; new or innovative vertical websites will cease to enter the market; 
and consumers will be faced with a corresponding reduction in innovation and choice. 459 
b. 
Google's SERP Changes Have Resulted In Anticompetitive 
Effects 
Google's conduct has resulted in significant harm to rival vertical websites in a 
number of different categories. As described earlier, in the comparison shopping category 
one of the first areas in which Google vigorously expanded its own offering, while 
simultaneously demoting rival offerings - many rival websites have experienced significant 
declines in traffic. Data obtained from NexTag and Shopping.com, among others, suggests 
that, as a result of Google's conduct, these websites have experienced significant drops in 
traffic. Google's internal data confirms this impact.460 
Simultaneously, Google's prominent placement and display of its Universal Search 
properties led to gains in user share for its own properties. For example, Google's inclusion 
of Google Product Search as a Universal Search result turned a property that the Google 
product team could not even get indexed by Google's web search results into the number one 
viewed comparison shopping website on Google.461 
c. 
Google's Justifications for the Conduct 
Google claims that the conduct under review improves its product and benefits users. 
"[A] design change that improves a product by providing a new benefit to consumers does 
not violate Section 2 absent some associated anticompetitive conduct." Allied Orthopedic 
Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Group LP, 592 F.3d 991, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2010).

[ 
r 
L 
Product design change-is an area of conduct where courts do not tend to strictly scrutinize 
asserted procompetitive justifications.462 In any event, Google's procompetitive 
justifications are compelling. 
For example, Google argues that any design changes to its SERP have improved its 
product by providing consumers with direct, relevant, and "better" results. Specifically, 
Google asserts that its Universal Search results are an "inherent aspect" of Google's overall 
search results "that help render Google's search results more relevant and useful to users."463 
It seems clear that Universal Search is a useful improvement to the product. Both Yahoo! 
and Microsoft appear to generally agree that Universal Search results are relevant and useful 
to users.464 While each search platform serves up its vertical content in different ways, the 
fact that all three major search engines offer some equivalent of Universal Search makes it 
_ difficult to dispute that users pla_ce a_~igh value on being_ able to obtain specialized results. 
Moreover, Google corr~ctly notes that the path from "10 blue links" toward a more 
comprehensive provision of thematic results long predates Google's formal introduction of 
Universal Search in 2007,465 and that Google's introduction of certain "OneBox" results on 
its SERP predate Google's alleged concern about any potential "vertical threat." For 
example, in 2003, Google began showing some product results through a Froogle OneBox at 
the top of its search results page,466 and in 2004, began displaying some local results in a 
Local OneBox at the top of the page. 467 
Google justifies the preferential placement of its Universal Search content by 
asserting that the "apples and oranges" problem prevents Google from doing a head-to-head 
comparison of its property versus competing vertical properties. This seems to be correct. 
Google's method of rankings its properties does create an inability to directly compare the

results. Google _measures the quality of its verticals by assigning relevance values to each 
individual vertical result, i.e., to each merchant in a specific product search, or to each 
location in a local search (which may be ranked by popularity, rating, number of Google 
reviews, distance, and other factors). 
Google's web search results, on the other hand, receive a score based on the text read 
from crawling the contents of the page. Based on the crawled text, the pages are rated using 
factors such as click-through rates (i.e., how often previous users clicked on the page), 
commerciality (i.e., whether the page has too many ads), and the page's PageRank.468 With 
Google's current algorithms, Google cannot directly compare, say, the ranking for a specific 
restaurant (in its own local results) to the ranking for an entire web page (in someone else's 
local results).469 On the other hand, Microsoft has told us that Bing uses a si_ngle signal
click-through rate - to determine where to place the Universal Search content within the 
organic search results.470 
Google's justification for promoting its own properties above that of competing 
properties automatically when those properties appear (recall the algorithms that boosted 
Google Product Search to the top of the SERP whenever another comparison shopping 
website was deemed relevant) is not as strong, but still has some force. Google's 
justification for this conduct is that, if another vertical property is deemed relevant by 
Google's algorithms, Google's vertical property must also have high quality results - and 
Google's rich Universal Search results are more helpful to the user than "blue links" to other 
comparison shopping websites. 
Google's justification for surfacing only ( or mainly) Google-sourced content - rather 
than third-party vertical content-within its Universal Search results is less convincing. 
Obtained by POLITICO
 82 
l 
r 
Google notes it is industry practice to show only the search engine's results in the vertical. 
Google also claims that serving third-party data in its Universal Search results would create 
significant technical and latency (speed) issues. The evidence shows that it would be 
technologically feasible to serve up third-party results in Google's Universal Search results. 
Indeed, Bing does this today with its flight vertical, serving up Kayak results;471 and Google 
itself originally considered third-party OneBoxes. 472 
Google also vigorously defends its "demotion" of certain vertical content, arguing 
that Google's algorithms are designed solely with the goal of improving a user's search 
experience.473 It is true that most firms naturally want to appear prominently in Google's 
natural search results, and, today, entire businesses are devoted to helping companies 
improve their ranking on Google's SERP. Companies seeking prominence in Google's 
sea~ch results e~p!gy a 'Y_tde variety of strategies to improve their visibility. Google has a 
substantial interest in protecting its search results from being "gamed" by websites for 
commercial gain, and so is consta:t;itly tweaking and adjusting its algorithms in order to 
protect the integrity of its search results. Google can legitimately claim that it needs to 
demote undesirable websites in order to improve the quality of the user experience. Staff has 
certainly uncovered contemporaneous evidence suggesting that improving search experience 
was at least one goal of Google's algorithm changes, including algorithms that specifically 
demoted certain vertical websites.474 
However, one aspect of Google's demotions that especially troubles Staff- and is not 
addressed by the above justification - is the fact that Google routinely, and prominently, 
displays its own vertical properties, while simultaneously demoting properties that are 
identical to its own, but for the fact that the latter are competing vertical websites.475

Google's defense for this conduct essentially boils down to "user expectations." Sergey Brin 
testified that Google's showcasing of its Universal Search results is not inconsistent with the 
demotion of other similar vertical content because Universal Search represents a "mode 
change" for users.476 According to Brin: 
So when you search for products rather than searching for web pages, I feel 
like that's more of a mode change. You know, you're switching- in fact, you 
can switch . . . . You can switch to product mode. And I think that would be 
confusing in the user interface if you were to just get a web link, you know, 
that looked like a normal Google result and yet it takes you to another Google 
search. I think people understand mode changes. They might understand 
resorting something in a different way. But I think ultimately when you click 
on an individual [web] link, you want to get an answer. You don't want to get 
another set of search results. 477 
In other words, Google's position is that, if a user conducts a search on Google for a 
product, that user is looking for Google's search results, not another list of search results 
from another search provider. However, Google has presented no evidence of user 
expectations in this area.478 Indeed, Google's vertical properties are typically not labeled as 
"Google" results, and thus, outwardly at least, provide no cue to a user that he or she is 
"switching" to a different mode of Google search.479 Nevertheless, Brin testified that "the 
user interface is pretty clear"480 - "the link that says 'shopping results for' is clearly a 
specialized part of the interface. It doesn't appear to be just like another web page."481 
d. 
Google's Additional Legal Defenses 
Setting aside efficiency justifications, Google has argued - successfully in several 
litigations - that it owes no duty to assist in the promotion of a rival's website or search 
platform, and that it owes no duty to promote a rival's product offering over its own product 
offerings.482 Indeed, one reading of Trinka and subsequent cases is that Google is privileged 
in blocking rivals from its search platform unless its conduct falls into in one of several 
Obtained by POLITICO
 84 
f: 
l 
r 
specific exceptions referenced in Trinka (e.g., where there is an affirmative voluntary prior 
course of dealing).483 Alternatively, one may argue that Trinka should not be read so broadly 
as to overrule swathes of antitrust doctrine.484 
Additionally, Google has long argued that its general search results are opinions that 
are protected speech under the First Amendment, and that such speech should not be subject 
to government regulation.485 In Search King Inc. v. Google Technology,486 plaintiffs alleged 
that Google's search results were not objectively accurate. Google argued, and the Western 
District of Oklahoma agreed, that, while the PageRank search process might be objective, the 
search algorithms themselves are not, making search results a form of subjective speech 
protected by the First Amendment. 487- Later decisions have called this conclusion into 
question,488 and Staff believes that Google's assertion of First Amendment protection here is 
overbroad.

Moreover, Search King did not examine whether Google's search results constitute 
"commercial speech," the content of which is subject to regulation under certain 
circumstances. This is because Search _King long predates Google's introduction of 
Universal Search, which blends its own commercially-oriented vertical content with its 
natural search results. A finding that Google's search results constitute expressions "related 
solely_ to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience" would likely alter the First 
Amendment analysis.489 Speech that "is 'linked inextricably' with the commercial 
arrangement that it proposes" gives the federal government an interest in the speech, 
particularly when the underlying commercial transaction is one that can be regulated by the 
govemment.490

In sum, Staff acknowledges the difficulties inherent in this area of the investigation, 
not only because of the legal hurdles we would face, but because of the ~trong 
procompetitive justifications Google has set forth. We are faced with a set of facts that can 
most plausibly be accounted for by a narrative of mixed motives: one in which Google's 
course of conduct was premised on its desire to innovate and to produce a high quality search 
product in the face of competition, blended with the desire to direct users to its own vertical 
offerings (instead of those ofrivals) so as to increase its own revenues. Indeed, the evidence 
paints a complex portrait of a company working toward an overall goal of maintaining its 
market share by providing the best user experience, while simultaneously engaging in tactics 
that resulted in harm to many vertical competitors, and likely helped to entrench Google's 
monopoly power over search and search advertising. The determination that Google's 
conduct is anticompetitive, and deserving of condemnation, would require an extensive 
balancing of these factors, a task that courts have been unwilling - in similar circumstances 
to perform under Section 2. Thus, although it is a close question, Staff does not recommend 
that the Commission move forward on this cause of action. 
2. 
Google's "Scraping" of Rivals' Vertical Content 
As described earlier, Staff has investigated whether Google has unlawfully "scraped" - or appropriated - the content of rival vertical websites in order to improve its own vertical 
products, so as to maintain, preserve,. or enhance its monopoly power in the markets for 
search and search advertising. We conclude that this conduct violates Section 2 and Section 
5.

Google's "Scraping" Constitutes a Conditional 
Refusal to Deal or Unfair Method of Competition 
Google's "scraping" of rivals' content to improve its own vertical products - and its 
threatened refusal to deal with some of these competitors - may be appropriately condemned 
as a conditional refusal to deal under Section 2. In Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law 
Offices of Curtis V. Trinka,491 the Supreme Court reiterated "the long recognized right of [a] 
trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own 
independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal."492 However, the Court 
acknowledged that, "[ u ]nder certain circumstances, a refusal to cooperate with rivals can 
constitute anticompetitive conduct and violate § 2."493 
Identifying those "circumstances" have been the subject of much debate in the post
Trinka world. In affirming the holding of Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing 
Corp. 494 - albeit~ a-s "at or near the outer boundary of§ 2-liabiiity''495 - the Trinka court 
provided some clues as to the continuing viability of the doctrine. At issue in Aspen Skiing 
was the termination by the defendant of a joint, multiple-day, all-ski area ticket issued by the 
defendant ( owner of three out of four ski areas in Aspen) and the plaintiff ( owner of the 
fourth ski area in Aspen). After repeatedly demanding an increased share of the joint profits, 
the defendant finally canceled the joint ticket. The defendant also rejected the plaintiff's 
"increasingly desperate measures" to recreate the joint ticket, ultimately even rejecting the 
plaintiff's offer to buy defendant's tickets at the retail price. Under these circumstances, the 
Supreme Court upheld the jury's finding of liability under Section 2.496 
The Trinka court suggested that the Aspen Skiing defendant's 
unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course 
of dealing suggested a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an 
anticompetitive end. Similarly, the defen_dant's unwillingness to renew the

ticket even if compensated at retail price revealed a distinctly anticompetitive 
bent.497 
. 
Appellate courts have focused upon Trinka 's reference to the "unilateral termination 
of a voluntary course of dealing," as a critical limitation upon a monopolist's discretion in 
determining whether to deal with a rival. For example, in American Central Eastern Texas 
Gas Co. v. Duke Energy Fuels LLC, 498 the Fifth Circuit upheld an arbitrator's determination 
that the defendant natural gas processor's refusal to contract with a competitor for additional 
processing capacity was unlawful. Plaintiff was both a "gatherer" and "processor" of natural 
gas. The plaintiff alleged that, because it was not economically feasible to open its own 
processing plant, it contracted with the defendant for processing capacity. 499 After two years 
of using the defendant's processing plant, when the plaintiff entered into renegotiations for 
additional capacity, the defendant proposed terms that it "knew were unrealistic or 
completely unviable" to the plaintiff, including a very high price, "in order to exclude [ the 
plaintiff] from competition with [the defendant] in the ... gas processing market."500 The 
Fifth Circuit upheld the arbitrator's conclusion that the defendant unlawfully refused to deal 
with the plaintiff, acknowledging that, while courts "must be cautious in finding exception to 
the right to .refuse to deal," here, the defendant's refusal, in the context of a "prior course of 
dealing" with plaintiff, supported a finding of liability. 501 
Here, much like in Aspen Skiing and Duke Energy, there is a compelling narrative 
regarding a prior voluntary course of dealing. Specifically, Google had long-established, 
voluntary, and mutually beneficial licensing agreements with both Yelp and TripAdvisor. 
Through its agreements with these (and other) third parties, Google secured relevant and 
high-quality content for its web search product. In exchange, through their presence in 
Obtained by POLITICO
 88 
r. 
l 
Google's web search results, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and others secured web traffic, and grew 
their own businesses. 
Google developed and launched directly competing products, and then changed its 
relationship with these websites, seeking to develop its own vertical offerings by scraping the 
content of its partners, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. When the websites balked at Google's 
attempt to free-ride on their content in this manner, Google threatened to refuse to deal with 
these websites altogether, despite the parties' long-standing "voluntary (and thus presumably 
profitable) course of dealing."502 Like the Aspen defendant, Google had no efficiency 
justification for its threatened refusal to deal.503 Rather, Google's threat to remove high 
quality content that was relevant to - and desired by- it users (so desired, in fact, that 
Google appropriated and incorporated the content into its own local product) would clearly 
degrade _Google's ownp,,-_oduct. 
Thus, the only logical explanation for Google's conduct is that Google took these 
actions in order to force its partners to allow it to appropriate the valuable content they had 
created. Indeed, Google's ability to use Yelp' s content depended entirely on its monopoly 
power over general search. Twice, when Yelp was faced with a similar situation with 
Microsoft, Yelp did not hesitate to threaten to block Microsoft from crawling Yelp's website 
altogether. 504 In both cases, Microsoft negotiated with Yelp to change the way it displayed 
Yelp's data.505 By contras~, when presented with an all-or-nothing choice by Google- either 
to allow Google to use its content in Google Local, or to risk removal from Google's search 
index altogether - Yelp reacted very differently, continuing to allow Google to crawl Yelp 
and to use its content in Google's local vertical offering.506 As Professor Herbert 
Hovenkamp has warned: "We will very quickly lose the social gains to be had from

collaborative networks if we permit one dominant firm to run away with all of the private 
gains once it is in a position to do so."507 
There are some distinctions between the conduct in Aspen and Google's conduct here 
that bear mention. First, the exchange of value here is non-financial. The benefit to Google 
accrues from securing high-quality co1'1:tent, while Google's partners secure traffic. However, 
this distinction appears to be insignificant. Whether the payment is in the form of dollars or 
other benefit is of little consequence to the purpose or effect of Google's threatened refusal to 
deal.sos 
More importantly, Google ultimately did not "refuse" to deal with Yelp, and their 
relationship continues to this day. While Google never followed through on its threat to 
remove these websites entirely from its web search results, it is clear that Google's threat was. 
intended to produce, and did produce, the desired effect ( for a significant period of time), 
which was to coerce Yelp and TripAdvisor into backing down on their efforts to have their 
valuable content removed from the Google Local product. Google's threat also sent a 
message to the broader marketplace that Google could, and would, use its monopoly power 
over search to extract the fruits of its rivals' innovations. Consequently, Google's threat 
itself - although not a consummated refusal to deal - may be challenged as exclusionary 
conduct. 509 
This theory of exclusion does not reach the search preferencing conduct we assessed 
supra at pp. 78-86. Here, we view the evidence of benefit to Google stemming from its 
licensing agreements with third-party content providers as offering the critical distinction. 
Google's long-standing licensing agreements with parties such as Yelp and TripAdvisor offer 
clear and convincing proof not just of an affirmative relationship between Google and these

 90 
( 
er 
L 
complainants, but also of Google's clear benefit from its relationships with these parties 
thus providing the critical intent evidence that is missing from the search preferencing case. 
While the Universal Search complainants assert that Google's previous inclusion of 
their websites in Google's web search results constitutes proof of a "voluntary" relationship 
that benefited Google, this argument is not sufficient to create the necessary proof. The act 
of categorizing and returning websites to users is at the very heart of what Google does. It 
would defy logic to argue that, simply by virtue of indexing hundreds of billions of web 
pages ( and returning millions of websites in its general web search results), Google has 
formed a relationship with each and every one of these websites. And it would be even 
further afield to argue that, the fact that Google at one time returned its web search results in 
a one manner, and has since ch~nged the manner in which it returns those web results, 
c9nstitutes evidence that Google is abandoning some "presuma~ly profitable" course of 
dealing in favor of destroying competition. Google is certainly entitled to change the manner 
in which it returns its web search results, even if those changes disadvantage its competitors. 
However, we also understand that this right is not unlimited. To that end, we believe 
that the "scraping" conduct engaged in by Google, in contrast to.the search biasing conduct, 
goes beyond clearly established limits. This is because, here, Google not only changed its 
course of dealing toward rivals with whom it had long-standing licensing agreements, but 
also because Google acted in a manner clearly contrary to its own interests in so doing. 
Even if the Commission determines that Google's scraping conduct does not rise to 
the level of a Section 2 violation, the Commission might condemn the conduct as a stand
alone violation of Section 5 .. Indeed, a Section 5 claim could extend to Google's scraping 
conduct even where no prior relationship existed (for example, Google's scraping of

Amazon's product ranking information, which was never part of any licensing agreement 
between the parties). Under this approach, Google's conduct can be analogized to the 
imposition of higher costs, through onerous tenns of dealing, on websites whose content 
Google deems the most valuable to its own web search product.510 Viewed in this way, 
condemnation of Google's conduct depends not on any prior established relationship with the 
affected vertical websites, but rather, on Google's motivation in scraping content from high
quality vertical competitors - the motivation to keep vertical websites from siphoning users 
from Google's web search property (and thus; maintaining, preserving, or enhancing its 
monopoly position in the market for search). 
While a traditional Section 2 analysis relies on a prior course of dealing as a 
gatekeeper, or a bright line proxy, for showing that the defendant's purpose·and effect was 
anticompetitive, Section 5 empowers the Commission to demonstrate harm to the 
competitive process in other ways.511 For example, Google's threat (and willingness) to 
degrade its own web search product - by banishing high-quality vertical websites from its 
web search results altogether - suggests that Google's motive in scraping high-quality 
content from its vertical competitors was not procompetitive. 
b. 
Google's "Scraping" Has Resulted In Anticompetitive 
Effects 
As described earlier, Google's "scraping" of the content of rival vertical websites has 
resulted in hann to these vertical websites and, more broadly, to the competitive process. 
Because Google scraped information over an extended period of time, it is difficult to point 
to declines in traffic that are specifically attributable to Google's conduct. However, 
Google's conduct has arguably lessened the incentives of vertical websites like Yelp, 
TripAdvisor, CitySearch, and Amazon to innovate. 
Obtained by POLITICO
 92 
r 
More broadly, the natural and probable effect of Google's conduct is to diminish the 
incentives of other vertical websites to invest in, and to develop, new and innovative 
products.s12 Entrepreneurs may be reluctant to develop new websites, and investors may be 
reluctant to sponsor that development, recognizing that Google can use its monopoly power 
over search to simply appropriate competing content that it deems lucrative to its own search 
empire.513 Further, Google's conduct suggests that Google itself has failed to innovate, as it 
would have to have done in the absence of scraping content from its rivals. 
c. 
Google's "Scraping" Is Not Justified By Efficiencies 
Google's main defense for its conduct is that, by authorizing Google to crawl and 
index content, these websites, in effect, acquiesced to Google's use of this content in any 
manner Google deemed appropriate. Google argues that websites like Yelp could simply 
have refused to allow Google to crawl their content at any time. As discussed above, 
however, Yelp and others believed that remaining in Google's index was critical to survival, 
and as such, could not afford to simply block Google from crawling their websites altogether. 
At no time was Google under the impression that its use of Yelp content in Google Local was 
acceptable to Yelp. 
Marissa Mayer and Sameer Samat testified that it was extraordinarily difficult for 
Google, as a technical matter, to remove sites like Yelp from Google Local without also 
removing them from its web search results.s14 Google's almost immediate compliance after 
Yelp sent a formal "cease and desist" letter to Google, however, suggests that the "technical" 
hurdles were not a significant factor in Google's refusal to comply with repeated requests to 
remove competitor content from Google Local.sis Indeed, parties have long been allowed to 
"opt out" of inclusion with Google's vertical news offering, Google News.s16

In sum, the evidence shows that Google used its monopoly position in search to 
scrape content from rivals and to improve its own complementary vertical offerings, to the 
detriment of those rivals, and without a countervailing efficiency justification. Google's 
scraping conduct has helped it to maintain, preserve, and enhance Google's monopoly 
position in the markets for search and search advertising. Accordingly, we believe that this 
conduct should be condemned by the Commission. 
3. 
Google's API Restrictions 
Staff has investigated whether Google has employed anticompetitive contractual 
restrictions to prevent advertisers from using third-party tools to simultaneously manage 
campaigns on Google's search advertising platform (AdWords) and rival advertising 
platforms (e.g., Microsoft's AdCenter). As described earlier, Microsoft has alleged that 
Google is denying Microsoft critical scale by employing these restrictions, and thus 
impairing Microsoft's ability to compete effectively in the markets for general search and 
search advertising. We conclude that Google's API restrictions violate Section 2. 
Google's introduction of the AdW ords API was a clearly procompetitive 
development that benefitted advertisers, SEMs, and Google alike. However, the restrictive 
conditions in the API usage agreement have anticompetitive effects without offsetting 
precompetitive benefits. They impede the efficient use of advertisers' own campaign data, 
creating additional, unnecessary transaction costs for advertisers that might wish to use that 
data to run advertising campaigns on other search networks. The restrictive conditions are 
not inherently tied to the product. Accordingly, we may evaluate Google's inclusion of the 
restrictive conditions as a stand-alone act and weigh their anticompetitive effects against any 
potential procompetitive benefits. 517

Should the restrictive conditions be found to be unreasonable restraints of trade, they 
could be removed today instantly, with no adverse effect on the functioning .of the APL Any 
additional engineering required to make the advertiser data interoperable with other search 
networks would be supplied by other market participants .. Notably, because Google would 
not be required to give its competitors access to the AdW ords API, there is no concern about 
whether Google has a duty to deal with its competitors. 518 
a. 
The Restrictive Conditions Are Unreasonable 
The restrictive conditions limit the ability of advertisers to make use of their own data 
and, by doing so, they prevent the development and sale of third party tools and services that 
would allow automated campaign management across multiple search networks. The 
restrictions do not affect advertisers that build their own campaign management tools, nor do 
they a.m~ct third-party tools and services that_ manually export the calllpaign data and then 
upload that data into a campaign on another search network. 
While Google emphasizes how much is allowed under the terms and conditions, it is 
undeniable that the restrictions constrain the development and sale of cross-network 
campaign management tools and services. SEMs have had to remove campaign cloning 
functionality that they have developed. They are unable to develop or offer tools and 
services that use algorithms - which can operate continuously and at scale - to perform 
cross-network campaign management and optimization.519 Even Google is constrained by 
these restrictions, having had to forgo improving its DART Search tool to offer such 
capabilities, despite internal estimates that such functionality would benefit Google and 
advertisers alike. 520

The restrictive conditions are unreasonable if their anticompetitive effects outweigh 
their procompetitive virtues. Our investigation has shown that the restrictive conditions do 
not have any procompetitive virtues, whereas their anticompetitive effects, while difficult to 
measure, are substantial. 
b. 
The Restrictive Conditions Have Resulted In 
Anticompetitive Effects 
The restrictive conditions harm competition in three broad ways. They reduce 
innovation, increase transaction costs, and degrade the quality of Google's rivals in search 
and search advertising. 
As noted above, several SEMs have been forced to remove campaign cloning 
functionality by Google. Beyond removing these products from the marketplace, Google's 
restrictive conditions have created a profound disincentive for tool developers to innovate in 
this area. A high performance cross-network campaign management tool would need to be a 
sophisticated product, able to allocate and adjust bids on keywords in different auctions with 
different and rapidly shifting competitive environments. However well the first-generation 
tools performed, it seems obvious that their performance would only have improved as SEMs 
and their clients tested these tools in the field. Google's restrictive conditions stopped this 
market segment in its infancy. There would be little to no demand for a cross-network 
management tool without the prospect of accessing the dominant search network, AdW ords. 
Google's imposition of the restrictive conditions has increased the transaction costs 
for all advertisers other than those large enough to make the internal investments to develop 
their own campaign management tools.521 For the rest, they must devote additional staff time 
to manage multiple parallel campaigns. Some may choose to use work-arounds, by which 
they download their AdWords campaigns into CSV (or plain-text) files, make the requisite 
Obtained by POLITICO
 96 
r 
l 
changes, then upload them into other search networks - a process they must repeat every 
time they make any changes to their campaign (for active advertisers, this can be a step they 
must make continuously). Others may just manage the campaigns separately. Either way, it 
is clear that the cost of managing campaigns is higher than it would otherwise be, but for the 
restrictive conditions, and clearly transaction costs can decrease advertising spend. 522 
Facing higher transaction costs, economic logic indicates that many advertisers would 
forgo advertising on non-dominant search networks, while others who do advertise on the 
other networks spend less time managing those campaigns, with a corresponding decrease in 
spend.523 As noted above, multi-homing data appears to support the former effect.524 As to 
the latter effect, as described earlier, a recent Microsoft study suggests that multi-homing 
advertisers bid on significantly more keywords on Google's AdWords platform than on 
_ Microsoft's f\dCen_!er __ p}a!~()~,_p~rticularly on critical "tail" keywords.525 
Google suggests that its API restrictions have de minimis effects because, as 
described earlier, the largest advertisers (who account for a significant portion of overall 
revenue) already multi-home.526 But Google ignores the importance of the substantial 
number of smaller advertisers who do not multi-home. This group of advertisers is critical to 
Microsoft, not just in expanding its coverage over a larger portion of queries, but specifically 
in covering "tail" queries, particularly those queries geared toward local markets.527 For 
example, while Microsoft might be able to display a generic ad for 1-800-FLOWERS in 
response to a query seeking "flowers in Washington, D.C.," Google would potentially have a 
far richer offering in this area, with numerous smaller advertisers providing the user with a 
"fully built out set of choices."528

97 
L 
Moreover, Google ignores the possibility that even larger advertisers that multi-home 
would do so more without the restrictions. As described above, Microsoft's internal studies 
suggest that advertisers who advertise on both platforms do so unevenly and unequally, thus 
leading to better, more targeted, and more relevant ads on AdW ords than on AdCenter. As 
described earlier, having the "right" ad for the "right" user at the "right" time is critical to a 
search engine's ability to improve its ad-serving algorithms and its revenue-per-search (or 
RPS). 529 The lack of smaller advertisers, combined with the lack of regular optimization by 
even the larger adve1iisers who advertise on both platforms, places Microsoft in a 
significantly inferior position to Google in terms of being able to provide that "right" ad for 
the "right" user at the "right" time. 
While the magnitude of these effects are unclear, their direction is clear: advertisers 
are spending less on the non-dominant search networks. For advertisers, this means forgone 
advertising opportunities that presumably would have been profitable, but for the restrictive 
conditions. For Google's rivals, the diminished spend resulting from the restrictive 
conditions means lost revenue, which diminishes their ability to invest in quality 
improvements in search. The reduction in ads placed also reduces the overall quality of the 
ads served on the rival search networks, which reduces the usefulness of the ads served to 
users, reducing, in tum, users' propensity to click on ads, an effect that broadly degrades the 
quality of the rival search network. It is also possible, though more speculative, that reduced 
ad quality may modestly reduce the usefulness of the rival search engines, particularly on 
very commercial queries, which in tum may suppress the number of searches performed on 
the rival networks. The degradation of Google's rivals both as advertising platforms and as 
Obtained by POLITICO
 98 
[ 
search engines would be, in effect, the inverse of the virtuous circle from. which Google 
benefits. 530 
c. 
The Restrictive Conditions Are Not Justified By 
Efficiencies 
The restrictive conditions are not functionally connected to the API in any way. They 
do not make it run faster, better or more securely.531 The only justification Google offers for 
the restrictive conditions is to correct what Google calls a "misalignment of incentives" for 
SEMs and agencies serving as intermediaries between Google and advertisers seeking to 
advertise on AdWords.532 Google's stated concern is that SEMs and agencies have an 
incentive to cut engineering and personnel costs in developing tools and services for cross
network campaign management, and, as a result, they will likely adopt a "lowest comm.on 
denominator" approach, which would diminish the performance of campaigns run on 
AdW ~~ds. 533 On~ Go~gl~- executive described SEMs' and agencies' 1ncent1ves asfollows: 
There wasn't a lot of focus on what the return on investment was. It was more 
focused on the volume of clicks being driven through the system.. And, in 
turn, they wanted to build the least cost software possible. And the way to do 
that is to be able to put all this stuff together in one interface and race to what 
we would call often the lowest comm.on denominator. Essentially ... cherry
picking the features from each ad network that were common, but not 
necessarily showing the distinction or the qualitative pieces that were different 
about each ad network to the advertiser. 534 
This concern about "misaligned incentives" is the only justification offered by 
Google for the restrictive conditions. 535 The evidence shows that this justification is 
unsubstantiated and is likely a pretext. All of the SEMs and agencies we spoke to described 
the critical importance of delivering a high return on investment to their clients.536 
Numerous SEMs and agencies provide their services in a highly competitive environment. 537 
Economic logic dictates that SEMs and agencies that fail to deliver campaign management

tools that perform well will lose clients. In fact, even if SEMs and agencies were in no 
danger of losing their clients' business, they would still have a strong incentive to improve 
their clients' returns as a way to encourage their clients to spend more on search advertising, 
increasing the third parties' commissions in the process. In a round-table discussion hosted 
by Google, SEMs and agencies made this exact point to Google. 538 In brief, these third 
parties incentives are highly aligned with Google's interests, precisely the opposite of what 
Google contends. 539 
Google, meanwhile, is unable to identify any concrete examples of any ill effects 
from the purportedly misaligned incentives of SEMs and agencies. Google has represented 
to advertisers and agencies that "we have found that advertisers experience higher returns 
when all AdWords functionality is available to them in a clear,functionally discrete, and 
coherent manner."540 However, Google has no such evidence.541 Google did investigate the 
potential influence SEMs·would have on the rate of spending by their clients, and determined 
that the spend for advertisers represented by SEMs increased at a higher rate than did spend 
for other advertisers.542 Google has not engaged in any experiments to determine what effect 
relaxing the restrictive terms and conditions might have. 543 
Moreover, there is already a different provision in the API AdWords Terms and 
Conditions that adequately addresses any concern about misaligned incentives. As a 
condition of using the API, SEMs and other tool developers are required to expose a Google
defined set of minimum functionality.544 The required minimum functionality provision 
directly addresses any legitimate concerns that Google might have about SEMs failing to 
expose important features of AdW ords to their advertiser clients. Google has not explained 
how the required minimum_functionality requirement is inadequate in this regard. 
Obtained by POLITICO
 100 
[ 
Meanwhile, the required minimum functionality requirement does not interfere more than 
necessary with how third parties design their tools and services. The restrictive conditions, 
on the other hand, have a substantially wider effect on how third parties conduct their 
business. 
There are also documents from 2004 that suggest that the restrictive conditions are 
not a remedy for concern about third party "misaligned incentives," but rather, were 
motivated by an anticompetitive desire to harm competitors and discourage entry: "Sergey 
[Brin] and Larry [Page] are big proponents of a protectionist strategy that prevents third party 
developers from building offerings which promote the consolidated management of 
[keywords] on Google and Overture (and whomever else)."545 
In one 2004 document, the API product manager was looking for "specific points on 
how we can prevent a new entrant(J\tiSN Ad Network) from benefitting from a common 3rd 
party platform that is cross-network."546 In a related presentation, Google listed as a concern 
"other competitors are buoyed by lowered barriers to entry" and, two options to address that 
concern: (1) "applications must have Google-centric UI functions and branding" (i.e., the 
comingling restriction); and (2) "disallow cross-network compatible applications from using 
API" (i.e., the copying restriction).547 
The same document lists, as a separate concern, "Google differentiators are 
normalized away," which appears to be an alternative formulation of the lowest common 
denominator concern. The option listed for that concern is "enforce must-have functionality 
in certified applications. "548 This 2004 language appears to refer to what is now known as 
the "required minimum functionality" provision of the API terms and conditions.549 As 
noted previously, under this provision, SEM tools must expose all of the functionality that

Google deems important to the performance of AdWords. Although Google now claims that 
the required minimum functionality condition and the restrictive conditions are both aimed at 
the lowest common denominator concern, 550 it cannot explain why the required minimum 
functionality requirement alone would not suffice to alleviate the lowest common 
denominator concern. Indeed, this document suggests that the restrictive conditions were 
actually designed specifically to reduce the likelihood that advertisers would extend their 
campaigns to rival search networks.551 
In sum, the effects of these restrictive conditions, combined, have the tendency to 
preserve and enhance Google's dominant position in the search advertising market. 
Unjustified by any procompetitive benefits, we believe that Google's restrictive conditions 
should be condemned by the Commission. 552 
4. 
Google's Exclusive and Restrictive Syndication Agreements 
Staff has investigated whether Google has entered into anticompetitive, exclusionary 
agreements with websites for syndicated search and search advertising services (AdSense 
agreements) that serve to maintain, preserve, or enhance Google's monopoly power in the 
markets for search, search advertising, or search and search advertising syndication ( search 
intermediation). We conclude that these agreements violate Section 2. 
a. 
Google's Agreements Foreclose a Substantial Portion of the 
Relevant Market 
Exclusive deals by a monopolist harm competition by foreclosing rivals from needed 
relationships with distributors, suppliers, or end users. For example, in Microsoft, then
defendant Microsoft's exclusive agreements with original equipment manufacturers and 
software vendors were deemed anticompetitive where they were found to prevent third 
parties from installing rival browser Netscape, thus foreclosing Netscape from the most

r 
efficient distribution charinel, and helping Microsoft to preserve its operating system 
monopoly.553 The fact that an agreement is not explicitly exclusive does not preclude a 
finding of liability.554 
The Microsoft decision instructs that the plaintiff is required to establish "a significant 
degree of foreclosure. "555 The competitive effects analysis for exclusive dealing under 
Section 2 is similar to the analysis under.Section 1. Under both Section 1 and Section 2, in 
order to determine the anticompetitive effects of exclusive agreements, courts consider the 
percentage of the market foreclosed to competitors and the duration of the foreclosure. 556 
However, a smaller degree of foreclosure may be sufficient to condemn an exclusive 
agreement under Section 2. In Microsoft, the D.C. Circuit noted that: 
[While] basic prudential concerns relevant to § § 1 and 2 are admittedly the 
same ... we agree with plaintiffs that a monopolist's use of exclusive contracts, 
in certain ~tr~lJ!llStances,. may.give rise to a.§ 2 violation even t~ough the 
contracts foreclose less than the roughly 40% or 50% share usually required in 
order to establish a § 1 violation. 557 
Foreclosure percentage is properly defined as the percentage of a market subject to 
the exclusive dealing arrangement in question. However, the case law suggests several 
different ways to calculate foreclosure percentages. In Omega Environmental, Inc. v. 
Gilbarco Inc., the Ninth Circuit held that foreclosure was accurately described in quantitative 
terms as the overall market share subject to the defendant's exclusive arrangements.558 In the 
alternative, foreclosure could be defined as the percentage of distribution outlets unavailable 
to rivals.559 
Here, under either formulation, the likely foreclosure by Google's exclusive dealing 
arrangements appears sufficient to support a monopolization claim under Section 2.560 In 
calculating foreclosure numbers, Staff has relied on the ComScore datas·et, which is a third

party dataset routinely used in the industry to analyze query volumes and market shares. 561 
As noted earlier, however, in a company data set provided by Microsoft, Yahoo! 's syndicated 
query volume is significantly higher than that reflected in ComScore. 562 Reliance on the 
larger figure would clearly result in a dramatically lower foreclosure number for Google's 
agreements. We are trying to get to the bottom of this discrepancy now. However, based on 
our broader understanding of the market, we believe that the ComScore set more accurately 
reflects the relative query shares of each party.563 
Below, Staff lays out three scenarios: the most conservative foreclosure scenario; the 
n;iost aggressive foreclosure scenario; and the "intermediate" - or most likely defensible 
foreclosure scenario. In our most conservative estimate, the foreclosure rate is approximately 
20 percent. 564 In our most aggressive estimate, the foreclosure rate is approximately 66 
percent.565 In the "intermediate" scenario, the foreclosure rate is approximately 52 
percent. 566 
Obviously, given the limitations of the various datasets, the calculated foreclosure 
rates are of limited value. Nevertheless, it is clear that Google has tied up a substantial 
portion of this distribution channel with exclusive and restrictive agreements. In the market 
for search syndication, Google has exclusive or restrictive agreements with 12 of the top 20 
companies (60 percent) and 4 of the top 5 (80 percent). The 20 largest companies account 
for 94 percent of total query volume.567 Courts have found that foreclosing rivals from the 
most efficient means of distribution can be especially problematic. 568 Access to these largest 
players is by far the most efficient method for Bing to gain query volume in the syndication 
channel. 569

b. 
Google's Agreements Have Resulted In Anticompetitive 
Effects 
Measuring foreclosure is merely the first step in assessing competitive effects in an 
exclusive dealing case. Once we establish that foreclosure is above so-called "safe harbor" 
levels, we still must undertake a qualitative, rule ofreason analysis of actual market 
effects.570 There are two potential anticompetitive effects flowing from Google's exclusive 
agreements with publishers. The agreements may impact both the immediate market for 
search and search advertising syndication, and also have broader effects in the markets for 
search and search advertising. 
We tum first to the search and search advertising syndication (search intermediation) 
market. There, our investigation shows that the exclusivity provisions are precluding at least 
some of the largest and most sophisticated publishers from using competing platforms for a 
subset of their syndication needs. This also means those publishers cannot credibly threaten 
to shift some incremental business to other platforms in order to wring price concessions 
from Google. 
In light of the fact that Google is aggressively reducing revenue shares to its 
customers without significant resistance today, the exclusive agreements appear to be having 
the effect of further entrenching Google's monopoly position in the market for search and 
search advertising syndication, and facilitating Google's maintenance of monopoly power in 
the market for search advertising. 
One might object to this argument by noting that Google is holding onto its business 
with most of these publishers mainly because its product is so superior to the other offerings 
available today. This argument is further bolstered by the fact that a substantial majority of

[ 
the publishers we interviewed did not object to exclusivity because they wanted to use 
Google for all their search syndication needs anyway. 
Our investigation indicates that this objection rests on a fallacious assumption: 
namely, that Bing's average monetization gap is derived from its consistent failings across
the-board. If, instead, that overall average is derived from sources of differing quality, that 
means Bing actually does have opportunities to pick off incremental business from Google in 
those areas where the monetization gap is lower, particularly where it can make up for some 
of its monetization deficiencies by offering higher revenue shares. Evidence from Microsoft 
indicates that there is indeed heterogeneity in the quality of its search advertising product, 
with comparative strength in certain commercial categories, such as travel and people 
(social) search.571 
Given this state of affairs, one likely path for Bing to win new syndication business is 
precisely the one blocked by the exclusivity provisions in Google's syndication agreements. 
All the publishers that expressed interest in using Bing told us that they want to split up their 
business, giving Bing opportunities where it can compete, and relying on Google for the 
balance of their needs. 
In addition to the immediate impact on Bing, our investigation suggests that specialty 
search advertising platforms may emerge in the absence of Google's exclusivity provisions. 
For example, IAC's CityGrid property·sought to build its own advertising platform to serve 
advertising targeted to local markets.572 CityGrid monetizes its websites through local ads 
from small "mom and pop" stores, medium-sized businesses, and large chains that are trying 
to gain local customers. 573 CityGrid decided that it wanted to build its own advertising 
network rather than "put all [its] eggs in one basket" by going with Google exclusively.574 
Obtained by POLITICO
 106 
CityGrid would like to provide a niche competitive alternative to Google's AdSense 
network, but it is hampered by Google's exclusivity provisions. The exclusivity provisions 
prevent CityGrid from winning prominent placement on the publisher websites where its 
local advertisements would be most effective. Due to these challenges, CityGrid is having 
only modest success, and has struggled to attract both advertisers and publishers willing to 
use an alternative platform. 575 It is unclear whether smaller search advertising networks like 
CityGrid can ultimately emerge (and thrive) in the absence of exclusivity, but CityGrid's 
experience suggests that nascent competition may be suppressed by Google's exclusivity 
provisions. 
The exclusivity provisions also have broader effects in the markets for search and 
search advertising. Microsoft argues that the intent- and the ultimate effect- of Google's 
. 
re.strictive syndication agreements is to preve11t Microsoft from achieving the necessary scale 
to compete effectively against Google.576 Microsoft reports that it could substantially benefit 
from serving a portion of the query and advertising volume from some of Google's largest 
syndication customers. 577 As noted above, a small number of the largest and most 
sophisticated customers believe they could benefit from contracting with Bing for some parts 
of their syndication business and would likely do so in the absence of exclusivity provisions 
in their Google contract. 
It is difficult to predict whether removing exclusivity would enable Bing to win 
enough traffic through new search syndication deals to meaningfully improve its overall 
search product. Google argues that the scale effects resulting from Microsoft winning some 
incremental syndication query traffic would be trivial, 578 while Microsoft asserts that even a

L 
5 to 10 percent increase in its overall query traffic would be "very meaningful" because Bing 
is at the lower part of the scale curve where "each percentage point is critical."579 
While there is not enough evidence on this point to reach definitive conclusions, 
internal Google documents suggest that Microsoft's view of things may be closer to the truth. 
Google's interest in renewing deals with some of its largest syndication customers may have 
been, in part, to keep Microsoft from gaining scale. For example, an internal Google analysis 
of the 2010 AOL renewal exp~ains: 
AOL holds marginal search share but represents scale gains for a 
Microsoft+ Yahoo! partnership .... AOL/Microsoft combination has 
modest impact on market dynamics, but material increase in scale of 
Microsoft's search & ads platform. 580 
When a senior Google executive was informed that "Microsoft [is] aggressively 
wooing AOL with large guarantees," he responded that: 
I think the worse case scenario here is that AOL users get sent to Bing, so 
even if we make AOL a bit more competitive relative to Google, that 
seems preferable to growing Bing.581 
According to Google documents, the company sought to pursue the AOL deal aggressively 
even though AOL represented "[a] low/no profit partnership for Google .... "582 
While the evidence summarized above is consistent with the theory that these 
exclusive dealing arrangements are creating anticompetitive effects, there are nevertheless 
some significant limitations in this evidence. Perhaps our biggest concern is that, today, so 
few publishers are actively interested in using multiple suppliers. As noted earlier, we have 
identified only three companies that are subject to the exclusivity or "preferred placement" 
provisions today and clearly voicing unambiguous concerns: eBay, NexTag, and 
Business.com. In addition to these three companies, Amazon is not foreclosed today, but 
voiced very similar concerns and is very worried that it may be subject to exclusivity in the

 108 
f 
L 
future, and so likely would support the views of the three foreclosed companies that are 
actively complaining. Finally, IAC is among those companies foreclosed today, and has 
previously voiced strong concerns, but in its most recent discussion with Staff, appeared to 
back away from some of those concerns. 
None of the complaining companies told us they would shift large segments of their. 
existing business with Google to Microsoft if exclusivity were lifted. The complainants all 
confirm that Microsoft's product monetizes at a much lower average rate than Google's, so 
they are only likely to shift a modest percentage of their available business to Microsoft.583 
The best real world evidence we have as to what using multiple providers will look like 
comes from Amazon, which is the only company that is currently using both Google and 
Microsoft for search syndication. Microsoft represents just 3.4 percent of Amazon's 
worldwide search syndicatiqn reve_nue, because, atpresent, Mic~osoft monetizes _so poorly in 
relation to Google.584 
At least in the near-term, this evidence suggests that the effects of removing 
exclusivity are not going to be dramatic. Rather, it appears that a subset of the largest and 
most sophisticated publishers will opportunistically shift modest amounts of their available 
traffic to Bing. The less sophisticated publishers appear likely to continue using Google 
exclusively because Google_'s product is better, they perceive that there are technical barriers 
or other problems associated with using multiple suppliers, or some combination of these 
issues. 
More significant competitive benefits may be realized over a longer period of time. 
Removing exclusivity may open up additional opportunities for both established and nascent 
competitors, and those opportunities may spur more significant changes in the market

dynamics as publishers have the opportunity to consider - and test - alternatives to Google's 
AdSense program. While the speed and strength of these long-term improvements cannot be 
accurately forecast today, this is a situation where the near-term competitive impacts may be 
overshadowed by the long-term improvements, as competitive forces are unleashed and 
additional dynamism emerges. 
c. 
Google's Agreements Are Not Justified By Efficiencies 
Google has offered three business justifications for its exclusive and restrictive 
syndication agreements with publishers. First, Google notes that there is a long-standing 
industry practice in favor of exclusivity dating from the time when the publishers demanded 
large, guaranteed revenue share payments rega;rdless of actual performance. However, 
guaranteed revenue shares are now virtually non-existent. 
A second, and related, justification is that Google is simply engaging in a vigorous 
competition with Microsoft for exclusive agreements. Although Microsoft asserts that it 
would like the opportunity to compete on a non-exclusive basis· ( and will happily serve even 
a small portion of a website publisher's queries), some publishers report that Microsoft itself 
· sought various forms of exclusivity in contract negotiations.585 Moreover, while Microsoft 
has aggressively pursued some very large website publishers, it appears that Microsoft is not 
generally pursuing the broader syndication business today.586 Google may argue that the fact 
that Microsoft is losing in a competitive bidding process ( and indeed, not competing as 
vigorously as it might otherwise) is not a basis on which to condemn Google. However, 
Google has effectively created the rules of today's game, and Microsoft's substantial 
monetization disadvantage puts it in a poor competition position to compete on an all-or
nothing basis. 
Obtained by POLITICO
 110 
The third justification Google has offered is "user confusion." Google claims that it 
does not want users to confuse a competitor's poor advertisements with its own higher 
quality advertisements. This argument suffers both from the fact that it is highly unlikely 
that users care about the source of the ad, as well as the fact that, if users did care, less 
restrictive alternatives are clearly available. Google has not explained why alternatives such 
as labeling competitor advertisements as originating from the competitor are unavailing here. 
Indeed, Google's actions demonstrate that "user confusion" is not a significant 
concern .. In 2008 Google attempted to enter into a non-exclusive agreement with Yahoo! to 
supplement Yahoo!'s search advertising platform. Under the proposed agreement, Yahoo! 
would return its own search advertising, but supplement its inventory with Google search 
advertisements when Yahoo! did not have sufficient inventory.587 Additionally, Google has 
recently eliminated its "preferred placement" res~rictio11 for its online partners.588 
In sum, a rule of reason analysis of the exclusivity provisions shows strong evidence 
of a relevant market protected by high entry barriers. There are some significant data 
limitations associated with calculating foreclosure accurately here, but it appears the level of 
foreclosure is likely modestly above the minimum level necessary to support a finding of 
competitive injury. At least some customers are being precluded from using Bing due to the 
exclusivity provisions of their agreements with Google. The procompetitive justifications for 
this conduct appear fairly insubstantial, although Microsoft's efforts to impose exclusivity 
will complicate our proof on that issue. However, there are not pervasive anticompetitive 
effects throughout the market, which will bolster the criticism that the putative 
anticompetitive effects here are too speculative to be cognizable in the context of an antitrust 
claim.

While we acknowledge the limited effects here, it is worth noting that the market for 
search and search advertising syndication is, inarguably, not robustly competitive today. 
Google has been unilaterally reducing revenue share percentages to many of its syndication 
customers (in effect raising prices) with apparent impunity.589 One of the largest customers, 
Amazon, decided that it is in its long-term, strategic interest to funnel some query volume to 
Bing, even if it is losing money on each query.590 Amazon is using multiple suppliers just to 
try to foster a more competitive marketplace.591 Where markets are functioning so poorly, 
the rationale for government intervention is stronger, even in situations where the near-term 
competitive harm directly attributable to the challenged conduct may be small. Although this 
conduct presents a closer question, we believe that Google's exclusive and restrictive 
agreements have not only helped to maintain, preserve, and enhance Google's monopoly 
power in the market for search and search advertising syndication (search intermediation), 
but also in the underlying markets for search and search advertising. Therefore, we believe 
that the Commission should condemn Google's exclusive and restrictive syndication 
agreements. 
IV. 
POTENTIAL REMEDIES 
Staff has identified several possible remedies to Google's conduct. These remedies 
are described below. 
A. 
Scraping 
There are at least two possible remedies for Google's scraping conduct. First, 
Google could be required to provide an "opt-out" feature to remove "snippets" of website 
content (e.g., user reviews, ratings) from Google's vertical properties, but retain those 
Obtained by POLITICO
 112 
snippets in Google's web search results and/or in its Universal Search results on the main 
SERP.s92 
Second, Google could be required to limit the use of content it indexes for its web 
search results (i.e., Google can only use the content in returning the property in its natural 
search results, but not in determining its own product or local rankings), unless given express 
permission to use it for other purposes. This remedy could address Google's less obvious 
"scraping" of third-party product and ranking information in order to determine its own 
. product collection and rankings. 
B. 
API Restrictions 
The most appropriate remedy for Google's API restrictions is to require Google to 
remove the problematic contractual restrictions from its API license.593 No technical fixes 
wollW_li~ve to be un.clertaken to aUow for full compatibility among the various search 
advertising platforms. Indeed, SEMs report that innovative technology for this cross
compatibility already exists, and, if left unhindered by Google's contractual restraints, will 
quickly flourish. 594 
C. 
Exclusive and Restrictive Syndication Agreements 
The most appropriate remedy for Google's exclusive and restrictive syndication 
agreements is to enjoin Google from entering into exclusive agreements with its search 
syndication partners, as well as to require Google to substantially loosen restrictions 
surrounding AdSense partners' use of rival search advertisements. As described above, a 
small, but significant, group of Google's Ad Sense partners have indicated that they would 
like to supplement their websites with Microsoft's search advertisements. The number of

LITIGATION RISKS 
We have identified throughout this memorandum the many substantial risks 
associated with bringing a case against Google. On a global level, the record will permit 
Google to show substantial innovation, intense competition from Microsoft and others, and 
speculative long-run harm. Here, we highlight some specific facts that present the greatest 
litigation risk:

"Competition is just one click away."596 Google does not charge consumers, 
and they are not locked into Google. The durability of Google's monopoly 
power is questionable with an increasing number of websites (e.g., Face book, 
Twitter) competing for user time and advertiser dollars. 
Universal Search is a "product improvement" that has resulted in substantial 
benefit to its users. 
Google's organization and aggregation of content from other websites adds 
value to the product for consumers. 
The largest advertisers (that produce the most revenue on Google's AdWords 
platform and Microsoft's Ad Center platform) already advertise on both 
AdWords and AdCenter. 
The most efficient channel through which Bing can gain scale is Bing.com, 
not syndication or other distribution channels.

not want to switch even part of their supply to Microsoft.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Staff concludes that Google's conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to 
consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets. Google has 
strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive 
means, and has forestalled competitors' and would-be competitors' ability to challenge those 
monopolies, and this will have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare. Specifically, 
Staff believes that: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general search and 
search advertising, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise engaged in unfair 
methods of competition, in violation of Section 5, by scraping content from 
rival vertical websites in order to improve its own product offerings. 
Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general search, search 
advertising, and search syndication, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise 
engaged in unfair methods of competition, in violation of Section 5, by 
entering into exclusive and highly restrictive agreements with web publishers 
that prevent publishers from displaying competing search results or search 
advertisements. 
Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general search and 
search advertising, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise engaged in unfair 
methods of competition, in violation of Section 5, by maintaining contractual 
restrictions that inhibit the cross-platform management of advertising 
campaigns.

45 Contextual ads are somewhat more successful at creating conversions than direct display ads, but less 
successful than search. Contextual advertising is considered a closer substitute for display advertising than for 
search advertising in terms of function and performance. See, e.g., Group MIR (Oct. 11, 2011); Expedia IR 
(Jan. 23, 2012). See also, e.g., GOOG-ITA-03-0045511-17 (2009), at 16 ("content conversions do not lead to 
sales like search conversions"); Brin Tr. 181: 1-8 ("the conversions are different. The click-through is also 
different . . . . So between the two of those, your average content page view is worth significantly less than 
your average search page, no question about it"). 
46 See Didit.com IR (Dec. 27, 2011); GOOGFOX-000073028 (2008), at 14. "Re-targeting" means serving ads 
to users that have abandoned purchases before completed, or who have visited certain websites in the past. Like 
search, this type of ad is meant to elicit a direct response, but - unlike search ads - re-targeted ads are not 
shown in response to a user's declared intent. Clickable IR (Oct. 24, 2011) (re-targeted display advertising 
requires advertisers to act on behavioral calculations and inferences from large troves of data, and does not 
generate leads or sales as well as search advertising). 
47 See Didit.com IR (Dec. 27, 2011); Wal-Mart IR (Jan. 23, 2012). Social media advertising appears to be more 
like display advertising in that it offers a large volume of impressions, but relatively few conversions. See 
Facebook IR (Jul. 1,2011); Facebook IR (Jan. 24, 2012). See also Matt Lawson, How to Integrate Search and 
Social Media/or Better Results, Mashable, Apr. 1, 2010, http:/lmashable.com/2010/04/01/paid-search-social
media/ (Director of marketing for Marin Software discussing how to develop and integrate paid search and 
social media advertising strategies; social and search advertising are "two distinctly different tactics - the bid
based, conversion-obsessed, ROI-driven world of paid search and the experimental, brand-building, hard-to
measure world of social ... each provide different benefits to your business, so you should leverage their 
strengths instead of trying to get them to deliver results that aren't suited to the medium. Marketers usually 
participate in social media to create an active dialogue with consumers around their products and services, with 
the main goal of building brand value, and a secondary goal of driving sales. On the other hand, marketers use 
paid search primarily to drive sales, leads, and conversions, and don't expect the short text of their paid search 
ads to do much for branding"). 
48 Contextual advertising is limited by the amount of advertising space available on web pages addressing any 
given topic, in which relevant ads can then be served. Re-targeted ( or behavioral) advertising is limited by the 
number of "cookies" users allow to be placed on their computers (and on how often those cookies are erased), 
and also requires guesswork and heavy analysis on the part of the advertiser. See GOOGFOX-000073028 
(2008), at 13; Interpublic IR (Oct. 20, 2011); FTC-EBAY-00000002 (2012), at 31 (eBay and Shopping.com 
spent an "insignificant" amount on contextual advertising). FTCNext-00000002 (2012), at 36 (non-search 
advertising cannot replace search advertising). Social media is still a maturing market, which remains quite 
small. Moreover, neither Facebook nor Twitter has been very successful in generating conversions, despite the 
information they have available on the interests of their users (see Facebook IR (Jul. 1, 2011; Jan. 24, 2012); 
Twitter IR (Dec. 13, 2011)), and both Living Social and General Motors have pulled the majority of their social 
media budgets based on a failure to achieve acceptable conversion rates. See Living Social CID Response

52 Google purchased the Android business in 2005. 
53 Since Google's release of the first commercially available mobile device running Android OS in October 
2008, Android's market share has grown exponentially. In Sep. 2009, Apple garnered 24.1 percent share of

U.S. mobile subscribers, compared with Android's 2.5 percent. By Nov. 2010, Android's market share of 26 
percent had surpassed Apple's 25 percent share. By Apr. 2012, Android enjoyed slightly more than 50 percent 
share, while Apple's share was 31.4 percent. Apple's market share appears to be plateauing, while Android's 
share continues to skyrocket, having successfully cannibalized RIM's rapidly declining base. See Press

Microsoft suggests that users are twice as likely to switch away from Bing for "tail" (or less frequent) queries 
than for "head" (or popular) queries, for which Bing's results are of high quality. The same study notes that, 
once a user has switched away from Bing, he or she is unlikely to return in the same session, and that Bing loses 
approximately three percent of its volume to searches by users who switch and do not return in the same

advantage in spelling correction and suggestions. A study conducted by Microsoft suggests that, where Bing's

78 Brin Tr. 154:5-14. Brin did not state this premise as a mathematical certainty, only as an illustration of the 
"diminishing returns" curve. Preston McAfee, Yahoo!' s former chief economist, suggested that "having 2-3 
times as many user observations," particularly for "tail" queries, would result in substantially more than a one 
percent increase in quality- indeed, doubling a search engine's queries would be "an enormous advantage." 
McAfee suggested that a 3-to-1 advantage in query volume could result in a 70 percent increase in "precision" 
for that search engine's ability to answer unique queries. Preston McAfee, Yahoo!, Presentation, "Scale, Data, 
and Machine Leaming: Solving the Search Problem" (2011), at 8. 
79 See Brin Tr. 154:15-158:18 (testifying that, based on publicly available information of Microsoft's query

quality). See also Michael L. Katz et al., "An Economic Analysis of Microsoft's Allegations that Google's 
Conduct Hanns Competition by Reducing Bing's Scale" (May 14, 2012), at 47 (arguing that, "because of the 
diminishing value of additional click-and-query data and Bing's substantial and growing query volume, it is 
unlikely that query data from Google's exclusive syndication and distribution arrangements would provide any 
considerable value to Bing"); id. at 104-105 (Microsoft already has a significant number of advertisers; any 
increase in ads volume or clicks would result in insignificant additional yield). 
80 See Microsoft EC Submission, at 26 ("The marginal returns for additional scale decrease once a platform 
reaches a certain scale") (Mar.31, 2011); Susan Athey, "Scale in Online Search" (Mar. 10, 2012), at 9 ("as 
query volume grows, RPS grows quickly at first and then becomes flatter, as more and more of the most 
important advertisers have already been attracted to the platform"). 
81 Microsoft estimates that, in 1997, the size of the world wide web was approximately 200 million web pages; 
by 2008, the figure was approximately 1 trillion web pages; and today, there are anywhere between 5 and 20 
trillion web pages. Susan Athey, "Scale in Online Search" (Mar. 10, 2012), at 11. See also e.g., Schmidt Tr. 
33:15-25 ("the rate of growth of the Internet appears to be accelerating, so it's getting- it's getting worse faster, 
if you will, primarily because of generation of ... user content"). 
82 Susan Athey, "Scale in Online Search" (Mar. 10, 2012), at 11. 
83 Id. To this end, Microsoft conducted an experiment in 2008 that tested the effect on user engagement of 
reversing algorithmic improvements. Microsoft found that, when it moved back to two-year-old algorithms 
(essentially eliminating two years' worth ofus·er data), the search engine "significantly reduced user 
engagement" with Microsoft's search engine. Id. at 13. Google came to the same conclusion when it removed

user click data from Google's NavBoost algorithm, which had a "significant [negative] impact" on search 
quality. Manber Tr. 122:16-123:12. 
84 However, Preston McAfee, Yahoo! 's former chief economist, suggests that, "[o]f all search engines, only 
Google may be experiencing declining returns to scale." As described earlier, supra note 78, he also stated that 
"having 2-3 times as many user observations," particularly for "tail" queries, would be "an enormous 
advantage" to a search engine. McAfee suggested that a 3-to-1 advantage in query volume could result in a 70 
percent increase in "precision" for that search engine's ability to answer unique queries. Preston McAfee, 
Yahoo!, Presentation, "Scale, Data, and Machine Leaming: Solving the Search Problem" (2011), at 8. 
85 Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012), at 8. Contrast this with Sergey Brin's testimony that Google's quality 
difference would be '"pretty marginal" with 20 percent fewer queries today. Brin Tr. 153: 1-6. See also Preston 
McAfee, Presentation, "Scale, Data, and Machine Leaming: Solving the Search Problem" (2011), at 8 
(theorizing that, "[ o ]fall search engines, only Google may be experiencing declining returns to scale"). 
86 Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012). In 2010, Yahoo! contributed some 92 billion queries to Microsoft through the 
partnership. See Microsoft Data Submission (Jan. 31, 2012). 
87 Susan Athey, Presentation, "The Role of Scale in Competing in Online Search" (Mar. 26, 2012), at 22. 
88 Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012). However, the particularities of the Microsoft-Yahoo! agreement makes things 
slightly more complex than if Bing were to run experiments directly over its own user volume. Id. 
89 Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012). See also Susan Athey and Glenn Ellison, "Share, Scale, and Platfonn Policy as 
Drivers of RPS: Together, Can Yahoo! and Microsoft Close the Gap?" (Apr. 3, 2008), at 5. 
90 Microsoft's modeling suggested an improvement of 20 percent; Microsoft has actually realized approximately 
3 percent improvement. Microsoft cites a host of complexities surrounding the agreement (e.g., payments of 
large guarantees, non-discriminatory experiments) that have so far prevented Microsoft from taking full 
advantage of the additional volume. Microsoft believes that RPS will improve in line with its initial modeling 
as it works out some of these issues. Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012). 
91 As noted earlier, Google's mobile conduct will be described in a supplemental memorandum. In addition to 
the categories of conduct described herein, Staff initially investigated several other allegations, including: (i) 
that Google was unlawfully refusing to sell search advertising to certain competitors; (ii) that Google was 
unlawfully blocking competitors' access to YouTube video content; and (iii) that Google's exclusive 
agreements with desktop distribution partners (OEMs, browsers, and independent software vendors) were 
anticompetitive. Staff has not found sufficient evidence to support these allegations, and does not discuss them 
in detail here. 
92 For example, Google removed search result pages from its index with no user testing, having detennined that 
such pages constitute spam. Google also changed its algorithm without testing to stop taking into consideration 
the co-occurrence of product comparison sites. These changes, which may have significant effects on Google's 
SERP, are often implemented through a "Changelist process" with little documentation. 
93 The "sandbox" is a closed system of Google engineers where Google runs sample queries using the new 
algorithm and makes adjustments as needed. Google IR (May 23, 2011). 
94 Id. Generally, three to five raters compare the SERPs for a new algorithm against the old algorithm and score 
the new SERP as being more or less relevant than the old SERP. RBB Economics, Google's Assessment of 
Changes to the Product Universal Results, at 4-5, Google Submission (Sep. 6 2010) (White Paper). 
95 According to Google, it conducts live tests if the SxS results show that the new algorithm provides better 
results. Google IR (May 23, 2011). Live experiments may be conducted to assess the relative number of clicks 
and abandoned searches between the new and old algorithm. Id.

119 For example, in 2008, Google had the goal to "[i]ncrease google.com product search inclusion to the level of 
google.com searches with 'product intent', while preserving clickthrough rate." GOOG-Texas-0227159-66 
(2008), at 60 ("2008 goal" for "Google.com Integration"). Google had a goal for the first quarter of 2008 to 
increase the triggering of the Product Universal to 6% for English sites. GOOG-Texas-0236963-65 (2008), at 
63. In the second quarter of 2008, that goal changed to increasing top OneBox coverage by 50 percent and top 
CTR by 10 percent, and to."[i]ncrease coverage on head queries. For example, we should be triggering on at 
least 5 of the top 10 most popular queries on amazon.com at any given time, rather than only one." GOOG
Texas-0227159-66 (2008), at 60. To increase triggering on head queries, Google also implemented a change to 
trigger the Product Universal on google.com queries if they appeared often in the product vertical. "Using 
Exact Corpusboost to Trigger Product Onebox" compares queries on www.google.com with queries on Google 
Shopping, triggers the Product OneBox if the same query is often searched in Google Shopping, and 
automatically places the universal in position 4, regardless of the quality of the universal results or user "bias" 
for top placement of the box. GOOGLR-00330279-80 (2008) (Launch Report for algorithm change). 
120 See, e.g., GOOG-Texas-0233970 (2007) (mandate from executive meeting to increase appearance of 
Universal Search results for all product-related queries as quickly as possible); GOOG-Texas-1004148-52 
(2007), at 48 ("Larry thought product should get more exposure"); GOOG-ITA-04-0004120-46 (2009), at 36

from Search to ensure strong traffic without harming user experience or AdW ords proposition for 
advertisers?"); GOOGFOX-000082469 (2009), at 4 (presentation notes that Mortgage OneBox on Google.com 
"drives traffic to consumer front end"). In order to speed up market share in shopping for Google, the shopping 
team wanted a "strategic direction to dial up google.com inclusion," and had a list of session metrics showing 
Google at #8 behind eBay, Amazon, Shopping.com, Shopzilla, etc. GOOG-Texas-0197424-29 (2008), at 24. 
121 GOOG-Texas-0191859-61 (2008), at 59 (reducing the frequency of the product universal would "ced[e] 
recent share gains to competitors"); GOOG-Texas-0214339 (2008) (Jen Fitzpatrick noting, "Long term, the 
product search team feels strongly that PS-universal is critical to maintain and increase the share of product
related (and therefore highly commercial) queries that people do on Google."); GOOGEC-0069974 (2009) 
( email from John Hanke, head of Google Local, to Marissa Mayer, "long term, I think we need to commit to a 
more aggressive path w/ google where we can show non-webpage results on google outside of the universal 
'box' ... most ofus on geo think that we won't win unless we can inject a lot more oflocal directly into google 
results."); GOOG-Texas-0199877-910 (2008), at 909 ("Google's key strengths are: Google.com real estate for 
the ~70MM of product queries/day in US/UK/DE alone"); GOOG-Texas-0909676-77 (2009), at 76 (John 
Hanke noting, "I think the mandate has to come down that we want to win [in local] and we are willing to take 
some hits [i.e., trigger incorrectly sometimes]. I think a philosophical decision needs to get made that results 
that are not web search results and that displace web pages are "OK" on google.com and nothing to be ashamed 
of. That would open the door to place page or local entities as ranked results outside of some 'local universal' 
container. Arguably for many queries_ all_ of the top 10 results should be local entities from our index with 
refinement options. The currently mentality is that the google results page needs to be primarily about web 
pages, possibly with some other annotations if they are really, really good. That's the_ big weakness that bing is 
shooting at w/ the 'decision engine' pitch-not a sea of pointers to possible answers, but real answers right on 
the page .... "). 
122 In the spring of 2008, Google estimated that the top placement of the Product Universal would lead to an 
"annualized loss of $154 million" on product queries. GOOG-Texas-0178597-607 (2008), at 598 ("Product 
Search Universal Holdback Experiment"). The advertising team requested that the Product Universal trigger 
less frequently to reduce the loss of ads revenue. The Product Search team objected, presenting to executives 
that: Google must retain and grow product queries: "We face strong competition and must move quickly. 
Turning down onebox would hamper progress as follows - Ranking: Losing click data harms ranking; 
[t]riggering Losing CTR and google.com query distribution data triggering accuracy; [c]omprehensiveness: 
Losing traffic harms merchant growth and therefore comprehensiveness; [m]erchant cooperation: Losing traffic 
reduces effort merchants put into offer data, tax, & shipping; PR: Turning off onebox reduces Google's 
credibility in commerce; [u]ser awareness: Losing shopping-related UI on google.com reduces awareness of 
Google's shopping features." GOOG-Texas-0178597-607 (2008), at 607. Rather than reducing triggering of 
the Product Universal, Google moved it down from position 1 to position 4 on the page, which reduced some 
cannibalization from the ads. See infra note 138.

123 See, e.g., GOOGFOX-000015092 (2009), at 5 (presentation suggests that Google's unique user interface for 
its mortgage vertical ad leads to greater user interaction and higher click-through rates); GOOG-Texas
0199877-910 (2008), at 881 ("Vision: Improving Google.com search and ads for product queries ... Proposed 
improvements ... PS blending: New Uis to show product results and lead to a deeper product experience"). 
124 Many subtle changes to Google's interfaces affect clicks to those links. For example, a merchant star rating 
on an Amazon ad reflecting Amazon's high rating (regardless of whether Amazon or one of its merchants is 
selling the product) increases clicks on text ads by 40 percent, Amazon CID Response at 17. Google has 
decided, however, to treat eBay ads differently and will not display a star rating for eBay based on the quality of 
eBay as a merchant, but only the rating of the underlying merchant- eBay thus does not get that increase in 
clicks which Amazon has experienced. eBay CID Response at 4-5. 
125 See, e.g., Living Social IR (Apr. 26, 2012). At one time, Google did consider third-party OneBoxes, but 
never deployed them. Mayer Tr. 83:6-84:1 (recalling that Google experimented with third-party OneBoxes in 
2005 and 2006, but abandoned the effort). 
126 Google has acknowledged that it slotted its Universal Search blends into fixed positions on its search results 
page irrespective of the so-called organic search results. Google Search Innovation White Paper, at 57-58 
(2011). However, Google argues that it is necessary to use different signals in returning organic results, which 
are triggered by a simple relevancy calculation, and vertical content, which requires an evaluation not just of 
relevancy, but of quality and other factors not identifiable by Google's organic results algorithms. See Google 
Submission to the European Commission, "Comparing Apples with Oranges, How Google Ranks Universal 
Search Results from Specialized Content-Specific Search Algorithms Within Web Search," Sep. 7, 2010. 
Microsoft also uses separate algorithms for incorporating vertical content into its search results page because of 
the differences in relevancy signals for each type ofresults. See Microsoft IR(Oct. 12, 2011). 
127 Click-through data shows that ranking position for natural search matters a great deal: 95 percent of users 
first click on rankings one through five. eBay IR (Jul. 16, 2012). See also Amazon CID Response at 21 (citing 
study performed by Tevye Krynski & Aaron Beppu, "Positional Bias White Paper" (Jul. 22, 2009), to show that 
drop in clicks from position one to position two on the SERP attributable to the position is about 37 percent, 
from position two to position three is 24 percent, and from position three to position four is 17 percent). 
128 As described earlier Google claims that it is unable to compare the quality of its own vertical properties 
against competing vertical properties. To the extent that it is unable to directly evaluate the scores of Google's 
vertical content against competitors' vertical properties, see supra note 114, this is true. However, Google 
routinely compares the quality of its vertical properties against competitors' vertical properties in seeking to 
improve the content of its own vertical properties. See supra note 116. See also Amazon CID Response at 35
37 (providing metric directly comparing the quality of Amazon's product search with Google Product Search). 
129 See, e.g., Expedia CID Response at 14 (asserting that Google Local only provides listings and links to a few 
hotels, with content of questionable quality, which is inferior to Expedia and Hotels.com which provide many 
more options and quality control); Yelp CID Response at 26-27 (listing several Yelp quality advantages 
including more and higher quality content and better filtering of unreliable reviews); TripAdvisor CID 
Response at 28-29 (alleging that the superiority ofTripAdvisor features includes amenity and attribute filtering 
of hotels, the largest corpus of user generated reviews in the travel space, personalization and friend reviews 
through connection to Facebook; sophisticated content integrity algorithms, and vacation rental property 
listings); Amazon CID Response at 35-37 (listing Amazon advantages including better access to real-time 
Amazon product availability, a catalog designed and structured for product search, and better data about 
customer behavior); Living Social CID Response at 14-16 (alleging Living Social provides a higher level of 
service to consumers and merchants than Google and at times has more daily deal offers). 
130 eBay IR (Jul. 16, 20'12). 
131 Id. This analysis does not account for the existence of navigational searches for eBay, for which users are 
likely to click on eBay in the search results. On navigational searches, however, Google does not typically 
return Google Product Search, so such results are unlikely to be included in the results here. 
132 eBay IR (Jul. 16, 2012). 
133 BE disagrees with the mode of analysis employed by eBay, noting that eBay did not account for clicks on 
advertisements or navigational clicks, see supra note 131. 
· 
134 If Google used click-through rates to determine the Universal Search positioning, Google would introduce its 
property in, say, position 5 or 10, and if users clicked on the Google property more often than the websites 
ranked above it, the property's rank would gradually increase. Or, if Google introduced the property in a higher

135 Mayer Tr. 275:10-276:11. 
136 Co-occurrence signals were used in many vertical areas. Regarding Google Product Search, see, e.g., Mayer 
Tr. 272:7- 277:8 (explaining that Google used the occurrence ofcomparison shopping engines at positions 1-3 
in the web ranking to boost Google's product universal to position one, because a CSE would appear if it has a 
highly relevant product to the query, and, thus, Google Product Search must also have a highly relevant 
product) (citing GOOG-Texas-0214363 (2009)). See also GOOGLR-00161978-80 (2009), at 78 (launch 
report entitled "Product universal top promotion based on shopping comparison [site] presence" that relies on a 
·. 
list of"blessed sites" to trigger top promotion of product universals); GOOGLR-00162103 (2009) (listing 
sites). Regarding Google Local, a local sites trigger - using, for example, CitySearch and Yelp - appears to 
have been introduced in 2007, see GOOGLR-00297666-69 (2007), at 66 ("added a 'cooccurring sites' signal to 
bias ourselves toward triggering when a local-oriented aggregator site (i.e. Citysearch) shows up in the web 
results"); GOOG-Texas-1324737-39 (2009), at 38-39 ("final trigger ... includes web-based signals such as 
yelp et al"). Regarding Google Books, Google used Amazon as a trigger, see GOOG-Texas-0196298 (2009) 
(For books, we use Amazon as co-occurring site"). Google appears to have considered a trigger for the finance 
"OneBox" based on the presence of finance sites in organic results, but it is not clear it was launched. 
GOOGLR-00257663-75 (2008), at 68. 
137 See GOOGEC-0066150 (2009); GOOGLR-00162615-17 (2009), at 15. Google has.provided some 
evidence that it has discontinued this practice with respect to GoogleProduct Search in Dec. 2010. 
138 Google did, at times, lower the position of certain Universal Search results. For example, in 2008, Google's 
search quality team recognized that Google Product Search results were often of poor quality. See CX-168 
(GOOG-Texas-0214363) (2009); GOOGWRIG-000041022-23 (2009), at 22; GOOG-Texas-0197396 (2009); 
GOOG-Texas-0180522 (2008), at 22 ("With regard to middle/top threshold, raters say it goes at the top but 
clicks metrics suggest middle"). Around the same time, the Google advertising team expressed concern that the 
photos, pricing information, and other rich data provided by the Google Product Search diverted users' attention 
from ads, resulting in fewer clicks on ads. In the spring of 2008, Google estimated that the top placement of 
Google Product Search would lead to an "annualized loss of $154 million" on product queries. GOOG-Texas
0178597-607 (2008), at 598 ("Product Search Universal Holdback Experiment"). In response to both concerns, 
Google launched a series of "aggressive demotions" to move most Google Product Search results down a few 
positions on the SERP. See GOOG-Texas-0178597-607 (2008), at 598 ("Product Search Universal Holdback 
Experiment") ("We are executing an aggressive plan to further improve google.com user experience for 
products that we estimate will reduce annualized loss from ~$130mm to ~$45MM within 4 weeks"); GOOG
Texas-0214409-11 (2008), at 9 (Nick Fox writes that "the product search team said they were going to do a 
bunch of things to dramatically reduce the negative [revenue] impact of the product .... "); GOOG-Texas
0178597-607 (2008), at 605 (estimating that these changes would result in the percentages of Google Product 
Search in positions 1, 4, and 10 going from "85/0/15" to "40/35/25," and a corresponding reduction in loss of 
advertising revenue from $154 million to $70 million). Specifically, in Jul. 2008, Google made three algorithm 
changes to "aggressively demote" more top OneBoxes to middle OneBoxes. GOOGMANB-000056049-54 
(2008), at 50. These were: (1) "Product Search Universal Triggering 2.0 [which] mainly moves them to a lower 
position", id, (2) "Using Exact Corpusboost to Trigger Product Onebox", which compares queries with queries 
on Google Shopping, triggers the Product OneBox if the same query is often searched in Google Shopping, and 
automatically places the universal in position 4, GOOGLR-00330279-80 (2008), at 79 (Launch Report for 
algorithm change); and (3) "Aggressive Demotion to Middle for Product Universal," which demotes from 
position one to position four if the product OneBox does not meet a higher relevance threshold, the first web 
result is navigational with high probability, or two out of the top three results are for a manufacturer. This 
change demoted about 51 percent of top product OneBoxes to the middle). GOOGMANB-000055473-76 
(2008), at 73-74 (Launch Report for algorithm change). See CX-168 (GOOG-Texas-0214363) (2009); 
GOOG-Texas-0197396 (2009). The "aggressiveness" of the demotion effort is debatable, as Google continued 
to display Google Product Search results in the fourth position. And even these minor demotions were 
apparently quite controversial within Google. For example, Marissa Mayer "threatened to come to quality 
launch review to defend keeping product universal at [position] I." GOOGWRIG-000041022-23 (2009), at 
22. fo any event, these demotion efforts were short-lived, as Google quickly moved Google Product Search

139 See Facebook Presentation (Mar. 7, 2012), at 6 (showing Google Plus content on the right hand side in

for Dell.com in the example. Facebook IR (Jan. 24, 2012); Facebook Presentation (Mar. 7, 2012), at 7. Some 
companies were quite unhappy about this development. Amazon, for example, was concerned that the inclusion 
of a link to the Google Plus page on a navigational search for Amazon would drive traffic to Google Plus rather 
than to Amazon. Because it is one of Google's largest advertisers, Amazon requested immediate removal of the 
Google Plus link in the mega-site links, and Google complied. See Amazon CID Response at 5-7; Amazon IR 
(Feb. 1, 2012); GOOGEUST-000_019807-11 (2011), at 7. Google has continued to comply with Amazon's 
request, and does not show the right hand column link to Amazon's Google Plus page as it does for Dell in the

153 See Response to the Microsoft Economist Report on "Anticompetitive Organic Search Manipulation" (Jul. 7, 
2011) (stating the Panda update ''was designed to ensure a higher ranking for high-quality sites with original

154 Although Google originally sought to demote all comparison shopping websites, after Google raters 
provided negative feedback to such a widespread demotion, Google implemented the current iteration of its so
called "diversity" algorithm. · See GOOG-Texas-0179485-92 (2006), at 85 (identifying shopping comparison 
sites for demotion); GOOGEC-0148152-56 (2007), at 53 (testing algorithm that would result in "SERP 
declines between 8 and 20 percent" for shopping comparison sites); GOOGMANB-000007246-47 (2007), at 
46 (launching the algorithm in Dec. 2007). Google claimed that the goal of this algorithm was to "increase the 
diversity of Google's search results for product related queries.'.' See Response of Google to DG Comp (Nov. 
22, 2010), at§ 2.2, p.1. 
Initially, Google compiled a list of target comparison shopping sites and demoted them from the top 10 
web results, but users preferred comparison shopping sites to the merchant sites that were often boosted by the 
demotion. GOOGSING-000014116-17 (2006), at 16-17 ("We had moderate losses when we promoted an 
etailer page which listed a single product because the raters thought this was worse than a bizrate or nextag page 
which listed several similar products. Etailer pages which listed multiple products fared better but were still not 
considered better than the meta-shopping.pages like bizrate or nextag ..... "). Google then tried an algorithm that 
would demote the CSEs, but not below sites of a certain relevance. GOOGEC-0168032-33 (2006), at 32. 
Again, the experiment failed, because users liked the quality of the CSE sites. GOOGSING-000014375-76 
(2006), at 75 ("The bizrate/nextag/epinions pages are decently good results. They are usually well-forma[t]ted, 
rarely broken, load quickly and usually on-topic. Raters tend to like them. I make this point because the 
replacement pages that we promote are occasionally off-topic or dead links. Another positive aspect of the 
meta-shopping pages is that they usually give a variety of choices ..... The single etailer pages tend to be single 
product pages. For a more general query, raters like the variety of choices the meta-shopping site seems to 
give.") Google tried another experiment which kept a CSE within the top 5 results if it was already there, but 
demoted others "aggressively." Id. at 76. This too resulted in slightly negative results. Id 
Unable to get positive reviews from raters when Google demoted comparison shopping sites, Google 
changed the raters' criteria to try to get positive results. Previously, raters judged new algorithms by looking at 
search results before and after the change "side-by-side" (SxS), and rated which search result was more relevant 
in each position. GOOGEC-0168014-27 (2007), at 25. After the first set ofresults, Google asked the users to 
instead focus on the diversity and utility of the whole set of results, rather than result by result, telling users 
explicitly that "if two results on the same side have very similar content then having those two results may not 
be more valuable than just having one." Id. at 23. When Google tried the new rating criteria with an algorithm 
which demoted CSEs such that sometimes no CSEs remained in the top 10, the test again came back "solidly 
negative." Id. at 19. Google again changed its algorithm to demote CS Es only if more than two appeared in the 
top 10 results, and then, only demoting those beyond the top two. With this change, Google finally got a 
slightly positive rating in its "diversity test" from its raters. Id. at 16; GOOGEC-0148152-56 (2007), at 52 
("Launch Report: Shopping Comparison Demotion"). Google finally launched this algorithm change in Jul. 
2007. GOOGEC-0014649 (2007) (launching at one Google data center); GOOGMANB-000007246-47

156 Google determined which websites would be demoted in two ways. First, Google had a group of "spam 
raters" manually rate whether certain websites would be labeled as "content farms," and thus, subject to 
demotion. GOOGHUFF-000089790-93 (2011 ), at 91. Google provided specific instructions for its spam

rating results for expanding the Panda algorithm to all English sites, ''we did 'low quality article recognition' 
training for all raters at the end of January (as well as special testing and feedback for US raters only. Because 
of this, raters have been more sensitive to the quality of results when rating since that date. Unfortunately, many 
URL ratings were completed before then")). Google then used the raters' list of "content farms" to lower the 
ranking (IR Score) given by raters to those websites. Those rankings were then used to determine the severity 
of a website's demotion. "The effect [was] pretty dramatic ; .. " Id.; GOOGSING 000091277-88 (2011), at 77 
(stating that the Panda algorithm's "IR Score demotions" lead to "demoting low quality hosts severely"). 
Second, because the Panda algorithm affected such a broad swath of websites, Google manually "whitelisted" 
websites it did not deem worthy of demotion. See, e.g., GOOGSING-000091277-88 (2011), at 86 (approving 
demotion ofTheFind); GOOGSING-000091277-88 (2011), at 83 (attempting to prevent demotion of

weeks before and after Panda initially launched in Feb. 2011). The drop in traffic to those websites also affects 
merchants, who prefer getting traffic from multiple sources. The monthly traffic from Pricegrabber and 
Shopping.com to Amazon dropped from the end of Feb. 2011 through the end of Oct. by, respectively, 35

increased 99 percent, traffic from May 2010 to 2011 decreased by 12 percent. Id. at 14. Staff has collected 
evidence of several declines in traffic to other competing verticals due to changes to Google's SERP. See, e.g.,

is going to get found in the library. Because Google is dominant in organic search, the ecosystem depends on 
its services"). Websites believe that they need to make all of their content available for Google to crawl 
because this will improve their traffic from Google. First, websites believe that the more original content they 
Obtained by POLITICO

[ 
have on their pages (and allow Google to see), the more highly those pages will be ranked. Google encourages 
this belief, repeatedly telling webmasters that they should focus on having "infonnation rich" web sites to get 
higher Google rankings. See Google Webmaster Guidelines, Best Practices to Help Google Find, Crawl, and 
Index Your Site, http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35769 (last visited Jul. 
25, 2012). Sites thus allow Google to crawl all of their content to show the Google algorithm the quantity of 
high quality content they host on their sites. Second, websites want to ensure that keywords that may show up 
in a query will be crawled and indexed by Google. For example, a search for "Venice Italy vegan restaurants" 
on Google returns a web search link to a Chowhound page called, "Looking for great vegetarian food in 
Venice." The only reference to the word "vegan" in the article is in one of the responses to the initial question, 
in which the respondent discusses vegan options. If a website does not permit Google to crawl the entire page, 
including all reviews, the site may not appear at all in the web search results in response to specific queries, or 
the website may not rank as highly.

262 Keystone, Advertiser Multi-homing in Online Search Advertising in Europe (June 26, 2011), at 9 (data 
discussed in the text is U.S. data). 
263 These figures represent the upper bound estimates of the percentage of multi-homing advertisers in each 
docile. The likely actual percentage will be lower. 
264 This is important because the availability of advertisements from smaller advertisers fills out a search 
engine's coverage of queries, particularly for "tail" queries. See infra p. 98. 
265 According to Microsoft, approximately 49 percent of keywords with 100 impressions or fewer per month are 
bid for only on AdWords; for "high scale" keywords, approximately 78 percent are bid for on both AdWords 
and AdCenter. Susan Athey, Presentation, "The Role of Scale in Competing in Online Search" (March 26, 
2012), at 9. 
266 See Microsoft IR (Jun. 11, 2012). This claim may not stand up to scrutiny, however. Despite numerous 
requests, Microsoft has not produced data to support this assertion. In addition, it is unclear on what basis 
Microsoft is able to estimate the level of optimization advertisers perform on their AdW ords campaigns. 
267 See Brew Gadgets IR (Jan. 30, 2012); National ReliefIR (Feb. 15, 2012); Phoenix East Aviation IR (Feb. 29, 
2012); Speedy Soft IR (Feb. 6, 2012); Top Hat Imagewear IR (Feb. 22, 2012); Yam Market IR (Jan. 13, 2012). 
While it is true that some of the small advertisers interviewed were not interested in a cross-platform 
optimization tool, their limited interest can be explained by unverified assumptions about a cross-platform 
tool's ultimate functionality and varying opinions on cross-platfom1 management's current transaction costs.

369 The fact that horizontal search services are currently provided free-of-charge to end users does not materially 
impact the analysis here. This is a two-sided market where the service costs to end users have been shifted to 
advertisers. But advertisers' willingness to bear these costs will be directly impacted by th~ consumer demand 
for them. We therefore analyze the cross-elasticity of demand here just as if consumers were directly bearing 
the costs themselves.

http://www.comscore.com/Press Events/Press Releases/2012/6/comScore Releases May 2012 U.S. Search 
Engine Rankings.Google's market share has been measured as a share of the total volume of unique searches in 
the United States conducted across traditional search engines, as well as other "leading" sites such as Facebook 
and Wikipedia. Google's internal figures reflect slightly higher market shares for Google, see, e.g., CX-183 
(GOOGWRIG-000086779-81) (2011) (reporting monthly market shares in Google's internal metrics ranging 
between 69.4 and 83.5 percent, while the equivalent comScore number for the same period is 65.1 percent). 
According to Sergey Brin, Google relies on both internal and external data sources when examining its market 
shares, although all of the sources "have their problems, their challenges." Brin Tr. 315:9-316:2. Brin testified 
that he is more concerned with whether all of the data sources are consistent in their "trends," i.e., whether 
Google's share is going up or down, than the exact numbers. Brin Tr. 321 :11-23.

384 This number should be viewed with some caution, both because there can often be shifts of a percent or two 
in the monthly comScore data, and also because there is really no good way to measure search share with high 
precision. All of the measures of search share have various methodological problems and limitations. See, 
e.g. Brin Tr. 315 :9-316:2 (noting that all of the internal and external market share numbers have issues); 
Schmidt Tr. 53:10-55:2 (noting that Google's view is that comScore numbers are always wrong); but see 
GOOGMANB-000095004-07 (2011), at 4 (Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, writes: "Though I would 
agree that ComScore is unreliable, it's not at all obvious to me that this matters much to us. From an antitrust 
perspective, I'm happy to see them underestimate our share.")

IR (Jan. 24, 2012). Generally speaking, it was difficult for many advertisers to answer the hypothetical- "what 
would you do in the face of an across-the-board price increase?" - because of the unique manner in which 
search advertising is priced. Pricing of search advertising is based on what is known as a "Vickrey second 
auction" model. The idea behind this auction is to give advertisers the incentive to bid their maximum bid, 
rather than try to game the auction to pay as little as possible. In this type of auction, an advertiser is only 
required to pay $.01 more than the next lowest bidder. For example, three sports retailers are bidding on the 
keyword "sneakers." Retailer A bids a maximum of $1.00; Retailer B bids $0.50; and Retailer C bids $0.25. 
All other things being equal (i.e., controllirig for Google's quality score adjustments), Retailer A will "win" the 
top·spot in the auction, but will only pay $0.51 to Google if a user clicks on Retailer A's ad. In this way, the 
auction itself drives up the prices, and Google's "control" of prices is more indirect (although Google sets 
minimum bids and establishes quality scores that sets each advertiser's baseline bid). Notably, each time a

query is entered, the auction occurs in real time, so in theory, an advertiser could be participating in thousands 
of auctions simultaneously on millions of keywords, and could pay vastly different prices for different 
keywords, or groups of keywords, at any g1ven time.

Craigslist.org have been removed from the dataset because the site does not host either web search or search 
advertising. There are some significant inconsistencies in our datasets. Figures provided by Microsoft for 
Yahoo!' s syndication query volume are staggeringly inconsistent with com Score's data ( 107 billion in 
Microsoft's data set v. 2.7 billion in comScore). We are trying to get to the bottom of this discrepancy now, but 
understand that Yahoo! 's internal data may take into account so-called "phantom" queries (instances where a 
user hovers over a word in text and a link or ad appears), which would account for the discrepancy. Google's 
market share would be considerably smaller taking into account the Yahoo! figure provided by Microsoft. 
However, we have reason to question the Yahoo! figure because it is inconsistent with the industry 
understanding of Google's dominance in this area. See Appendix 3 for a detailed explanation of how Staff 
calculated the relevant market shares using comScore' s dataset.

456 This is the most friendly legal framework. Under the Ninth Circuit's Allied Orthopedic framework, if 
Google can show any objective "improvement" to its product, there will be no balancing of harm to competition 
and procompetitive justifications. See Allied Orthopedic Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Group LP, 592 
F.3d 991, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2010). The Ninth Circuit has also, on occasion, applied a "refusal to deal" analysis to 
these types of product improvement cases. See, e.g., Live Universe, Inc. v. MySpace, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 
43739 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (no duty to deal with rival where defendant redesigned its platform so that links to

458 See Microsoft Corp., Microsoft Complaint to the European Commission (Mar. 31, 2011). This theory 
directly tracks the Department of Justice's theory on the role of middleware in Microsoft. There, it was argued, 
middleware represented a threat to Microsoft's operating system dominance not because the middleware would 
itself replace the underlying operating system, but because middleware provided an alternative platform onto 
which applications could be written, which could be run irrespective of the underlying operating system. 
Lowering this so-called applications barrier to entry, in turn, lowered the costs for other firms to introduce rival 
operating systems that could directly challenge Microsoft's dominance over Intel-compatible operating systems. 
Similarly, here, Microsoft argues that a "key component" of its strategy in attracting users has been to partner 
with vertical websites so that Bing can offer a "differentiated general search experience to compete with 
Google." Id. See also e.g., GOOG-Texas-1325832-33 (2010), at 33 ("Bing has explicitly made improving 
verticals a key part of their strategy to beat Google"); GOOG-ITA-01-0331214 (2009) (email noting that Bing 
is focused on competing against Google in its "two top verticals," shopping and travel). 
· 
459 While reduced innovation is at the heart of this theory, the role of pricing cannot be ignored, in that (as with 
other theories described later in this memorandum), the broader availability of alternative search advertising 
platfom1s would operate as a constraint on Google's ability to raise prices to its advertisers. 
460 See supra p. 30; 
461 See supra p. 30-31. 
462 In Microsoft, the government's argument that product improvement could be outweighed by anticompetitive 
effects did not fare well. The en bane court considered a claim that Microsoft had designed certain software in 
a way that made Java applications both faster on its operating system and incompatible with rival operating 
systems. Although the opinion stated that the applicable test was that "the incompatible product must have an 
anticompetitive effect that outweighs any procompetitive justification for the design," it held that the fact that 
product ran faster on Microsoft machines sufficed to make it legal standing alone and did not appear to try to 
balance that benefit against anticompetitive effects. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 74-75. Similarly, while the D.C. 
Circuit upheld the lower court's ruling against Microsoft on the company's efforts to ·integrate the Internet 
browser with the operating system, it did so on particular integration aspects for which Microsoft could provide 
no justification. Where Microsoft did provide a justification (namely, in overriding users' choice of a default 
browser), the court found no liability. 253 F.3d at 67-68.

483 Google's possible "duty" to deal with certain competitors will be discussed at length at p. 94-95, infra, but it 
is worth noting here that courts have generally required some sort of affim1ative contract or agreement in 
establishing an affirmative voluntary course of dealing. This makes sense because of the underlying nature of 
the cause of action: that the defendant has engaged in conduct that is clearly contrary to its own short-term 
benefit in order to achieve anticompetitive ends. An affirmative agreement provides clear evidence of the 
defendant's prior intent to "deal" with that party based on, presumably, some real benefit to the defendant. On 
the search bias front, it would be more difficult to establish a "voluntary course of dealing." Although Google 
does crawling and return search results for a variety of websites, and- in a sense - has certainly benefited from 
the websites' efforts to "optimize" their content for inclusion in Google's web search results, that does not 
translate into some prior course of dealing that it would defy common sense to abandon, but for an 
anticompetitive plan to rid itself of vertical rivals. 
484 See Tucker, 493 F .Supp.2d at 1099 (suggesting that plaintiffs product design claims would not be 
"construed as a refusal to deal"). But see LiveUniverse, 2007.U.S. Dist. Lexis 43739 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (no duty

does not rise to a Section 2 violation. Professor Herbert Hovenkamp believes that the area of monopoly

Intel's conduct with respect to graphic chips in the Intel matter because he felt that Section 5 was uniquely

508 Some courts have interpreted Trinka as requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant has sacrificed 
short-tenn profits in refusing to deal with the plaintiff. See, e.g., Covad, 398 F.3d at 675 (stating that, in order 
to prevail on refusal to deal claim, plaintiff would have to allege that the refusal to deal resulted in some kind of 
"short-term economic loss" to the defendant); MetroNet, 383 F.3d at 1132-33 (observing that defendant's 
actions did not have the same economic significance as the Aspen Skiing defendant's refusal to sell to plaintiff 
at retail price because the defendant's conduct did not entail a sacrifice of short-term profits); Four Corners 
Nephrology Assoc. v. Mercy Medical Center of Durango, 582 F.3d 1216, 1225 (10th Cit. 2009) (observing that 
"the key face permitting liability in Aspen Skiing was that the defendant terminated a profitable relationship 
without any economic justification," and noting that, in the present case, the evidence suggested that the 
defendant refused to deal with the plaintiff to avoid an "unprofitable relationship" and to "maximize its chances 
of profitability in the short-term"). However, this interpretation appears inconsistent with the Supreme Court's 
actual position in Aspen Skiing, as well as the Court's interpretation of Aspen Skiing in the more recent Trinka 
decision. See Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608 ( observing only that, because the defendant declined to sell tickets 
at retail price, "[t]he jury may well have concluded that Ski Co. elected to forgo ... short-run benefits because it 
was more interested in reducing competition," and that Ski Co. 's willingness "to sacrifice short-run benefits and 
consumer goodwill" supported the "inference that Ski Co. was not motivated by efficiency concerns," but rather 
by a desire to harn1 its smaller rival); Trinka, 540 U.S. at 409 (assuming that the Aspen Skiing defendant's 
tennination of "a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealing ... suggested a willingness to 
forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end") ( emphasis in original). See also Areeda & 
Hovenkamp 1772cl (expressing doubt that the Aspen Skiing defendant's refusal to sell tickets at retail price to 
defendant resulted in short-term revenue losses to defendant). As the District of Connecticut has observed, 
Trinka did not establish a "new rule in refusal to deal cases, namely that a complaint is deficient unless.the 
plaintiff has specifically alleged that the defendant could not possibly make a short-tern1 profit from the 
challenged conduct. The Trinka court held that a motion to dismiss was appropriate when it was abundantly 
clear that unbundling - the alternative to the alleged anticompetitive conduct - was manifestly inefficient. It 
distinguished that situation from Aspen Skiing where a jury was permitted to infer anticompetitive conduct from 
a lack of short-term profits. But nowhere in Trinka did the Court indicate that a complaint should be dismissed 
if it fails to recite the magic words 'no short-term profit."' Creative Copier Servs., 344 F.Supp.2d at 866 
( emphasis in original). 
509 See., e.g.,Michigan State Medical Society, 110 F.T.C. 191 (1983) (in horizontal boycott context, threat alone 
is actionable since it is designed to produce the anticompetitive effect). Courts have routinely found that non
explicit refusals to deal, or offers to deal only on egregiously unreasonable terms, can constitute unlawful 
refusals to deal. See; e.g., MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124, 1132 (9th Cir. 2004) ("An

Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 592-93 (noting that defendant offered plaintiff joint ticket deal provided that plaintiff 
agreed to accept a fixed percentage of profits considerably below plaintiffs historical average, that a member of 
defendant's board of directors admitted that defendant made an offer it knew plaintiff would not accept, and that 
on those facts, plaintiff did reject defendant's offer); Duke Energy, 93 Fed. Appx. at 4 (premising liability for 
refusal to deal on offer with terms that defendant "knew were unrealistic or completely unviable" to plaintiff);

delays in shipping, making certain parts unavailable, and raising prices on other parts). See also Areeda &

kept trying to reduce plaintiffs share of the profits until it "finally made an offer that [plaintiff] would and did

516 Google allows newspapers to choose to be indexed for Google's web search results, but not by Google 
News. See Jonathan Simon, New User Agent for News, Google Webmaster Central, Dec. 2, 2009,

Vanessa Fox, Google Retires the Googlebot-News Bot, Search Engine Land, 
http://searchengineland.com/google-retires-the-googlebot-news-bot-90607. The primary difference between 
Google News and the affected verticals here is that Google makes little money from Google News as a stand
alone product. Presumably, this lower-value vertical is one in which Google was willing to make certain 
concessions that it was not willing to make in higher-value vertical areas. 
517 As demonstrated in the Microsoft opinion, courts are deferential in their treatment of product innovations 
with genuine procompetitive qualities. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 75-76 (reversing finding ofliability with 
respect to Microsoft development of a j ava script that allowed improved performance, but was incompatible 
with the java script pioneered by Sun Micro System, Inc.); see also Allied Orthopedic, 592 F.3d at 998-1002 
(finding that the introduction of improved sensors that were incompatible with competitors' monitoring systems 
was not anticompetitive). However, when evaluating contractual restrictions attached to the product, the 
Microsoft court had no trouble evaluating those contractual restrictions separately from the products they were 
attached to. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 59-63 (condemning licensing restrictions for harming rivals, "not by 
improving its own product, but, rather, by preventing OEMs from taking actions that could increase rivals' 
share of usage"). This distinction demonstrates why the consumer choice model described in the BE Staff 
Memo of Jan. 31, 2012, at 23-24, frames a false choice. With the model, BE Staff compared overall welfare of 
advertisers with the API plus restrictions versus their welfare if no API existed. There is no support in the case 
law for limiting the choice in such a way when there is a third choice: the API without the restrictive conditions. 
The analogous argument in the Microsoft case would have prevented the courts from considering the possibility

of a Windows operating system that did not come burdened with contractual and technical restrictions 
preventing OEMs from featuring other browsers. 
518 While Google itself has not argued that such a remedy would be imposing a duty to deal, the argument has 
been raised internally. Review of the leading cases, including Trinka, LinkLine and Aspen Skiing, makes clear 
that the duty to deal doctrine is only relevant to claims that antitrust law should compel a firm to deal directly 
with a competitor. In the present case, the issue is the tenns and conditions upon which Google deals with its 
customers. As such, they are subject to the same kind of review as any section 2 case, like exclusive dealing, 
predatory pricing or tying. 
519 As an example, Google forced Marin Software to remove a feature it called "The Cloner." Marin had 
promoted the feature as "an easy-to-use, professional tool that removes the cross-platform management 
impediment, making it easy for marketers to derive maximum effectiveness, reach, and conversion from their 
search campaigns, without requiring costly new resources." Press Release, Marin Software, Marin Software 
Unveils 'The Cloner' (Nov. 4, 2008) http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/11/prwebl567824.htm. 
520 See supra text accompanying footnote 277. 
521 The possibility that the API itself reduces transaction costs is not a relevant consideration when the 
restrictive conditions are not necessary to the functioning of the APL . 
522 For example, Google offers a service to advertisers called Expanded and Broad Match as a way to encourage 
increased spend on AdWords by decreasing transaction costs. This opt-in service gives advertisers the option to 
let Google automatically expand their keyword lists to include many words and phrases that Google's 
algorithms detennine ought to have similar relevance. Hal Varian described this as a "very valuable service to 
advertisers;" it increases their advertising opportunities without having "to consider every possible variation of 
queries." Varian Tr. 218:11 - 221:8. 
523 Richard Holden and Hal Varian endorsed this view. CX-41 (GOOGFOX-000128077-080) (2009), at 3 
(Advertisers "focus on us first today b/c of volume of search artd if they don't get around to the other networks 
b/c it is a hassle today, the other networks lose out.") See also Brin Tr. 204:2-17 (testifying that Google has had 
more difficulty gaining "traction" with the local advertiser base because small advertisers have far less time and 
resources to advertise). 
524 See supra note 262. [multi-homing data].

than on AdCenter. See supra p. 46-48 and note 266.

in certain circumstances, may give rise to a § 2 violation even though the contracts foreclose less than the 
roughly 40% or 50% share usually required in order to establish a § 1 violation"), with United States v. 
Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30, 52 (D.D.C. 2000) ("Where courts have found that the agreements in 
question failed to foreclose absolutely outlets that together accounted for a substantial percentage of the total 
distribution of the relevant products, they have consistently declined to assign liability"), and OmGga 
Environmental, Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 1997) ("If competitors can reach the ultimate 
consumers of the product by employing existing or potential alternative channels of distribution, it is unclear 
whether such restrictions foreclose from competition any part of the relevant market.").

559 See Stitt Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 840 F.2d 1253, 1258 (5th Cir. 1988) (foreclosure 
referred to as "comparison between the number of distribution outlets available and the number of those 
foreclosed"). 
560 See Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 70 (finding that Microsoft foreclosed a substantial percentage of the 
available opportunities for browser distribution without calculating a specific foreclosure rate); but see 
Masimo Corp. v. Tyco Health Care Group, L.P., 350 Fed. Appx. 95, 97 (9th Cir. 2009) ("[The] effects ofTyco's 
varied bundling arrangements was insufficient to support a finding that the arrangements foreclosed competition 
in a substantial share of the relevant market"). 
561 There are noted problems with the comScore dataset, most importantly, perhaps, that it appears to· 
significantly underestimate Google's syndicated query volume (for 2011, 32.9 billion in comScore v. 132 
billion, as submitted by Google). However, given the limitations of all existing datasets in this area, Staff relies 
on the comScore dataset as the best proxy for the parties' respective performances in the market. 
562 See supra note 439. 
563 Moreover, relying on third-party data submissions opens up a host of other issues, most problematically the 
question of how each party calculates its own syndication query volume and whether they are calculating the 
volumes in the same manner. Nevertheless, in an abundance of caution, we have calculated an alternative set of 
foreclosure numbers based on internal company datasets. See Appendix 3.

564 The "conservative" estimate includes in the "foreclosed" group only the companies that have explicitly 
complained to the Commission that agreements foreclose them from using a rival syndication service, and that 
they would like to do so, but for their current agreement with Google. This group includes only eBay. It should 
also include NexTag and Business.com, however the comScore dataset does not provide numbers for these 
firms. The comScore dataset suggests that, under this scenario, 8,653,366,936 queries, or some 19.6 percent of 
the market, is foreclosed. (IfIAC is included within this group, the foreclosed query volume increases to • 
16,447,977,342, or some 37.3 percent of the market.) This is an extremely conservative estimate because, as 
noted above, courts routinely include all sales made pursuant to an exclusive agreement as being foreclosed. 
565 The "aggressive" estimate includes in the "foreclosed" group every company that is party to an exclusive 
· agreement with Google (see Appendix 1, table showing exclusive agreements), as well as every company that is 
party to an agreement with the challenged "preferred placement" provision (see Appendix 2, table showing 
"preferred placement" agreements), except for any party that has explicitly told us that they do not view the 
"preferred placement" provision as a barrier to the use of a rival's syndication service. The excluded group 
includes Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Google's online partners. Also excluded is Earthlink, although the comScore 
dataset does not provide numbers for this firm. The comScore c;lataset suggests that, under this scenario, 
29,133,927,882 queries, or some 66.1 percent of the market is foreclosed. 
566 The "intermediate" estimate includes in the "foreclosed" group every company that is party to an exclusive 
agreement with Google, as well as any company that is party to "preferred placement" terms and has explicitly 
complained to the Commission that these terms. foreclose them from using a rival syndication service, and has 
stated that they would like to do so, but for their current agreement with Google. In addition to all partners with 
an exclusive agreement (see Appendix 1, table showing exclusive agreements), this group includes: eBay (and 
should include NexTag and Business.com, but does not, given the limitations of the comScore dataset, 
described above). The comScore dataset suggests that, under this scenario, 22,804,213,204 queries, or some 
51.5 percent of the market, is foreclosed. We believe that this is the most defensible position because it takes 
into account both the exclusive agreements - those companies literally foreclosed to competitors on the face of 
their agreements - as well as any "preferred placement" agreements for companies. that have explicitly 
complained about the de facto exclusive effect of such agreements. Staff believes that this approach is 
consistent with case law. See Omega Environmental, Inc. 127 F.3d at 1162; Stitt Spark Plug Co., 840 F.2d at 
1258.

573 Id. Indeed, as CityGrid explained, there are approximately 15-17 million individual local businesses that 
hope to attract local customers throughout the United States. These local businesses are potential advertisers for 
which search advertising (particularly search advertising serving specialized or "tail'' queries) can deliver a very 
high return for investment. As such, these markets are highly lucrative for Google, and competition for this 
advertising revenue from specialized web-sites, such as CityGrid and UrbanSpoon, aggregately poses a 
significant competitive threat to Google. For reference, competition in serving these local and specialized 
(vertical) markets is the same competitive threat Google contemplated it its 2007 EU planning document 
entitled, "Online Advertising Challenges: Rise of the Aggregators," wherein Google saw local advertising 
markets in Europe as having many companies experimenting to lure advertisers it what Google only saw as a 
"winner take all" market. See CX-116 (GOOG-Texas-1486915-70) (2009), at 21.

577 Microsoft IR (JuJ.1.. 11, 2012) (explaining that more high traffic partners, like those under agreement with 
Google, will help Bing move up the scale curve). 
578 Indeed, Google does not rely on any of its syndication data to improve its search algorithms. See Google 
Submission, "An Economic Analysis of Microsoft's Allegations that Google's Conduct Harms Competition by 
Reducing Bing's Scale" (May 14, 2012), at 12. However, Microsoft has specifically stated that itdoes rely on 
the search query volume from Yahoo!; and would similarly rely on the search query volume from some of 
Google's largest partners, like AOL and IAC. See Susan Athey, Scale in Online Search (Mar. 10, 2012), at 18 
( explaining that search queries on search engine syndication partners, such as Yahoo!, are· "high quality for 
Bing because they reflect a broad spectrum of head and tail queries," but queries conducted on "non-search 
engine syndication partners do not provide the same level of infonnation about user intent that Bing gets from a 
search engine partner"). The fact that Google does not use - and has never used- syndication data is irrelevant 
to Microsoft's ability to do so. Moreover, Google's argument misses a critical point. At the very least, 
additional syndication partners would net Bing additional search advertising volume ( and ad clicks), and this is 
a crucial element of developing Microsoft's ad platfom1 and improving its monetization rate. See supra p. 15
16 and 77-78.

582 GOOG-ITA-16-0030892-93 (undated, c. 2009), at.92 (document entitled "AOL/Google Partnership "Good 
to Know"). AOL's limited value to Google was discussed on a number of occasions. For example, in Aug. 
2009, senior vice president and chief business officer Nikesh Arora noted that Google's current deal with AOL 
"loses money on a gross basis," and that, because of this, AOL was becoming "more nervous" about what 
Google's proposal for a renewed syndication deal was going to look like. It appears that Google initially 
intended to offer AOL significantly worse renewal tenns, including a decreased revenue share (80.75 percent 
for the new deal versus 88 percent in 2005), see GOOG-Texas-0437725-33 (2009), at 29, than it ultimately 
provided AOL. See AOL IR (Dec. 7, 2011) (noting that AOL's 2010 agreement with Google provided for a 90 
percent revenue share minus a 2 percent deduction for click spam). See also GOOG-AFS-000000146 (2010),

payments, and revenue shares of 85 percent, which contained a most favored nations clause (MFN) that 
guaranteed AOL a matching rate if Google agreed to pay another publisher more than 85 percent). Staff took 
investigational hearing testimony from Sanjay Kapoor, who negotiated the 2010 Google/ AOL agreement on 
behalf of Google. In attempting to explain these documents, Mr. Kapoor testified that while revenues from the 
AOL relationship may have declined, AOL had a very strong brand, and retaining that brand relationship was 
valuable to Google. Kapoor Tr. 32:9-33:2; id. at 50:7-10; id. at 90:24-91:10; id. at 108:18-23; id. at 135:24

with $169 million from Google and the rest from Yahoo/Bing). No domestic number was available, but the 
domestic share is likely modestly higher just because Google has a much more dominant position in overseas 
markets than it does in the United States. 
585 IAC IR (Dec. 8, 2011) (Microsoft sought an exclusive deal); Amazon IR (Feb. 15, 2012) (Microsoft and 
Yahoo! both require page-based exclusivity so their ads cannot be mixed and matched on the same page with 
another provider's ads). 
586 See supra p. 56 & note 309 and 310. Microsoft admits that, because Microsoft's product monetizes at such a 
low rate relative to Google, winning new syndication deals has not been a strategic priority for the company. 
Bing needs a larger portfolio of advertisers in order to present a competitive offering to publishers, and so,
