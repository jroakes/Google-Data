DEPUTY CLERK:

Your Honor, this is civil action 20-3010,

United States of America, et al. versus Google, LLC.

Kenneth Dintzer is representing the Department of Justice in

5

this matter.

represent the Plaintiff States.

Attorneys Jonathan Sallet and William Cavanaugh

THE COURT:

9

a nice weekend.

10

courtroom.

11

Attorneys

And attorney John Schmidtlein

Good morning, everyone.

I hope everybody had

Let me just make sure everybody's in the right

This is U.S. v. Google.

Anyway.

Just a couple of things before we move forward this

12

morning.

We should have out -- we will have out this afternoon

13

the transcripts of Mr. Kolotouros and Mr. Higgins.

14

that we should have Mr. Roszak out very soon, and then Mr. Yoo

15

and Mr. Lehman shortly after Mr. Roszak.

The hope is

16

Sorry, I thought I had one more administrative matter.

17

All right.

Then there's the issue of the Daubert motion

18

concerning Professor Whinston and certain testimony that is

19

expected of Professor Whinston.

20

and look, here's where I am.

21

surprise to anybody, which is that I'm essentially going to

22

allow the testimony.

23

I've read the parties' papers,

This probably won't come as a

As everybody understands, the Daubert gatekeeping function

24

is relaxed quite a bit when it is a bench trial.

I'll just

25

read, for example, from a recent decision from this district,

5709
1

DL vs. District of Columbia, 109 F.Supp.3d at 12 at 28, where

2

the Court wrote:

3

relaxed when the judge will serve as a fact finder in a trial.

4

This is because where the gatekeeper and the fact finder are

5

one in the same -- that is, the judge, the need to make such

6

decisions regarding reliability prior to hearing the testimony

7

is lessened.

8

situation need be any less reliable.

9

can hear the evidence and make its reliability determination

10

during rather than in advance of trial."

11

"The gatekeeping requirement is substantially

This is not to say that expert testimony in this
It simply means the Court

I'll just note, although I'm not sure there's -- we didn't

12

find a circuit decision to that effect, there are a number of

13

decisions from various circuits to the same -- for the same

14

principle.

15

Circuit.

16

Eleventh Circuit.

17

Commissioner, 615 F.3d 321.

Gibbs v. Gibbs, also from the

18

Fifth Circuit, 210 F.3d 491.

I could go on.

19

line is, because this is a bench trial, the gatekeeping

20

function is relaxed a little bit.

In re: Salem at 467 F.3d 767 from the Seventh

United States vs. Brown, 415 F.3d 1257, from the
White House Hotel Limited Partnership vs.

But the bottom

21

Now, that said, I will be curious to hear what Professor

22

Whinston has to say specifically about the issues that Google

23

has raised.

24

about scale and latency and how he couches them, whether it's

25

more of that in line of somebody who's an economist, rather

In particular, what his opinions are going to be

5710
1

than someone who is a computer scientist.

I appreciate and

2

know what the limitations are of his background and his

3

expertise.

4

how he says and in what context it arises.

So I look forward to hearing what he has to say and

5

So while I'm denying the motion to prevent him from

6

testifying, it certainly is not without prejudice to raise in

7

the -- later on, either ignoring parts of his testimony,

8

altogether excluding him or diminishing any weight that I would

9

give to it.

So okay.

10

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

11

THE COURT:

All right.
Thank you, Your Honor.

So are we ready to go?

Anything else anybody

12

would like to discuss this morning before we bring in Professor

13

Whinston?

14

MR. DINTZER:

Not from the DOJ plaintiffs.

15

call Professor Whinston.

16

MR. CAVANAUGH:

17

THE COURT:

We're ready to

No, Your Honor.

Terrific.

Why don't we bring Professor

18

Whinston back in and we'll get started.

19

Professor Whinston, welcome back.

20

THE WITNESS:

21

THE COURT:

22

remains sworn.

Thank you.

It's good to be back.

He doesn't need to be sworn in again.

23

Good to see you.

24

Mr. Severt, whenever you're ready to go.

25

MR. SEVERT:

He

Welcome back.

Great.

Thank you, Your Honor.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION OF MICHAEL WHINSTON

3

BY MR. SEVERT:

4

Q.

5

Professor Whinston, did you prepare a slide

presentation to facilitate your testimony today?

6

A.

I did.

7

MR. SEVERT:

May I approach, Your Honor?

8

THE COURT:

You may.

9

THE WITNESS:

10

BY MR. SEVERT:

11

Q.

Thank you.

Professor Whinston, last week, you described your

12

assignment as it related to definition of market power.

13

was the rest of your assignment?

What

14

A.

15

assignment.

16

economic principles whether Google's conduct was or is likely

17

to result in the creation, extension or maintenance of monopoly

18

power.

19

conduct was or is anti-competitive or was or is likely to

20

result in material harm to competition and consumers.

21

If you bring up slide two, you'll see the rest of my
So first I was asked to determine as a matter of

And second, I was asked to determine whether any such

MR. SEVERT:

And just for the record, the slide deck

22

has -- bears first Bates number -- sorry, Exhibit No. UPXD104.

23

BY MR. SEVERT:

24

Q.

25

Professor, regarding that assignment, did you form any

opinions?

5712
1

A.

I did.

2

Q.

What were those?

3

A.

So if you bring up slide three, you'll see there are

4

three opinions related to those two assignments.

5

numbered -- I had two opinions last time.

6

numbered continuing that numbering.

7

Google search distribution contracts give it exclusive

8

defaults, which are a large driver of search traffic.

9

They're

So these are

So opinion three was that

Opinion four is that Google search distribution contracts

10

foreclose rivals from a substantial share of each relevant

11

market.

12

contracts have harmed competition to the likely detriment of

13

consumers and advertisers.

14
15
16

Q.

And opinion five is that Google search distribution

And how do these three opinions fit into your overall

analysis in this case?
A.

Sure.

So, Your Honor, I guess I regard what we did

17

last time as sort of the predicate, setting the stage for

18

really -- now for looking at -- now looking at Google's

19

conduct.

20

conduct ultimately has on competition and consumers and

21

advertisers.

22

Q.

And in particular, looking at the effects Google's

Professor, let's go to slide four.

23

opinion three that you just described.

24

investigate in this case?

25

A.

And we have

What conduct did you

So the conduct that I investigated was Google's

5713
1

exclusionary distribution contracts, and in particular, the ISA

2

with Apple, the MADA and RSAs with Android OEMs and carriers.

3

And also the RSAs with third-party browsers.

4

Q.

And what conclusion did you reach?

5

A.

My conclusion is that they are anti-competitive and

6

harm competition, and to the likely detriment of both consumers

7

and advertisers.

8

Q.

And your opinion says that Google's contracts give it

9

exclusive defaults.

10

contract with Apple give it exclusive defaults?

11

A.

Let's start with Apple.

So if you bring up slide five.

How does Google's

There are really three

12

ways.

13

default on all instances of Safari.

14

ensure that its Safari suggest feature remains, quote,

15

substantially similar to the way it operated in 2016.

16

third, Google has a right of first refusal should Apple decide

17

to run ads on Siri or Spotlight.

18
19
20

First, most prominently, Apple must set Google as the

Q.

Second, Apple has to

And

And practically, what do these provisions prevent

Apple from doing?
A.

If you bring up slide six, you'll see a variety of

21

things that it restricts Apple from doing.

So Apple cannot

22

offer a search choice screen that gives consumers a choice of

23

their default in Safari upon, say, device activation.

24

can't offer a different default in Safari's private browsing

25

mode.

Apple can't offer different defaults by device.

They

Apple

5714
1

can't offer different defaults in the U.S. versus the rest of

2

the world.

Apple can't substantially increase its suggestions

3

for users.

And Apple also can't run ads on Siri or Spotlight

4

without giving Google the option to run.

5

Q.

Now, Professor, doesn't the ISA allow, for example,

6

Bing and Yahoo! to have bookmarks in Safari and users can

7

change the default; isn't that right?

8

A.

It does, but the Safari default is responsible for the

9

lion share of queries on Apple devices.

10

you heard testimony about this.

11

take account of the fact in my analysis that there are these

12

other ways for users to access alternative search engines.

13

nonetheless, the Safari default really is where the vast

14

majority of queries are being entered.

15
16
17

Q.

Your Honor, I think

And so it's -- you know, I

And let's move to Android.

But

How do the Android

contracts give Google exclusive defaults?
A.

So if you turn to slide seven, you'll see here, Your

18

Honor, the -- just a list of the provisions of the MADAs and

19

the RSAs.

20

hear at this point about them, so I'll just be very brief.

21

I know you've probably heard more than you want to

So the MADA is requiring that the Google search widget be

22

on the home screen.

It's requiring Chrome and GSA to be

23

undeletable and be in a Google folder on the home screen.

24

it's also prohibiting distributors from implementing launchers

25

or otherwise encouraging or helping users change the

And

5715
1
2

out-of-the-box defaults.
The RSAs, they're going further.

They -- and they're

3

signed by both OEMs -- I should say, the MADA's signed by OEMs.

4

The RSAs are signed by both OEMs and carriers.

5

the revenue share that one of these distributors earns, it has

6

to set the -- Google as the default on all search access points

7

and not pre-install any alternative search service -- where, by

8

alternative search service, the meaning really is general

9

search engines.

And to maximize

10

One thing -- I know you're familiar with this, but one

11

thing I think to -- is worth highlighting is the redundancy in

12

these agreements.

13

widget, the requirement is -- on the Google search widget

14

appears both in the MADA and in the RSAs.

15

carrier ID phones, no one party can get out of it.

16

carrier decided it wanted to just completely ditch Google, it

17

can't because the OEM has agreed to the MADA.

So in particular, around the Google search

So in the case of
So if a

18

Q.

And Professor, what about third-party browsers?

19

A.

So third-party browsers, the restrictions are similar.

20

It has to be the default for the -- out-of-the-box default for

21

the third-party browser, out-of-the-box in a figurative sense.

22

Q.

And when you say similar, similar to what?

23

A.

Well, say, to the Safari default.

24

Q.

So we talked about exclusive defaults, but if the

25

users can change the default, why do they matter?

5716
1

A.

So, again, I think -- Your Honor, you've heard

2

testimony from Professor Rangel and many others about the power

3

of defaults.

4

the years is competition is just a click away.

It's definitely

5

not a click away in terms of how users behave.

And if you

6

bring up slide eight, you'll just see a range of testimony that

7

you've heard about this.

8
9
10

Q.

I think one thing Google has liked to say over

And Professor, what evidence did you look at about the

importance of defaults?
A.

So in my analysis, I looked at two different kinds of

11

evidence.

If you bring up slide nine, you'll see that.

12

the internal projections and business decisions of Google,

13

Microsoft and Apple.

14

users.

15

Q.

And two, analyzing the behavior of search

Let's talk about the first category, and go to

16

slide 11, the ordinary course business documents.

17

evidence informative?

18

A.

One,

Right.

Why is that

So these -- just to be clear, these internal

19

projections and business decisions, I'm looking at two sorts of

20

things.

21

highlighted here from Google, Microsoft and Apple, that

22

estimate the impact of Google losing search defaults.

23

second, Google's payments to these search distribution

24

partners.

25

your question?

One is ordinary course documents, which you've

And then

So, I'm sorry, Mr. Severt, could you just repeat

5717
1

Q.

Sure.

What's informative about this first category?

2

A.

Well, what's informative about looking at the ordinary

3

course business documents from these parties is these are

4

decisions, Your Honor, that involve billions and billions of

5

dollars.

6

sophisticated, coming up with these estimates, it's very

7

meaningful.

8

Q.

And so when you see these parties, who are very

Let's talk about this first bullet, the ordinary

9

course business documents and projections.

10

at?

11

A.

What did you look

So the first thing I looked at were estimates around

12

Apple and the Safari default.

13

is a document, Your Honor, that you've seen before.

14

Professor Rangel testified to it.

15

Google document that was from the period where they were

16

negotiating with Apple around the -- so in 2016 around the -- a

17

potential for the -- what would happen in 2017 with Apple

18

Safari default.

19

So if you go to slide 12, this
I think

It was a document -- it's a

And so what you can see here, Your Honor, just to kind of

20

walk you through it -- I was here when Professor Rangel

21

testified, and there's been a lot of water under the bridge

22

since then.

23

is they're estimating recovery, the Safari search recovery

24

assumptions.

25

default, how much of that default traffic will come back to us;

So on the left, you'll see that what they're doing

By that, what they mean is if we lose the

5718
1

how much -- you know, how many loyal Google users are there

2

that are going to follow us even though we lost the default.

3

So on the left -- I can't say the numbers, you'll see the

4

percentage.

5

the -- whoever gets the default would be a hundred percent

6

minus that.

7

Stated in terms of the recovery, of course, what

So you'll see, first of all, that they break it out by iOS

8

versus macOS.

So they're separately coming up with estimates

9

for mobile and for desktop.

10

figure for iOS recovery is much lower than it is for desktop.

11

I think you've heard testimony about this as well, that

12

defaults are more powerful on mobile devices.

And you can see right away the

13

And so the next thing to take from this is that they're

14

looking at historical episodes to come up with these estimates.

15

So in the case of the iOS estimate, they're looking at Apple

16

Maps.

17

Honor, that at one point, Apple -- Google Maps had been on

18

iPhones, and Apple came in with its own map product, and Google

19

lost a lot of traffic.

20

see what effect there would be if they lost the search default

21

on Apple iOS devices.

22

coming up with.

23

in the second sub bullet that mobile defaults have more

24

prominence.

25

And so, again, I think you've heard about this, Your

And Google looked to that evidence to

And you can see the number that they're

And they make the point, actually, immediately

So they're observing this as well.

And then the second main bullet, you'll see the Mac

5719
1

recovery.

What's that based on?

It's based on something that

2

you -- that Professor Rangel also testified about, which is the

3

episode where Firefox, in 2014, switched the default from

4

Google to Yahoo!, and so Google had experience in how much it

5

would lose on -- it lost from that episode.

6

nearly all the traffic is PC traffic, desktop.

7

they looked to that as evidence for what they would lose on

8

macOS.

And Firefox,
So that's why

9

And then the bottom bullet is what the -- you know, taking

10

a weighted average of those based on what the revenue mix would

11

be, and that's how they came up with that number.

12

And you can see from the -- what I put at the bottom, you

13

know, Mike Roszak testified -- and it's something that I had

14

observed in any case, that Apple -- sorry, Google used these

15

episodes as evidence -- Google Maps, Apple Maps episode as

16

evidence about the effect on iOS for many years after, all the

17

way to 2021.

18

you can see his testimony, that they really -- you know, that

19

was their best estimate.

20

Q.

It was the last evidence I found about that.

And

And Professor, did you see any evidence that Google

21

used these estimates when assessing the potential benefits of

22

the ISA?

23

A.

I did.

So if you bring up slide 13.

So there's --

24

pretty much everything is redacted on here, Your Honor.

But

25

this is from the same slide deck that that document -- the

5720
1

slide that we just looked at is from.

2

document with basically kind of projections of spreadsheets.

3

The thing here is they -- you know -- and so what's getting --

4

and then I've done some call-outs for you to just highlight

5

some points from it.

6

On the left, you see a

So from the left, what I would like you to take from that

7

is they're using those estimates in a very detailed way.

8

They're very sophisticated.

9

throwing this number out.

10

using it for on the left in those spreadsheets?

11

out how much net benefit they're going to get from this deal.

12

So like a key thing for Google in its analysis of deals is

13

what's the net benefit we get, how much traffic are we

14

incrementally going to get and how much are we paying.

15

this is something that they started doing back in 2005 or 2006.

16

Just as an aside, like, one of the fun things about doing

And it's not just that they're

They're using it.

And what are they
It's to figure

And

17

this is, like, you see e-mails and such.

18

back in 2005, it seems Michael Dell told Sergey Brin:

19

how you should think about defaults, this is how you should

20

think about these deals.

21

done.

22

benefit.

23

And so, actually,
This is

Ever since then, this is what they've

They've basically tried to estimate -- get that net
The way they do it with these recovery assumptions.

So what you can see on the right side is they're using --

24

you can see right away, all I've done is pull the headers,

25

because, like, going into the numbers, we could be here all

5721
1

day.

2

their estimate using that recovery number that we just saw,

3

that I just -- that averaged recovery number, which I can't say

4

it, but that we just saw.

5

kind of orange, you can see in parentheses the two separate

6

things that they based it on that we just saw.

7

They're using -- up on the right, you see they're basing

And you can see on the right in the

A second thing that you can see in the second header that

8

I pulled out is, actually, you'll see what Apple asked for.

9

Actually, you can see their nickname for Apple at this time,

10

you know, clearly because Apple was the Big Apple, and that's

11

why they have that acronym for it.

12

asked -- what Apple asked for in terms of a revenue share

13

level.

14

you can see in the last call-out, is that at that proposed

15

revenue share number from Apple, they still were going to make

16

money, okay.

17

of profit on that increment of paying less than it's worth to

18

them.

19

So you can see Apple

One of the things, if you looked at the numbers -- and

They still were going to make billions of dollars

But that's not actually the revenue share that they paid.

20

They actually paid much less than this in the end.

And so you

21

can see that -- you know, this gap in terms of what their net

22

benefit actually ended up being.

23

into the details in that slide -- in that spreadsheet -- in the

24

pictures of that spreadsheet to see the numbers specifically,

25

but I didn't think for our purposes here it would be worth it.

Again, you can -- one can go

5722
1

Q.

2

Google.

3

A.

And then, Professor, you talked about evidence from
What about evidence from Microsoft?
So Microsoft was trying to get this -- and hoping to

4

get the Safari default.

5

much traffic they would keep if the -- if they got the default

6

and Google lost it.

7

you'll see Microsoft's estimate.

8

can see a pretty detailed -- and again, I won't go into the

9

numbers, a pretty detailed analysis of what the share shift

10

would be if that happened.

11

call-out is telling you the bottom line of it:

12

change in Bing's share on iPhones go from today -- that is,

13

when they don't have the default, to post-deal where they do

14

have the default.

15
16
17

Q.

And they also estimated what -- how

So if you bring up slide 14, Your Honor,
And again, on the left you

And on the right, you can -- the
What would the

And so that's an estimate from 2018.

And what does that tell you about how much the mobile

default traffic would shift to Microsoft if it won the deal?
A.

Yeah, so the thing about this -- the numbers that I'm

18

showing you right here is these are the overall market shares

19

on the phone.

20

Google's default traffic would it lose and recover, it's

21

actually a slight -- it's very close to, but slightly more

22

powerful default estimate than what I just showed you Google

23

was estimating.

24
25

Q.

If you translate that into what share of

And what did Microsoft rely upon in reaching this

estimate?

5723
A.

1

So if you bring up the next slide, slide 15.

So this

2

is another Microsoft document, Your Honor.

It's not from 2018,

3

like what I just showed you, but it's back from 2016 at the

4

same time as those Google documents, where they're also

5

doing -- in 2016, they had started doing estimates.
What you can see here is what they based their estimate

6
7

on.

And it was a different piece of information.

I guess -- I

8

don't even -- it seems like I can't even say what that is, not

9

just the number.

10

Maps episode.

11

about a certain device, mobile device, and what their share was

12

on it.

But it was a different episode than the Apple

They were looking at evidence on what they knew

13

And then I think to kind of reiterate how important these

14

decisions are, Your Honor, Jon Tinter from Microsoft testified

15

about this, and I think was basically -- it's all under seal

16

and I won't say -- you know, read any of the specifics.

17

basically saying, to paraphrase, if I'm in a position where I'm

18

affecting billions of dollars of business for my company, I'm

19

going to do a pretty good careful estimate of what the effect

20

would be.

21
22
23

Q.

But

And in that document, the 2018 document, did Microsoft

also estimate share shifts for PCs?
A.

They did, Your Honor.

So the 2018 document we looked

24

at was for iPhones, and in my report I also have similar

25

estimate -- similar part of that document that did PCs and,

5724
1

actually, PCs and iPads as well.

And you're seeing very

2

similar effects to what we saw in the Google document.

3

Q.

And then --

4

A.

And similar effects, I should say also, that the

5

mobile estimate is much bigger than the desktop estimate.

6

Q.

And how about from Apple?

7

from Apple?

8

A.

I have.

Do you see any evidence

So if you'd bring up slide 16.

You'll see

9

Apple's estimate -- this is from 2016 also, of overall what

10

they thought the -- you know, they were interested in, well, if

11

we go with Microsoft, what -- how much -- how many loyal Google

12

users are there that are going to follow Google.

13

overall was something very closes to what the other two firms

14

were estimating.

15
16
17

Q.

The answer

So we talked a little bit about iOS estimates.

Did

you see any similar analyses for Android?
A.

I did.

So if you go to slide 17.

Again, this is --

18

the whole call-out is redacted, so I won't say anything about

19

the numbers.

20

Honor.

21

Samsung, and they were -- there was a -- the issue was, well,

22

if we lose the default on Samsung, what's going to happen.

But in 2017 -- this is a Google document, Your

In 2017, Google was in the process of negotiating with

23

And what did they do?

They looked at the episode again --

24

I don't know if I can say.

25

episode that they -- what information they looked at, one of

Your Honor, you can read what

5725
1

which is something we just talked about and one is actually

2

something that we're about to talk about.

3

quote.

4

another word they sometimes use for recovery.

5

see what that was.

6

Q.

They came up with a

Here it's called a clawback number, but clawback is
And so you can

Professor, you listed Google's payments on -- sort of

7

taking us back to slide 18, your second bullet was Google's

8

payments to search distribution partners as evidence of the

9

power of defaults.

10

What does the size of payments tell you about defaults?

11

THE COURT:

12

I think Professor Rangel touched on this, but what is the

13

explanation for -- if the premise is the defaults are difficult

14

to move away from, what's the explanation for, then, some

15

percentage that's not insignificant of people actually moving

16

away from the default if it's not Google?

17

If I can interrupt you for a second, Counsel.

THE WITNESS:

So, Your Honor, the -- I think the thing is

18

it's not uniform across the population.

19

whether it's because they're -- Professor Rangel is a

20

behavioral economist.

21

whether you call it costs or you call it some kind of

22

behavioral response, there's variation in the population to

23

that.

24
25

I'm not.

So some people are --

I'm a rational economist.

So

And some people, if they, quote -- you know, you might say
they might have preferred the non-default search engine.

5726
1

They -- they might have preferred the non-default search

2

engine.

Some people will go and make the change and others

3

won't.

And we're going to talk, I think, soon, when we talk

4

about foreclosure measures, we're going to talk about this fact

5

and what it implies for thinking about foreclosure measures.

6

But that's how I think about it.

7

THE COURT:

I guess the question then, though, is to what

8

extent -- if there are some consumers that view the cost of

9

switching as negligible and they do switch, isn't Google's

10

response, well, the reason they're making the switch is because

11

they're switching to a better product?

12

choice screen, for example, would not really alter the

13

alternate mix of search engines if it were offered?

14

THE WITNESS:

And so options like a

Yeah, great question.

I think a really,

15

really important thing to keep in mind is that that can be true

16

at the current qualities, but not true if rivals were at, say,

17

invested and became better.

18

see right now that what consumers are doing doesn't tell you in

19

some sense -- ultimately, we're going to talk about competitive

20

effects and but-for worlds and the like -- doesn't tell you

21

what these defaults are doing to say rivals incentives for

22

investment.

23

So just what's happening when you

Because when rivals are thinking about investment, they're

24

thinking, well, what if I get much better.

And we're going to

25

talk about -- I mean, your question -- you kind of did this

5727
1

last time.

2

things.

Your question's kind of leading into a lot of other

3

THE COURT:

4

BY MR. SEVERT:

5

Q.

Okay.

Fair enough.

Professor, on slide 18, you have a bullet about

6

Google's payments to search distribution partners.

7

size of the payments tell you about defaults?

8

A.

So if you bring up slide 19.

What do the

So the thing -- Your

9

Honor, this is a figure just showing what the -- Google's

10

payments are to different groups, Apple, Android M&Os and OEMs

11

and third-party browsers, of what in total Google paid for --

12

in revenue share in the U.S.

13

And the thing is, just to -- I think I should have said --

14

probably said this first because it was really what your

15

question was, Mr. Severt.

16

billions and billions and billions of dollars, there's got to

17

be a reason.

18

an economist, you know, that's what is kind of the first thing

19

that slaps me in the face.

20

Is when you see Google paying

There has to be a reason it's worth doing it.

As

So here, you're seeing, yes, Your Honor, they are paying

21

many billions of dollars.

And I should say, I know you've

22

probably -- Your Honor, you've probably seen numbers for what

23

revenue share payments are.

24

numbers -- sometimes, perhaps because the numbers you've seen

25

perhaps are worldwide while these are just for the U.S., okay.

And these are smaller, because the

5728
1

There are two bullet points at the bottom, just to kind

2

of -- the first one is to just put this in perspective, and it

3

just tells you for fiscal year 2020 what share of Apple's total

4

operating income was the payment from Google, and it's large.

5

The second thing is to recognize this isn't everything in a

6

sense that Google is paying, because it doesn't count the fact

7

that they give away the must-have Play Store for free in order

8

to get the MADA signed.

9

Google is handing over the Play Store, which Android -- again,

10

you've heard Android OEMs have to have to have a marketable

11

Android device.

12
13
14

Q.

So on top of these RSA payments,

Professor, does the percentage revenue share that

Google pays partners tell you anything about the defaults?
A.

It does.

So, Your Honor, we just were speaking about

15

just the absolute dollars that Google is paying.

You can also

16

think about this in a different way, which is what's the

17

revenue share percentage that they're paying.

18

logic kind of applies, which is if they're paying a given

19

revenue share, it has to be that losing the default would shift

20

that amount of -- that share of revenue.

21

revenue share percentage is, it's a lower bound estimate on

22

what the actual share shift would be.

23

next slide, slide 20, you'll see what that implies for Apple.

24

Now, I want to emphasize this is just a lower bound,

25

because we've just seen evidence -- lots of evidence that

And the same

So whatever the

So if you bring up the

5729
1

actually the share shift is bigger than that, and that Google

2

actually would make profits at substantially higher revenue

3

shares.

4

the money on the table and what it implies about what Google

5

must see as the value.
Q.

6

But it is just kind of another way of thinking about

And Professor, just to go back to slide 19 just for a

7

moment, I had one clarifying question.

8

19.

9

to just ask if the redacted text in the header -- I don't want

10

you to say it, but is that another reason why the numbers here

11

are smaller than what the Court might have heard?

12

Is the -- sorry, slide

There's a box at the top with some redacted text.

A.

Yes, thank you.

I want

So, Your Honor, here I'm counting

13

only the payments that were made for the queries that went

14

through exclusionary -- through search access points for which

15

Google has exclusionary payments.

16

about coverage, for example, there are some places -- for

17

example, with Apple, there are some things that Google is

18

paying for that you might say, oh, that's not exclusionary, and

19

so I'm not counting those here.

20

Q.

Okay, Professor.

And when we get to talking

I want to go to slide 21 and talk

21

about the second category of evidence that you described

22

earlier, which is the observed behavior of users.

23

look at there?

24

A.

So I looked at three things that you see listed here.

25

Q.

And let's start with your first bullet, the 2014

What did you

5730
1

Mozilla Firefox default switch.

2

Google relied on this for its estimate, but did you do any

3

analysis of this event?

4

A.

I did.

I think you said earlier that

So if you bring up slide 23, you'll see, Your

5

Honor, that -- again, it's redacted, so I won't say any numbers

6

or anything.

7

search shares by day.

8

DisplayNav data.

9

But this is just literally a daily -- a graph of
And the source of this is Google's

What you can see, if you recall in November 2014, Firefox

10

switched the default from Google to Yahoo!.

11

from this is right at that day and the next couple days, you

12

know, a jump in default -- in the traffic shares here.

13

can -- I don't -- down at the bottom is the implication of

14

what -- how many percentage points of share Google lost.

15

on the right, in that bullet point is telling you what the

16

share of its default traffic -- what that implies for the share

17

of its default traffic that it lost.

18

What you can see

You

And

It's pretty much dead on what the slide that we looked at

19

from Google -- you know, Google managed to do this analysis

20

some amount of years before I did, and that's what was in that

21

slide that we looked at a little while ago, and that Professor

22

Rangel had also shown you.

23

So you can see that jump.

You can see there's some

24

evolution in shares over time, and then you can see back in

25

2017, Firefox default was switched back to Google.

And you can

5731
1

see the jump there.

And it's a little smaller, but there's a

2

jump as well.

3

of this would have been a nice, smooth -- maybe not line, but

4

curve.

5

Q.

6

THE COURT:

And, of course, if defaults didn't matter, all

You wouldn't have seen these jumps.
Professor -I'm sorry, is the number here lower than the

7

estimates we've seen for -- well, let me ask you:

8

hypothesis that the number here in terms of actual switching is

9

lower than what's estimated because switching is more difficult

10

on mobile?

11

THE WITNESS:

Are you referring to the number on -- oh,

12

I'm sorry, let me be clear about this.

13

Firefox.

14

THE COURT:

15

THE WITNESS:

Is the

So this is for Mozilla

Right.
Yeah, sorry, I now understand.

Yes, so this

16

is Firefox, almost all of its traffic -- actually, not only

17

that.

18

look at the title.

19

THE COURT:

20

THE WITNESS:

This is actually focusing just on its PC traffic, if you

Right.
Almost all of its traffic actually is PC,

21

but exactly, you have it exactly right.

22

BY MR. SEVERT:

23

Q.

I think on Page 24, you have your next example:

24

EU and Russia choice screens.

25

events?

Why did you look at those

The

5732
1

A.

So I looked at the EU and Russia choice screens

2

because they are one of the very -- other than the Mozilla

3

Firefox change, they're one of the very -- really, the only

4

other cases where we see an actual default switch from one

5

search provider to a different way of the defaults.

6

different default situation.

You know,

7

It's important to recognize this is not -- the previous

8

things we looked at, Your Honor, were switches of a default

9

where a default switched from Google to a rival.

10

it's different, it's a switch from a Google default to a choice

11

screen.

12

things about this, the choice screens were a little different

13

in the way they worked in Russia and the EU.

14

cases, it was to a choice screen.

15

Q.

And here,

As I think Professor Rangel touched -- showed you some

But in both

And what would you expect to see with the choice

16

screen that would be different where there's an exclusive

17

default?

18

A.

So the thing about a choice screen is you're seeing

19

users -- at least if it's a well defined -- I'm sorry, a well

20

designed choice screen, you're going to see users preferences

21

over search engines.

22

Q.

They're going to choose.

A few minutes ago in response to the Court's question,

23

you talked about the quality or strength of rivals.

How does

24

the ability to overcome an exclusive default depend upon the

25

strength of rivals and applies to choice screens also?

5733
1

A.

Right.

So it does apply to choice screens, and in a

2

very strong way.

So if everyone -- if Google is much, much

3

stronger than its rivals, okay, then you may not see very much

4

shift from a Google default to the choice screen in terms of

5

shares because Google is much stronger than rivals, and at that

6

moment, what you're seeing in the choice screen is what user --

7

consumers preferences are at the time the choice screen was

8

instituted.

9

Q.

10

point?

11

A.

And so that may hide the power of defaults.

Can you give the Court an example to illustrate the

Yes.

So, Your Honor, this -- and I think this point

12

touches on exactly the question you were asking me 10,

13

15 minutes ago.

14

just to take an extreme hypothetical.

15

default that was perfectly powerful, nobody ever leaves the

16

default when it exists.

17

hundred percent, infinite, just nobody can leave the default.

18

And imagine, as well, that we have a search engine, say

19

Google, that has the default to start with, and then we move to

20

a choice screen.

21

suppose it's preferred by 99 -- at that moment, preferred by

22

99 percent of the population, okay.

23

So like, imagine, for example, that we had -Imagine that we had a

So the power of the default there, a

And that that search engine, say Google,

What will you see in the choice screen?

You'll see a

24

1 percent shift, from a hundred percent of everybody picking

25

Google to 99.

But we have a completely powerful default by

5734
1

hypothesis, right.

Nobody would ever leave that default.

And

2

in particular, if rivals got better -- suppose someone invested

3

and got to the point where 30 percent of the population

4

preferred the rival -- you know, instead of 99 percent

5

preferring Google, only 70 percent preferred Google.
Now if you ran -- if you did the choice screen, you'd go

6
7

from a hundred percent to 70.

And so you would -- in the case

8

where the rival had improved, you would see the power of the

9

default, but you just don't see it when Google is preferred by

10

everyone.
And why is that going to matter?

11

It's going to matter

12

because of the way it impacts investment incentives.

13

rival is thinking, gee, should I spend a ton of money to get

14

better, and it's thinking, what can I get -- how much traffic

15

will I attract if I do that, when we get to competitive

16

effects, the fact that the power of the default is there, if it

17

got better, like that would have a big impact on traffic if it

18

got better, will be really important.
THE COURT:

19

When a

So these numbers are not -- I take it the

20

numbers on the right column -- oh, I guess I'm a page ahead of

21

you.

22

Can you flip to the next page, please.

23

So the number on the right column is a market share

24

number; is that right?

25

THE WITNESS:

Yeah, I haven't explained it.

5735
1
2
3

THE COURT:

Why don't you explain it, then I'll ask my

question.
THE WITNESS:

Sure.

So slide 25, what I'm showing here,

4

Your Honor, is information about the choice screen outcomes.

5

And just to be clear, if you remember, there were different

6

versions of the choice screen.

7

quarter of 2021, when we had the kind of good choice screen

8

implemented, not the one that kept the popular rivals off that

9

had existed before.

10

THE COURT:

11

THE WITNESS:

This is looking at the third

I'm sorry, say that again.
Sure.

So I think -- I can't remember now.

12

Sitting in the courtroom, I don't remember exactly whether

13

Professor Rangel went through this.

14

there were three stages of it.

15

happened is it really wasn't so much a choice screen to

16

switch -- it wasn't switching your default.

17

download things onto your device.

18

But the remedy in EU,

The very first stage, what

It was just to

Then they went to a choice screen that was an auction.

19

People had to bid to get on the choice screen.

And you bid --

20

what happened -- hopefully I'm going to describe this right.

21

You paid only if someone selected you.

22

the ad auction.

23

the way they run their ad auction, like only if someone clicks

24

and chooses you as the default from the choice screen do you

25

end up paying in this auction.

So it was kind of like

Google had proposed this.

It was kind of like

5736
1

But the result of that was lots of popular search engines,

2

like Ecosia or DuckDuckGo, that have lower monetization didn't

3

have -- like, it wasn't economic for them to bid, and so they

4

didn't get on.

5

issues of the American Economic Review has a paper talking

6

about this flaw in the choice screen.

7

known this was a flawed choice screen.

8

And in fact, there's -- one of the latest

So it became widely

And then starting in the third quarter of 2021, they

9

changed it so that popular choice -- sorry, popular general

10

search engines would all be on it.

11

So this is data from that non-flawed choice screen.

On

12

the right is just showing in -- back before the choice screen,

13

actually back before any of the remedy, how strong Google was

14

in terms of its mobile market share in these various European

15

countries.

16

their shares.

17

is incredibly strong in European countries.

18

way down at the right in the blue, you can see what Google's

19

share is, which we already talked about, in the U.S. in those

20

years.

This is stat counter data, and it's just reporting
What you can see is, for the most part, Google
Actually, all the

21

You can see in these European countries, for the most

22

part, Google was actually even stronger than it is in the U.S.

23

There are exceptions.

24

was a moderately strong search engine, Seznam, that had an

25

87.7 percent share before all of this happened.

One is the Czech Republic, where there

5737
1

The left column, which is redacted, is showing you what

2

was the share in each country of Google's selections on the

3

choice screen.

4

it's lower than the market share numbers.

5

bigger in the Czech Republic, where there was a stronger rival.

6

And that's going to be a theme that when you -- and it's not a

7

surprising theme, that when you have a stronger rival, the

8

choice screen makes a bigger difference.

9

the 1 percent example, it's the 30 percent example that -- and

10

it can really move share.

11

What you can see here is, pretty uniformly,
And also, it's

Because now it's not

And so one thing that I did here was I ran a regression

12

analysis to -- that verified that point, that the stronger was

13

the mobile phone share for Google -- or maybe a different way

14

to put it, the stronger were rivals in terms of their share,

15

which is one minus the Google share, the better they did in the

16

choice screen.

17

THE COURT:

18
19

And -And the variable for strength was market share

prior to the choice screen?
THE WITNESS:

20

BY MR. SEVERT:

21

Q.

22

States?

23

A.

Correct.

And what did this regression mean for the United

Right.

So, Your Honor, one thing you can do with that

24

regression, once you've identified how strength translates into

25

choice screen shares, is you can -- I could ask, well, suppose

5738
1

I -- the same choice screen had been run at the same time in

2

the U.S., where we've just seen, you know, rivals are weak in

3

the U.S., but they're not as weak as they are in Europe.

4

So you can use that regression analysis to predict what

5

the choice screen share would have been if you had had a choice

6

screen.

7

Q.

You can say the number.

8

A.

Okay.

I don't know whether I can say that number.

So the bottom line on that would be the -- at

9

least my estimate would be rivals would get about 10 percent of

10

the selections.

11

Q.

And is that prediction surprising to you?

12

A.

As I said, no, because the --

THE WITNESS:

17

This is on mobile?
Yes.

Actually, on Android, not just mobile.

Just Android?
Yes.

So the choice screen here was just

implemented for Android phones in Europe.

18

THE COURT:

I see, okay.

19

THE WITNESS:

And so, no, it's not surprising for the

20

reason that we talked about.

21

run a choice screen and they're weak, you're going to see

22

people's preferences, which is going to be for Google.

23

BY MR. SEVERT:

24

Q.

25

Like the rivals are weak.

If you

And have you seen any other examples to illustrate the

idea that the strength of rivals impacts the outcome of a

5739
1

choice screen?

2

A.

3
4

I have.

So if we turn to slide 26.

So the other

choice screen, Your Honor, that I know you've seen -THE COURT:

Sorry, before you answer this, can I just ask

5

a different question, it's the one I was going to ask earlier.

6

The market where there is not a strong rival, the market

7

share -- the number of -- there's not a large delta between the

8

market share and the choice made.

9

not 50 percent.

10

THE WITNESS:

11

THE COURT:

I mean, it varies, but it's

Right.

In that circumstance, is there any -- I mean,

12

is a choice screen truly effective in the sense that you're not

13

necessarily driving that much more traffic to the rival?

14

if the whole theory here is that the rival will improve by more

15

traffic, it's not clear to me that a choice screen accomplishes

16

very much.

17

THE WITNESS:

Right.

So there's two things -- and

18

we'll -- we're going to talk about this a lot.

19

set up --

20

THE COURT:

21

THE WITNESS:

22
23

And

So it's a great

I'm jumping ahead again.
It's okay.

It's perfect.

I like having

people lay the -- open the door.
So it's going to be two things.

One, just the move of

24

share is going to tend to have a feedback kind of effect, which

25

is we're going to talk about how getting more scale improves

5740
1

your quality.

2

course, once you get more scale and your quality goes up, now

3

your choice screen selection share goes up, which then gives

4

you more scale, and so forth.

5

you'd expected that that could increase things.

6
7
8

And you've seen testimony about that.

And of

So that can go -- over time,

Second, it is going to change incentives -- and this is a
really important point.
THE COURT:

Sorry, so why would you assume that, though?

9

In other words, say you're right that some additional traffic

10

does lead to some additional improvement.

11

why that then means the next time the next -- the next time a

12

phone is purchased, that more people will make a different

13

decision based upon the improved quality of a rival that the

14

person may not know about.

15

me why the share would not essentially remain static even with

16

some marginal improvement by the rival.

17

THE WITNESS:

It's not clear to me

In other words, it's not clear to

So if we think that choice screens are

18

revealing preference, and we think preference is related to

19

quality, the different qualities that the different rivals

20

have, then at least -- let's put it this way:

21

were to -- if Google's quality were to stay unchanged and the

22

rivals were to get better because they got some scale, then we

23

would expect more preference -- some preference shift away from

24

Google towards the rivals, for some people.

25

THE COURT:

At least if you

And then --

Is the idea that's because reputationally -- I

5741
1

mean, an enhanced reputation would cause people who otherwise

2

might not have switched the first time to switch the next time

3

they buy a phone?

4

THE WITNESS:

Right.

So, you know, you would -- you know,

5

rivals start getting reviewed in PC Magazine or the equivalent

6

of it online, and friends have used it -- I mean, the

7

assumption with a choice screen is, of course, that people are

8

going to -- when I say it will reflect preferences, it has some

9

element of that they know something about these -- the choice

10

that they're making.

11

THE COURT:

12

THE WITNESS:

Right.
So if they do know something about -- of

13

course, if they know nothing about the choice they're making,

14

maybe it would be static.

15

choice they're making, then this relation that we saw already

16

and we're about to see even more of in a moment when we look at

17

Russia, between quality and strength and choice -- you know,

18

the effect of the choice screen, you would expect to see an

19

impact of that.

20

THE COURT:

But if they know something about the

And just to change the circumstance slightly

21

differently.

To markets where there was what you would

22

consider a more effective rival, did the presence of a choice

23

screen increase the rival's -- was the percentage of choice for

24

the rival greater than their preexisting market share?

25

other words, was there some sort of bump or multiplier by

In

5742
1
2
3

virtue of having the choice screen?
THE WITNESS:

Okay, thank you.

You've led into the next

slide.

4

THE COURT:

Okay, sorry.

5

THE WITNESS:

Let's go to the next slide.

So slide 26.

So this is Russia, Your Honor.

6

In 2015 -- just to -- again, I don't remember exactly what

7

Professor Rangel described of the circumstance.

8

Russia -- there was a finding by competition authorities in

9

Russia that ended up in August of 2017 leading to the

10

initiation of choice screen.

11

But in 2015,

The choice screen, just to say another word or two about

12

it, was -- there actually were two different things that

13

happened.

14

Store for the first time -- I think it's the Play Store, I may

15

be -- it may be either Chrome or the Play Store, what they got

16

was a choice screen asking them what they wanted to do for the

17

Chrome default.

18

changed the Chrome default.

For existing users, when they accessed the Play

It didn't change the widget default, but it

19

And then as new users -- as we had new devices coming in,

20

a new device would get a choice screen when it first was booted

21

up that would affect both the Chrome default and the widget,

22

the search widget.

23

Again, this was all for just Android.

Now, coming to what you were asking me, the thing about

24

Russia that's really striking is you had a strong rival in

25

Yandex, and you can see that before the --

5743
Nothing is redacted here, correct?

1
2

BY MR. SEVERT:

3

Q.

That's right.

4

A.

Okay.

You can see that before the choice screen,

5

Yandex had about a 35 percent market share.

So it was stronger

6

than Seznam in the Czech Republic.

7

in fact, Google has done side-by-side tests where they show

8

that Yandex and Google quality in Russia are about equal.

9

of course, Yandex might have some local national preference for

10

it.

It was quite strong.

And,

And,

11

But nonetheless, before the choice screen, Google had

12

these exclusives -- defaults in place and its share on Android

13

mobile phones was in the 60 to 65 percent range.

14

screen comes on -- starts to come on where you see the vertical

15

blue line; that's August 2017.

16

complete reversal of share, okay.

The choice

And then what you see is a

17

Rather than Google having 63 percent and Yandex having

18

36 -- or 37 percent before the choice screen, within two to

19

three years, the share has completely reversed.

20

seeing almost a 20-point change in Yandex share.

21

And so we're

And so you asked a moment ago, are there circumstances

22

where we see a stronger rival and we see a big change.

23

it here.

24

it's not a bump is when the choice screen is instituted, it's

25

only as these -- you know, people start getting the choice

Now, it's not a bump immediately.

You see

And the reason

5744
1

screen and start getting new devices that the change starts

2

happening.

3

but you can see the dramatic effect.

So it took time for it to actually filter through,

4

Q.

And did Mr. Parakhin testify about this?

5

A.

He did.

6
7
8
9

So, Your Honor, you've heard Mr. Parakhin say

something very similar in his testimony.
Q.

And Professor, how do you know that it was the choice

screen that caused this change and not something else?
A.

Right.

So, Your Honor, I think it's an immediate

10

question one has is, oh, is it something about maybe Yandex got

11

much better in this time period or Google got much worse or

12

maybe there was a rise in anti-American sentiment because it's

13

Russia, after all.

14

You can think all these things.

If you bring up slide 27, you can see, no, that's not it.

15

It's the choice screen.

So in this figure, Your Honor, you see

16

in red the same curve about Google's share on Android.

17

is its share on Apple phones, iPhones.

18

share on PCs.

19

to see it on all of these things.

20

on Android.

21

Q.

In yellow is Google's

So if it was anti-Americanism, you would expect
You don't.

You only see it

Professor, turning to slide 28, I think your final

22

example is Google and Bing's relative share by browser.

23

did you look at there?

24
25

A.

In blue

What

So if you bring up slide 29, Your Honor, this is

showing you data from -- again, from Google, Google data,

5745
1

showing you Google's share on different browsers.

2

can see here is on the left, four browsers -- sorry, Google's

3

share is in red -- and this is just showing you Google and

4

Bing's share.

5

And what you

Google's share is in red; Bing is in blue.

The four browsers on the left, they're browsers with a

6

Google default.

The two browsers on the right, IE -- Internet

7

Explorer and Edge, are Microsoft browsers that have a Bing

8

default.

9

browser that is almost not used anymore.

10

more of the thing to look at.

11

difference here.

I should say, you know, this is Edge -- IE is an old
So I guess Edge is

But you can see the really big

12

And just to remind you, something I couldn't say earlier

13

but was in the slides, you know, one of these browsers -- the

14

share on one of these browsers is something Google looked at in

15

estimating effects.

16
17
18

Q.

And Professor, just so we have a clear record, did

this analysis rely on data from both Google and Microsoft?
A.

I'm sorry, yes, thank you very much.

So it relied

19

on -- I'm using both Google and Bing data in terms of what

20

their queries received on different browsers was.

21

Q.

Thank you.

Professor, there's been argument and testimony during

22

this trial about Google's share on Windows PCs.

23

at any evidence relating to that?

24

A.

I did.

25

Q.

What did you find?

Did you look

5746
1

A.

If you'd bring up slide 30.

So, Your Honor, this

2

slide is showing you information about two different kinds of

3

PCs, what Google and Bing's and others shares are.

On the top

4

are Windows PCs, and on the bottom are macOS PCs.

And you can

5

see the change in share.

6

to think about this comparison is these are both PCs, and on

7

one of them Google ships with a pre-installed default in

8

Safari, and on Windows PCs the pre-installed browser is Edge

9

with a Bing default.

10

it has, which is redacted, but it's in the first bullet point.

11
12
13

Q.

You can see -- and, you know, the way

So you can see the change in share that

Professor, the difference here seems lower than your

estimates of the importance of defaults.
A.

Why is that?

So, Your Honor, the difference here is -- I think

14

there's been some attention on this.

15

it was mentioned in the opening, about this number, and it's

16

only the percent that you see there.

17

percent -- so first -- you know, how to -- what do we think

18

about this percent?

19

and the estimates I showed you before were about how much

20

Google would lose if it lost its default, what share of its

21

default traffic, okay, which is a different number.

22

I can't remember whether

But the thing is, this

Well, this percent is percentage points,

And if you translate this number into what share of

23

Google's macOS default traffic would Google lose, it's the

24

number in the second bullet point.

25

than the estimates I showed you earlier.

And that number is bigger

5747
1

So rather than Windows PCs being evidence against the

2

importance of defaults -- you know, that undermines the other

3

evidence, it's actually stronger evidence about the impact of

4

defaults.

5

even so, only the number on the bottom?

Well, these are PCs.

6

These are desktop.

We know that on mobile

7

the number is much bigger.

8

is this number is bigger than the number I showed you earlier

9

for PCs.

10

Q.

And the thing is, why is it low, why is it only --

They're not mobile.

What I'm just trying to say to you

And now that you've discussed all these different

11

pieces of evidence about the power of defaults, did you

12

calculate any kind of bottom-line statistic that summarizes

13

what you've learned about the importance of Google's defaults?

14

A.

I did.

15

Q.

And how did you do that?

16

A.

So, Your Honor, to try to give you --

17

THE COURT:

I'm sorry, I want to make sure I'm

18

understanding the slide here.

19

what you have determined would be the amplification of Bing's

20

share that's currently in the second column.

21

point reflects your estimate of what the change would be in

22

terms of the default traffic?

23

THE WITNESS:

24

THE COURT:

25

Right.

So the second bullet point is

The second bullet

Let me think about --

Well, I'm just trying to understand why the

numbers are different and what accounts for the difference.

5748
1

THE WITNESS:

Right.

So the previous numbers -- when

2

Google was doing these recovery estimates, it was saying, okay,

3

right now on iPhones we -- you know, on Apple devices, we're

4

getting -- you know, we're paying for these exclusive defaults,

5

and we're getting a certain amount of traffic.

6

happen if we lost that to a rival, what share of that query

7

traffic and revenue would we lose.

8

And what would

So the number here in the first bullet point is not that,

9

it's the overall change in share on the device.

But a bunch of

10

traffic on the device that is not -- first of all, it's not

11

traffic google's getting.

12

engines, and also, even the traffic that Google is getting,

13

only some share of it is -- smaller share of it is stuff that's

14

going through the exclusive default in Safari, okay.

Some of it's going to other search

15

So to make it apples to apples to that previous recovery

16

estimate, what we want to do is look at, okay, what is going

17

through the Safari default, the exclusive default, in macOS for

18

Google on macOSs, and what share -- that number in the first

19

bullet point, what share of that does that first number in the

20

bullet point represent?

21

And that's the second bullet point.

So it's taking that number that was the overall change in

22

share on the device and saying, well, what does that tell me

23

relative to what Google's default traffic on macOS was?

24

much did they -- you know, the exercise is to say pretend -- in

25

some sense, pretend macOSs and Windows PCs are exactly the same

How

5749
1

thing, just the only thing is -- you know, think of it on

2

Windows PCs, Google has lost the default.

3

recovery -- what would that tell you about its recovery?

What would the

And so that's what the second number is.

4

It's a

5

comparable number to what we -- you know, exercise to what the

6

estimates before were, and it's a bigger number than what the

7

estimates before were.

8

THE COURT:

9

sure I understand.

10

which the Safari default on Mac PCs was -- and how much

11

recovery Google would get and what their loss ultimately would

12

be?

So these numbers are estimating -- to make

13

THE WITNESS:

14

THE COURT:

15

THE WITNESS:

16

BY MR. SEVERT:

17

Q.

Okay.

These numbers are estimating a world in

Yes.

Okay, thank you.
Yeah, sure.

Professor, I think we were talking about your

18

bottom-line statistic summarizing what you learned about

19

Google's default.

20

did you go about finding that number?

21

A.

How did you calculate that number -- or how

So, Your Honor, what I wanted to do was come up with

22

some exercise that would kind of give you a sense of how

23

significant that -- those shifts are that we've just talked

24

about, you know, from Google having a default to losing it to a

25

rival.

And so what I did is I used the estimates from -- that

5750
1

we just saw from Google and Microsoft, and as well the -- I

2

also had looked at the Mozilla actual effect, but that was the

3

same as what Google had looked at.

4

But I used those estimates with the following kind of

5

thought exercise, which is suppose I took all of Google's

6

exclusive defaults in the U.S., and I switched them to a rival.

7

So we take all of them -- not one at a time, we take all of

8

them -- and we switch it to rivals, and we use those estimates

9

from Google and Microsoft and Mozilla, and the actual Mozilla

10

effect, what share of U.S. traffic would switch to rivals?

11

so if you bring up slide 31, you'll see that number -- which is

12

in the first bullet point, which is that 33 percent of all U.S.

13

queries would switch to rivals.

14

And

Just as an aside, we've seen that mobile defaults are more

15

powerful.

16

the number -- this is redacted -- of the same thing if we were

17

just looking at mobile queries, okay.

18

perspective, that 33 percent shift in queries that we've

19

already talked last time about market shares would quadruple

20

rivals' total U.S. market share.

21

defaults, these defaults -- the power of the defaults is very

22

significant.

23

Q.

24
25

As a sub bullet, it's the same -- I'm showing you

And to put it in

So a shift in exclusive

And Professor, why did you rely upon the estimates

from Google and Microsoft in reaching the 33 percent number?
A.

So --

5751
1

THE COURT:

I'm sorry, when you say the Google-Microsoft

2

data, you're not referring to the thought experiments that

3

Google was performing.

4

In other words, I don't know whether the --

5

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

6

THE COURT:

7

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

8

THE COURT:

9
10

experiment.

This is actual numbers; is that right?

The NYC scenario?

Yes, yes.
The thought experiment.

That's right, calling it the thought

Is that an input in this --

THE WITNESS:

Yes.

So when I'm using -- remember,

11

those -- I don't want to call them thought experiments, because

12

I think it understates the importance of those estimates.

13

Those are estimates that are affecting billions of dollars for

14

these companies, okay.

15

extremely valuable estimates.

16

So I think those estimates are

Google has used those estimates for years, okay.

It

17

wasn't a one-shot thing in 2016.

In my report I have a list --

18

you know, an entire page where I'm going down, they used it

19

here, they used it here, they used it there, all the way to

20

2021.

21

name is Mike, Mr. Roszak, sorry, testify that they don't have

22

any better estimates.

23

important those estimates were to him.

And I've heard Mike Roszak testify -- I think his first

And you heard Mr. Tinter testify how

24

So those are the estimates that I'm using here, and I'm

25

asking, given the traffic that's going through all of these

5752
1

exclusive defaults, if you use those estimates -- which are

2

also in the case of Google confirmed by -- Google on PCs,

3

confirmed by what I looked at in Mozilla, if you use those

4

estimates, what do you get for the overall shift in U.S.

5

queries?

6

BY MR. SEVERT:

7

Q.

And Professor, when you did your estimate, did you --

8

and switching Google's exclusive defaults, did that include

9

switching the Google default on Windows Chrome?

10

A.

No, no.

11

Q.

Let's go to slide 32.

12

opinion.

13

case?

I think this is your fourth

Can you restate what your fourth opinion was in this

14

A.

Yeah, this is my fourth opinion.

So what is my fourth

15

opinion?

16

foreclose rivals from a substantial share of each relevant

17

market.

18

Q.

And how did you go about reaching this opinion?

19

A.

So, Your Honor, I know that in your summary judgment

It's that Google's search distribution contracts

20

opinion, the measurement of foreclosure was something that you

21

regarded as very important.

22

turn to slide 33.

23

how -- is the Areeda and Hovenkamp definition of measuring

24

foreclosure, which is that foreclosure is measured by looking

25

at the percentage of the market that's tied up by the

So what I did here -- if you'd

What I did here was -- and showing you is

5753
1

contracts.

2

Q.

3
4

So that's what I have tried to do as a measurement.

And does this Areeda definition of foreclosure make

sense to you as an economist?
A.

It does, because what it's doing is it's identifying

5

kind of the fundamental force that these contracts are having.

6

When I get to competitive effects, I'm going to use these

7

estimates to inform my analysis of competitive effects.

8

what this measurement is doing is it's kind of at a first level

9

asking, well, what do these contracts do if they're in place.

10
11
12

Q.

But

And were you able to identify a specific percentage of

the market that's foreclosed by Google's contracts?
A.

Not exactly.

Your Honor, this comes back, again, to

13

this discussion in your questions.

So there's a question of

14

what "tied up" means.

15

consumers have some variation in how affected they are by

16

defaults.

17

contracts make things, as we've already -- kind of the

18

conversation we've been having, it depends on the strength of

19

rivals.

And in particular, we talked about how

And so when you're thinking about how tied up the

20

And so what I've tried to do here -- and, you know, at

21

some level, it's not an economic decision in terms of this.

22

It's what you think is kind of the right measure.

23

tried to do is -- and I'm going to show you is a range, and I'm

24

going to explain how that range is related to strength of

25

rivals, where you can then think about what you think is the

So what I've

5754
1
2

right definition.
In the end, when I get to competitive effects, I'm going

3

to use all that information.

4

purposes you find the right thing, I'm just trying to provide

5

you with the information for you to think about that.

6

THE COURT:

But in terms of what -- for legal

To make sure I understand.

So at the most

7

general level, what the foreclosure rate is in your thinking,

8

it's here's the full market for search, say it's a hundred

9

searches a year -- obviously, that's not right, but a hundred

10

searches.

11

level, is the percentage of that hundred that is attributed to

12

those contracts in which Google is the default, the paid

13

default, correct?

14

THE WITNESS:

The tied-up portion, at least at the most general

So I'm going to show you a range.

It

15

depends what you mean by attributed to.

16

that's going to be one end of this range.

17

you something else, too.

18

started describing that in terms of the whole market, that's

19

exactly what I'm going to show you.

20

THE COURT:

Okay.

If you mean coverage,
I'm going to show

But we're going to -- the way you

And your range is not the coverage

21

range because -- maybe I'm jumping ahead.

22

some number of people are going to stick with Google no matter

23

what?

24
25

THE WITNESS:
it will help.

You're assuming that

So let me go two or three slides and I think

5755
1

THE COURT:

Fine, go ahead.

2

THE WITNESS:

3

the most helpful way.

4

BY MR. SEVERT:

5

Q.

What's the range that you identified?

6

A.

So the range, if you look at slide 34, at the high

Totally fine.

I'm just trying to do it in

7

end, it would be 50 percent.

8

get it?

9

covered by Google's exclusive defaults.

10

that are going through the defaults that are affected by

11

exclusionary provisions.

12

That 50 percent is -- where do I

It's the share of U.S. queries that are, quote,
They're the queries

At the low end, kind of a lower bound is 33 percent -- and

13

this is percentages of all U.S. queries, Your Honor.

And what

14

is that doing?

15

exclusive defaults make unavailable even to a much stronger

16

rival.

17

Q.

What do you mean by much stronger rival?

18

A.

So by much stronger rival, Your Honor -- and let me

It's the share of U.S. queries that Google's

So the -- anyway, let me pause there, and you can --

19

first just say, a way to think about the first number -- and

20

we're going to come back to that -- is the ones that are going

21

through the exclusionary defaults are ones that are affected to

22

some degree by the presence of a default.

23

just all of those queries.

24

matters.

But also there is a default in place, and that can

25

matter.

So that's what the 50 percent is going to be.

That is, it's not

It's not just Google's quality that

5756
1

The 33 percent is to think about an exercise where --

2

imagine rivals became like almost unimaginably better, where --

3

the thing I like to think about you're sitting at a restaurant

4

with your friends, and a question comes up, like, nobody knows

5

the answer.

6

that.

7

DuckDuckGo has become so good that everyone -- that that's what

8

everyone uses as the verb, okay.

9

I'm just picking DuckDuckGo.

10

much that it's gotten -- you know, which is almost

11

unimaginable, but imagine that they did.

12

And everyone immediately says let's DuckDuckGo

Nobody's talking about Googling things anymore.

What do I mean by that?

Or it could be another rival,

But some rival has improved that

The exact thing I mean by it is

13

they've gotten as much better than Google as Google now is

14

better than them.

15

about that.

16

mouthful.

17

fantastic search engine that is that much stronger than Google.

18

So that's the -- where the 33 percent's going to come

19

from, is asking what share of queries in the U.S. -- from these

20

covered queries, what share of them would a rival be able to

21

access when it got that good, and what share would nonetheless

22

stick with Google -- which is now not nearly as good as the

23

Super Duck, but would stick with Google just because it's the

24

default.

25

So that's the range that I'm kind of trying to show you.

That's what it's going to be when I think

I'll use a fanciful shorthand, because that's a

The rival has become Super Duck, okay.

It's just a

That's the way I'm thinking about this other extreme.

5757
1
2
3

Q.

And if we were looking just at mobile, what -- how

would that impact the range?
A.

So the range on both of these, if we looked at mobile,

4

would be bigger numbers.

5

bigger, I mean the high end would be bigger on mobile, the

6

share of covered queries is higher, and as well the lower bound

7

would be higher.

8

about mobile.

9

but just to state that.

10

I don't mean the range would be

I'm not going to go further into talking

I'm going to stick with the overall estimate.

THE COURT:

So the 50 percent number, let's just start

11

there.

So that's share of U.S. queries covered by Google's

12

exclusive defaults.

13

U.S. queries input into a search engine are subject to either

14

an RSA or the Apple agreement?

And by that, do you mean that half of all

15

THE WITNESS:

Yes, with -- except that I've done it kind

16

of conservatively.

So I'm not counting, for example, queries

17

coming through the bookmark in Safari -- on an iPhone, because

18

arguably somebody might say, oh, the bookmarks, Yahoo! and Bing

19

and Google are all there.

20

I'll show you, it's not going to have those in it.

21

going to have queries where an individual went to the Google

22

search app on an iPhone.

23

THE COURT:

24

THE WITNESS:

25

THE COURT:

So when I give a coverage number,
It's not

Right, or anything through Chrome.
Correct.

Which is probably the biggest number of the

5758
1
2

remaining 50.
THE WITNESS:

Exactly.

So it's not going to be counting

3

those things.

4

where we're looking at things that really are affected by the

5

exclusionary provisions.

6
7
8

I'm kind of trying to do it conservatively,

THE COURT:

And then the 33 percent, is that a third of 50

or is that a third of a hundred?
THE WITNESS:

Good question.

It's a third of a hundred.

9

So the 50 is 50 percent of all U.S. queries.

10

33 percent of all U.S. queries.

11

BY MR. SEVERT:

12

Q.

13

THE COURT:

The 33 is

Let's take a look at your slide 35 -Counsel, why don't we actually take a break

14

before Professor Whinston sort of provides more detail about

15

his conclusions.

16

So it's a little bit before 11:00.

We'll resume at 11:15.

17

See you all shortly.

Oh, one thing I did forget to add -- I

18

can tell you after the break, it's not important.

19

(Recess taken at 10:59 a.m.)

20

(Back on the record at 11:17 a.m.)

21

THE COURT:

Thank you.

Before we get started, Counsel, I wanted to

22

make sure -- I only saw it myself a couple minutes ago, that

23

both sides -- or all sides had seen the memorandum the New York

24

Times filed this morning.

25

up, since it reflects some meet and confer prior to that.

I assume you all received a heads

5759
1
2

So I would be -- well, let me ask you, does anybody wish
to submit something in writing in response?

3

MR. DINTZER:

Not the DOJ plaintiffs, Your Honor.

4

MR. CAVANAUGH:

5

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

Nor us.
We may want to.

Honestly, I haven't had

6

a chance -- my client hasn't had a chance to review it yet.

7

got some vague description of it, kind of multiple descriptions

8

of it starting late yesterday, and so we'd like a chance to

9

review it.

10

We may well want to file a response.

MR. DINTZER:

Your Honor, I'm going to walk back what I

11

said.

12

whether we're going to respond to it as well.

13

We

We have not finished looking at it, so we would withhold

THE COURT:

Okay.

Well, here's what I'd like to do then:

14

Can I ask everybody -- it's short, it's not very long.

15

make sure you review it at lunch, so that when we come back

16

after lunch, we can talk about how to proceed.

17

a desire to file something in writing, I would be inclined to

18

see if counsel for the Times is available at 5:00 today just to

19

address what the request is and try and work through it.

20

you'd like to do something in writing, I'd like to get it

21

tonight so it can be addressed tomorrow, so we can move apace

22

on this matter.

23

MR. DINTZER:

24

THE COURT:

25

Just

If there's not

If

Will do, Your Honor.

The one thing I forgot to mention this morning

when I announced that a couple of the transcripts have now been

5760
1

released -- or will be available this afternoon, is -- and

2

maybe, again, I should probably be more explicit about these

3

things.

4

I basically have done the same balancing I did the very

5

first time.

6

record.

7

by line through each of the transcripts, both the proposed

8

redactions that Google has -- redactions Google has proposed,

9

redactions by third parties, and then the position of the DOJ

10

and the states with respect to each of those requested

11

redactions.

12

Maybe I should reiterate that each time on the

But what I'll make clear now is that we are going line

The general categories that we have unredacted have

13

remained the same.

14

redacted remain the same.

15

financial numbers, strategic internal strategy issues, trade

16

secrets being the top three.

17

that I thought, if disclosed, could put -- it's really

18

primarily Google or a business partner of Google's at some

19

competitive disadvantage.

20

Generally categories that we have kept
So, again, sort of internal

And specific terms of contracts

The only caveat to that will be apparent in one of the

21

releases that will come out today, and that is I think I

22

have -- we've not redacted a portion of these exhibits --

23

excuse me, an agreement that refers to -- that references the

24

default and the way in which the default is structured.

25

see what I'm talking about.

You'll

5761
1

But given the centrality of that provision, we took a

2

harder look at it, and we made some decisions about whether at

3

least that portion of any agreement should be disclosed.

4

think at least in one case we did disclose that particular

5

portion.

Go ahead, Counsel.

7

BY MR. SEVERT:

8

Q.

9
10

And I

Welcome back, Professor Whinston.

slide 35.
A.

I think we were on

And what does slide 35 depict?

So, Your Honor, slide 35 is looking at the queries

11

covered by an exclusive distribution provision.

12

from 2016 to 2021, which were the -- through half of 2021,

13

the -- with this red line, what the queries that are covered by

14

exclusive provisions amount to.

15

the note at the bottom is redacted, and so it's --

16

Q.

Well, let me ask this:

It's showing

So -- can I -- I'm a little --

I think you said that the

17

coverage does not include Chrome on Apple or on PCs; is that

18

right?

19
20
21

THE COURT:

Can I ask, is there a reason that the box at

the bottom is redacted?
MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

I think we, and I believe Apple, have

22

treated as, you know, proprietary or confidential the portions

23

that are attributable to particular access points on devices.

24

And I believe that has been consistent with other third parties

25

as well.

And so this -- by this clarification, Your Honor, by

5762
1

sort of negative inference, then gives more insight into what a

2

larger number implies, if that makes sense.

3

THE COURT:

4

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

5

Okay.

It does.
For consistency's sake, that's why that

has been done.

6

MR. SEVERT:

I'll point out, this is pretty aggregated.

7

It's not by channel.

8

MR. SCHMIDTLEIN:

Understood.

9

THE COURT:

Look, from where I'm sitting, given

Okay.

10

this is an excluded amount -- these are exclusions from the

11

percentage that Dr. Whinston has calculated, it's not clear to

12

me that just identifying these is really a problem.

13

tried to do is maintain confidentiality with respect to

14

particular search access points.

15

the negative of that, I'm not so sure it creates a real

16

problem.

17

from the box there.

19

Okay, thank you.

I mean, I'm afraid I may

have already said it already.
THE COURT:

20
21

And this is, while perhaps

So feel free to refer to what's otherwise redacted

THE WITNESS:

18

What we've

I know you did.

I'm giving you retroactive

cover.
THE WITNESS:

22

Okay, thanks.

So as I said earlier, Your

23

Honor, this is showing over time the 50 percent numbers

24

corresponding to 2020.

25

on.

It did rise some over time from 2016

And as I described to you earlier, I excluded things that

5763
1

one might arguably have said aren't -- even if paid, aren't --

2

even if paid under the contract, are not kind of exclusionary.

3

And so I excluded iGSA and the bookmarks.

4

Chrome is not in here at all.

5

here at all.

6

BY MR. SEVERT:

7

Q.

Just a clarification, what is iGSA?

8

A.

Sorry, the Google Search app for iPhones.

9

Q.

And when you said Chrome is not on here at all, does

10

And, of course,

User-downloaded Chrome is not in

this include Chrome on Android?

11

A.

This includes Chrome -- thank you, it includes Chrome

12

on Android.

13

on Windows, user-downloaded Chrome on Apple devices.

What it doesn't include is user-downloaded Chrome

14

Q.

And then, Professor, did you look at coverage by

15

partner type?

16

A.

I did.

So if you'd go to slide 36.

Your Honor, I

17

think you asked about -- at some point in one of the hearings,

18

you asked about how it breaks out by partner type.

19

just -- the total is that number to the right, 49.7.

20

the approximately 50 percent that I rounded up to 50, the

21

number that I rounded to 50, and this is just how it splits

22

out.

23
24
25

Q.

Okay.

And this is
That's

Why is the coverage of Google's agreements a

reasonable estimate of foreclosure?
A.

Well, as I said earlier, I think it's a reasonable

5764
1

number for a foreclosure measure in the sense that it's the

2

number of queries that are affected to whatever extent they are

3

affected by the presence of a default.

4

for which it's not just the quality of Google and the rivals,

5

but also there's a default effect present.

6
7

Q.

So those are queries

And why doesn't the fact that defaults can be changed

mean that foreclosure is less than coverage?

8

A.

I'm sorry, could you just repeat the question?

9

Q.

Sure.

Why doesn't the fact that defaults can be

10

changed, why doesn't it mean that foreclosure is less than

11

coverage?

12

A.

Right.

So along the lines we've been talking about,

13

there are ways to get to rivals that are not just involving the

14

default.

15

than any exclusive dealing case involving distribution.

16

Consumers typically have some way of getting to rivals that

17

isn't the distributors that are subject to the exclusive

18

provisions.

19

And so the -- it's really no different in some sense

And so that's no different here.

It's the issue that we

20

started talking about before the break.

And so that's -- you

21

know, that's something that when I'm thinking about this range,

22

that's exactly what I'm trying to think about.

23

kind of Super Duck, you know, exercise of thinking, well, what

24

happens if we have such a strong rival.

25

at trying to get at.

That's what the

That's what it's aimed

5765
1
2
3

Q.

And let's turn to that, the other end of the range.

Where does the 33 percent come from?
A.

So the 33 percent comes from exactly the share-shift

4

estimate that we talked about earlier.

So that's how we're

5

going to get to a measure of foreclosure.

6

Q.

And can you walk us through that?

7

A.

So if you bring up slide 37.

So, Your Honor, earlier

8

you talked about the whole market.

9

that whole market to start with.

10

know, it adds up to a hundred percent.

11

are the -- the 50 percent that are the covered queries.

12

yellow is user-downloaded Chrome.

13

queries that are not affected, you know, either by the

14

contracts or are going through user-downloaded Chrome.

15

is kind of a picture of the overall market.

16
17
18

Q.

This is just a graphic of

So we just talked -- you
In red, we talked about
In

And then in green are other

So this

And would a much stronger rival be able to attract

some of this 50 percent in red?
A.

So a much stronger rival would be able to attract some

19

of that 50 percent.

So, Your Honor, earlier, as we were

20

speaking, I talked about how in that 50 percent users vary in

21

how much they're affected by defaults, whether it's behavioral

22

or rational or for whatever reason.

23

And so if you bring up slide 38, I'm representing that.

24

And I've pulled out that 50 percent, and you can imagine kind

25

of that that red is shaded.

Some of it's dark red.

There's no

5766
1

way you're going to get to some of those.

2

lighter red, and maybe they would go to a rival if the rival

3

was better.

4

Some of it is

So what I'm going to try to -- what I'm going to walk you

5

through is how those previous share-shift estimates give you

6

the answer about Super Duck and what Super Duck could access,

7

okay.

8

So let's think about those share-shift estimates.

So when

9

Google was thinking, what if we lose the default to a rival, it

10

was thinking about what if it lost to a Bing or a DuckDuckGo,

11

i.e. -- and those rivals were much weaker than Google.

12

that share-shift estimate told us was if Google lost the

13

default to a much weaker rival, how much would the default --

14

basically, the power of the default protect queries for the

15

rival, for the weak rival.

16

So what

And so what I've done here is represent that graphically.

17

So you can see the 33 percent is that 33 -- to the left, is

18

dark red.

19

defaults are extremely powerful.

20

the default and Google out there with its better product, those

21

consumers don't follow Google.

Those are queries done by consumers for whom
Even with a weaker rival in

They stick with the default.

22

The 17 percent in that previous share-shift estimate is

23

the remaining part of the 50 percent of U.S. queries that are

24

covered.

25

when we were talking about it, they are the queries that Google

Those are ones that Google recovers.

Previously,

5767
1

recovers if it loses the default to a much weaker rival.

2

that's a description of this picture in terms of the

3

share-shift estimate, okay.

4

a much weaker rival, the power of defaults is going to get that

5

rival, even against Google, 33 percent of the U.S. market.

6

So

So it's telling me that if I have

So now let's think about Super Duck.

Imagine that a

7

rival -- you know, DuckDuckGo or some other rival invested so

8

much and was so successful at raising its quality that it was

9

as much better as Google as Google now is to the rivals, okay.

10

Well, this same number is telling me the answer, because this

11

number is telling me what the much strong stronger rival would

12

get and what the much weaker rival would get.

13

Only now, I'm just thinking about it from the other

14

perspective, which is suppose Google is the weaker rival

15

because we have Super Duck out there, and Google is going to

16

get 33 percent of those 50, even though it's not nearly as good

17

as Super Duck.

Super Duck's only going to get 17.

18

So that's how those previous estimates give you this

19

range, where if you, like, imagine, you know, how strong -- you

20

know, what's a lower bound for how powerful these defaults are,

21

for how much they protect Google?

22

Duck.

23

better than Google as Google now is to them, and how much

24

Google would nonetheless hang on, too, compared to the rival,

25

the much stronger rival.

It's thinking about Super

It's unimaginable improvement in rivals to get as much

So that's how we get to the lower

5768
1
2

number for the impact as a foreclosure measure.
Q.

And then what about the 50 percent of queries that

3

aren't covered under Google's contracts, the yellow and the

4

green part on the top of the slide, of slide 38?

5

available to rivals?

Is that

6

A.

7

number.

8

foreclosure upper bound is this 50 percent.

9

your view of what those numbers mean, because there's no

10

allegation about what Google is doing with Chrome.

11

Chrome queries are not fully available either to rivals,

12

because Chrome is coming with a default in it to Google.

13

So it's not -- those things are not in the foreclosure
The foreclosure lower bound is this 33 percent.

The

But it does color

But those

And so when you think about these numbers, this 33 percent

14

number or the 50 percent number, in some sense, you shouldn't

15

think of it, I think, relative to a hundred percent.

16

really should think of it in some sense relative to some

17

smaller possible available market because of the presence of

18

Chrome.

19

THE COURT:

You

Can we just go back to 17 percent to make sure

20

I understand what that number is.

21

the defaults were switched.

22

switched, I mean to another browser -- excuse me, to another

23

search engine.

24

would maintain?

25

So the 33 percent is if all

The 33 percent is -- when I say

This is your estimate of how much a weak rival

THE WITNESS:

Yes.

5769
1

THE COURT:

2

THE WITNESS:

3

THE COURT:

4
5
6

From day one?
Correct.

The 17 percent is the delta between the 50 and

the 33?
THE WITNESS:

Correct.

It's what Google -- remember when

we had those Google documents about recovery?

7

THE COURT:

Yeah.

8

THE WITNESS:

They were expressing it as what share of the

9

50 we hang on to, but that share of the 50 is 17 percent of

10

U.S. queries.

11

the much stronger one and a rival as much weaker, which is the

12

way those earlier documents were thinking about it, Google is

13

the one that was imagining itself not with a default, a weaker

14

rival with it.

15

of queries in the U.S. I now have through the defaults, I'm

16

only going to hang on to 17 percent of U.S. queries.

17

what Google was saying in those -- you know, if we use those

18

estimates.

19

So the 17, when we're thinking about Google as

Google was saying, well, out of that 50 percent

That's

But now, when you think about Super Duck, it's just the

20

roles are reversed.

21

Google is the one with the default.

22

estimate is telling you is that default will protect Google, to

23

the extent that it's -- even against Super Duck it's going to

24

hang on to 33 percent.

25

Super Duck is now the strong one and
And so what that same

And just to be clear, if the rivals -- imagine Super Duck

5770
1

wasn't as strong as Super Duck, it was Super Duck Minus or

2

whatever funky name I'll give it.

3

than that 33 percent.

4

range that I'm kind of giving you.

5

THE COURT:

Google would hang on to more

So it's -- you know, that's why it's a

So essentially, the 17 percent, in your

6

estimation, is a sliding scale based upon the increasing

7

strength of a rival?

8

THE WITNESS:

Right.

So it's saying that, like, if you're

9

a rival, even if you thought of doing the unimaginable

10

improvement in your quality and you were looking at these

11

50 percent of covered queries, and you asked yourself, well,

12

what could I get out of that even if I managed to achieve that,

13

the answer is, at most, 17 percent of U.S. queries.

BY MR. SEVERT:

15

Q.

Professor, up to now, our discussion of foreclosure

16

has focused on general search services.

17

the foreclosure analysis apply for the ads markets?

18

A.

If you bring up slide 39.

How about:

Your Honor, this is showing

19

you coverage for general search text ad revenue.

20

again, falling under the exclusive provisions.

21

here -- again, we have the same redaction issue.

22

THE COURT:

How does

That is,

What you see

I'm sorry, can we go back to 38 real quick.

23

want to clarify one more thing.

The 33 percent in your

24

estimation, that is of the overall U.S. market?

25

words, 33 of a hundred percent?

In other

I

5771
1

THE WITNESS:

2

THE COURT:

3
4

Correct.

The 17 percent, is that also 17 percent of a

hundred percent or 17 percent of 50 percent?
THE WITNESS:

No, 17 percent of a hundred.

In other

5

words, you add those two things up, and it comes to the 50 that

6

are covered.

7

Duck out there, and we looked at those covered queries

8

before -- you know, that Google has, what share -- when that

9

improvement in Super Duck happened, what share of that 50 would

10

Google still have when suddenly Super Duck -- DuckDuckGo became

11

Super Duck, and what share would Super Duck get of that.

12

So it's basically telling you, if we had Super

So we're going to take that 50 percent of U.S. queries,

13

33 percent of U.S. queries Google will hang on to.

14

is going to get 17 percent of U.S. queries.

15

saying out of that coverage, how does it split out when Google

16

has those defaults and faces a really strong rival.

17

THE COURT:

Super Duck

So we're just

But the 17 percent, that would assume that

18

Google essentially loses all of those 50 percent of those

19

queries.

20

THE WITNESS:

21

THE COURT:

So it's -- say the sentence again, sorry.

In other words, the 17 percent, say it's

22

achieved.

23

50 percent that is otherwise foreclosed right now?

24
25

That, in your estimation, is a complete loss of the

THE WITNESS:
me try again.

I wouldn't say it exactly that way.

So let

5772
1

THE COURT:

Okay, sorry.

2

THE WITNESS:

No, it's totally fine.

I mean, it's

3

actually not the easiest thing to wrap your head around.

So

4

what we have is -- you know, imagine we have these contracts in

5

place.

6

little old DuckDuckGo.

7

going through these -- as they are now, going through these

8

exclusive defaults.

9

happens.

10

DuckDuckGo amazing, Super Duck.

11

manage to attract out of those covered queries?

We're in a situation, to start with, where it's just
And 50 percent of covered queries are

And now, bang, suddenly some miracle

Gabriel Weinberg suddenly figures out how to make
What is he going to get and

12

So covered queries amount to half of U.S. queries.

13

only going to get 17 percent of U.S. -- in other words, 17

14

divided by 50 is the share of those that he's going to get.

15

Google is going to hang on to what share of the 50?

16

Thirty-three divided by 50, that's the share.

17

I'm kind of showing that it splits the 50.

18

THE COURT:

19

BY MR. SEVERT:

20

Q.

He's

So that's why

Okay, I think I understand.

Professor, just going to the ads markets for coverage

21

number, what was the coverage number you calculated on slide 39

22

for the general search text ad revenue?

23

A.

So this, Your Honor, is the same kind of slide that I

24

showed you before about coverage, only it's doing exactly the

25

same thing but for search text ad revenue.

And what it's

5773
1

showing you is that in 2020, 45 percent of U.S. general search

2

text ad revenue was covered by these exclusivity provisions.

3
4
5

Q.

And what coverage did you calculate in the search

advertising market?
A.

You go to slide 40, you'll see the same thing for the

6

overall search ad market, which is that 36 percent in 2020 was

7

covered.

8

Q.

And in these last two slides, 39 and 40, we looked at

9

your upper bound estimates for foreclosure in the ads markets.

10

Can you give us a rough sense of what the lower bound would

11

look like?

12

A.

Yeah.

So a rough sense in the numbers we're looking

13

at for search services and queries a moment ago, Your Honor,

14

the lower bound was two-thirds of the coverage number.

15

rough estimate here, and actually a conservative one, would be

16

that that lower bound would be two-thirds of these coverage

17

numbers.

18

Q.

Why is it conservative?

19

A.

It's conservative -- if you go -- there's evidence

So a

20

that the shift of the defaults can -- shifts revenue more than

21

it shifts queries.

22

that we first looked at that you saw as well from Professor

23

Rangel, it states in the Mozilla change from Yahoo! -- from

24

Google to Yahoo!, Google lost 30 percent of queries but

25

45 percent of revenue.

So if you go back to that Google document

So that's why I view it as

5774
1

conservative.

2

Q.

3
4

And Professor, let's turn now to slide 41.

your opinion five.
A.

This is

Can you, again, state your opinion five?

Yeah, so opinion five is that Google search

5

distribution contracts have harmed competition to the likely

6

detriment of consumers and advertisers.

7
8
9

Q.

And just to start at a high level, why does

competition matter?
A.

Well, competition matters because it determines the

10

outcomes in markets that consumers, in the case of search

11

services and advertisers, get.

12

get when they go to these markets, and competition has a

13

significant effect on that.

Like what are the benefits they

14

Q.

And then do you recall writing in your rebuttal

15

report:

16

locking up search access points through the challenged

17

agreements is ideally estimated relative to a but-for world"?

"The likely competitive effects of Google's behavior

18

A.

I do.

19

Q.

And what did you mean by "a but-for world" in that

20
21

sentence?
A.

So, Your Honor, just a but-for world, what we mean is

22

thinking about what would have happened in the general case, in

23

the absence of an event or the absence of a behavior.

24

that's what we mean.

25

of Google's contracting practices.

And so

In this case, it would be in the absence

5775
1
2

Q.

And are there challenges associated with determining

what a but-for world might be?

3

A.

There are.

4

Q.

And what kinds of challenges are there?

5

A.

So this is why I used the -- you know, in that

6

sentence you read before, I used the word "ideally."

So, Your

7

Honor, it's just very hard.

8

requires thinking back to -- for me, thinking being to 2014 and

9

asking what would the evolution of this entire market have been

10

in the absence of Google's behavior.

11

basically, some backward time machine into a world that doesn't

12

exist.

In this case, for example, it

You know, like,

13

If you think about it, like even at the start -- like a

14

first thing I ask myself when I think about that, Your Honor,

15

is what would Google have done.

16

contracts that it did do, what contracts would it have used.

17

So maybe it would have used an unconditional revenue share that

18

paid revenue share but didn't require exclusivity.

19

would have used some kind of most-favored supplier contract,

20

that said that it had to have at least as good search access

21

points and access to consumers as any rival did.

22

would have used no contracts.

23

would be chosen no matter what.

24
25

Like if it wasn't doing the

Maybe it

Maybe it

Sometimes we hear Google say it
Maybe it would have done that.

And even at the start of thinking about that is a legal
question I don't even know the answer to, which is:

Well,

5776
1

which of those is permissible?

2

would Google's general counsel have decided was a safe thing to

3

do?

And what

I don't know the answer to that.
So even at the start, it's not exactly clear what --

4
5

I don't know that.

exactly what the change in Google's behavior would be.

6

Q.

Are there uncertainties relating to what rivals may

7

have done?

8

A.

There are.

So on top of the starting point of what --

9

how Google's behavior would change, for current rivals, how

10

would they have changed their investments; how would their

11

investment efforts led -- you know, how much of a quality

12

change would their investment efforts have led to; how would

13

that quality translate into changes in market share.

14

that's for current rivals.

15

might have come in; would Apple have come in.

16

things are kind of up for grabs to think about.

17

very challenging, and it means that that kind of analysis is

18

not going to be something that comes up with some quantitative

19

number, like, oh, if we had done this, the but-for world would

20

have been 7 percent.

21

just an impossibility.

22
23
24
25

And

And then what potential rivals
So all of these
It's very,

We're not going to end up with that, it's

Q.

So given the difficulties you described, what did you

A.

So what I did is I thought about two -- most about two

do?

particular but-for worlds.

One is thinking about an

5777
1

unconditional revenue share payment, that what if Google had

2

done that.

3

where Google might have -- you know, for example, it might have

4

offered a payment that was conditional on a choice screen, on

5

at least being in a choice screen, or having at least as much

6

access points as rivals or something like that.

7

And the other being sort of most-favored supplier,

So those are -- and those are -- the thing about them is

8

they're less restrictive.

9

told myself is, okay, let's think about something that's less

10

restrictive than what happened.

11

would have been permissible.

12

would have done it.

13

possible less restrictive alternatives I could have thought

14

about, but those are the two primary ones I did think about.

15
16
17

Q.

So with that uncertainty, what I

I don't know for sure if it

I don't know for sure if Google

Granted, there are many other things,

How would those two less restrictive alternatives that

you mentioned, how would they impact competition?
A.

So the way I view those two less restrictive

18

alternatives, Your Honor, is that they would have made it more

19

likely that there would have been an equal -- more equal

20

playing field in terms of distribution.

21

analysis then is, well, what would that mean.

22

end up leading to in terms of changes in competition.

23

the reasons that I just said, the way I think about that, you

24

know, I'm not going to be able to trace -- you know, come up

25

with the number, the 7 percent.

And so a lot of my
What would that
And for

But what I can do is think

5778
1

about how that changes the fundamental forces in the market,

2

and think about how those changes in fundamental forces would

3

change market outcomes.

4

Q.

So that's what I did.

And then just to go back to foreclosure, you alluded

5

to this earlier.

6

competitive effects fit together?

7

A.

Now talking about -- how do foreclosure and

So, Your Honor, the foreclosure measure that you had

8

asked about and that we talked about, I think of it as it's an

9

input in some sense to thinking about competitive effects.

10

It's a much more circumscribed question.

11

contracts in place, what would the effect be on how much of the

12

market is tied up on -- you know, how much that quality

13

improvement by DuckDuckGo could have given it.

14

It's asking, with the

And that -- you know, what's nice is, okay, I can have a

15

quantitative measure of that that informs me.

16

to competitive effects, I'm taking that and I'm taking other

17

information about the market and coming up -- you know, trying

18

to analyze what all of that ends up meaning.

19

sense, it's an input.

20

Q.

But when I get

And so in that

At least, that's how I think about it.

And if -- but if you're using -- if competitive

21

effects are best measured relative to the but-for world -- or a

22

but-for world, why are you not using a but-for world to

23

estimate foreclosure?

24
25

A.

For the reason that I said, that it's useful to start

by thinking about kind of this fundamental force of what the

5779
1

contracts do.

2

with the contracts in place, what's tied up?

3

end of the analysis.

4

we, I.

5

effects and take that -- having learned that, then use that in

6

thinking about what the impact would be.

7

Q.

That's what the foreclosure measure is.

It's,

And it's not the

We're going to take that when we get --

I'm going to take that when I get to competitive

And Professor, are you aware that Google has argued

8

that you defined foreclosure as the difference in market shares

9

between this world and a but-for world?

10

A.

I am.

11

THE COURT:

12

BY MR. SEVERT:

13

Q.

I'm sorry, what was the question?

Are you aware that Google has argued that you defined

14

foreclosure as the difference in market shares between this

15

world and a but-for world?

16
17
18

A.

I am.

I think Mr. Schmidtlein said something like

that in the opening.
Q.

And just to be really clear, do you define foreclosure

19

as the difference in market shares between this world and a

20

but-for world?

21

A.

22

report.

23

foreclosure measure is measuring is how much of the market is

24

tied up when the contracts are in place.

25

when I get to competitive effects and I'm thinking about, gee,

No, absolutely not.

And I say that in my rebuttal

As I said, what foreclosure measure -- what the

That's different than

5780
1

how does this all -- how do these contracts all play out.

2

I get to competitive effects, I am thinking about but-for

3

worlds.

4

Q.

Can you explain what's causing the confusion?

5

A.

I think they're conflating what I say about

When

That's the difference.

6

foreclosure and share shifts to what I'm saying about

7

competitive effects.

8

I think sometimes you can -- keeping track of this difference,

9

especially for an academic who does what I do, is a little

10

tricky.

11

written, I might write down a model that has -- I'm looking at

12

the effect of a firm writing exclusive contracts.

13

into the model, and the model then let's me analyze what the

14

ultimate effect is on outcomes.

15

And so it's -- you know, I think it is --

Because in academic papers -- such as many I've

It's built

The literature I -- and I'm one of them, part of that

16

literature, is very loose about the way it uses the word

17

"foreclosure."

18

done all that analysis, proven a theorem, the end of that paper

19

will say -- and in describing the result will say

20

foreclosure -- you know, this outcome is because of

21

foreclosure.

22

there isn't this foreclosure measure kind of measuring that

23

first fundamental starting point.

24

people, including myself, describe the whole outcome as the

25

result of foreclosure.

It will -- you know, the end of that -- having

There isn't -- in those papers, in the academic,

It's in there and that's why

But there isn't a separate foreclosure

5781
1
2

measure.
So it's easy, at least for me, to start that

3

distinction -- which really comes in in this case, and I think

4

it's important, like I think it's really helpful to break that

5

out when you're thinking about this case and have that

6

foreclosure measure.

7

do in an academic paper.

8

Q.

Okay.

But it's not something that we normally

Professor, let's turn to the issue of effects

9

on competition.

Do Google's distribution contracts harm

10

competition?

11

A.

They do.

12

Q.

And why do they lead to reduced competition?

13

A.

So if you go to slide 42, you'll see two things here.

14

So, Your Honor, the way I think about this, there are kind of

15

two distinct ways in which competition is harmed, two

16

mechanisms.

17

coming from reduced scale.

18

about scale mattering for quality.

19

about that shortly.

20

direct -- you know, if rivals have reduced scale, that can

21

directly reduce the quality of their search services and their

22

ad as well.

23

weakens rivals as competitors.

24

occurs from these contracts.

25

The first mechanism is kind of a direct mechanism
I think you've heard testimony
We will, I think, talk

But because, you know, reduced scale can

So they -- basically, reduced scale directly
So that's one way in which harm

The second way is distinct.

It's about incentives.

I've

5782
1

kind of alluded to this a little bit already, which is:

2

contracts reduce the incentives for rivals to compete on

3

quality and price -- price in the case of the ad markets.

4

does that for Google.

5

rivals.

6

it for potential distributors.

7

know, when I'm thinking about the competitive impact here, I'm

8

thinking about those two kinds of mechanisms.

9
10
11

Q.

It

It does that for current search engine

It does that for potential entrants.

And it also does

So I think that's how I -- you

And I think you mentioned you list Google in your

second mechanism.
A.

The

Why is Google listed there?

So let me -- maybe I'll -- it helps maybe to first --

12

if you don't mind, to say something about current search engine

13

rivals and entrants.

14

you think about that Super Duck example, DuckDuckGo, if it's

15

thinking about how much to invest in improving its quality,

16

takes account of how much it can possibly get as a benefit.

17

And to the extent that these contracts are in place and tie up

18

the market, there's less that DuckDuckGo can foresee as a

19

benefit of investing.

20

other rivals of Google see their incentives reduced.

21

thing for potential entrants, same story.

22

And we're going to come to this.

But if

So that's how DuckDuckGo's incentives or

Mr. Severt, your question was about Google:

Same

So why would

23

Google's incentives be reduced.

Google's incentives are

24

reduced for two reasons.

25

contracts -- the same point that the contracts tie up the

One is for the same reason that the

5783
1

market insulate Google.

So Google doesn't have to worry if I

2

lose -- my quality isn't so good -- or isn't as good as it

3

might have been, I'm going to lose a lot of customers.

4

So it affects Google's incentives in that sense, and

5

having weaker rivals also reduces Google's concerns over losing

6

customers.

7

was when we talked about ad markets, ad auctions, we were

8

talking about competition in ad auctions and Usain Bolt; and

9

this image of like it mattered where the rivals -- Usain's

10

rivals were for how fast he would run.

11

here.

12

competition.

13

matter for them in terms of what they can do in terms of

14

innovation.

15

Q.

16
17

So actually, I think nine days ago or whatever it

It's the same idea

Google is going to run faster if it has more
And then finally, distributors, it's going to

Okay.

Let's talk about your first mechanism.

What

role does scale play in your competitive effects analysis?
A.

So scale is going to matter in a very directive way in

18

this first mechanism.

19

is important for quality, then rivals are going to be weaker

20

competitors.

21

Q.

22
23

So if rivals have less scale and scale

As an economist, why do you think you have something

useful to tell the Court about scale?
A.

So, Your Honor, scale is a central thing that -- in

24

industrial organization.

By that I mean scale impacts market

25

outcomes in a significant way.

The literature in industrial

5784
1

organization is focused on that to a large degree, on how scale

2

effects matter for market outcomes.

3

So if you look at my -- if you looked at my CV and you

4

looked at my papers, like some of my most significant papers

5

are precisely about this.

6

for example, which sort of resurrected -- or put -- you know,

7

formalized kind of leveraged theories of tying, what was the

8

key thing that it did.

9

scale economies.

10

how tying contracts could matter.

11

exclusive dealing, same thing.

12

very central thing in industrial organization.

13

markets we look at aren't all number two wheat.

So a paper that I wrote about tying,

It posited a world where there were

And that had a really big impact on what -In papers I've written on

So it's just -- it's just a
It's why the

14

And then the last thing I'd say is economists have

15

developed a tool kit, an empirical tool kit, for looking at

16

scale effects.

17

things.

18

bring to the table about the effects of scale on market

19

outcomes.

20

Q.

It's just standard, kind of bread and butter

So I think an economist has a lot to say, a lot to

And as an economist, what kind of evidence did you

21

rely upon to determine whether there were scale effects in this

22

case?

23

A.

So if you go to slide 43, three kinds of things.

One

24

was ordinary course of business documents and testimony.

A

25

second was empirical work that I did using the data that Google

5785
1

and Bing provided to me -- or I shouldn't say to me, but in

2

this case.

3

were significant business decisions that were predicated on

4

scale.

5

Q.

And then, finally, looking at the fact that there

And what does this -- I guess at a high level, what

6

does the scale of various market participants look like in the

7

industry?

8

A.

So, Your Honor, I mean, it's not going to be a

9

surprise, given everything you've seen, that there's a massive

10

scale difference between Google and its rivals.

11

Q.

Is it just total number of queries that's relevant?

12

A.

Right.

So when we look at -- you know, the most

13

immediate thing, of course, is you just think about market

14

shares of queries, like I showed you last time.

15

there's a big scale difference.

16

looking -- and if you bring up slide 44, you can start looking

17

at kind of a little bit more of like how does that rubber hit

18

the road, like how does it impact things.

19

Of course

But you can also start

So here, the whole slide, I guess, except for pieces of

20

the bullet points is redacted.

21

Honor, is look using Google and Bing data for -- at query

22

phrases that they get.

23

on here.

24
25

But what I've done here, Your

So I had a week -- I think it says this

Yeah.

So seven-day query data.

There was a week where -- in

February 2020 where I have data on all the queries that they're

5786
1

getting.

And so I can look at how many -- you know, out of the

2

query phrases Google and Bing got -- by phrases, I mean the

3

exact -- the things that were put in as keyword searches, okay.

4

Not the number of queries here but the query phrases.
So here what I'm showing you is out of the query phrases

5
6

Google and Bing got overall, that one of them got or maybe both

7

of them got, how many were received only by Google, that's in

8

red.

9

how many did they both receive.

How many were received only by Bing, that's in blue.

And

10

So what you can see on the left -- and it's showing it on

11

the left for all devices, on the right for PCs and -- I mean,

12

in the middle for PCs and on the right for mobile.

13

on the left you can see a very -- an extremely high share of

14

query phrases is only received by Google.

15

mobile, all the way to right.

If you look

It's even higher in

16

Now -- and then down at the bottom are two further -- you

17

know, the first bullet point is just also saying this is just

18

if you received things but if you look, say, at query

19

phrases -- the first bullet point is saying if you look at

20

query phrases that Google received in this week between one and

21

four times, what share were seen by Bing and what share

22

weren't.

23

that were not seen by Bing.

24
25

Q.

You can see it's a number close to a hundred percent

Professor, aren't a lot of the queries that Google

sees very infrequent?

A lot of them are tail queries or maybe

5787
1

they're not important?
A.

2

Right.

So this is talking about queries -- you know,

3

query phrases overall.

And, of course, the ones -- you know,

4

these phrases that Bing isn't seeing that Google is, they are

5

what you would call tail queries.

6

which is why Bing is not seeing them at all, given that it's

7

small traffic.

They're not frequently seen,

You might ask -- a completely immediate question would be,

8
9

well, okay, maybe tail queries aren't important.

10

are important, and there's two ways you can kind of capture --

11

look at that.

12

represents, okay, so that -- what share of queries is Google

13

seeing that isn't seen by Bing, that's the second bullet point.

14

And you can see, yeah, okay, even if when I count the

15

number of queries, in aggregate these tail queries add up to a

16

lot.

17

being seen by Bing and are being seen by Google.

18

I'd say they

One, if you look at what share of queries this

So a lot of queries are not seen -- in aggregate are not

The second thing is tail queries are an important

19

differentiator.

I think you've heard testimony -- I think it

20

was in testimony by Mr. Giannandrea, when he was advising

21

Apple -- when Microsoft made an attempt in 2018 to do a joint

22

certain deal with Apple or sell Apple Bing, he spent some time

23

evaluating Bing.

24

most of the time but, like, then you get some tail -- you put

25

in some tail query and it's terrible.

And what he said was, well, it's pretty good

I mean, I don't know if

5788
1

the word was terrible.

2

THE COURT:

3
4

No, no, this was his Eurythmics, Annie Lennox

example.
THE WITNESS:

Okay.

So you can see from that what it was

5

doing in the tail was really important.

6

well -- you know, not anyone.

7

But Bing can do well in the head toward queries, but the

8

differentiator is in the tail.

9

THE COURT:

Like anyone can do

I can't do well in the head.

Sorry, can we just back up.

Can you help me

10

understand what these percentages are and what they represent

11

one more time because I'm just trying to understand why these

12

numbers are different and what they represent.

13

THE WITNESS:

Okay.

So on the left it's saying, if I look

14

at all the query phrases put in on -- into Google and Bing --

15

Google and/or Bing in that week, Annie Lennox, Talking Heads,

16

Baltimore Orioles, whatever it is, I look at all of them.

17

red percent, the percent in the red, is saying that out of all

18

those phrases, that percent are phrases that only Google is

19

seeing in that week.

20

THE COURT:

21

THE WITNESS:

22

THE COURT:

23

THE WITNESS:

24

THE COURT:

25

The

Bing doesn't see them at all.

So these are unique -Phrases.

Unique phrases?
Yes.

In other words, anything that is seen on both

search engines --

5789
1

THE WITNESS:

2

THE COURT:

3

THE WITNESS:

4

THE COURT:

5

THE WITNESS:

That's in the green.

That's in the green?
Yes.

Okay.

6

is in the blue.

7

THE COURT:

8

THE WITNESS:

And then anything that's seen only by Bing

Okay.
And then if you look to the right, it's

9

doing the same exercise but restricting to queries that were

10

put in in that week on PCs, and doing the same calculation.

11

And then on the right -- sorry, in the middle.

12

right, restricting to queries that were put in on mobile

13

phones, and doing the same calculation.

14

THE COURT:

Okay.

And on the

And so the first bullet, then, is the

15

number of phrases seen between a particular number of times.

16

That number is higher.

17

THE WITNESS:

Right.

So what this is saying is of that

18

very big number of queries that Google is seeing, some of them

19

had seen a lot, some had seen little.

20

even focus on the tail of the tail, like queries that Google

21

has just seen between one and four times in that week.

22

the tail of the tail, yeah, just like you said, you get an even

23

bigger number.

24
25

I was just saying, let's

And in

And I don't know if you want to -- want me to also say
something about the second bullet point?

5790
1

THE COURT:

If you would, yes.

2

THE WITNESS:

So the second bullet point is saying, well,

3

okay, you know, fine, a skeptic might say fine, you just showed

4

me that Google -- of these query phrases, you know, these

5

weird -- you know, there are all these weird query phrases, and

6

sure, Google's seeing those and Bing isn't.

7

and they're almost never put in, and, like, they don't add up

8

to much.

9

But they're weird

Actually -- so what the second pull bullet point is saying

10

is yeah, they do.

11

query is put in and you add up the -- you take that red and you

12

take a count of how many times each of the things in the red

13

is -- each of these things is put in and you just count what

14

share of queries, not query phrases but queries, the red would

15

be -- red would be the share that is in the second bullet.

16
17

THE COURT:

When you take a count of how many times each

I see.

Okay.

So that second bullet point is

a percentage based on total queries, not --

18

THE WITNESS:

19

THE COURT:

20

THE WITNESS:

21

up to something.

22

THE COURT:

23

THE WITNESS:

24

THE COURT:

25

BY MR. SEVERT:

Correct.

-- unique phrases?
Yes.

So it's just trying to say does it add

Okay.
And the answer is yes.

Okay.

Terrific, thank you.

5791
1

Q.

And Professor, let's start by talking about the effect

2

of Google scale advantages on the user side.

Have you seen

3

documents that scale impacts a search engine's quality for

4

consumers?

5

A.

I have.

6

Q.

What have you seen?

7

A.

If you'd bring up slide 45.

Your Honor, this is a

8

2017 Google document that I know you've seen before.

It was

9

authored by Dr. Lehman.

10

was a presentation to people in charge of user interface or

11

something to make sure that users really took account of --

12

would click on the things that they cared about.

13

point of this is not -- actually, before that, which is just,

14

okay, this is how -- this is not how search works on the left.

15

On the right it's how search does work.

I think he testified about it, that it

The first

16

He was trying to motivate, he said, the Google employees

17

in charge of user interface that, yeah, let's make really sure

18

that, like, it's easy for people to click on the things they

19

think are important.

20

that information because it was useful for ranking.

21

it was motivating them, but it was motivating them with the

22

reason that clicks are important.

23
24
25

Q.

But that's the point.

He wanted to have
And yes,

Have you seen other evidence of Google employees

discussing the importance of scale?
A.

I have.

So if you go to the next slide, slide 46.

5792
1

Again, this is something that you've seen before when Hal

2

Varian testified.

3

the -- whether scale mattered around the time of the

4

Yahoo!-Microsoft deal in 2009, and how strongly Marissa Mayer

5

and Udi Manber felt about the importance of scale.

6

Q.

You know, the whole back and forth around

In addition to the documentary evidence, did you

7

review any testimony during this trial about scale and its

8

impact on quality?

9

A.

I did.

So if you bring up slide 47.

Your Honor,

10

you've seen all of these.

11

testimony from Mr. Parakhin, trial testimony from Dr. Lehman

12

and e-mail in the record from John -- from Mr. Giannandrea, all

13

of which are about how scale matters because seeing user clicks

14

and user behavior.

15

Q.

This is just an excerpt of trial

Professor, have you reviewed any evidence that

16

Google's algorithm makes use of a significant amount of user

17

data?

18

A.

I have.

So if you go to slide 48.

So this, Your

19

Honor, is talking about navboost.

20

navboost, which is not only one of the components of Google's

21

ranking system, but to this day still considered the most

22

powerful.

23

clicks.

24
25

I think you've heard of

And how much -- you know, how navboost is using user

What it does is it uses that information to help determine
ranking, what should be at the top of -- what organic results

5793
1

should be at the top of the SERP, of the results page.

2

the top are two -- on the left, a document that Eric Lehman

3

authored, just describing what navboost is in essence and that

4

it's still the most potent.

5

trial testimony about what navboost does.

That's from 2016.

So at

On the right,

6

And importantly, on the right, let me just say something

7

about how much data it uses, so how many months of data Google

8

is using as an input into training navboost.

9

bottom, back when Amit Singhal, who was putting in for a

10

Founder's Award nomination -- or was put in, in 2006 his team

11

came up -- I think either him personally or his team came up

12

with navboost.

13

locked out small players from the ranking game.

14

And at the

And the way he described it is:

Navboost has

And the reason he described it that way is because he's

15

using user data and a lot of user data.

16

impact of this, Your Honor, is if you go back to the comment of

17

Eric Lehman about how many months of data -- the question about

18

how many months of data navboost is using, and you asked

19

yourself how many -- how long would it take Microsoft -- how

20

much data would Microsoft at its current share have to use to

21

use -- get the same amount of data.

22

17 years of data.

23

going to be very useful when we start looking at that.

24
25

Q.

And one way to put the

It's basically like 16 or

And, obviously, the 16-year-old data is not

Is it just algorithm training where scale matters for

search services quality?

5794
1

A.

No.

If you bring up the next slide, slide 49.

So

2

really important thing, Your Honor, is that it's not -- and

3

again, I think you've heard some of this.

4

training the current algorithms.

5

current algorithms.

6

these algorithms and approve them are live-traffic experiments

7

where they'll take some actual queries and they have some idea

8

for an improvement in the algorithm, and they'll use the new

9

algorithm and see how good the outcome is.

10

It's not just

It's also developing the

And a key thing that they used to develop

And so the thing is that when you don't have a lot of

11

scale, you can't do a lot of these experiments.

And moreover,

12

the experiments that you do will tend to have smaller samples.

13

So it's either going to be less precise, if you let the

14

experiment go for the same amount of time, or it's going to

15

have to go a lot longer.

16

statistics:

17

results.

18

effect from Jon Tinter -- Mr. Tinter, from Mr. Parakhin and

19

Mr. Weinberg about what impact it has on experimentation.

20

Actually, one thing, I was here during Hal Varian's

That's just a basic property of

The bigger the sample, the more precise the

And so -- and you can see here testimony to that

21

testimony, as I've mentioned before.

22

thing that he would say that, like, it's not the ingredients,

23

it's the recipe.

24

is -- he was trying to argue it's not the data, the

25

ingredients, it's that we've learned how to use the data.

I'm paraphrasing.

You know, he had this

By that, what he meant

It's

5795
1

the recipes.

2

like, the way you figure out the recipes is by having a lot of

3

data that you can use for experimenting.

4
5
6

Q.

But the thing he was leaving out is this:

That,

Professor, have you done any empirical analysis of

scale effects on search services quality?
A.

I have.

So if you go to slide 50.

This is redacted,

7

Your Honor, so I won't say the numbers.

But let me describe

8

what is here.

9

testimony about this and I think I also mentioned it nine days

10

ago, about IS scores.

11

organic search results.

So we've talked -- and I think you've heard

It's the way Google measures quality of

12

What I'm showing here is using Google and Bing data --

13

actually, sorry, this is all coming from Google, where they

14

also -- they evaluated their own IS scores and they evaluated

15

Bing's IS score.

16

query -- and I think we've also used words like head query or a

17

tail query.

And this is split by whether it's a popular

And this is -- sorry, hang on one second.

Okay.

18

So the title -- let me just make a correction here.

19

shouldn't say "by month" at the top, because it's actually for

20

this -- it's overall, over this period from July 2020 to

21

September 2021.

22

deleted.

23

It

That's something that should have been

But what is this doing?

It's showing you on the left what

24

the IS score was for their popular queries, for Google in red

25

and Bing in blue.

And on the right it's showing you their IS

5796
1

scores for Google and Bing for tail queries.

2

see from this is two things.

3

And what you can

Number one, the most striking thing is IS scores are way

4

higher, way higher for popular queries than tail queries.

5

remember, the last time I talked, to kind of give you context,

6

I said how a 4-point IS score difference is very significant

7

and how Google hopes to get -- I think Dr. Lehman testified to

8

this -- hopes to get a one-point improvement in a year.

9

mean, these differences are much bigger than that between

10

popular and tail.

11

And,

I

The second thing that you can see is on popular, Bing is

12

close.

13

tail queries, it's more significantly below.

14

of can see this point that it's in the tail where scale matters

15

most.

16

It's a little bit below Google in IS score.

THE COURT:

But on

And so you kind

So the difference here, in your estimation,

17

between Google and Bing and the tail queries is significant

18

based upon what Dr. Lehman --

19

THE WITNESS:

20

THE COURT:

21

THE WITNESS:

22

THE COURT:

23

THE WITNESS:

Correct.

-- said was the key scale?
Yes.

Okay.
And it's bigger than what you see in popular

24

queries where Bing can be more successful because it's seeing

25

the queries.

Popular queries it tends to see; tail queries,

5797
1

no.

2

BY MR. SEVERT:

3

Q.

Did you do any other empirical analysis relating to

4

the effect of scale on search quality results, Professor

5

Whinston?

6

A.

I did.

So, Your Honor, another analysis that I did --

7

and I'm not sure whether -- I can't remember whether you've

8

heard anything about this or not.

9

historically used the length of clicks that a user puts in as a

10

measure of whether it was a good result.

11

if a user clicks a very short click -- so in other words, it

12

clicks -- the user clicks, goes to the website and immediately

13

comes back, that's bad.

14

weren't satisfied with what they saw.

But Google will use and has

In particular, that

And if -- you know, it shows that they

15

Of course, it's not perfect because maybe they got --

16

occasionally get a piece of information and they're happy and

17

they come back.

18

poor quality and long clicks as a measure of high quality, and

19

has this measure that they have tracked called click split,

20

which is the ratio of long clicks to short clicks.

21

But Google has looked to that as a measure of

And so what I did is an analysis of looking at Google and

22

looking at how click split is related to scale.

And so what

23

you find is that head queries have a better click split than

24

torso queries, which are kind of the middle category that was

25

left out in the previous -- you know, we looked at popular and

5798
1
2

tail.

There's also torso in the middle.

Click splits are better for head, significantly, than

3

torso, and torso is better than tail.

4

for things like what vertical -- you know, you might worry,

5

like, oh, there are confounding effects.

6

are in shopping categories and tail queries are for -- I don't

7

know what.

8

frequently looked at.

9

controlling for that, controlling for the complexity of the

10

query, things like that, and you still see it.

11

And that's controlling

Head queries maybe

I actually think Annie Lennox is probably

THE COURT:

But whatever the categories are,

So the idea is that -- and it's intuitive, is

12

that for the head queries, the click period is longer; in other

13

words, there's -- sorry, there's less clicking back to the

14

start page?

15

THE WITNESS:

16

BY MR. SEVERT:

17

Q.

Correct.

And then, Professor, I think you've at various times

18

today talked about mobile separately from everything else.

19

is that?

20

A.

Why

I think there's a really important issue here, is to

21

what extent -- if you are talking about scale, you know, it's

22

scale on what.

23

it scale within a device.

24

mobile matter distinctly for how good you are in mobile.

25

that's why I kind of have talked about mobile.

So is it overall scale across all devices; is
And in particular, does scale in
So

5799
1

And, of course, just to be really clear, all the growth

2

in -- you know, everything I talk about when I talk about

3

mobile, it's important to remember mobile is where the market

4

is growing.

5

a long time.

6

Q.

Like, PC queries are, like, flat and have been for

Is there any testimony you relied upon to -- in

7

considering whether mobile queries are different from desktop

8

queries?

9

A.

Yes.

So if you bring up slide 51.

This is something

10

from the deposition of Pandu Nayak.

11

search.

12

this topic was that there are some striking differences that

13

come up between mobile queries and PC queries.

14

Well, mobile queries tend to be much more local.

15

seeking, the intent is more local.

16

didn't bold it, but it's here, this great example of Bank of

17

America.

18

have a different meaning when it's on desktop or on mobile.

19

what he says is, well, if someone puts in Bank of America on

20

their desktop, they're probably interested in online banking.

21

But if someone puts in Bank of America on their mobile phone,

22

they want to know where the nearest ATM or branch is.

23

exact same literal query phrase can have a different meaning,

24

one versus the other.

25

Q.

Mr. Nayak was VP of

So he was asked -- or his answer to a question about

What are they?
They're local

And then he gives this -- I

And so -- which shows you that the same query can
So

So the

And have you seen, Professor, evidence in documents

5800
1

that scale on mobile devices distinctly impacts a search

2

engine's competitiveness for mobile queries?

3

A.

Yes.

Yes, I have.

So if you go to slide 52.

This is

4

a document from -- that was authored by Mr. Giannandrea.

5

Again, where he's -- you know, it's from 2018 during the same

6

time when there was a discussion about a possible

7

Microsoft-Apple deal.

8

And what he's saying is not having mobile queries at scale

9

is a huge liability for Bing, since the most important search

10

signal is engagement.

11

but it's a huge liability.

12

thing that, like, if you want to do well on mobile, in quality,

13

you need to see the mobile stream.

14

happening on mobile.

15
16
17

Q.

He says it's not impossible to do okay,
And so that's just capturing this

You need to see what's

Is there any empirical evidence of the difference

between search on mobile phones and search on PCs?
A.

There is.

So if you bring up slide 53.

Your Honor,

18

this is -- it's all redacted.

19

numbers.

20

we talked about when we were looking at what Bing saw versus

21

what Google saw, except here what I'm doing is I'm asking, on

22

the left for Google, of the phrases that are put in on mobile

23

phones, what share of them are only put in on mobile phones.

24

So that's the blue on the left for Google.

25

So, again, I won't say the

But it's kind of a similar kind of exercise to what

The green are the mobile -- the query phrases that are put

5801
1

in -- hopefully, I said query phrases before, not queries.

2

query phrases that are put in on mobile phones that are also

3

put in on PCs.

4

majority of mobile query phrases that are put in on mobile

5

phones are only put in on mobile phones.

6

The

And what you can see on the left is the vast

You see the same thing on the right for Bing.

The

7

percentages are a little different because, of course, Bing has

8

a different ratio of the queries it's seeing on mobile versus

9

desktop.

It doesn't see very much on mobile.

10

And at the bottom you see kind of, you know, one kind of

11

obvious kind of statistic where you could start, which is if

12

you asked, like, what share of query phrases that include the

13

words "near me," what share of them are on mobile phones, the

14

answer, 86 percent.

15

apologize.

16

Q.

17
18

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

In the bullet point at the bottom.

And what does this evidence tell you about rivals'

ability to compete with Google?
A.

It means, as I was saying, that if you don't have

19

scale on mobile, it's going to be really hard for you to do

20

well in quality on mobile.

21
22
23
24
25

I

Q.

Professor, have you seen evidence of significant

business decisions predicated on scale?
THE COURT:
