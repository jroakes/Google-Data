natural and probable effect ofGoogle's conduct is to diminish the incentives of vertical
websites to invest in, and to develop, new and innovative content. Jn the alternative,
Googlc's conduct may be condemned as a stand-alone violation of Section 5. Google has
presented no efficiency justifi cation for its conduct.
Third, Staff has investigated whether Google has employed ru1ticompetifve
contractual restrictions on the a· utomated cross-management of advertising camp,laigns.

.

Google's main rival (Microsoft) has alleged that Googlc is denying Microsoft c ·tical scale
by employing these restrictions, and thus impairing Microsoft's ability to compe e effectively
in the markets for general search and search advertising. We conclude that thes restrictions
should be condemned under Section 2 because they limit the ability of advertisers to make
use of their own data, and as such, have reduced innovation and increased transaction costs
among advertisers and third-party businesses, and also degraded the quality ofGoogle's
rivals in search and search advertising. Google 's proffered efficiency justification for these
restrictions appears to be pretextual.
Fourth, Staff has investigated whether Google has entered into anticomprtive,
exclusionary agreements with websites for syndicated search and search advcrtisrng services.
We conclude that Google's agreements should be condemned under Section 2 because they
foreclose some p01tion of the market, and, although the agreements result in only modest
anticompetitive effects on publishers, the impact of the agreements in denying scale to
competitors is both competitively significant to its main rival (Microsoft) today, as well as a
significant barrier to entry for potential entrants in the longer term. While Googe presents
efficiency justifications for these agreements, on balance, Staff finds them to be nonpersuasive.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION INVESTIGATION

The European Commission ("EC") has been conducting a parallel investigation of
Google since November 2010. On May 21, 2012, Commissioner Joaquin Aim

·a issued

Googlc a letter, signaling the EC's possible intent to issue a Statement ofObjec ions ("SO")
against Google for abuse of dominance in violation of Article I 02 of the EC Tr aty. The
letter set out the EC's concern in four areas: (I) Google's "favourable treatmen of its own
vettical search services as compared to those of its competitors in its nah1ral sea ch results";
(2) Google's "practice of copying third party content" to supplement its own ve ical
ofTcrings; (3) Google's "exclusivity agreements with publishers for the provisio of search
advertising intem1ediation services"; and (4) Google' s " restrictions with regard to the
portability and cross-platform management of online advertising campaigns.'.4
In his letter, Commissioner Almunia offered Googlc the opportunity to resolve the
concerns prior to the issuance of an SO by coming forward "with a written description of
possible solutions" to the EC's eoncems. 5
On June 30, 2012, Google submitted a settlement proposal to the EC. Although
Googlc denied any infringement of European Union ("EU") competition law, Google
proposed to enter into several "commitments," designed to address the EC's sta 'e d concerns.6
FTC staff has coordinated closely with EC staff throughout the course o our parallel
investigations. Staffhas received waivers from Googlc, Microsoft, Yahoo! , an a handful of
other parties to discuss and exchange infonnation with the EC. Staff has had regular
telephone calls with EC staff, where we have updated one another on theories
We have also exchanged documents of mutual interest.

Google to tott liability. The Kinderstart court also dismissed the plaintift"s complaint,
13

rejecting the claim that Google's search results were an essential facility for vertical
websites, because Kindcrstart had not been e liminated from the downstream mlket and
continued to get high rankings from other search cngincs.

14

The AdWords cases address a common fact pattern, but are decided on
grounds. Plaintiffs in these cases argued that Google increased the minimum bi s for the
keywords the website had purchased, which made those keywords effectively u available,
thus depriving the plaintiff website oftrat1ic. The complaint in TradeComet.co , LLC v.
Coogle, inc. 15 was dismissed for improper venue, while the allegations in Goog e, Inc. v.
myTriggers. com, inc.

16

were dismissed on grounds that they failed to describe harm to

competition as a whole. Both cases were dismissed with little discussion of the merits.
In Person v. Coogle, Inc., 11 Judge Fogel of the Northern District of California
criticized the plaintiffs market definition, finding no basis for distinguishing th alleged
"search advertising market" fro m the larger market for Internet advcrtising. 18 The Ninth
Circuit affirm ed the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to raise the
allegations in its complaint beyond a speculative level, but did not address mar t
dcfinition. 19

Major Vertical Complainants

Staff has met with, interviewed, and subpoenaed numerous vertical websites offering
shopping, travel, local, and financial services. We identify here some of the rna
complainants. ln general, these companies complain tbat Google's practice of referencing
its own vertical results over the complainants' websites on Google 's search pag has
negatively impacted the complainants' ability to compete for users and advertis rs.

a.

Amazon

Amazon is the world's Largest online retailer, and also produces consum r
electronics, notably the Amazon Kindle e-book reader and the Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon's
product search feature competes with Google Product Search.

b.

eBay

eBay operates an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses
buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. eBay has expan*d from its
origina l "set-time" auction format to include "Buy It Now" standard shopping, nd a variety
of other services. eBay's product search feature competes with Google Product Search.

c.

NexTag

NexTag is a shopping comparison website in the U.S. that competes wi

Google

Product Search.

d.

Foundcm

Foundem is a shopping comparison website in the United Kingdom that competes
with Googlc Product Search. We understand that Foundem was the first vertica website to
publicly accuse Google ofpreferencing its own vertical content over that of co petitors on

recently introduced social networking site, Google Plus. Facebook has complained, among
other things, that Google's prcfercncing of Google Plus results over Facebook results on
Google's search page is negatively impacting its ability to compete for users.

B.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
1.

General Search

The Internet is a vast, largely unorganized collection of constantly chan ing
information. If the Internet can be roughly analogized to a huge and highly dyn mic library,
then algorithmic search engines are the card cata log.
Unlike a traditional library, the Internet is too large and changes too rapidly for
traditional cataloging. 32 Instead, search engines (like Google) deploy computer programs
that constantly "crawl" the web, building and updating automated indexes of web content.
Similarly, the process of finding relevant information inside these web indexes is automated.
Sophisticated algorithms evaluate the content of the end user's request for information to
determine which parts of the web index may contain relevant responses. The identified
potential responses arc then ranked by additional algorithms based on the predicted
likelihood of their relevance, and displayed to the end user in response to his or her query.
Critically, all of this complex activity occurs rapidly and automatically, without any direct
human intervention.
As users search for information on the Internet, they necessarily provide the search
engine with valuable information - the precise topic users arc interested in at that moment.
Although a user does not pay for the web search service, the user's focused inte est - or
intent - is very valuable to advertisers, because users arc e ffectively identifying hcmselves
as potential customers through the content of their queries. For example, a business selling

advcrtising:l The growth of the Internet has created entirely new business models that can
6

take advantage of ways, unique to the Internet, to identify and reach potential customers with
advertising. 37 Among the reasons advertisers have shifted budget online is the

l.gh degree of

tracking possible and the quantifiable, superior return on investment. 38
Online advertising is primarily made up of display and search advertisin , although
some other types of advertising (e.g., contextual , re-targeted display, and social

edia

advertising) also have some presence. Display advertising typically consists of
containing graphics and other rich media appearing on white space on a web pa e. Search
advertising consists of text ads (displayed on the right-hand side of the search rasults page, at
the top of the page above the search results, and below the search results) matched to specific
keyword queries entered into the search engine by the user.
Search advertising makes up the bulk of online advertiser spend, primar' ly because
advertisers believe that search advertising provides unprecedented precision in i entifying
potential customers, measurabi lity, and the highest return on investment. 39 Simr ly put, "it is
the most effective marketing ever."40 Search advertising is highly valued by ad ertisers
because they learn crucial information about the user from the query alone: the] learn that
the user is interested in a particular subject, right now.41 Thus, search adve11isi g is a highly
effective method of reaching users who arc interested in learning about or purc1asing
products. Search advertising is often called "direct response•· advertising, as it ' is intended
to elicit a response from a consumer, such as the purchase of a product or signing up for a
service.'A2
With pure djsplay advertising, all the advertiser knows about the user is hat he or she
is viewing a particular web page (similar to the information an advertiser may h ve about a

the user leave to go to a dedicated search website like Google or Bing; the search provider
picks up incremental search volume, as some users will not bother to run a search if they

I

bave to leave the publisher's website to do it; and, most importantly, the resulti g search
traffic can be monetized through search advertising in the same way as a search run on
Google or Bing.
The process works very similarly to a web search conducted on Google. Google
receives queries from the third-party website, evaluates them against a subset o its web
index, and then de livers web search results to the user on the third-party publisl er's
website.

49

As with web search on Google.com, the consumer pays for none oft ese services.

Instead, pub I is hers pay Google for syndicated search either on a cost-per-user-query basis
(for example, $.95 per 1,000 queries), or by accepting search advertisements from Google
and splitting the revenues from the se-arch advertisements run on the publisher's website.
The resulting revenue sharing arrangement is often referred to as the "traffic

ac~uisition cost"

(or ''TAC").
Publishers arc generally able to select the web search and search advertisement
syndication services separately or together. Thus, publishers that do not wish to offer web
search generally (or Google's web search, specifically) can- and do- participa e in
Google's AdScnsc program to receive search advertisements without the corres onding web
search functionality.50

4.

Mobile Searcb 51

In recent years, the focus of search (and related advertising) has begun s jfting from
the traditional desktop model to the rapidly emerging- and lucrative- frontier f mobile (or
"smartphone") devices. At the forefront of this shift is Google's mobile operating system,

12

In addition, click data (the website links on which a user actually clicks) is important
for evaluating the quality of the search results page. As Google' s former chief of search
quality Udi Manber testified:
The ranking itself is affected by the click data. If we discover th t, for a
particular query, hypothetically, 80 percent or people click on R ult No. 2
and only l 0 percent click on Result No. I, after a while we fi~ur
probably Result 2 is the one people want. So we'll switch it.
Testimony from Scrgcy Brin and Eric Schmidt confirms that click data is impo

nt for many

purposes, including, most importantly, providing ''feedback" on whether Googl 's search
algorithms are offering its users high quality results. 58
Finally, search providers run experiments on large volumes of users. Search engines
conduct experiments on everything from ranking of search results to user interface and
design decisions. 59 As Larry Page and Sergey Brin stated in their 2005 annual letter to
shareholders:
Our teams are more productive once they get real users and feed ack. We
have learned that the best way to make something great is to actu lly launch it
to the public. T hat's why we have the Google Labs and 'beta' la els- these
arc our experiments. 60
Multiple experiments are conducted simullaneously. 61 The more search users l~ere are at any
given time, the more experiments can be run, the faster they can be completed, td the more
improvements that can be made to the search algorithms. 62 According to Micro oft chief
economist (and Harvard professor) Susan Athey, Microsoft's search quality tea 1 is greatly
hampered by having insufficient search volume to conduct expcrimcnts.63
With improved search quality, particularly for ·'tail" queries, Bing assert that it will
be better positioned to compete with Google for users (and, thus, for advertisers , and so to

and - importantly - also serves to attract more advertisers, that, generally spe
the ir advertisements to reach as broad an audience as possible. 74
Jn sum, Bing asserts that a larger volume of advertisements- and the im roved
coverage, quality, conversion rates, and revenues that come from such an increa 'ed volumewi ll allow it to better compete with Google for both advertisers and website pub ishers, and
so to constrain the exercise by Google of monopoly power.

3.

The Scale C urve

Googlc acknowledges the importance of scale in the abstract. Google documents are
replete with references to the "virtuous cycle" among users, advertisers, and publishers; 75
and testimony from Google executives confirms the continuing viability of the "cycle." 76
However, Google argues that, while scale matters, it only matters up to a point, beyond
which there arc substantially "diminishing returns" to increasing volumes of both queries and
advertisements. 77 For example, Sergey Brio testified that a ''rough rule of thumb" might be,
as query volume doubles, a search engine might expect to see a one percent incr ase in
quality.7l!
Googl.e argues that Bing's query and advertiser volume have passed the oint at
which scale should - or would - matter significantly to Microsofi, and that any volume gains

I

made by Bing would yield minimal improvements in either Bing's search quality or its
monetization ability.

79

Microsoft does not dispute the notion that there are generally

diminishing returns to scale. 80 The main bone of contention between Google and Microsoft
is where on this scale curve Microsoft currently operates. This is an important question, but

I

one which evades easy answers. This is, in part, because neither party can identify a fixed
number of queries or ads that constitutes the " minimum efficient" point of

platform, it calculated that Bing would receive a 20 percent boost in revenue per search
(''R PS") on the basis ofYahoo!'s additional volume.89 Although Bing's RPS (and
consequently, RPM) has improved with the addition of Yahoo! query and ads v lume, it has
not improved as substantially as Microsoft initially forccast.90
In this investigation, the question of how and why scale matters has tak n a
prominent position in several allegations advanced by complainants: speciticall , whether the
conduct under review denies Googlc's main competitor - Microsoft- the scale t needs to
successfully constrain Googlc's monopoly over search and search advertising.

hese

allegations arc discussed in detail in the following section.

D.

GOOGLE'S SUSPECT CONDUCT

Staff has conducted a comprehensive investigation into several areas of alleged
anticompctitive conduct. Below, we lay out four of the five main areas of Staff's
investigation. 91

1.

Google's Preferencing of Googlc Vertical Properties 'fitbin Its
Search Engine Results Page ("SERP")
1

Staff has investigated whether Google is unlawfully preferencing its own vertical
properties, wh ile demoting rival vertical properties. in order to maintain, preser e, or enhance
Googlc's monopoly power in the markets for search and search advertising. Co plainants
allege that Google's conduct is anticompetitivc because it forecloses alternative search
platforms that might operate to constrain Google's dominance in search and sea ch
advertising. Although it is a close call, we do not recommend that the Commis ·an issue a
complaint against Googlc for this conduct.

search capabilities within specific commercial categories, and thus might cause users to shift
their searches in those categories away from Google's general web search platfi rm. As users
moved to vertical search websites, those websites could, in tum, become more ttractive
vehicles for advertisers, thus resulting in potentially significant revenue losses t Google. In

sh011:
Vertical search is of tremendous strategic importance to Google. Otherwise
the Jisk is that Google is the go-to place for finding information nly in the
cases where there is sufficiently low monetization potential that o niche
101
vertical search competitor has fi lled the space with a better alter ative.
A 2008 presentation, entitled "Online Advertising Challenges: Rise oft e
Aggregators," further highlights the problems faced by Google with regard to the leading
UK-based finance vertical website, MoneySupem1arkct:
Issue 1. Consumers migrating to MoneySupermarket. Driver: General
search engines not solving consumer queries as well as specialized
vertical search.... Consequence: Increasing proportion of visitors
going directly to MoneySupermarket. . . . Google Implication: Loss of
query volumes.

I

Issue 2: MoneySupermarket has better advertiser proposition. Dp ver:
MoneySupermarkct offers cheaper, lower risk (CPA-based) lead to
advertisers. Google Implication: Advertiser pull: Direct advertis
switch spend to MoneySupcrmarket/othcr channels. 102
Pa1tly in response to this new competitive threat - the "rise of aggrcgato " - Google
decided to hone in on certain "key" ve1tical search areas (shopping, local, finan e, and travel)
and invest in developing existing - or creating new- vertical properties. 103 In e rtain areas
where Google already bad existing vertical properties, such as shopping and local, 104 Googlc
saw a critical need to invest further and take measures to increase user traffic to
properties. 105 In potentially lucrative areas where strong verticals already exi

and against its natural search results, because the web index and other indices all bad their
own ranking algorithms and scores. 114 Google referred to the difficulty of comparing these
ranking scores as an "apples to oranges" problem. 115 Google did, however, frei uently
compare the quality of its vertical results to that of its competitors using others oring
methods. 116
The verticals were initially placed in one of three locations: if Googled emed the
vertical content to be highly relevant, it would go into position one, above then tural search
results; ifGoogle deemed the content somewhat relevant, it would go into posit on four (or
midway down the frrst page of natural search results); and ifGoogle deemed the content only
marginally relevant, it would go into position I 0 (or at the bottom of the first page of natural
search results). 117 In 2012, Google claims that it changed its algorithms to display Universal
Search results in any position on the SERP, depending on the same initial relevancy

maximize the percentage of queries for which it displayed Universal Search results.

119

Evidence shows that Googlc sought to increase such "triggering" of Universal Search results
not only to provide users with the "right" answer to their queries, but also to dri e traffic to
Google properties.

120

Google recognized that the frequen t display of its vertica properties on

the SERP was necessary to drive traffic to its properties, and thus, grow user sh rc in highly
commercial areas such as shopping and local. 121 Google continued to trigger U iversal
Search results frequently- and prominently - even when it detem1ined that sho 'ing such
results in the top position would "cannibalize" revenue from the top ads, as the ompany was
willing to lose short-term revenue with the long-term goal of retaining and growing vertical
search query share. 122

Second, Google embellished its Universal Search results with photos and other eyecatching interfaces, recognizing that these design choices would help steer users to Googlc's
vertical properties. 123 Third party studies show the substantial difference in traffic with
prominent, !:,TTaphical user interfaces. 124 These "rich" user interfaces are not available to
competing vertical webs ites. 125 Moreover, Google 's Universal Search results often were not
labeled as being provided by Google affiliated services, but were integrated dire tly into the
search results.

Third, Googlc displayed its Universal Search results at or ncar the top o
This desirable positioning ofGoogle's Universal Search results pushes all other eb search
results down, which significantly decreases click-through to the websitcs displa ed in
Google 's natural search results. 127 Google displays its Universal Search results n these
prominent positions without comparing the quality ofGoogle's vertical content o that of its
vertical competitors, 128 or evaluating whether users would prefer to see Google's content or

24

SJ

Although Google tracks user click-through rates (and relies on such click-through
data to improve its web search results in a number of ways, see supra p. 14), Google has not
relied on click-through data to rank its Universal Search results against other web search
results.

134

According to Marissa Mayer, Google did not use click-through rates to determine

the position of the Universal Search properties because it would take too long to move up on
tbc SERP on the basis of user click-through ratc. 135
Rather than comparing its content with that of competitors, Google used lhe
occurrence of competing vertical websites in its natural search results to automa~ically boost
the ranking of its own vertical properties above that of competitors. 136 For exam~lc, where
Google's algorithms deemed a comparison shopping website relevant to a user's query,
Google automatically returned Google Product Search - above any rival comparison
shopping websites. 137 Similarly, when Google's algorithms deemed local websites, such as
Yelp or CityScarcb, relevant to a user's query, Google automatically returned Google Local
at the top ofthe SERP. 138
Google also dedicates space at the top of its SERP to its social network

rtical,

Google Plus. Google provides links to Googlc Plus pages that might be rclevan to a query
on the right-hand side of the SERP, and "auto suggests" Google Plus pages for user queries,
regardless of which social media sites are the most relevant, comprehensive, or ave the
freshest results in response to any given user query. 139 Google also displays prolincnt links
to Google Plus pages when users make navigational queries to many companies' wcbsitcs:
For example, in response to the navigational query "Dell" a user is presented with the SERP
shown on the next page.

(offers),t or "Sponsored" (the new paid Google Shopping ads), and other tijes provided

146

no label (flight search). 147 In May 20 12, Google announced that its shopping pr pcrty,
Google Product Search- which will now be known as Google Shopping - will be
transitioned to a paid listing model in the fall of2012. 148 Under the paid model, Lcrchants
will pay Google directly to appear in Google Shopping, and Google will no long r include
product listings for merchants who do not pay for placement. 149
Google's dedicated ads do not compete with other ads through Google's

dWords

auction for placement on Google's SERP. Instead, they enjoy automatic placemjnt in the
most effective advertising places on the SERP, usually above the natural search ~esults. 150
Google also does not compare the quality of itc.; own ads to the quality of competitors' ads
that provide the same vertical service. For example, although it displays its flight search
above any nat un-~1 search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide tbe most
flight options for travclcrs. 151 As with Google's Universal Search results, Google's rich user
interfaces for its ads-based vertical offerings, which are unavailable to competitors, lead to

. Google's Demotion of Competing Vertical Web ites

While Google embarked on a multi-year strategy of developing and shoWI asing its
own vertical properties, Google simultaneously adopted a strdtcgy of demoting, or refusing to
display, links to cettain vertical websites in highly commercial categories. AccoLing to
Googlc, the company has targeted for demotion vertical websites that have "little or no
original content," or that contain "duplicative'' content. 153
Similarly, Google has identified comparison shopping websites as undesirable to
users, and has developed several algorithms to demote these websites on its

28

algorithms that demote sites that "scrape a large percentage of their content from other
sites." 163 These algorithms are not applied to Google vertical sites.
Google's vertical properties would rank poorly if they were crawled and rdexed by
Google because they have never been "engineered" for ranking by the search cntine. 164

I

Unlike Google's vertical competitors, who expend considerable resources on op imizing their
websites in order to rank highly on Googlc' s SERP, Google docs not expend the time and
resources to optimize its own vertical properties; it simply places them on the SERP.

f.

Effects of Google's SERP Changes on Vertical tvals

Vertical websites, such as comparison shopping and local websitcs, are h avily
dependent on Google's web search results to reach users. 165 Thus, Google is in the unique
position of bei ng able to " make or break any web-based busincss." 166
Google's prominent placement and display o[ its Universal Search properties,
combined with the demotion of certain vertical competitors in Google's natural search
results, has resulted in s ignificant loss of traffic to many competing vertical webjites. Data
from various comparison shopping and other competing websitcs shows drops in traffic that
correlate to changes implemented by Googlc to its SERP. 167 Google's internal d ta eonfinns
the impact, showing that Google anticipated significant traffic loss to certain cate ories of
ve11ieal wcbsites when it implemented many of the algorithmic changes described above. 168
While Coogle's changes to its SERP led to a significant decrease in traffi for the
websites of many vertical competitors, Googlc's prominent showcasing of its vertica l
propctties led to gains in user share for its own properties. 169 For example, Google's
inclusion ofGoogle Product Search as a Universal Search result took Google Product Search
from a rank of seventh in page views in July 2007 to the number one rank by Jul 2008. 170

Google considered several options for obtaining information for display n its own
vertical prope1ties: developing its own content; obtaining licenses from other co tent
creators; and obtaining content by crawling the world wide web (in the same wal>' that
Googlc crawls the world wide web for its general web index). Ultimately, Goo lc settled on
a combination of all three of these alternatives.
Much ofGoogle's vertical content is currently obtained through feeds fr m various
wcbsitcs, pursuant to free licenses from those sites for Google to use that data.

oogle's

standard license agreement allows Google to usc third parties' data feeds for any purpose. 178
Many website publishers, such as Shopzilla, have agreed to these terms because they believe
they do not have the levemge to negotiate with Googlc regarding tbc terms of their licenses,
because they want the benefits of appearing in Google's vertica1. 179
l~on to the feeds it receives, Google 's use of crawled content is .Ervasive.

Indeed, the content of any website that Google crawls for indexing purposes (for Google's
web search) may be used by Google for any of its vertical search properties in a umber of
different ways. For example, Google has often included "snippets" (or excerpts) of user
l also uses
reviews from local or shopping properties on its own vertical properties. Googlt
the rankings of various businesses or products to aid its own determination rega ing the
order in which those businesses or products should be ranked within its own ver ·cal
properties. For example, Google calculates the popularity of a product for the purpose of
ranking it in Google Product Search based on three factors: (I) Amazon Sales Rank; (2) the
number of merchants offering the product for sale; and (3) the quality of those merchants. 180

For Googlc Local, Google needed photos, addresses, hours, and reviews. Google
originally obtained this content through licenses with the.<>e websites. In late 2006, Google
decided that it wanted more control over its local content. 186 Google recognized that review
content, in particular, was "critical to w inning in local search," but that Google had an
"unhealthy dependency" on Yelp for much of its review content. 187 Google feared that its

heavy reliance on Yelp content, along with Yelp's success in certain categories 1nd
geographies, could lead Yelp and other local information websites to siphon use s' local
queries away from Google.

Instead, Google decided to launch a redesigned version of Google

Googlc understood that the existence of a critical mass of user reviews (like those
users bad already submitted to websites like Yclp and Trip Advisor) was import nt in
attracting additional user reviews.

191

Google also knew that its partners- such a, Yelp and

Trip Advisor - wou ld be unhappy about Googlc 's osc of their content to collect f oogle 's

192

asked Googlc to remove all Yelp content that Google fea tured on Google Loca1. ]93

after offering its own review site for more than two years, Google recognized that it had
failed to develop a community of users- and thus, the critical mass of user reviJ s- that it
needed to sustain its local produet.

Critically, for Google, this meant that it could now force local websites- that needed

access to Google's web search to reach users - to accede to Google's use ofthe large
storehouse of reviews that Google's rivals had built in order to develop its own user base.204
Indeed, G9 o

most stmu taneous y aunched a new rcvicws-collectiof product-

Hotpot - to (again) try to solicit original user reviews, this time seeding it w ith ~eviews from
thi rd-party websites with no attribution. 205 Yelp, TripAdvisor, and CitySearch a 1 complained
to Google?

06

All of these parties sought removal of their user review content from Google

Placcs/Hotpot, as well as the removal oftheir reviews from Coogle's aggregated review
count on the main SERP? 07 This time, however, Googlc told each company that ifYelp,
TripAdvisor, and CityScarch wanted to have their content removed from Google
PlacesfHotpot, they would have to exclude their websitcs from being crawled by Google
altogether, which meant complete exclusion from Google's SERP. 208 This was rot
ccssary - tt was JUSt a po tcy decision by Google. 209
Like many other vertical websitcs, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Citysearch reJjed heavily

I

on Google 's web search results to reach users, and thus could not risk removal lom Google's
web search index?

10

Instead, they each attempted to negotiate with Google, seling removal

from Coogle Local (without simultaneous removal from Google's web search r suits), or at
least a user interface that provided sufficient attribution o f their content.211
Facing what seemed to be an ali-or-nothing choice, Yelp also began widely .
publicizing Google's refusal to remove Yelp content fro m Google Local (including filing a
complaint with the Commission), and ultimately, in July 2011, sent Googte a Cease and
Desist letter.

In its letter, Yelp clearly indicated that it expected to remain in Google web

Google had already collected sufficient reviews by bootstrapping its review collection on the
display of other websites' reviews. It no longer needed to display third-party reviews,
particularly while under investigation for this precise conduct.

b.

The "Shopping" Story

Much ofGoogle Product Search content is obtained through feeds from arious
websitcs with corresponding license agreements, from crawls, and to a lesser ex ent, by
generating its own contcnt.220 As Google sought to develop a stronger shopping offering
beginn ing around 2006, Google recognized the need to improve its data in sever l areas.
Googlc decided to supplement its feeds with additional merchant review , product
reviews, and product listings it could get from crawls, particularly from Amazon. 221 Amazon
had a license agreement with Google starting in June 2009. Pursuant to this agreement,
Amazon provided Googlc with only a limited data feed of information about its products, and
sought to limit how Google used the data, because Amazon has always feared that Google
would usc Amazon's comprehensive product catalogue and original review content to
develop a strong competitor in shopping. 222
Shortly thereafter, claiming that Amazon's data feed to Google Product hoppi ng was
too limited, Google decided not to rely on the feed, but instead, crawled Amazo 's website to
scrape the much more detailed product information - including star ratings and
reviews. 223 Googlc also relied on Amazon's web pages that indicate the ranking of products
within Amazon. Google used- and continues to usc - this information to determine the
order in which to rank products within Google Product Search.
In August2010, around the same time that Yelp requested that Google r

ove Yelp's

content from Google Local, Amazon requested that Googlc stop using Amazon' crawled

38

SJ

comprchensive? Google also attempted to pay a company to generate a new hierarchy, but
31

this was taking a long time, and also was not sufficiently comprehensive.232
Ultimately, Google decided to cra\vl Amazon's product web pages, read mbedded
information on Amazon's pages indicating Amazon's classification system, and to use that
infom1ation to create Google's classification.233 This was critical to Googlc bec~use Froogle
had failed partly due to Google 's inability to accurately classify the millions of roducts from
feeds and crawls, and to return correct search results. 234 Amazon considers its c assification
system an important competitive advantage that it spends tremendous resources o develop,
and docs not approve ofGoogle's use of Amazon 's system to develop its O\V'll .rs
.>r
With Google's migration to a paid shopping modcl,236 Google has stated that it will
only use reviews from companies that provide licensed feeds of their content. lt appears,
however, that Google may continue to crawl, and rely upon, rivals ' product classifications to
generate its own, and on rivals' ran kings to determine raukings of products with'n Google
Shopping.

c.

Effects of Google's "Scraping" on Vertical Riv~ls

Because Google scraped content from these vertical websites over an

ex~ended period

of time, it is difficult to point to declines in traffic that arc specifically attributable to
Google's conduct. However, the natural and probable effect of Googlc 's condur is to
diminish the incentives of companies like Yelp, TripAdvisor, CitySearch, and A~azon to
invest in, and to develop, new and innovative content, as the companies cannot fully capture
the benefits of their innovations. 237

Initial ly, Google offered advertisers two ways to access the AdWords system and
manage their campaigns: the AdWords Front End and the AdWords Editor. The Front End is
a web page that advertisers could log into and manage their campaigns. The Editor is a
program advertisers can download. It allows advertisers to download campaign inforn1ation
from Googlc, make bulk changes offline, and then upload the changes back into AdWords.

Thesetwo access points eventuall y proved to be insufficient because large

adve~isers and

agenc1es were taxmg the ex1stmg system. They would access the system and mlke so many
changes to their campaigns that the system's capacity would be exceeded,

causi~g it to be

unavailable temporarily or even to crash. 240
In response, in 2004, Google introduced a third method for accessing the AdWords
system: the AdWords APJ. The A PI (application programm ing interface) allows advertisers
and agencies direct programmatic access to the AdWords platform. The API contains a set
of specifications that allows advertisers and agencies to develop their own software programs
to interact with the API and allow them to set up and optimize their ad campaigns. APls arc
now an essential feature of campaign management for advertisers and agencies ran aging

multiple accounts." ' All three major search advertising platforms (Google, Mi~osofi, and
242

Yahoo!)

have APis that allow th1s dnect, automated mteract1on w1th ad platform featw-es.

Google anticipated that the API would have several benefits, inctudjng:

fl) reduced

Google operating expenses (Google personnel having to provide manual proces~ing and
troubleshooting for large bulk sheets); (2) increased advertiser spend due to reduced
advertiser operating costs; and (3) rapid development of advertiser and third party tools
supporting AdWords campaigns 243

Amazon and eBay, can develop- and have developed - their own
simultaneously manage campaigns across platforms? 48 The advertisers affected are those
whose campaign volumes are large enough to benefit from using th e AdWords API, but too
small to justify devoting the necessary resources to develop in-house the software and
expertise to manage multiple search network ad campaigns.
c.

Effects of the Restrictive C onditions

i.

Effects on Advertisers and Search Engi e Marketers

("SEMs")249
As noted above, the immediate effect of the restrictive conditions has been to prevent
the development and marketing of tools that would allow ad vertisers to manage ad
campaigns on multiple search advertising networks simultan eously. Google routinely audits
its API clients to determine compliance with the restrictive cond itions. On several occasions,
Google bas required SEMs to remove functionality t hat would facilitate simultaneous
management of search advertising campaigns.250 Other SEMs have stated that, but for the
restrictive conditions, they too would develop and offer such functionality. 251

ey would

also be freer to innovate the tools they offer based on their clients' demands. 252 Google
anticipated that the restrictive conditions wou ld e liminate SEM incentives to iru ovate.253
Many advertisers have said they would be interested in buying a tool th

Such functionality would be attractive to advertisers because it

would reduce the costs of managing multiple ad campaigns, giving advertisers access to
add itional advertising opportunities on multiple search advertising networks wi~h minimal
additional investment of time. The advertisers who would bene fit from such a tool appear to
be the medium-sized advertisers, whose advertising budgets are too small to jus ity hiring a

Effects on Competitors

lt seems likely that the removal ofGoogle's API restrictions would increase the
amount of advertising spend directed towards search networks that compete with Google.
The rationale is that many advertisers would be w illing to advertise on Bing or Yahoo! if
they could do so w ithout incurring significant transaction costs. As noted above, optimizing
a search advertising campaign is time-intensive. lt may not be worthwhile investjng such
efforts for additional, smaller search networks. Microsoft contends that if management tools
that allowed advertisers to optimize their campaigns on multiple search networks
simultaneously were available, many more advertisers would choose to advertise on the
networks that comp ete with Google.
Data on advertiser " multi-homing" may show some of the effects of the restrictive
conditions. ''Multi~homing" refers to advertisers that advertise on multiple search networks.
The data indicate that nearly all of the largest advertisers multi- home, but the percentage of
multi-homing declines as the advertisers ' spend decreases. According to a 201 1 study by
I

Microsoft, which divided the advertiser base into deciles based on total number of clicks
(such that the largest nine advertisers comprise a decile - or 10 pen;ent of total cl cks - unto
themselves), the distribution of multi-homing was as follows: 262

basis, the same advertisers optimize their Microsoft campaigns far less frequently, on a
weekly or bi-weekly basis. 266
Staff conducted a series of interviews o f randomly selected small adverti l ers to gather
their anecdotal perspective on these issues. These interviews strongly tend to su port the
thesis that many small advertisers would extend their advertising to other search networks if
they had access to a cross-platfom1 optimization too l. Nearly all small advertise s
interviewed showed interest in such a too1. 267 They believed such a cross-platfo~m
optimization tool would be central to addressing their core constraints: time, sophistication,
and money.

268

When these transaction costs are coupled with Bing's limited volume, some

small advertisers refrain from using Bing altogether? 69 Furthermore, even those that do use
Bing may not be fully optimizing their Bing campaigns because the benefits of Bing's
limited user volume may not out\veigh the transaction costs associated with full
optimization. 270

Internal Coogle Discussions Regarding tbe Restrictions

I ntemal Google documents support the notion that the removal of the res rictions

would increase advertiser spend on competing networks. In 2007, when eonside ing whether
to offer a cross-network management tool, an API product manager wrote (and director of
product management Richard Holden endorsed):

If we otTer cross-network SEM in [Europe), we will give a significant boost to our
competitors. Most advertisers that I have talked to in [Europe] don't bother running
campaigns on [Microsoft] or Yahoo because the additional overhead needed to
manage these other networks outweighs the small amount of additional traffic. For
this reason, [Microsoft} and Yahoo still have a.fi·action of the advertisers that we
have in [Europe}, and they still have lower average CPAs [cost per acquisition}.271
This last point is significant. The success of Googlc's Ad Words auctions has ""rv•-·" to raise
the costs of advertising on Google. With more advertisers entering the AdW

and the plans to improve DART Seareh.

274

However, a series of documents- documents

authored by Holden -explicitly link the two ideas.
In December 2008, Holden, senior vice-president of ad products Susan W ~ cicki, and
others met to discuss the issue. Of the meeting, Holden wrote:

ij

[O]ne debate we arc having is whether we should eliminate our A
requirement that AW [AdWords] featu res not be co-mingled with ompetitor
network featu res in SEM cross-network tools like DART Search. We are
advocating that we eliminate this requirement and that we build a uch more
:;treamlined and efficient DART Search otTcring and let SEM tool rovidcr
competitors do the same. There was some debate about this, but 1 e
concluded that it is better.for customers and the indust1y as a who e to make
things more efficient and we will maximize our opportunity by mo ing
quickly and providing the most robust offering. 27

In February 2009, Holden wrote the executive summary for a DART Search product
review, in which he advocated that Googlc ·'alter the AdWords Ts&Cs to be less restrictive
and produce the leading cross-network toolset that increases advertiser/agency efficiency."
Such a move, he wrote, would "[r]educe friction in the search ads sales and management
process and grow the industry fastcr." 276 In April 2009, in light of evident disapproval from
Larry Page about the idea of removing the co-mingling restriction, Holden wrote: "We've
heard that and we will focus on building the product to be industry-leading and wm evaluate
il with him when it is done and then discuss co-mingling and enabling all to do it. '277
In September 2009, the API product manager again raised the possibility f
eliminating the restrictive conditions as a way to help DART Search, this time wi h the added
argument that DART Search was not able to compete effect ively against other SEM crossnetwork tools that might be violating those restrictive conditions.278 Before the i . ue was

rnised up the Ladder to Susan Wojcicki, the API product manager asked Richard 1 oldcn's

advertising syndication (or "search intermediation"). We recommend that the Commission
issue a complaint against Google for this conduct.
a.

Publishers and Market Structure

The buyers of search and search advertising syndication ser vices are web ite
publishers. In effect, any website that has content that it would like to monetize ia ads is a
potential buyer of syndication services. Whi lc there arc thousands of these webs· es, a
handful of the largest websites on the Internet account for the vast majority of sy dicated
search traffic and revenue. 285 Google served approximately 118 billion AdSense (search
syndication) queries in 201 1, but just 10 websites generated almost 80 percent of that
tra flic. 286
The biggest customers for search and search advertising syndication services are ecommercc retailers (e.g., Amazon and eBay), traditional retailers with large associated
websites (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy), and Internet Service Providers ("TSPs"),2 7 which
operate their own web portals.288
Below this small group of very large publishers, there arc another roughly 25
companies with significant query volume. These mid-tier companies include ver ical ecommerce sites such as Kayak (travel), along with smaller retailers and smaller I Ps such as
EarthLink. None of these mid-tier companies generate even one percent ofGoogle's total
AdScnse query volume. Below these companies, publisher size drops off rapidly to well
under 0.1 percent of Google's query volume. 289
The search provider pays the publisher (website) a percentage of the revenue
generated from user ad clicks on the publisher's website. ln the industry, these agreements
arc known as " revenue sharing" arrangements. The higher this percentage, the m re the

domain related) advenising services. There are two main categories of AdSense agreements:
AFS (search), which provides search advertising to publishers, and AFC (content), which
provides contextual advertising to publishers. Staffs investigation has focused on Google's
AFS agreements.
Within the AFS category, there are two types of agreements: (i) Google erv1ce
Agreements ("GSAs"), which are individually negotiated agreements with large partners; and
(ii) standard online contracts, which are non-negotiable and non-exclusive agreements that
any publisher can sign?96 Standard online agreements make up the bulk of Google's AFS
partners, but only a small portion ofAFS rcvcnucs. 297 The bulk of the revenues lc ome from
the GSAs with Google's 10 largest partners, which collectively comprise almost 80 percent
ofGoogle's overall AFS query volume in 201 1.198 All ofGoogle's GSAs contain some form
of exclusivity or "preferred placement" for Google, and the GSAs typically last from one to
three years. 299
Google's exclusive AFS agreements effectively prohibit the use of non-CSoogle search
and search advertising within the sites and pages designated in the agreement.300 Some
exclusive agreements cover all properties held by a publisher globally; other agr ements
provide for a property-by-property (or market-by-market) assignment. 30 1
By 2008, with its market presence clearly established, Googlc began to t11ligrate away
from outright exclusivity in all of its agreements toward what Googlc terms "preferred
placement" in many of its agreements.302 In essence, the "preferred placement" provision
requires the publisher to display three Google ads or the same number of ads the publisher
acquires from any competitor (whichever is greater)~ that Google's ads be displayed in an

The customers generally confirmed Microsoft's claim that Bing's search syndication
o~fer ing is inferior, at least in part, because Microsoft's network of advertisers is smaller than

Google's. With a significantly larger advertiser base, Googlc is more likely to have a
relevant, high-quality advertisement for any given query, which greatly improves its
monetization rate relative to Microsoft. 307
A smaller publisher reported that, essentially, the only websites exclusiv ly using
Bing's search syndication service today aTe those that have been kicked out ofGoogle's
syndication network for violating its tenns of service. 308 While we know from other
interviews that this comment is an exaggeration, it does capture the general tcno Iof the
comments we received about the relative quality of Microsoft's search and search advertising
syndication product.

/

Many publishers reported that M icrosoft was not aggressively trying to win their
syndication business. One mid-tier publ isher stated that Microsoft did not even return its
inquiry calls during the publisher's last contract renewa l discussions with Google.309 A
Microsoft executive acknowledged that Bing needs a larger portfolio of advertisers in order
to present a competitive offering to publishers, and so the company has not been ocused on
wi nn ing new search syndication business .310
Another common theme we heard from many (but not all) of the publishJs is that
serving advertising is a relatively minor part of their business and not a significant strategic
focus for them. For example, Wal-Mart operates its website principally as an extension to its
retail operations (letting Wal-Mart customers buy products either in-store or from the website

at their preference).

311

Best Buy's principal goal for its website is to be the provider of

presale information, as 60 percent of its customers do online research before coming to the

reductions in their AdSense revenue share percentage as large enough to justify shifting their
business to Bing or to begin serving more display advertisements instead of search ads. 321

Publishers ' Views of Exclusivity Provisions

ii.

When asked whether their AdSense contract with Google was exclusive, the

publishers gave widely varied answers. A number of the large publishers reporter that their
AdSensc contract with Google was exclusive,322 but some reported that their Adrnse
contracts were not exclusive.

323

Most of the publ ishcrs that reported exclusivity ~rovisions

did not complain to us about them.
Staff s interviews did identify a fairly small, but significant, group of publishers that
were deeply concerned by the exclusivity provisions in their Google AdSense agreements.
All of these customers view search and search advertis ing syndication income as a
substantial part of their business, and all have the technical sophistication to integrate
multiple suppliers into their on-line properties. W e summarize these concerns below.

eBay. eBay is Google's largest search and search advertising syndication partner,
accounting for just over 27 percent of the syndicated U.S. queries answered by G ogle in
20 I l.

324

Section 14 of eBay' s AdSense agreement states that the agreement is n t

exclusive.

325

However, the contract requires preferential treatment for Googlc A •Sense ads,

which eBay has characterized as equivalent to exclusivity. 326 The preferential treatment
terms include requirements that eBay show as many Googlc AdSense ads on each page as
third-party advertisements, that no third party advcttiscmcnts appear above the Google
AdSense advertisements, that Google AdSense advertisements cannot be interspersed with
third party advertisements, and that Googlc AdScnsc advertisements cannot be less
prominently displayed than third parry advertisements.327

because it would have such poor placement on the NexTag site due to the Google contract
restrictions.336

Business.com. Business.com is a " B2B" lead generation/vertical site. In effect, the
site marries commercial customers looking for products (such as business phone systems)
with providers ofthose products.337 Busincss.com is several orders ofmagnitud smaller
than the other complainants, barely making it onto a list of the lop 60 providers or AdSense
query volume. Busines~.com reports that it has an exclusive AdSense agreement with
Googlc.

338

This agreement materially limits how Business.com can design its web pages. If

Business.com were relieved from its exclusive arrangement, it would test Bi11g and Yahoo!
by product category, and place their advertisements in a more prominent position in those
categories where their perfonnancc warrantcd. 339 The company would also likely take
advertisements from both Google and BingNahoo! , and show them on the same page, with
placement dictated by relative performance in each category ? 40 Loosening up Googlc's
exclusivity restrictions would allow Business.com to improve its revenue, and also allow it to
introduce some new features that would make the site more accessible and user-Tendly.

341

Amazon. Amazon is the world's largest c-commcrcc sitc342 and the seco1d largest
AFS customer after eBay. On a worldwide basis, Amazon earns roughly $ 175 m Ilion from
search syndication services, with $169 million of that total coming from Google's AdSense
search product.

343

Amazon does not have an exclusive agreement with Googlc, and actually

splits its inventory among Google, Bing, and Yahoo! .3-14 However, Amazon finds that the
Bing and Yahoo! 's advertisements monetize at about 46 percent the rate of Googie's
advcrtiscments.345 Because of the very large monetization gap, Amazon can only afford to
use B ing and Yahoo! for a very small percentage of its total search syndication n~eds.

during the negotiation period wanted an exclusive arrangement.

358

Ultimately, Google's

offeri ng was the most lucrative, and lAC re-signed with Googlc. 359
However, lAC expressed concern about Google's requirement of exclusivity for
subsidiary properties, such as local website CityGrid, that wanted to explore "mi -andmatch" options with other search advertising providers. Indeed, in 2008, lAC de lined to opt
CityGrid into its larger exclusive agreement, attempting to forge an alternative ro 1te with
other search advertising providers (including CityGrid's own ad network). Ultir ately,
however, CityGrid determined that it could not completely replace Google's syn~ication
network, even with a patchwork of other providers. Since then, CityGrid has been forced to
"opt in" to lAC's larger exclusive agreement. Although CityGrid wants the option of using
other networks (including its own), and supplementing those ads with Googlc ads, it cannot
do so under lAC's existing agreement with Google. More generally, lAC expressed concern
about the lack of competition in search and search advertising syndication because there are
no good substitutes for search advertising. 360
While lAC initially seemed supportive of the story we heard from the oth r
concerned publishers, during a recent follow-up call, lAC's tone changed substa tially. One
of the key complainants on the initial call was the president of lAC subsidiary Ci Grid.
That executive has since left lAC, and our more recent call was with another exequtive, who
was in charge of business development for lAC. This executive was far less sanguine as to
lAC 's likelihood of splitting their business in the absence of exclusivity. He noted that,
while he was also concerned about the lack of competition in the market, he could not see
moving incremental traffic to Bing or other search advertising providers unless the
monetization gap narrowed significantly. The departure of the key executive with the closest

An attempted monopolization claim requires a showing that (i) "the defendant has

engaged in predatory or anticomperitive cooduct" with (ii) "a speci fic intent to t onopolize"
and (iii) a dangerous probability of achieving or maintaining monopoly power. 3 5

A.

GOOGLE HAS MONOPOLY POWER IN RELEVANT M1 RKETS

"A fi rm is a monopolist if it can profitably raise prices substantially abo e the

competitive level. .. . [M]onopoly power may be inferred from a firm's posses ion of a
dominant share of a relevant market that is protected by entry barriers." 366 Goog le has
monopoly power in one or more properly defined markets.
I.

Relevant Markets and Market Shares

A properly defined antitrust market consists of ''any grouping of sales whose sellers,
if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger, could profitably raise prices significantly above
the competitive level." 367 Typically, a court examines "such practical indicia as industry or
public recognition o f the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product 's peculiar
characteristics and uses, un ique production fa cilities, d istinct customers, distinct prices,
sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors."368
Staff has identitied three relevant antitmst markets.

a.

Horizontal Search

Horizontal, algori thmic web search (hereafter "horizontal search") likely! constitutes a
properly defined relevant market. As discussed earl ier, horizontal search engines, such as
Google, attempt to cover the content of the Internet as widely as possible, and are specifically
designed to return a comprehensive list of search results on any topic. By contrast, "vertical''
search engines focus on more narrowly-defined categories of content, such as product

words, to the extent vertical wcbsites compete with horizontal search providers 'vithin their
limited areas of competence, nothing prohibits price discrimination between thdse narrow
areas and the broader web.
Even in the narrow areas where vertical websites have subject matter co petence,
they face challenges in competing effectively with horizontal search providers. This is
because comprehensive coverage of all topic areas appears to be a very importa t driver of
demand, even to websites focusing on specific topic areas. The abi lity to offer
comprehensive search results was characterized as "fundamental" b_y Google's former CEO,
Eric Schmidt. 372 Schmidt explained that the company needs to build brand equity with its
customers by providing consistently good results regardless of the content of the query, and
that strong results across-the-board lead to specifi c queries in commercial search:
So if you, for example, are an academic researcher and you use Google 30
times for your academics, then perhaps you ' ll want to buy a camera ... So long
as the product is very, very, very, very good, people will keep coming
back ... The general product then creates the brand, creates demand and so
forth. Then occasionally, these ads get clicked on.313
In effect, users are habituated into using Google for all their queries because of its
comprehensive scope, and so they may be more likely to tum to Google when they have
commercial queries, instead of starting at a vertical website. Schmidt's testimo?y is
corroborated by the representations of several of the vertical search firms, who note tJ1at they
arc dependent on horizontal search providers for significant amounts of their traffic, because
even many vetiical search users tend to begin their search with a query on Google, Bing or
Yahoo!. 314
When asked to identify his competitors in web search, Schmidt did not mention any
vertical property: "[A]s far as I can tell, the industry has two main horizontal

properly define the scope of the geographic market for web search. Our investigation has
uncovered no basis on which to deviate from this conclusion. 319
Google is clearly the dominant provider of "general search" services in tt c United
States. Google's own sites have a 66.7 percent share of the market as of May 20 2,
according to ComScore, a leading industry measurement finn. 31l0 Google also povides
search services to two small, formerly independent web search operators (Ask.com

381

and

AOL382), which collectively account for another 4.6 percent of the relevant marbt according
to ComScore.m ln sum, the total Google-powered query share in the United Sta es is 71.3
percent, according to ComScore. 384
The balance of this market is controlled by the Microsoft/Yahoo! search alliance.
Yahoo! holds approximately 15 percent of the market, and Bing (owned by M icrosoft), holds
approximately 14 percent.385 As noted earlier, since 2009. Microsoft and Yahoo! have been
partners in what essentially amounts to a long-tem1 joint venture for search, where Microsoft
powers the algorithmic search results for both Yahoo! and Bing, while Yahoo! handles the
direct relationships with large advertisers for the combined scrvicc. 386 Advertisers that want
to purchase search advertising on Yahoo! or Bing cannot buy access to these pro erties
separately, but rather must purchase advertisements that run on both sites simultreously. 387
So, in effect, there are just two providers of horizontal search: Google and the BTg!Yahoo!
search alliance.

are typically more interested in developing user interest- or "branding"- than in eliciting a
direct response from the consumer, whereas the primary attraction of search advertising is its
propensity to generate direct responses. 394 As Hal Varian, Google's chief ccono rust put it,
"[o]nc way to think about the difference between search and display/brand adve ising is to
say that 'search ads help satisfy demand' while 'brand advertising helps to crcat
demand." 395
The different manners in which disp lay and search advertising arc priced ·s consistent
with their disti nct overarching goals. Search advertisements - whose main goal is to directly
drive user purchases- are priced on a "cost-per-cl ick" basis (i.e., an advertiser ooly pays if a
user clicks on the ad). Conversely, display advertisements - whose main goal is to spark
interest and drive awareness- are priced based on the number of times the ad is displayed.
Display and search advertising arc also separately managed, measured, and tracked
internally at Google. 396 Similarly, for advertisers and agencies, display and search are
different eategories.397 The ad types require different creative, targets, budgets, ~d
tracking.

398

Most advertisers spend in both categories, as they consider display a d search

advcttising to be complements.399
Evidence suggests tbat search and display arc indeed complements rather than
substitutes. Google has observed steep click declines when advertisers have atte~pted to
shift budget to display advertising. For example, when automobile manufacturer Chevrolet
decided to suspend its search advertising campaign for two weeks, and rely on display
advertising alone, it lost 30 percent of total clicks on irs wcbsitc.

400

In recent years there has been some perceived convergence between the
display and search advertising.

414

However, a minority of advertising agencies and advertisers sa·d they

would move advertising dollars away from search advertising in response to a SSNIP.

415

Google's internal documents and testimony confirm that there is currcntl~ no viable
substitute for search advertising. Both Ad Words vice-president of product manakement Nick

Fox and chief economist Hal Varian have previously stated that search advertis+ spend
docs not come at the expense of other advertising dollars.'" And former GoogleiCEO Eric
Schmidt has twice testified unequivocally- in both this investigation and in a prior
Depa1tment of Justice investigation- that search advertising is ·'the most effective tool for
reaching the customers that arc actually prepared to buy,"41 7 and "has the best ROI of any
advertising as best we can determine.',... 18
Both the Commission and the Department of Justice have previously found online
" search advertising" to be a distinct product market. Specifically, in 2007, the Commission
noted that ''advertisers purchase different types of ad inventory for different purposes," and
concluded that "the sale of search advertising docs not operate as a significant constraint on
prices or quality of other online advertising."419 The Department o f Justice found that search
advertising was a relevant antitrust market in 2008, and again endorsed search a~vertising as
a relevant market in 2010. 420
While no cowt has yet determined that search advertising constitutes a relevant
market, courts have repeatedly recognized naJTOW advertising markets. For example, in

Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States,421 the Supreme Court identified newspaper
advertising as a unique antitrust market. There, the Court held that there were two "separate
though interdependent markets"- one market for selling news and ads to readers and a

72

The consumers in this market arc the publisher wcbsitcs that wish to provide search
services and return search advertisements on their websitcs, while the sellers are the
horizontal search providers, Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. 43 1
Staff has interviewed a number of publishers of various sizes, and they rovide very
consistent responses on the issue of cross-elasticity of demand. Publishers report that search
and search advertising syndication monetizes better than display advertising or other content
that they might place on their websites. 432 The publishers do not view other fo

I s of

advertising as viable substitutes for search and search advertising syndication.43 None of the
publishers told us that a modest (5 to 10 percent increase) in the price for searc and search
advcttising syndication would cause them to shift away from search and search advertising
syndication in favor of other forms of advertising or web content. 434
Further support for this relevant market comes from Google's efforts to
systematically reduce TAC, or the amount of money Googlc shares with the pu lisber from
syndicated searches. A decline in revenue share is effectively a price increase t the
publishers. A number of the publishers have seen their revenue share from Goo le decline
significantly in recent years as a result ofGooglc's efforts.m Of the publishers ptaffhas
interviewed, none have reduced or eliminated their usc of search and search adv~rtising
syndication in response to these price increases. 436 In effect, Google's successful efforts to
syslcmatically to reduce revenue share constitutes a natural experiment to deterline the

I

likely response to a SSNTP. The publishers' response to Google's price increases has been
universally consistent with the proposition that search and search advertising syndication
(search intermediation) is a relevant market.

Substantial Upfrout Investment

Along with specialized algorithms, search and search advertising platfonus require
enormous investments in the technology and infrastructure required to crawl and categorize
the entire lnternet.

443

For instance, in 20 11, Google spent more than $5 billion or research

and development, although this figure is inclusive of all ofGoogle's divisions. 444 And, in
2010, Microsoft invested more than $4.5 billion into developing its algorithms and building

c.

Scale Effects

As discussed at length earlier, Internet search, search advertising, and search
syndication arc markets that are characterized by substantial scale effects. As more
consumers use a general search engine, its search algorithms are honed to improve its
accuracy in retrieving the information that consumers want. More users also leads to an
increased number of advertisers. And, as the number of advertisers that place ads- and the
number of consumers who click on those ads - increases, the ad-serving algorithrs improve
their ability to predict what advertisements stimulate consumer "clicks." This, i turn,
inc~eases monetization .for the. search engine, its a~ve~tisers, and its syn~ication rrtn~rs,

WhiCh leads to the cychcal cftect of greater partiCipatiOn by both advertiSers and rubhshers.
This effect, which bas been termed the "virtuous cycle," represents a significant ~arricr for
any potential entrant.446
Indeed, according to Microsoft, its greatest barrier is obtaining sufficient scale
through its collection of search and advertising data, and it faces an enormous task in trying
to catch up with Google. Despite substantial investments in technology and infrastructure,
Microsoft has yet to make a significant dent in Google's market share, and has b Ien losing

trafficked websitcs, which, in tum, magnifies the problems of scale effects. In addition, the
exclusive agreements act as barriers to smaller, more specialized search advertising platforms
(e.g., a network specializ ing in local Washington, D.C.-based advertising, or in specific

categories, such as travel).

B.

COOGLE HAS ENGAGED IN EXCLUSIONARY CONDUOT

Conduct may be judged exclusionary when it tends to exclude competitor "on some
basis other than efficiency," i.e., when it "tends to impair the opportunities ofrii ls" but
"either docs not further competition on the merits or does so in an wmecessarily restrictive
way.'"'

52

In order for conduct to be condemned as "exclusionary," Staff must sh9w that

Google's conduct likely impairs the ability of its rivals to compete effectively, and thus to
constrain Google 's exercise of monopoly power. 453

1.

Coogle's Preferencing of Google Vertical Properties Within Its
SERP

As described earlier, Staff has investigated whether Googlc is unlawfully
prcfcrcncing its own vertical content over that of rivals, while simultaneously deP,oting rival
vertical websitcs, in order to maintain, preserve, or enhance its monopoly power in the
markets for search and search advertising. Althollgh we believe that this is a clol·e question,
we conclude that Google's prc.fcrencing conduct docs not violate Section 2.

a.

Coogle's Product Design Impedes Vertical Competitors

"As a general rule, courts are properly very skeptical about claims that competition
has been harmed by a dominant fum's product design changes . . . . Judicial deference to
product innovation, however, does not mean that a monopolist's product design decisions are

per se Jawful.'"'

54

In United States v. Microsoft, the D.C. Circ uit conc luded that several

The theory of harm to competition is mainly one of reduced innovation: that, when

faced with Google 's seamless ability to enter into highly monetizable categories of
commerce and simultaneously to disadvantage its competitors, existing competitors cannot
innovate at the same pace; new or i1movative vertical websites will cease to entc the market;
and consumers will be faced with a corresponding reduction in innovation and choice.459

b.

Google's SERP Changes Have Resulted In Anti ompetitive
Effects

Google's conduct has resulted in significant harm to 1iva l vertical websit~s in a
number of different categories. As described earlier, in the comparison shoppinJ category one of the first areas in which Google vigorously expanded its own offering, while
simultaneously demoting rival offerings- many rival websitcs have experienced significant
declines in traffic. Data obtained from NexTag and Shopping.com, among others, suggests
that, as a result of Googlc's conduct, these web sites have experienced significant drops in
traffic. Google's internal data confirms this impact.460
Simultaneously, Google's prominent placement and display of its Univer al Search
properties led to gains in user share for its own properties. For example, Google s inclusion
of Googlc Product Search as a Universal Search result turned a property that the Google
product team could not even get indexed by Googlc's web search results into the number one
viewed comparison shopping website on Googlc. 46 1

c.

Google's Justifications for the Conduct

Google claims that the conduct under review improves its product and benefits users.
"[A] design change that improves a product by providing a new benefit to consumers does
not violate Section 2 absent some associated anticompetitive conduct." Allied Orthopedic
Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Group LP, 592 F.3d 991, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2 10).

results. Google measures the quality of its verticals by assigning relevance valu ( to each
individual vertical result, i.e., to each merchant in a specific product search, or t each
location in a local search (which may be ranked by popularity, rating, number ofGooglc
reviews, distance, and other factors).
Google's web search results, on the other hand, receive a score based on he text read
from crawling the contents of the page. Based on the crawled text, the pages are rated using
factors such as click-through rates (i.e., how often previous users clicked on the r ge),
commerciality (i.e., whether the page has too many ads), and the page's PageRank.468 With
Googlc's current algorithms, Google cannot directly compare, say, the ranking for a specific
restaurant (in its own local results) to the ranking for an entire web page (in someone else's
local results).

469

On the other hand, Microsoft has told us that Bing uses a single signal -

click-through rate- to determine where to place the Universal Search content within the
organic search results. 470
Google's justification for promoting its own properties above that of competing
properties automatically when those properties appear (reca ll the algorithms that oosted
Googlc Product Search to the top of the SERP whenever another comparison shrping
website was deemed relevant) is not as strong, but still has some force. Google'
justification for this conduct is that, if another vertical property is deemed rcleva1,1t by
Google's algorithms, Google's vertical property must also have high quality results - and
Google's rich Universal Search results are more helpful to the user than "blue links" to other
comparison shopping websites.
Google 's justification for surfacing only (or mainly) Google-sourced con ent- rather
than third-party vertical content - w ithin its Universal Search results is less conv ncing.

82

SJ

W
a
i
v
s
nt

me
u
c
o
D
Google's defense for this conduct essentially boils down to "user expectations." Sergey Brio
testified that Google's showcasing of its Universal Search results is not inconsistent with the
demotion of other similar vertical content because Universal Search represents a "mode
change" for users. 476 According to Brin:
So when you search for products rather than searching for web p ges, I feel
like that's more of a mode change. You know, you're switching in fact, you
can switch .... You can switch to product mode. And I think th t would be
confusing in the user interface if you were to just get a web link, ou know,
that looked li ke a normal Googlc result and yet it takes you to an ther Google
search. l think people understand mode changes. They might unacrstand
resorting something in a different way. But I think ultimately whfn you click
on an individual [web] link, you want to get an answer. You don t want to get
another set of search results. 477
In other words, Google's position is that, if a user conducts a search on Google for a
product, that user is looking for Google 's search results, not another list of search results
from another search provider. However, Googlc has presented no evidence ofu~er
expectations in this area. 4 78 Indeed, Google's vertical properties are typically not labeled as
"Google" results, and thus, outwardly at least, provide no cue to a user that he or she is
"switching" to a different mode of Google search.479 Nevertheless, Brin testifie~ that "the
user interface is pretty clear'.480 - "the link that says 'shopping results for' is cle!rly a
specialized part of the interface. It doesn't appea r to be just like another web pa e.''481

d.

Google's Additional Legal Defenses

Setting aside efficiency justifications, Googlc has argued - successfully b1 several
litigations- that it owes no duty to assist in the promotion of a rival's website or search
platform, and that it owes no duty to promote a rival's product offering over its own product
offcrings.

4 82

1ndeed, one reading of Trinko and subsequent cases is that Google ·s privileged

in blocking rivals from its search platform unless its conduct falls into in one of ·everal

84

ln sum, Staff acknowledges the difficulties inherent in this area of the investigation,

not only because of the legal hurdles we would face, but because ofthe strong
procompetitive justifications Google has set forth. We arc faced with a set of facts that can
most plausibly be accounted for by a nanative of mixed motives: one in which G ogle's
course of conduct was premised on its desire to innovate and to produce a high q ality search
product in the face of competition, blended with the desire to direct users to its o n vertical
offeri ngs (instead of those of rivals) so as to increase its own revenues. Indeed, t e evidence
paints a complex portrait of a company working toward an overall goal of maint3!ining its
market share by providing the best user experience, while simultaneously engaging in tactics
that resulted in harm to many vertical competitors, and likely helped to entrench poogle's
monopoly power over search and search advertising. The determination that Google's
conduct is anticompetitivc, and deserving of condemnation, would require an extensive
balancing of these factors, a task that courts have been unwilling- in similar circumstances to perform under Section 2. Thus, although it is a close question, Staff does not recommend
that the Commission move forward on this cause of action.

2.

Google's "Scraping" of Rivals' Vertical Content

As described earlier) Staff has investigated whether Google bas w1lawfb ll "scraped"
or appropriated - the content of rival vertical wcbsitcs in order to improve its own vertical
products, so as to maintain, preserve, or enhance its monopoly power in the markets for
search and search advertising. We conclude that this conduct violates Section 2 and Section
5.

ticket even ~f compensated at retail price revealed a distinctly anti competitive
bent..t97
Appellate courts have focused upon Trinko 's reference to the "unilateral termination

of a voluntary course of dealing," as a critical limitation upon a monopolist's discretion in
determining whether to deal with a rival. For example, in American Central Eastern Texas
Gas Co. v. Duke Energy Fuels LLC,498 the Fifth Circuit upheld an arbitrator's det rmination

that the defendant natural gas processor's refusal to contract with a competitor fo additional
processing capacity was unlawful. Plaintiff was both a "gatherer" and "processo " of natural
gas. The plaintiff alleged that, because it was not economically feasible to open

lrs own

processing plant, it contracted with the defendant for processing capacity. 499 After two years
of using the defendant's processing plant, when the plaintiff entered into renegotiations for
additional capacity, the defendant proposed terms that it " knew were unrealistic or
completely unviable" to the plaintiff, including a very high price, "in order to exclude [the
plaintiff] from competition with [the defendant] in the ... gas processing market."500 The
Fifth Circuit upheld the arbitrator's conclusion that the defendant unlawfully refused to deal
with the plaintiff, acknowledging that, while courts "must be cautious in finding xception to
the right to refuse to deal," here, the defendant's refusal, in the context of a "prio course of
dealing" with plaintiff, supported a finding of liability. 50 1
Here, much like in Aspen Skiing and Duke Energy, there is a compelling narrative

----

regarding a prior voluntary course of dealing. Specifically, Google had long-established,

-

voluntary, and mutually beneficial licensing agreements with both Yelp and Tri_pAdvisor.
Through its agreements with these (and other) third parties, Google secured relevant and
high-quality content for its web search product. In exchange, through their prcse ce in

collaborative networks if we permit one dominant firm to run away with all of the private
gains once it is in a position to do so:.s07
There are some distinctions between the conduct in Aspen and Google's conduct here
that bear mention. First, the exchange of value here is non-linancial. The bencfi to Google
accrues fro m securing high-quality content, while Googlc's partners secure traffit However,
this distinction appears to be insignificant. Whether the payment is in the form

l

dollars or

other benefit is of little consequence to the purpose or effect of Googlc's threate ed refusal to
deal. sos
More importantly, Google ultimately did not "refuse" to deal with Yelp, and their
relationship continues to this day. While Google never followed through on its tyreat to
remove these websitcs entirely from its web search results, it is clear that Googles threat was
intended to produce, and did produce, the desired effect (for a significant period of time),
which was to coerce Yelp and TripAdvisor into backing down on their efforts to rave their
valuable content removed from the Google Local product. Google's threat also sent a
message to the broader marketplace that Google could, and would, use its mono oly power
over search to extract the fi11its of its rivals' innovations. Consequently, Google' threat
itself - although not a consummated refusal to deal - may be challenged as excl ionary
conduct. 509
This theory of exclusion does not reach the search prefcrencing conduct we assessed

supra at pp. 78-86. Here, we view the evidence of benefi t to Google stemming from its
licensing agreements with third-party content providers as offering the critical distinction.
Google's long-standing licensing agreements with parties such as Yelp and TripAd visor offer
clear and convincing proof not just of an affirmative relationship between Googl and these

Amazon's product ranking information, which was never part of any licensing agreement
between the parties). Under this approach, Googlc's conduct can be analogized to the
imposition of higher costs, through onerous terms of dealing, on wcbsitcs wbos content
Google deems the most valuable to its own web search product. 510 Viewed in is way,
condemnation ofGooglc's conduct depertds not on any prior established relatio ship with the
affected vertical websitcs, but rather, on Google's motivation in scraping conte t from highquality verti<.:al competitors- the motivation to keep vertical websites from sip oning users
from Google's web search property (and thus, maintaining, preserving, or enha
monopoly position in Lhe market for search).
While a traditional Section 2 analysis relics on a prior course of dealing as a
gatekeeper, or a bright line proxy, for showing that the defendant's purpose and effect was
anticompetitive, Section 5 empowers the Commission to demonstrate harm to the
competitive process in other ways. 5 11 For example, Googlc's threat (and willingness) to
degrade its own web search product- by banishing high-quality vertical wcbsites from its
web search results altogether- suggests that Google's motive in scraping high-quality
con tent from its vettical competitors was not procompetitive.

b.

Google's "Scraping" Has Resulted In Anticomt etltive

I.

Effects

As described earlier, Go ogle's "scrapi ng" of the content of rival vertical websites has
resulted in harm to these vertical wcbsites and, more broadly, to the competitive process.
Because Googlc scraped information over an extended period of time, it is diffi ult to point
to declines in traffic that are specifically attributable to Google's conduct. How ver,
Google's conduct has arguably lessened the incentives of vertical wcbsitcs like
TripAdvisor, CitySearch, and Amazon to innovate.

In sum, the evidence shows that Google used its monopoly position in search to
scrape content from rivals and to improve its own complementary vertical offerings, to the
detriment of those rivals, and without a countervailing efficiency justification. ~oogle's
scraping conduct has helped it to maintain, preserve, and enhance Google's mo opoly
position in the markets for search and search advertising. Accordingly, we beli ve that this
conduct should be condemned by the Commission.

3.

Google's API Restrictions

Staff has investigated whether Google has employed anticompctitivc contractual
restrictions to prevent advertisers from using third-party tools to simultaneously manage
campaigns on Google's search advertising platform (AdWords) and rival advertising
platforms (e.g., Microsoft's AdCenter). As described earlier, Microsoft has alleged that
Googlc is denying Microsoft critical scale by employing these restrictions, and thus
impairing Microsoft's ability to compete effectively in the markets for general search and
search advertising. We conclude that Google's API restrictions violate Section

r-

Google's introduction of the AdWords API was a clearly procompetitivj
development that benefitted advertisers, SEMs, and Google alike. However, th restrictive
conditions in the API usage agreement have anticompctitive effects without off: etting
precompetitive benefits. They impede the efficient usc of advertisers' own camhaign data,
creating additional, unnecessary transaction costs for advertisers that might wisli to use that
data to run advertising campaigns on other search networks. The restrictive conr itions are
not inherently tied to the product. Accordingly, we may evaluate Google's inclusion of the
restrictive conditions as a stand-alone act and weigh their anticompetitive effects against any
potential procompetitive bcnefits.517

The restrictive conditions are unreasonable if their anticompetitive effecj outweigh
their procompetitive virtues. Ou r investigation has shown that the restrictive cor ditions do
not have any procompetitive virtues, whereas their anticompctitivc cf.Tccts, whil difficult to

b.

The Restrictive Conditions Have Resulted In
Anticompetitive Effects

The restrictive conditions hann competition in three broad ways. They rl duce
innovation, increase transaction costs, and degrade the quality ofGoogle's rivals in search
and search advertising.
As noted above, severa l SEMs have been forced to remove campaign cloning
functionality by Google. Beyond removing these products from the marketplace, Googl e 's
restrictive cond itior1s have created a profound d isincentive for tool developers to innovate in
this area. A h igh performance cross-network campaign management tool would need to be a
soph isticated product, able to allocate and adjust bids on keyword s in different auctions with
different and rapidly shifting competitive environments. However well the first-generation
tools performed, it seems obvious that their performance would only have imprTed as SEMs
and their c lients tested these tools in the fie ld. Google's restrictive conditions stopped this
market segment in its infancy. There would be little to no demand for a cross-network
management tool without the prospect of accessing the dominant search network, AdWords.
Google's imposition of the restrictive conditions has increased the transaction costs
for all advertisers other than those large enough to make the internal investment~ to develop
their own campaign management tools. 521 For the rest, they must devote additional staff time
to manage multiple parallel campaigns. Some may choose to usc work-arounds, by which
they download their AdWords campaigns into CSV (or plain-text) files, make th ~requisite

Moreover, Google ignores the possibility that even larger advertisers that multi-borne
would do so more without the restrictions. As described above, Microsoft's internal studies
suggest that advertisers who advertise on both platforms do so unevenly and unequally, thus
leading to better, more targeted, and more relevant ads on AdWords than on AdCenter. As
described earlier, having the "right" ad for the " right" user at the " right" time is ' ritical to a
search engine's abi lity to improve its ad-serving algorithms and its revenue-per-search (or
RPS).

529

The lack of smaller advert ism, combined with the lack of regular optr ization by

even the larger advertisers who advertise on both platforms, places Microsoft in a
significantly inferior position to Google in tem1s of being able to provide that "right" ad for
the "right" user at the "right" time.
While the magnitude of these effects arc unclear, their direction is clear: advertisers
arc spending less on the non-dominant search networks. For advertisers, this means forgone
advertising opportunities that presumably would have been profitable, but for the restrictive
conditions. For Google's rivals, the diminished spend resulting from the restrict ve
conditions means lost revenue, which diminishes their ability to invest in quality
improvements in search. The reduction in ads placed also reduces the overall qu lity of the
ads served on the rival search networks, which reduces the usefulness of the ads erved to
users, reducing, in turn, users' propensity to click on ads, an effect that broadly egrades the
quality of the rival search network It is also possible, though more speculative, that reduced
ad quality may modestly reduce the usefulness of the rival search engines, particularly on
very commercial queries, which in tum may suppress the number of searches performed on
the rival networks. The degradation of Google's rivals both as advertising platfQmls and as

tools that perform well will lose clients. In fact, even if SEMs and agencies were in no
danger oflosing their clients' business, they would still have a strong incentive to improve
their clients' returns as a way to encourage their clients to spend more on searc advertising,
increasing the third parties' commissions in the process. Jn a round-table discu sion hosted
by Google, SEMs and agencies made this exact point to Google. 538 ln brief, the e third
parties incentives are highly aligned with Googlc's interests, precisely the oppo ite of what
Google contends.539
Google, meanwhile, is unable to identify any concrete examples of any i I effects
from the purportedly misaligned incentives of SEMs and agencies. Google has represented
to advertisers and agencies that " we have found that advertisers experience higher returns

coherent manner." 540

owcvcr, Google has no such cvidence. 541 Go gle did investigate the

potential innuence SEMs would have on the rate of spendi ng by their clients, and determined
that the spend for advertisers represented by SEMs increased at a higher rate than did spend
for other advertisers.542 Google has not engaged in any experiments to determine what effect
relaxing the restrictive terms and conditions might havc. 543
Moreover, there is already a different provision in the APT AdWords Te
Conditions that adequately addresses any concern about misaligned incentives.

sa

condition of using the APT, SEMs and other tool developers are required to expose a Googledefined set of minimum func~onality. 544 The required minimum functionality provision
directly addresses any legitimate concerns that Googlc might have about SEMs1ailing to
expose important features of AdWords to their advertiser clients. Google has n t explained
how the required minimum functionality requirement is inadequate in this regar .

Google deems important to the performance of AdWords. Although Google now claims that
the required minimum functionality condition and the restrictive conditions are both aimed at
the lowest common denominator concem,550 it cannot explain why the required minimum
functiona lity requirement alone would not suffice to alleviate the lowest comm n
denominator concern_ Indeed, this document suggests that the restrictive condi ·ons were
actually designed specifically to reduce the likelihood that advertisers would ex end their
campaigns to rival search networks. 55 '
In sum, the effects of these restrictive conditions, combined, have the te dency to
preserve and enhance Google's dominant position in the search advertising market.
Unjustified by any procompetitive benefits, we believe that Googlc's restrictive conditions
should be condemned by the Commission.552

Coogle's Exclusive and Restrictive Syndication Agreements

Staff has investigated whether Googlc has entered into anticompetiti ve, exclusionary
agreements with websitcs for syndicated search and search advertising services (AdSense
agreements) that serve to maintain, preserve, or enhance Googlc's monopoly power in the
markets for search, search advertising, or search and search advertising syndica ion (search
intermediation). We conclude that these agreements violate Section 2.

a.
~

Google's Agreements Foreclose a Substantial ortion of the
Relevant Market

Exclusive deals by a monopolist harm competition by foreclosing rivals !from needed

~ relationships with distributors, suppliers, or end users. For example, in Microso t, then.J
defendant Microsoft 's exclusive agreements with original equipment manufactu ers and
software vendors were deemed anticompetitive where they were found to preve t third
parties from installing rival browser Netscape, thus forec losing Nctscape from t e most

party dataset routinely used in the industry to analyze query volumes and market shares.

561

As noted earlier, however, in a company data set provided by Microsoft, Yaboo! 's syndicated
query volume is significantly higher than that reflected in ComScore.562 Relianc on the
larger figure would clearly result in a dramatically lower foreclosure number for

oogle's

agreements. We are trying to get to the bottom of this discrepancy now. Howev r, based on
our broader understanding of the market, we believe that the ComScorc set more accurately
reflects the relative query shares of each party. 563
Below, Staff lays out three scenarios: the most conservative foreclosure scenario; the
most aggressive foreclosure scenario; and the "intermediate"- or most likely defensibleforeclosure scenario. ln our most conservative estimate, the foreclosure rate is approximately
20 pcrcent.564 In our most aggressive estimate, the foreclosure rate is approximately 66
perccnt.

565

In the "intennediatc" scenario, the foreclosure rate is approximately 52

percent.566
Obviously, given the limitations of the various datasets, the calculated foreclosure
rates arc of limited value. Nevertheless, it is clear that Google has tied up a substantial
portion of this distribution channel with exclusivc and restrictive agreements. ln he market
for search syndication, Google has exclusive or restrictive agreements with 12 of the top 20
companies (60 percent) and 4 of the top 5 (80 percent). The 20 largest companies account
for 94 percent of total query volume.567 Courts have found that foreclosing rivals from the
most effi cient means of distribution can be especially problematic.568 Access to these largest
players is by far the most efficient method for Bing to gain query volume in the syndication
channel. 569

the publishers we interviewed did not object to exclusivity because they wanted to use
Google for all their search syndication needs anyway.
Our investigation indicates that this objection rests on a fallac ious assu ption:
namely, that Bing's average monetization gap is derived from its consistent fai ings acrossthe-board. If, instead, that overall average is derived from sources of differing uality, that
means Bing actually does have opportunities to pick off incremental business fr m Google in
those areas where the monetization gap is lower, particularly where it can make up for some
of its monetization deficiencies by otlcring higher revenue shares. Evidence fr m Microsoft
indicates that there is indeed heterogeneity in the quality of its search advertising product,
with comparative strength in certain c~mmercial categories, such as travel and people
(social) scarch.571
Given this state of affairs, one likely path for Bing to win new syndication business is
precisely the one blocked by the exclusivity provisions in Google's syndication agreements.
All the publishers that expressed interest in using Bing told us that they want to split up their
business, giving Bing opportunities where it can compete, and relying on Googlc for the
balance of their needs.
In addition to the immediate impact on Bing, our investigation suggests hat specialty

search advertising platforms may emerge in the absence of Google's exclusivit provisions.
For example, lAC's CityGrid property sought to build its own advertising platfQrm to serve
advertising targeted to local markets. 572 CityGrid monetizes its websites
from small''mom and pop'' stores, medium-sized businesses, and large chains
to gain local eustomers.

573

CityGrid decided that it wanted to build its own

network rather than "put all [its] eggs in one basket" by going with Google

5 to I 0 percent increase in its overall query traffic would be "very meaningful" because Bing
is at the lower part of the scale curve where "each percentage point is critical."579
While there is not enough evidence on this point to reach definitive cone usions,
internal Google documents suggest that Microsoft's view of things may be close to the truth.
Googlc's interest in renewing deals with some of its largest syndication customers may have
been, in part, to keep Microsoft from gaining scale. For example, an internal Google analysis
of the 2010 AOL renewal explains:
s marginal search share but represents sea e gains for a
Microsoft + Yahoo! partnership.... AOL/Microsoft combinatiof has
modest impact on market dynamics, but material increase in scale of
Microsoft's search & ads platform. 580
When a senior Googlc executive was infonned that " Microsoft [is] aggressively
wooing AOL with large guarantees," he responded that:
I think the worse case scenario here is that AOL users get sent to Bing, so
even if we make AOL a bit more c~mpeti tive relative to Google, fhat
seems preferable to growing Bing.,') 81
Ac ord ing to Googlc documents, the company sought to pursue the AOL deal algressively
,582

While the evidence summarized above is consistent with the theory that

esc

exclusive dealing arrangements are creating anticompctitivc effects, there are nevertheless
some significant limitations in this evidence. Perhaps our biggest concern is that today, so
few publishers arc actively interested in using multiple suppliers. As noted earlier, we have
identified only three companies that are subject to the exclusivity or "preferred placement"
provisions today and clearly voicing unambiguous concerns: cBay, NexTag, and
Business.com. In addition to these three companies, AmaLon is not foreclosed

, but

voiced very similar concerns and is very worried that it may be subject to cxclus vity in the

dynamics as publishers have the opportunity to consider - and test - alternatives to Google's
AdScnsc program. While the speed and strength of these long-term improvements cannot be
accurately forecast today, this is a situation where the ncar-term competitive imp cts may be
overshadowed by the long-term improvements, as competitive forces arc unleas led and
additional dynamism emerges.

c.

Google's Agreements Are Not Justified By Effic'encies

Google has offered three business justi.ftcations for its exclusive and restr clive
syndication agreements with publishers. First, Google notes that there is a long- tanding
industry practice in favor of exclusivity dating from the time when the publishers demanded
large, guaranteed revenue share payments regardless of actual performance. However,
guaranteed revenue shares are now virtually non-existent.
A second, and related. justification is that Google is simply engaging in a vigorous
competition with Microsoft for exclusive agreements. Although Microsoft asserts that it
would like the opportunity to compete on a non-exclusive basis (and will happily serve even
a sma ll portion of a website publ isher's queries), some publishers report that Microsoft itself
sought various forms of exclusivity in contract negotiations.m Moreover, while r icrosoft
has aggressively pursued some very large website publishers, it appears that Mic osoft is not
generally pursuing the broader syndication busi11ess Loday. 586 Google may argue that the fac t
that Microsoft is losing in a competitive bidding process (and indeed, nol compe ·ng as
'
vigorously as it might otherwise) is not a basis on which to condemn Googlc. However,
I
Google has effectively created the rules oftoday's game, and Microsoft's subs

tial

mone tization disadvantage puts it in a poor competition position to compete on a aU-ornothing basis.

While we acknowledge the limited effects here, it is worth noting that the market for

search and search advertising syndication is, inarguably, not robustly competitive today.
Googlc has been unilaterally reducing revenue share percentages to many of its syndication
customers (in effect raising prices) with apparent impunity.589 One of the largest customers,
Amazon, decided that it is in its long-term, strategic interest to fu nnel some que1 volume to
Bing, even if it is losing money on each query. 590 Ama7.on is using multiple sup~liers just to
try to foster a more competitive marketplace.59 1 Where markets are functioning Jo poorly,
the rationale for government intervention is stronger, even in situations where th near-term
competitive harm directly attributable to the challenged conduct may be small. Although this
conduct presents a closer question, we believe that Google's exclusive and restrictive
agreements have not only helped to maintain, preserve, and enhance Google's monopoly
power in the market for search and search advertising syndication (search intermediation),
but also in the underlying markets for search and search advertising. Therefore, we believe
Lhat the Commission shou ld condemn Google's exclusive and restrictive syndica ion

agreements.
IV.

POTENTIAL REMEDIES
Staff has identified several possible remedies to Google 's conduct. These remedies

arc described below.
A.

Scraping

There are at least two possible remedies for Google's scraping conduct. First,
Google could be required to provide an "opt-out" feature to remove "snippets" of website
content (e.g., user reviews, ratings) from Google's vertical properties, but retain

112

partners considering alternatives to AdSense may grow in the event that these agreements are
enjoined.595

V.

LITIGATION RISKS
We have identified throughout this memorandum the many substantial ri ks

associated with bringing a case against Googlc. On a global level, the record wit penni!
Googlc to show substantial innovation, intense competition fi·om Microsoft and ~thers, and
speculative long-run harm. Here, we highlight some specific facts that present t e greatest
litigation risk:
I.

"Competition is just one click away. "596 Googlc does not charge consumers,
and they are not locked into Google. The durability ofGoogle's monopoly
power is questionable with an increasing number of wcbsites (e.g., Faeebook,
Twitter) competing for user time and advertiser dollars.

2.

Universal Search is a "product improvement" that has resulted in substantial
benefit to its users.

3.

Google's organization and aggregation o[ content from other wcbsites adds
value to the product for consumers.

4.

The largest advertisers (that produce the most revenue on Google's AdWords
platform and Microsoft's AdCenter platform) already advertise on both
AdWords and AdCenter.

5.

The most efficient channel through which Bing can gain scale is Bing.com,
not syndication or other distribution channels.

CONCLUSION
Staff concludes that Google's conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to

consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets. Google has
strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive
means, and has forestalled competitors' and would-be competitors' ability to cha lenge those
monopolies, and this will have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare. Sp~cifically,
StalT believes that:
1.

Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general searcJ1 and
search advertising, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise engaged in w1fair
methods of competition, in violation of Section 5, by scraping content from
rival vertical websites in order to improve its own product offerings.

2.

Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general search, search
advertising, and search syndication, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise
engaged in unfair methods of competition, in violation of Section 6, by
entering into exclusive and highly restrictive agreements with we publishers
that prevent publishers from displaying competing search results r search
advertisements.

3.

Google has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over general search and
search advertising, in violation of Section 2, or otherwise engaged in unfair
methods of competition, in violation of Section 5, by maintaining contractual
restrictions that inhibit the cross-platform management of advcrtis~ng
campaigns.

Contextual advertis ing is limited by the amount of advertising space ava ilable on web pages addressing any

For example, in 2008, Google had the goal to "[i)ncrea'ic google.com product search inclusi<?n to the level of
google.com searches with 'product intent', while preseiVing clickthrough rate:' C OOG-Texas-0227159-66
(2008). at 60 ("2008 goal" for '·Google.com Integration"). Google had a goal for the fust quarter of2008 to
increase the triggering of the Product Universal to 6% for English sites. GOOC-Tcxas--0236963-65 (2008). at
63. In the second quarter of2008, that goal changed to increasing top OneBox coverage by 50 percent and top
CfR by I 0 percent, and to "[i]ncrease coverage on head queries. For example, we should be tfogering on at
least 5 of the top I 0 most popular queries on amazon.com at any given time, rather than only o e." GOOGTcxas..0227159-66 (2008), at 60. To increase triggering on head queries. Google also impleme ted a change to
trigger the Product Universal on google.com queries if they appeared often in the product verti al. "Using
Exact Corpusboost to Trigger Product Onebox" compares queries on www.google.com with qu ries on Google
Shopping, triggers the Product OneBox if the same query is often searched in Google Shoppin< and
automatically places the universal in position 4, regardless of the quality of the universal result or user "bias"
for top placement of the box. GOOGLR-00330279-80 (2008) (Launch Report for algorithm c ange).

of. That would open the door to place page or local entities as ranked results outside of some 'l3~al universal'
container. Arguably for many queries _all_ of the top I0 results should be local entities from oti. index w ith
refinement options. The currently mentality is that the googlc results page needs to be primarily about web
pages, possibly with some other annotations if they are really, really good. That's the big weak ess that bing is
shooting at w/ the 'decision engine' pitch - not a sea of pointers to possible answers, but real a wers right on
the page.... ").
122
In the spring of2008, Google estimated that the top placement of the Product Universal would lead to an
"annualized loss of $154 million" on product queries. GOOG-Tcxas-0 178597-607 (2008), at 598 ("Product
Search Universallloldba~.:k Experiment"). The.: atht:rtisin!S team rcquc:.tcd that the Product Universal trigger
less frequently to reduce the loss of ads revenue. The Product Search team objected, presenting to executives
that: Google must retain and grow product queries: ··we face strong competition and must move quickly.
Turning down ooebox would hamper progress as follows - Ranking: Losing click data harms ~ing;
ft lriggering Losing CTR and google.com query distribution data triggering accuracy; [c ]ompre ensiveness:
Losing traffic hann s merchant growth and therefore comprehensiveness: fm)erchant cooperatio :Losing traffic
reduces eiTort merchants put into offer data, tax, & shipping; PR: Turning ofl' one box reduces Google's
credibility in commerce; [u)ser awareness: Losing shopping-related Ul on google.com reduces d~areness of
Google's shopping features.'' GOOG-Texas-0178597-607 (2008), at 607. Rather than reducin~ triggering of
the Product Universal, Google moved it down from position I to position 4 on the page, which reduced some
cannibalization from the ads. See infra note 138.

(GOOG-Texas-0214363) (2009); GOOGWRJG-000041022-23 (2009), at 22; GOOG-Texas-0197396 (2009);
GOOG-Tcxas-0180522 (2008), at 22 ("With regard to middle/top threshold, raters say it goes at the top but
clicks metrics suggest middle"). Around the same time. the Google advertising team expressed concern that the
photo , pricing infom1ation, and other rich data provided by the Coogle Product Search diverted users' attention
from ads, resulting in fewer clicks on ads. In the spring of2008, Google estjmated that the top placement of
Google Product Search would lead to an "annualized loss of$ 154 million'' on product queries. GOOG-Texas0178597-607 (2008), at 598 ("Product Search Universal Holdback Experiment''). In response to both concerns,
Google launched a series of"aggressive demotions" to move most Google Product Search result;s down a few
positions on the SERP. See GOOG-Texas-0178597-607 (2008), at 59S ("Product Search Universal Holdback
Experiment") ("We are executing an aggressive plan to further improve google.com user exper~·nee tor
products that we estimate will reduce annualized loss from - $130mm to - $45MM within 4 wee · s"); GOOGTexas.-0214409-11 (2008), at 9 (Nick Fox writes that "the product search team said they were g ing to do a
bunch of thi ngs to dramatically reduce the negative [revenue] impact of the product .... "); GO G-Texas017859?· 607 (~008), at 605 (estin~a. ting tha~ thes~ changes would rc~ult in the percentages of G~ogl~ Product
Search m posmons 1, 4, and I 0 gomg from ·'85/0t 15" to ''40/35/25,' and a correspondmg reduc~on m loss of
advertising revenue from $154 million to $70 million). Speci fically, in Jul. 2008, Google made ~hree algorithm
ch~mges to "aggressively demote" more top OncBoxes to middle OneBoxes. GOOGMANB-00pos6049-S4
(20015), at 50. These were: (I) "Product Search Universal Triggering 2.0 [which] mainly moves them to a lower
position", id., (2) "Using Exact Corpusboost to Trigger Product Onebox", which compares quer~es with que1ies
on Google Shopping, triggers the Product OneBox if the same query is often searched in Google Shopping, and
automatically places the universal in position 4, GOOGLR-00330279-80 (2008), at 79 (Launch Report for
algorithm change); and (3) "Aggressive Demotion to Middle for Product Universal," which demotes from
position one to position four if the product One Box does not meet a higher relevance threshold, the first web
result is navigational with high probability, or rwo out of the top three resulis are for a manufacturer. Th.is
change demoted about 51 percent of top product OneBoxes to the middle). GOOGMANB-000055473-76
(2008), at 73-74 (Launch Report for algorithm change). See CX-168 (GOOG-T cxas-0214363) (2009);
GOOG-Texas-0197396 (2009). The "aggressiveness" of the demotion effort is debatable, as Google continued
to display Google Product Search results in the fourth position. And even t11ese tni nor demotions were
apparently quite controversial within Google. For example, Marissa Mayer "threatened to come to quality
launch review to defend keeping product w1iversal at [position] 1." GOOGWRIG-000041022-~3 (2009), at
22. In any event, these demotion efforts were short-lived, as Google quickly moved Google Proruct Search

content and information and reduce the ranking of, inter alia, 'content fam1s,' i.e., low-quality adtoriented

Although Google originally sought to demote all comparison shopping websites, after Google raters
provided negative feedback to such a widespread demotion, Google implemented the current iter tion of its socalled "diversity" algorithm. See GOOG-Texas-0 179485-92 (2006), at 85 (identifYing shoppin comparison
s ites for demotion); GOOCEC-0148152-56 (2007), at 53 (testing algorithm that would result in 'SERP
declines between 8 and 20 percent" for shopping comparison sites); GOOGMANB-000007246-·p (2007), at
46 (launching the algorithm in Dec. 2007). Googlc claimed that the goal of this algorithm was to :increase the
1
diversity of Google ·s search results for product related queries." See Response of Google to DG 'Comp (Nov.
22, 2010), at§ 2.2, p.l.
Initially, Google compiled a list of target comparison shopping s ites and demoted them from the top 10
web results, but users preferred comparison shopping sites to the merc hant sites that were often boosted by the
demotion. GOOCSI~G-0000141 16-17 (2006), at 16- 17 (''We had moderate losses when we promoted an
etailer page which listed a single product because the raters thought this was worse than a bizrate or nextag page
which listed several similar products. Etailer pages which listed multiple products fared better but were still not
considered better than the meta-shopping pages like bizrate or nextag..... "). Google then tried an algorithm that
wo uld demote the CSEs, but not below sites of a certain relevance. GOOGEC-0168032-33 (2006), at 32.
Again, the experiment £:1iled, because users liked the quality of the CSE sites. COOGSING-000014375-76
(2006). at 75 ("The bizratelnextaglepinions pages are decently good results. They are usually we~-forma[t)ted,
rarely broken, load quickly ru1d usually on-topic. Raters tend to like them. I make this point becaase the
replacement pages that we promote are occasionally off-topic or dead links. Another positive as~ct of the
meta-shopping pages is that they usually give a variety of choices. ... The single etailer pages te d to be single
product pages. For a more general query, raters like the variety of choices the meta-shopping site seems to
give.") Google tried another experiment which kept a CSE within the top 5 results if it was alreatly there, but
demoted others "aggressively." !d. at 76. This too resulted in slightly negative results. /d.
Unable to get positive reviews from raters when Google demo ted comparison shopping sites, Google
changed the raters' criteria to try to get positive results. Previously, raters judged new algori thm~ by looking at
search results before and after the change ''side-by-side" (SxS), and rated which search result wa~ more relevant
in ench position. COOGEC-0 168014-27 (2007), at 25. After the fi rst set of results, Google ask1d the users to
·
instead focus on the diversity and utility of the whole set of results, 111ther than resul t by •·esult, te ling users
explicitly that ''if two results on the same side have very similar content then having those two re ults may not
be mo re valuable than just having one." !d. at 23. When Googlc u·ied the new rating criteria with an algorithm
which demoted CSEs such that sometimes no CSEs remained in the top I 0, the test again came back "solidly
negative." ld. ut 19. Google again changed its algorithm to demote CSEs only if more than two appeared in the
top 10 results, and then, only demoting those beyond the top two. With this change, Google finally got a
slightly positive rating in its "diversity test" from its raters. /d. at 16; C OOGEC-0148 152-56 (2007), at 52
("Launch Report: Shopping Comparison Demotion''). Google finally launched this algorithm change in Jul.
2007. GOOGEC-0014649 (2007) (launching at one Google data center); GOOCMAN B-<100007246-47

IR (Jun. 24, 20 12). Generally speaking, it was difficult for many advertisers to answer the hypothetical- "what
would you do in the face of an across-the-board price increase?"- because of the unique manner in which
search advertising is priced. Pricing of search advertising is based on what is known as a " Vickrey second
auction" model. The idea behind this auction is !0 give advertisers the incentive to bid their maximum bid,
rather than tly to game the auction to pay as little as possible. In this type of auction, an advertiser is only
requi red to pay $.0 I more than the next lowest bidder. For example, three sports retailers are bidding on the
keyword "sneakers." Reta iler A bids a maximum of$1.00; Retailer B bids $0.50; and Retailer C bids $0.25.
All other th ings being equal (i.e., controlling for Google's quality score adjustments), Retailer A. will "win" the
top spot in the auction, but will only pay $0.51 to Google if a user clicks on Retailer A's ad. ~~~his way, the
auction itself drives up the prices, and Google's "control" of prices is more indirect (although lfogle sets
minimum bids and establishes quality scores that sets each advertiser's baseline bid). Notably, each time a

Cra igslist.org have been removed from d1e dataset because the site does not host either web search or search
advertising. There are some significant inconsistencies in our datasets. Figures provided by Microsoft for
Yahoo! 's syndication query volume are staggeringly inconsistent with comScore's data ( I 07 billion in
Microsoft's data :;et v. 2.7 billion in comScore). We are trying 10 get to rhe bottom of this discrepancy now, but
understand that Yahoo! 's internal data may take into account so-called ''phantom.. queries (instances where a
user hovers over a word in tex t and a link or ad appears), which would account for the discrepancy. Google's
market share would be considerably smaller taking into accoun t the Yahoo! figure provided by Microsoft.
However, we have reason to question the Yal10o! figure because it is inconsistent with the i
Staff
understand ing ofGoogle's dominance in this area. See Appendix 3 for a detailed explanation
calculated the relevant market shares using cornScore's dataset.

Se11 Microsofi Corp., Microsoft Complaint to the European Commission (Mar. 3 I, 20 II). 'f1'is theory
di rectly tracks the Department of Justice's theory on the role of middleware in Mieroso.fi. Therf.' it was argued,
middleware represented a threat to Microsoft's operating system dominance not because the mi?dleware would
itselfreplace the underlying operating system, but because middleware provided an alternati vellatform onto
which applications could be written, which could be run irrespective of the underlying operatin system.
Lowering this so-called applications barrier to entry, in turn, lowered the costs for other firms t introduce rival
operating systems that could directly challe11ge Microsoft's dom inance over lntel-compatible o~erating systems.
Sim ilarly, here, Microsoft argues that a "key component" of its strategy in attracting users ha~en to partner
with vertical websites so that Bing can offer a "differentiated generctl search experience to com ete with
improving
Google.'' !d. See also e.g., GOOG-Texas-1325832-33 (201 0), at 33 ("Oing has explicitly m
verticals a key pa•t of their strategy to beat Coogle"); GOOG-JTA-0 1-033 1214 (2009) (email oting that Bing
is focused on competing against Googlc in its "two top vert icals," shopping and travel).
459
Wh ile reduced innovation is at the heart of this theory, the role of pricing cannot be ignored, in that (as with
other theories described later in this memorandum), the broader availabi lity of alternative search advertis ing
r:oatforms would operate as a constraint on Google's ability to raise prices to its advertisers.

In Micro ·oft. the government's argument that product improvement could be outweighed by anticompetitive
effects did not fare well. The en hanc court considered a claim that Microsoft had designed certain software in
a way that made Java a pplications both faster on its operating system and incompatible with rival operating
systems. Although the opinion stated that the appl icable test was th at "lhe incompatible produc~ must have an
anticompetitive effect that outweighs any procompetitive justifi cation for the design," it held thft the fact that
product ran taster on Microsoft machines sufficed to make it legal standing alone and did not a{/pear to try to
balance that benefit aga inst anticompetiti vc effects. Microsoft, 253 P.3d at 74-75. Similarly, w ' le the D.C.
Circuit up held the lower court's ruling against Microsoft on the company's e fforts to integrate t e In ternet
browser with the operating system, it did so on particular integration aspects for which Microso t could provide
no justification. Where M icrosoft did provide a justification (namely, in oveniding users' choi e of a default
browser), the comt found no liability. 253 F.3d at 67-68.

to standalone Section 5 competition enforcement. Herbert J. IIovenkamp, The Federal Trade O{Jmmission Act
and the Sherman Act, 62 Fla. L. Rev. 871, 885-87 (20 I 0). Hovckamp lauded the FTC's decisiob to challenge

suited to deal w ith thorny issues relating to design changes by monopolists that disadvantage ri als, id., and
because liability under Section 5 does not lead to the imposition of treble damages, and is appli d by an agency
that is able to develop expertise about partt' cularly complex issues such as design changes that nfbgatively impact
rivals. See also Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antilntsf Law, ,] 772h ("Another possibility is use of§ of the Federal

Vanessa Fox, Google Retires the Googlebot-News Bot, Search Engine Land,
http;//scarchcngi neland.com/google-retires-the- googlebot-news-bot-90607. The primary di fler nee between
Google News and the affected verticals here is that Google makes little money from Google Ne~s as a standalone product. Presumably, this lower-value vertical is one in which Google was willing to make certain
concessions that it was not willing to make in higher-value vertical areas.
m As demonstrated in the Microsoft opinion, courts are deferential in their treatment ofproduc innovations
with gen uine procompetitive qualities. See Microsoji, 253 F.3d at 75-76 (reversing finding of l i~bility with

(finding that the inlroduction of improved sensors that were incompatible with competitors' monitoring systems
was no t antioompctitive). However, when evaluating comracrual restrictions attached to the product. the
Microsoft court had no trouble evaluating those contractual restrictions separately from the products they were
attached to. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 59-63 (condemning licensing restrictions for harming rivals, «not by
improving its own product, but, rather, by preventing OE.vts from taking actions that could increa;;e rivals'
share of usage"). This distinction demonstrates why the consumer choice model described in the BE Staff
Memo of Jan. 3 I, 20 I 2, at 23-24, frames a false choice. With the model. BE Staff compared overall welfare of
advertisers with the API plus restrictions versus their welfare if no API existed. There is no support in the case
law for limiting the choice in such a way when there is a third choice: the API without the restrictive conditions.
The analogous argument in the Microsoft case would have prevented the courts from considering the possibility

y.a The ''conservative" estimate includes in the '"foreclosed" group only the companies that have explicitly
complained to the Commission that agreements foreclose them from using a rival syndication service, and that
they would like to do so, but for their current agreement with Googlc. This group includes only cBay. It should
also include ?\exTag and Business.com, however the comScore dataset does not provide numbe for these
firms. The comScore dataset suggests that, under this scenario, 8,653.366,936 queries, or some 19.6 percent of
the market, is foreclosed. (If lAC is included within this group, the foreclosed query volume in~reases to
16,447,977,342, or some 37.3 percent of the market.) This is an extremely conservative estimatf because, as
noted above, courts routinely include all sales made pursuant to an exclusive agreement as bein foreclosed.
sns The "aggressive" estimate includes in the ·'foreclosed" group every company that is party to n exclusive
agreement with Googlc (sec Appendix I, table showing exclusive agreements), as well as every company that is
party to an agreement with the challenged "preferred placement" provision (.1ee Appendix 2, tab e showing
"preferred placement" agree ments), except for any party that has explicitly told us that they do ot view the
"preferred placement" provision as a baiTier to the use of a rival's syndication service. The excl1ded group
includes Amazon, Wai-Mart, and Google's online partners. Also excluded is Ear1hlink, althoug the comScore
dataset does not provide numbers for this finn. The comScore dataset suggests that, under this cenario,
29, 133,927,g82 queries, or some 66. 1 percent of the market is foreclosed.
566
The "intermediate'' estimate includes in the "foreclosed" group every company that is party t an exclusive
agreement with Google, as well as any company that is party to "preferred placement" terms an~ has explicitly
complained to the Commission that these terms foreclose them from using a rival syndication service, and has
stated that they would like to do so, but for their current agreement with Google. In addition to all partners with
an exclusive agreement (see Appendix I, table showing exclusive agreements), this group includes: eBay (and
s hould include NexTag and Business.com, but does not, given the limitations of the comScore dataset,
described above). The comScore dataset suggests that, under this scenario. 22.804,213.204 queries, or some
51.5 percent of the market, is foreclosed. We believe that this is the most defensible position because it takes
into account both the exclusive agreeme nts- those companies literally forcclo~ed to competitors on the face of
their agreements - as well as any "preferred placement" agreements for companies that have explicitly
complained about the de facto exclusive effect of s uch agreements. Staff believes that this approach is

m !d. indeed, as CityGrid explained, there are approximately 15- 17 million individual local businesses that
hope to attract local customers throughout the United States. These local businesses are potential advertisers for
which search advertising (particularly search advertising serving specialized or "tail'' queries) can deliver a very
