- meetings people have meetings every day in a number of different venues and forms. For example, people worldwide daily have face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, public lectures, classes, and discussions, Web-based and other electronic meetings, and various other kinds of meetings.
- meetings occur at a given date and time, have at least one topic for discussion, and are established by a “host” to be attended by one or more “invitees.”
- the host and invitee(s) of the meeting can be collectively called “participants.”
- Meetings can be arranged with the aid of electronic meeting notices. That is, one or more hosts for a meeting can send out an electronic meeting notice (a.k.a. invitations) to one or more invitees of the meeting.
- the electronic meeting notice can include a given (or proposed) date and/or time for the meeting, one or more topics for discussion, a list of one or more hosts, a list of one or more invitees, and other information, such as an agenda and/or links or copies of documents associated with the meeting.
- Alice wants to have a discussion with Bob and Carla about an upcoming trip to Thailand
- Alice can format and send an electronic meeting notice to invite Bob and Carla to the meeting, with information about the meeting, such as the topic (e.g., “Thai trip”), time/place information, and perhaps an agenda and/or some related documents (e.g., example itineraries, information about Thailand, etc.).
- the topic e.g., “Thai trip”
- time/place information e.g., time/place information
- agenda and/or some related documents e.g., example itineraries, information about Thailand, etc.
- Bob and Carla each receive a copy of the electronic meeting notice, each of them can decide whether or not to attend the meeting.
- Alice is the “host” of the meeting and Bob and Carla are “invitees” of the meeting. While it is possible that a meeting can have multiple hosts, it is assumed that all meetings have only one host to simplify the remainder of the discussion herein.
- electronic communications such as electronic mail, blog postings, short messages, and other electronic communications, about the meeting are exchanged before, after, and sometimes during the meeting. For example, after receiving the meeting notice from Alice, Bob can send an electronic mail message to Carla asking her about the meeting.
- electronic mail is used herein interchangeably with the term “electronic mail message.”
- E-mails and other electronic communications can be “filtered” or selected, based on the electronic meeting notice.
- a computer application can have a button (virtual or literal) to filter a user's electronic communications, such as email, so as to show the user only the electronic communications with persons associated with the meeting.
- Carla can use a meeting filter to select the meeting about the That trip and then display only e-mails that are either to or from Alice and Bob.
- the identities of the other persons, Alice and Bob can be taken from the meeting notice and/or from other data stored about the other persons; e.g., Carla's contact information for Alice and Bob.
- Meeting-based filters for electronic communications can help in reviewing electronic communications relevant to a meeting to focus and prepare for the meeting.
- an invitee can generate his or her own electronic meeting notices. For example, suppose Rick and Scott have a telephone call where they arrange to have a meeting in a week's time. Rick can use a software application, such as an electronic calendar, to add a calendar entry with time and date information for the upcoming meeting, a location or telephone number to reach Scott, and any other information Rick wishes to keep about the meeting, such as a topic and/or associated document(s).
- Rick can send his calendar entry to Scott, so that both Rick and Scott can use the calendar entry as an electronic meeting notice.
- Scott can generate the calendar entry and send it to Rick for use as an electronic meeting notice.
- Rick can decide not to send his calendar entry to Scott, so that the calendar entry acts as an electronic meeting notice for Rick but not Scott.
- Electronic communications can be filtered based on one or more filtering rules.
- a more complex “closed loop” filter of electronic communications can be utilized as well.
- the e-mail can be considered to form a closed loop through the host and all invitees, Alice, Bob, and Carla.
- a technique to determine if a closed-loop filter is satisfied is to compare a meeting set including all participants of a meeting with an electronic-communications set including a sender and receivers of a given electronic communication. The closed-loop filter is satisfied for the given electronic communication and the meeting when the meeting set equals the electronic-communication set.
- the “More Trip Stuff” e-mail can be filtered out by the closed-loop filter.
- the closed loop filter can be used for e-mail that does not include up to N (N ⁇ 1) participants and/or also includes up to M (M ⁇ 1) non-participants.
- the filtering rules can include rules for showing materials in addition to, or instead of, electronic communications. Examples of these other materials include documents related to the meeting, contact information for the other person(s), search results for the other person(s), information from social networking sites, such as LinkedIn or Facebook, pertaining to the other person(s), and other kinds of information.
