Describe in detail
Fig. 2 is for according to the high-level block diagram of main electronic unit preferred embodiment, that be used for catching, manage and show the digital camera 102 of digital picture.Camera 102 comprises: programmable processor 201, it carries out control program 211 resident in internal random reference to storage 202, with the work of overall control camera components.Camera 102 also comprises: optic sensor array 203 is used for capture digital image; Display driver 204 and LCD display 205 are used for display image and out of Memory; Memory interface 206 is used for communicating by letter with storage medium 208; I/O device driver/controller 207 is used for various other components communicate with camera; And optional global location unit 215, be used for writing down the attribute of corresponding global location data as each captured images; All these is under the control of processor 201.One or the communications supported between the various electronic units of many communication buss 210.For clarity sake, in Fig. 2, bus 210 is expressed as single entity, but it actually can be multiple bus, bus interface and associated components.By the battery (not shown) is these various electronic unit power supplies.
Storage medium 208 can be for being used for storing any suitable storage medium of digital picture, for example semiconductor memory, tape, disk, optical memory or the like.Preferably but not necessarily, storage medium is for can remove medium.Medium 208 is mainly used to store the digital picture of being caught by optic sensor array 203; But it can storing additional information, especially relevant data with each respective image, and for example sequence number, the date and time of catching image, camera are provided with or the like.In a preferred embodiment, with respect to each image storage particular additional, as described herein.
I/O device driver controller 207 provides other camera components interface of (not necessarily showing in Fig. 2).These parts comprise those parts of processor 201 control, for example shutter, camera lens, mirror or the like, and processor 201 receives those parts of input, for example shutter actuator button, the perhaps button of other user-accessible and switch from it.Particularly, according to preferred embodiment, I/O device driver controller 207 detects the user's input from one group of rolling function load button 209, comprise to upward arrow, downwards arrow, left arrow, with arrow to the right, these are used for carrying out user's selection from menu or the like.In addition, generally also have at least one outside port, be used for sending the data to the digital device outside the camera, for example desktop computer 106 or personal digital assistant 107.
Memory 202 comprises control program 211, and control program 211 comprises many executable instructions of processor, the work of these instructions control camera when carrying out on processor 201.Preferably, memory 202 comprises the proper nonvolatile storage of at least a portion, does not promptly have can not be lost in data in this non-volatile part under the situation or other situation of power supply (no matter owing to battery failures, replacement) at memory.Preferably, control program 211 is stored in this part memory.Memory 202 can also comprise easy mistake or dynamic part, is used for storing nonce, counter or the like, perhaps is used for cushioning view data, and it depends on the existence of battery supply.According to this design, can utilize small-sized reserve battery, capacitor or other component protection easily to lose part and avoid data degradation.
Control program 211 is carried out general all the required conventional func of control camera 102 work.Control program receives the user's input from each source, and imports from the transducer of exposure meter, distance measuring sensor or the like.Utilize this input, control program control camera function, for example shutter, photoflash lamp, focal length, aperture or the like, as known in the art.Control program is also controlled miscellaneous function, for example downloads data to other digital device, camera parameter is set, deleted image or the like.Except that these conventional features, control program 211 also comprises: image marshalling function 212 is used for organizing into groups automatically image; And identifier determines function 213, is used for determining automatically the identifier image in the image sets.Below with the operation of description control program 211 in more detail, especially it is used for the function of display image, comprises the image that marshalling shows, and definite identifier image.
The attribute information 214 that control program 211 is safeguarded about the digital picture of being caught.Preferably, accompanying image is stored in attribute information in the medium 208, but when powering up for camera, preferably attribute information is written in the memory 202, and is used thereby it can be control program.Attribute information can comprise General Properties, for example, for each image, timestamp (for example catching the date and time of image), the camera setting when catching image, user's title specified or the like.In addition, attribute information can comprise the data that can be used for organizing into groups image automatically and select the identifier image of each group.According to preferred embodiment, this attribute information comprises for each image: (a) power up session phase identifier; (b) group identifier of user's appointment; (c) image accumulation viewing time; (d) zoom operations counting; And (e) the identifier sign selected of user.Replacedly, can in attribute data 214, store other or additional attribute, be used to organize into groups image or selection marker symbol image, for example the global location data that generate of global location unit 215.
Power up session phase identifier for sign uniquely power up the session phase (that is, single power up between operation and the corresponding power operation, time interval of powering up continuously of camera wherein) number and be used for being identified at the same image of catching during the session phase that powers up.Preferably, powering up by each camera just increases by a private counter value, obtains unique identifier; This counter should have the figure place of enough support camera bimetries, perhaps can for the less number that combines with for example date to produce unique session phase identifier that powers up.The group identifier of user's appointment is to distribute to the arbitrary number that the user indicates one group of image being organized into groups together; Preferably, the marshalling of user's appointment covers any automatic marshalling that camera carries out if present.The accumulated time that image accumulation viewing time record specific image has shown on the display 205 of camera and be used for automatic selection marker symbol image.Zoom operations counting is for the stored counts of the number of the zoom operations of having carried out when display image and also be used for automatic selection marker symbol.The identifier that the user selects is masked as the indication user, and to have specified specific image be the sign of identifier, and preferably, such user's indication covers any Automatic Logos symbol selection of camera when exist.
Though in memory 202, show certain number object program, function and other entity, should be appreciated that show these just for illustrative purposes and the actual number of this type of entity may change.In addition, resided in the memory 202 though the software part of Fig. 2 conceptually shows, some that should be appreciated that these parts also can be stored in other place, for example on medium 208 and be written into as required in the memory 202.
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, control program 211 carries out default marshalling to image automatically, selects the identifier of each group automatically and to user's display image.The user by along move up or down (in group, moving to another image) on the storehouse from an image or between storehouse, move (set up mobile, the identifier image that wherein always at first shows each group), pass through image to navigate based on the mode of storehouse.
Fig. 3 is the concept map based on the navigation of storehouse according to the image of the marshalling of preferred embodiment.Fig. 3
Camera 102 comprises rolling
function load button 209, and the user utilizes this rolling
function load button 209 to navigate.The user can navigate according to group or in group and pass through image.When according to the group navigation, the user watches each corresponding identifier image of group successively.That is, when the user utilized suitable rolling function load button (it is preferably to right arrow button) to select next image, next shown image was the identifier image of next group.Thus, by utilizing to next image of right arrow button Continuous Selection, the user only can see not identifier image on the same group and can skip the image of non-identifier in the group.This function allows the user more promptly to scan by the image in the storage, to find interested some image or exercise question.When the user found interested specific image group (it is by its identifier sign), the user can roll by the image in this group.Preferably, this finishes by pushing downward arrow button continuously.Image in the group unrolls to beginning, thereby when pushing downward arrow button after the image that has shown the storehouse bottom, shows to turn back to the identifier image.Similarly, each is organized oneself and unrolls to beginning, thereby when pushing to right arrow button after the image in having shown last group, shows to turn back to first group identifier image.To left arrow button and upwards arrow button respectively with to right arrow button with arrow button is reverse downwards.
Fig. 4 is for showing according to high-level flow preferred embodiment, that be used to control particular aspects camera 102 work, control program 211 work.In Fig. 4, omitted to understand the present invention not necessarily, some routine work of camera control program and accompanying drawing subsequently thereof, perhaps represent, so that illustrate clear with the form of simplifying very much.
With reference to Fig. 4, camera has multiple mode of operation, wherein two most important be image capture mode and display mode.The user selects appropriate operating mode, for example by one or more special pattern switch on the camera main-body, by option from shown menu or pass through alternate manner.When powering up, control program 211 initialization self load previous data of preserving as required to memory, distribute temporary variable, or the like (step 401).Particularly, the control program increase is used for identifying uniquely the session phase identifier that powers up the session phase.
If the user selects image to catch mode of operation (branch of step 402 ' is '), then control program is carried out and is caught all required appropriate functional (step 403) of one or more image.For example, generally start optic sensor array 203; On display 205, show the image that receives from optic sensor array, calculate the distance of object and amasthenic lens (if using self-focusing words) correspondingly, photometry and calculation exposure time/aperture, monitoring shutter release button and when detecting the user and pushed shutter is caught image.Carrying out the multiple function be used for catching one or more digital picture by control program is conventional in itself, no longer describes herein.But, except that with any General Properties data that each captive image is preserved (for example date stamp, camera are provided with or the like), preferably, control program is also preserved the current session phase identifier that powers up with each captive image, to be used for later image marshalling.The user can catch single image under image capture mode, perhaps a plurality of images and be withdrawn into step 407 when catching image when finishing.
If the user selects to show mode of operation (branch of step 404 ' is '), then control program shows one or more image of before having caught and the image of being stored on display 205.Image with display capture in Fig. 4 is being expressed as square frame 405 and is showing in greater detail in Fig. 5 on the high level.When the user had finished display image, control program was withdrawn into step 407.
If the user had not both selected image capture mode not select display mode yet, the branch that then carries out step 404 ' denys ' that control program is carried out other function (step 406) that is suitable for selected pattern.Other mode of operation can comprise (for example): the data downloading mode, and wherein the image of being stored or other data download to another digital device by cable or Radio Link; Menu mode, wherein the user can be from selection function the menu of display 205 demonstrations; Or the like.Usually, these other mode of operations and function are conventional in itself and are not described in detail herein.When the user finished suitable pattern, control program was withdrawn into step 407.
Step 407 expression pattern changes or outage.If user's preference pattern changes (branch of step 404 ' denys '), then control program changes pattern and turns back to step 402, is suitable for the function of the new pattern of selecting with execution.If the user selects outage, any volatile data of in nonvolatile storage or storage, preserve to need preserving and then with phase tester in power-down state (step 408).
Fig. 5 A and 5B (being referred to as Fig. 5 herein) for show in greater detail according to preferred embodiment, the work flow chart of (it briefly is shown as step 405 in Fig. 4) of display mode control program 211 down.With reference to Fig. 5, when entering display mode, control program calling graph picture marshalling function 212 is to be assigned to each respective image corresponding image sets.In Fig. 5, the distribution diagram picture briefly is expressed as square frame 501 and shows in greater detail in following Fig. 6 to group.Control program also calls identifier and determines function 213, with from the corresponding surely identifier of each image sets middle finger of determining step 501.In Fig. 5, specified sign symbol briefly is expressed as square frame 502 and in following Fig. 7, shows in greater detail.
Watch convention according to certain, the picture position in current group of control program 211 initialization and this group is to show initial pictures (step 503).Initial current group can be the image sets of obtaining recently, perhaps the oldest image sets, the image sets of perhaps watching recently, perhaps certain other convention.Initial position in the group is generally the identifier position, the primary importance in promptly organizing, but it can be certain other position (last image of for example watching).
Then, control program shows present images at display 205, that is, in it shows current group corresponding to the image (step 504) of the picture position of current selected.When display image, control program is provided with and shows that timer is to remain on the time span timing on the display to image.
Then, control program is waited for that the user imports and waiting for user's input and checking when the user imports timer and continue display image, is expressed as the circulation at step 505 and 506 places.Afterwards, the user imports timer with overtime at the viewing time (for example 1 minute, it can be at user option parameter) without any the abundant length of user input.If the user imports timer expired (branch of step 505 ' is '), suppose that then the user sees that no longer camera and control program advance to step 533, to upgrade the accumulation viewing time in the attribute data 214 and to withdraw from display mode.If received user's input before overtime, then the branch of execution in step 506 ' is '.
If the user who receives is input as the Scale command, then the branch of execution in step 507 ' is '.Then, control program increases the zoom operations counter (step 508) in the attribute data 214 relevant with the image that is showing.This program is according to circumstances by zoom in or out (step 509), and the user who carries out the zoom function of being asked and turn back to step 505 and 506 places imports circulation.
If the user who receives is input as the image-guidance order that is used for selecting another image (in the rolling function load button in the arrow button any one), then the branch of execution in step 510 ' is ' and control program processing navigation input, and its summary is shown as step 511-519.Stop to show timer and the time quantum that has shown according to image, increase the accumulation viewing time (step 511) of current display image in the attribute data 214.Recruitment can be show the total time of the process on the timer, but be preferably process deduct total time certain fixedly constant (for example 1 second) but be not less than zero.By deducting a little fixedly constant, can avoid accumulation viewing time when when navigating to other image, just passing through this image simply.
If the user who receives is input as to upward arrow rolling function load button (branch of step 512 ' is '), then reduce by current group of interior present image position (step 513).That is, the present image group is constant, and the position of still being somebody's turn to do in the group reduces one, and this can make camera show current group of interior previous image, promptly along make progress on the storehouse (when it turns back to step 504).If present image is identifier (storehouse top), then camera will unroll to storehouse bottom and show last image of this group.Then, control program advances to step 504 to show new present image.
If the user who receives is input as downward arrow rolling function load button (branch of step 514 ' is '), then increase current group of interior present image position (step 515).That is, the present image group is constant, and the position of still being somebody's turn to do in the group increases by one, and this can make camera show current group of interior next image, promptly along downward (when it turns back to step 504) on the storehouse.If present image is last image (storehouse bottom), then camera will unroll to the storehouse top and show the identifier image of this group.Then, control program advances to step 504 to show new present image.
If the user who receives is input as arrow rolling function load button (branch of step 516 ' is ') left, then with the current group of identifier position (step 518) of reducing by one (step 517) and current location being reset to place, storehouse top.This can make camera show identifier image (when it turns back to step 504) from last group.If current group is first group, then camera will unroll to last one group and show identifier from last group.Then, control program advances to step 504 to show new present image.
If the branch of execution in step 516 ' denys ' that then unique residue possibility is input as arrow rolling function load button to the right for the user who receives.In this case, with current group of identifier position (step 517) that increases by one (step 519) and current location is reset to place, storehouse top.This can make the identifier image (when it turn back to step 504) of camera demonstration from next group.If current group is last group, then camera will unroll to first group and show identifier from first group.Then, control program advances to step 504 to show new present image.
In preferred enforcement, the user can select to cover any marshalling or the identifier of being carried out automatically by control program and select, but replacedly, can not provide this function.In order to utilize this selection, the user manually specifies marshalling or identifier under display mode.Any appropriate combination by using enter key, at first navigate to the arbitrary image in the group of user's appointment and selecting and be used for the selection group function of selection group, manually organize into groups.If image not in the group of user's appointment, supposes then that it is first image of the group of new user's appointment.The user navigates to any arbitrary image and selection and adds group function (by using any appropriate combination of enter key) to then, and this makes this image be added to selected group.The user can be by this way adds the image of arbitrary number to selected group.The user is appointed as identifier function (by using any appropriate combination of enter key), the identifier of designated groups by navigating to identifier and selection.The user is deleted image from group in an identical manner, perhaps removes selected previous selected identifier.These functions summaries are expressed as step 520-530.
Referring again to Fig. 5, if the user navigates to image (camera shows this image) and the user imports selection group function, then the branch of execution in step 520 ' is '.If present image has been member's (non-null value indication in user's designated groups id field of the attribute data 214 of present image like that) of the group of user's appointment, then the branch of execution in step 521 ' is ' and user's designated groups of present image becomes selected organize (step 522).Then, control program turns back to the input of the circulation of step 505-506 with products for further.If at step 521 present image is not the member of the group of user's appointment, then distribute new user's designated groups identifier (step 523) and this newly to consist of selected group.By the user's designated groups id field in the renewal attribute data is the identifier of new group, adds present image to this new group (step 524).Then, control program calls definite function (step 527) of group and identifier appointed function (step 530), and with update group and identifier, it may change as the new result who organizes.Then, control program turns back to the idle cycles of step 505-506.
If group (perhaps removing) function is added in user's input to from group, then the branch of execution in step 525 ' is '.Then, by correspondingly upgrading the user's designated groups id field in the attribute data, add present image to selected group (perhaps from selected group, removing) (step 526).Then, control program calls group and determines function (step 527) and identifier appointed function (step 530), with update group and identifier, and the result that it may add as this/remove and the idle cycles of step 505-506 of having changed and turned back to.If before not selected group is then ignored the user to adding the selection of group to, perhaps produce error message to the user.
If identifier (perhaps remove and be appointed as identifier) function is appointed as in user's input, then the branch of execution in step 528 ' is '.Then, by correspondingly upgrading the identifier sign of the user's appointment in the attribute data, present image is appointed as identifier (perhaps remove and be appointed as identifier) (step 529).Then, control program calls group mark symbol appointed function (step 530), and with the updating mark symbol, it may be specified/remove the result of appointment and change and turned back to the idle cycles of step 505-506 as this.
If the branch of execution in step 528 ' denys ' that then the user has imported above some other selection of not discussing.This type of selection can be for selection change pattern or with phase tester in power-down state (branch by step 531 ' is ' indication), perhaps some other function.If the branch of execution in step 531 ' denys ' then to carry out the idle cycles that appropriate functional (step 532) and control program turn back to step 505-506.If the branch of execution in step 521 ' is ', then stop display counter and increase the accumulation viewing time (step 533) of image, as above described with respect to step 511.Then, control program is withdrawn into the step 407 of Fig. 4.
Fig. 6 be show in greater detail according to preferred embodiment, automatically the distribution diagram picture is to the flow chart of the process of respective sets (its summarize in Fig. 5 be expressed as step 501 or 527).Control program is considered each image successively and is determined suitable group (perhaps create new group) for this image.This distribution can be used any being recorded in the memory in the multiple conventional means, and for example each member of group covers the tabulation of next member's pointer by creating wherein, by place index or the like in array.
With reference to Fig. 6, control program is selected next image (step 601) from the sequential list (for example according to the order of catching image) of image.If selected image belongs to the group (as the indication of the non-null value among user's designated groups ID of attribute data) of user's appointment, then the branch of execution in step 602 ' is ' and this image is distributed to corresponding user's designated groups (step 603).
If selected image does not belong to the group of user's appointment, then select each group and marshalling function to determine whether this image meets suitable marshalling standard successively.As shown in Figure 6, to consider that then the branch of execution in step 604 ' is ' if also remain by any one group.Select next group (step 605) then.Then, the attribute data of selected digital image or one or more attribute of other data and selected group are compared, to determine whether selected digital image belongs to this group (step 606).If do not belong to, then the branch of execution in step 606 ' denys ' and control program turns back to step 604.If selected digital image belongs to this group, then the branch of execution in step 606 ' is ' and adds this image to this group (step 607).
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sole criterion that is used for step 606 place of definite group membership's identity (group of non-user's appointment) is a session phase identifier.The image that all images with same session phase identifier is grouped in together (group that the image of non-user's appointment belongs to user's appointment) and has a different sessions phase identifier is not grouped in together.Thus, use is to the simple test of group membership's identity.But, replacedly, can use member's identity test in the more complicated group.In this type of alternative a kind of (its do not have session phase identifier data can with situation under be particularly useful, but also useful in other cases) be: elapsed time between the catching of present image and the previous image that is right after, it is by relatively the timestamp of present image and the timestamp of previous image are indicated.If should enough lack in the time interval, can suppose that then these two images should be grouped in together.Following described in more detail, also can use the combination of various factors.Usually, in step 606, one or more attribute and the selected digital image of organizing compared, to determine whether adding selected digital image.In some cases, these attribute representation's mean values or the value that when adding the newcomer to this group, otherwise changes.Under the attribute situation that may change of group, when adding the newcomer at every turn, shown in the optional step among Fig. 6 609, profile (profile) that all should update group.
If all groups have all been compared with the current selected image and the satisfied standard that covers in any group of this image, then the branch of execution in step 604 ' denys ' and distributes new group, and wherein Xuan Ding image is its unique member (step 608).
If also residue has image to check, then the branch of execution in step 610 ' is ', to select next image in step 601.When such when having considered all images, the branch of execution in step 610 ' denys ' and finishes the marshalling function.
Fig. 7 be show in greater detail according to preferred embodiment, automatically from every group the image middle finger flow chart of the process of corresponding identifier (its among Fig. 5, summarize be expressed as step 502 or 530) surely.Control program is considered each group successively and is determined suitable identifier.Preferably, top or the beginning that the group mark symbol of considering is like this placed the group image list.
With reference to Fig. 7, control program was from before selecting next group (step 701) the group list by the distribution of marshalling function.The a pair of temporary variable of initialization, it is mascot (identifier) (being initialized to sky Null) and for value (merit) mmerit (being initialized to sky) (step 702) of identifier.
Then, control program is selected next image (step 703) in the selected group, i.e. specify image I.If image I is the identifier (by the identifier sign indication of attribute data) of user's appointment, then the branch of execution in step 704 ' is ', and temporary variable mascot is set to the value (step 708) of I then, thereby bypass is to any further search of identifier.
If selected digital image I is not the identifier of user's appointment, then the value score of computed image I (merit (I)) and with mmerit relatively (step 705).If merit (I) surpasses mmerit, then the branch of execution in step 705 ' is ' and mascot is set to I, and mmerit is set to merit (I) (step 706) simultaneously.The best identifier that run into so far when thus, these variablees are kept at the member of search by group.
In a preferred embodiment, from the interactive history of user and the camera image stored, derive and be worth score, particularly, this is worth score as the accumulation viewing time of this image of record in attribute data 214 function calculation counted of the convergent-divergent of this image, promptly
Merit (I)=C1* (accumulation viewing time)+C2* (convergent-divergent counting),
Wherein C1 and C2 are the coefficient of suitably selecting, and it can be by user program.Should be appreciated that and to use other or additional standard to come selection marker symbol image.
If also have any image to consider in group, then the branch of execution in step 707 ' is ' and selects next image in step 703.When such all images of having considered in the group, then the branch of execution in step 707 ' denys '.The value of mascot is the selected identifier of this group and suitably preserves this state (step 709) like this.In a preferred embodiment, place the top of storehouse or the head of group image list, write down the state of mascot effectively, thereby when selecting this group, at first show this identifier image by the identifier image that will select.
If also whether residue is the group of its specified sign symbol, then the branch of execution in step 710 ' is ' and selects next group in step 701.Considered all whens group when such, the branch of execution in step 710 ' deny ' and complement mark accords with appointed function.
In a preferred embodiment, mainly power up/cut off the power supply session phase automatic marshalling image and mainly count the selection marker symbol according to accumulation viewing time and zoom operations according to camera.These are the very basic standards that are used for organizing into groups image and selection marker symbol, and it can utilize memory very limited in the camera and disposal ability to realize.But, should be appreciated that, according to the present invention, replacedly, can use other more complicated technology organize into groups image and selection marker symbol.Below be some example of this type of replacement, should be appreciated that these are example, but not the exhaustive list that possible replacement realizes.
Can utilize color analysis or graphical analysis to come token image and or use the result of this alanysis that similar image is grouped in combination individually or with other marshalling standard.For example, can will show that similar color mode and the image of locating to catch in the approximate identical time (stab according to the date of image or same session phase or at a time in the interbody spacer) are grouped in together, although and show few of color similarity image its approximate identical time place take (and image of taking for basic different time place similarly) and can not be grouped in together.Also global positioning system and/or direction indicator (for example compass) can be placed the global coordinates of camera and record camera when photographic images and/or direction as adeditive attribute to be used to organize into groups image.Also can use other or additional standard to come selection marker symbol image; For example, if camera amplifies when catching image, then this may indicate preferably be thought of as identifier than important images.
Can also organize into groups image automatically according in a plurality of different replacement standards any one, these standards are that the user can select.For example, the user can select in following option: by marshalling a few days ago, wherein all images of taking in same date is grouped in together; Perhaps by the identifier marshalling of session phase, wherein all images of taking during the same session phase is grouped in together; Perhaps organize into groups according to the combination of some other factors or factor.This type of user does not need change to the bottom attribute data to the selection of marshalling, and therefore identical attribute data can be supported multiple different marshalling.This user selects and can carry out when display image, and perhaps some after having caught image carried out At All Other Times and can be changed every now and then by the user, thereby can be according to user's hope, at different same group of images of asynchronism(-nization) ground marshalling.Select in response to this type of user, camera will be checked each attributes of images data and organize into groups image according to the standard of appointment.
More than describe and in Fig. 3, conceptually shown and specific image navigation method still be noted that according to the present invention to have the air navigation aid of various replacements.In general sense, digital device (or a plurality of equipment) is organized into groups image automatically and the navigation selection of at least two kinds of replacements is provided to the user.In first navigation selection, skip some image, promptly this equipment shows at least one image from each group, but at least for some group, does not show all images in this group.In second navigation selection, show consecutive image, thereby can watch all images in the group.Each of these selections can be different from herein in some aspects describes the ground realization as preferred embodiment.For example, if first select to show a N image of each group continuously and the individual image more than N is arranged, then jump to next group in arbitrary group.Replacedly, different with the identifier that always shows next group, first selects to jump to the locational image of current stack.For example, when watching the 3rd image of storehouse N, selected first selects can make it to show the 3rd image of storehouse (N+1).Similarly, when in the storehouse bottom, second navigation selection can make equipment be rolled to next group; That is, in this alternative, selected second first image of selecting will make it to show next group when last image of demonstration group.Has other variation.
In a preferred embodiment, one or more numerical data is distributed to image group automatically and is each group selection identifier automatically.At that time, replacedly, can manually carry out one of these steps.For example, equipment can be distributed to group with image automatically, imports selection marker symbol (perhaps first image of selection group always as a token of accords with) but rely on the user.Replacedly, this equipment can rely on the user and import definitions section, but according to user interaction history or other factors selection marker symbol automatically.
Usually, carry out the routine (in camera 102 or in some other digital data processor spare, realizing) that realizes illustrated embodiment of the present invention and be called as program or control program as the part of operating system or specific application, program, object, module or command sequence no matter be.Program generally comprises to give an order, this instruction makes these equipment or system carry out the required step of element of execution in step or generation realization each side of the present invention when being read and being carried out by one or more processor in equipment according to the present invention or the system.In addition, and after this though will describe the present invention under the situation of camera apparatus completely in function, but various embodiment of the present invention can be distributed as various forms of program products and the present invention is suitable equally, and no matter be used for the particular type of signal bearing medium of actual this distribution of execution.The example of signal bearing medium include but not limited to volatile and non-volatile memory equipment, floppy disk, hard disk drive, CD-ROM, DVD, tape, or the like.In addition, the present invention is suitable for any type of signal bearing medium, and no matter whether data by transmitting network is exchanged for (comprising wireless network) another kind of form from a kind of signal bearing medium of form signal bearing medium.The example of shows signal bearing medium is memory 202 and medium 208 in Fig. 2.
Though disclose specific embodiment of the present invention and specific alternative, those skilled in the art should understand that: can carry out other variation of form and details within the scope of the claims.
