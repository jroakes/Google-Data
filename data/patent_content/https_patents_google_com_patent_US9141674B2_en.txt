- FIG. 4 is a diagram of example functional components 400 relating to prominence detection and presentation of search results.
- Functional components 400 may be implemented by a server, such as search server 210 .
- functional components 400 may determine whether a search query is a search query for which one or more results should be prominently presented, and, when the search query is one for which results should be prominently presented, format a document to prominently present one or more of the results relative to other ones of the results.
- functional components 400 may include a search component 410 , a prominence detection component 420 , and a search formatting component 430 .
- Search component 410 may receive a search query from a client 205 .
- the search query may be a query for a book.
- Search component 410 may use the search query to identify a set of references to books relevant to the search query. For example, search component 410 may analyze search terms, of the search query, against terms in an index to identify books, or references to books ( 412 ), that include or are associated with those search terms. For each identified book, search component 410 may generate a relevance score ( 414 ), which reflects a measure of relevance of the identified book to the search query.
- determining the relevance score of a document e.g., a book or descriptive information corresponding to a book
- a search query such as a matching of terms of the search query to the content of the document.
- Another possible factor that may be used in determining relevance scores may include geographic information. For example, a particular book may be particularly relevant to, or have a high sales volume in, a particular geographic region. In this case, the relevance score of the book may be increased if the client that submitted the search query is from the particular geographic region.
- the index or relevance determining technique used by search component 410 may be derived from or based on a number of sources of information. For example, information relating to books, such as book titles, the authors of books, descriptive information relating to the books (e.g., a synopsis of the book), genre or other category information, or other information relating to books, may be used by search component 410 to match book search queries to relevant books.
- information relating to books such as book titles, the authors of books, descriptive information relating to the books (e.g., a synopsis of the book), genre or other category information, or other information relating to books.
- Search component 410 may additionally use book quality information, which is independent of a search query, as part of the relevance score.
- Book quality information may include, for example, a value or values relating to the authoritativeness or legitimacy of books, and may be referred to as a quality score for a book.
- the quality score for a book may be determined independently of the relevance of the book to a particular search query.
- the quality score, for a book may be used as a factor in determining the final relevance score, for the book, to the search query.
- books published by large or well-known publishing companies may be deemed to have higher book quality scores than books published by lesser-known publishing companies.
- books that are on best selling lists, books that are associated with reviews by known reviewers, books that are written by prolific or well known authors, or books that have had high sales may be given a higher quality score relative to books that are not on best selling lists, that are not associated with reviews by known reviewers, that are written by lesser known authors, or that have lower sales volumes, respectively.
- other factors may additionally, or alternatively, be used to determine the quality scores.
- the sales data, or other data for a book may be filtered based on a time window. For instance, older sales data may be deemphasized relative to newer sales data, the sales data may only be used over a particular time period, such as an X-year window (X ⁇ 1), etc.
- library holding or circulation information may be used to determine the quality scores, where books that are more commonly available in libraries may be assigned a higher quality score than books that are less commonly available.
- publication date or the number of published editions of a book may be used as a factor in determining the quality score of the book.
- Some books may include multiple published editions of the book.
- the quality score for the book such as the most recent edition of the book, may take into account, or may be based on an aggregation of, the quality scores corresponding to multiple editions of the book.
- the quality score for a book may be determined on a per-edition basis.
- the quality score for a book may be processed based on a per-edition or per-title basis.
- the book access information may include information regarding the number of times that a book is accessed or selected from a set of search results and/or the amount of time that users spend accessing the book. For example, books that were accessed or browsed more often or that users spent more time accessing may be given a higher quality score than books that were accessed less often or that users spent less time accessing.
- Another possible factor may include link-based scores of related books or documents.
- a related document may include an associated publishers' web page or web site.
- the publisher or author associated with a book may be identified and a web page or web site (or set of web pages or web sites) associated with the publisher/author may be located.
- the link-based score of the web page(s) or web site(s) associated with the publisher/author may then be used to influence the quality score of the book.
- Prominence detection component 420 may receive the references to the books 412 and the corresponding relevance scores 414 determined by search component 410 . Based on this information, prominence detection component 420 may determine whether one or more of the books, corresponding to the references to books 412 , should be prominently presented in search results provided to client 205 . A number of techniques may be used by prominence detection component 420 in determining whether to prominently present a particular book.
- prominence detection component 420 may identify the most relevant book (i.e., the book associated with the highest relevance score of relevance scores 414 ) and the second most relevant book (i.e., the book associated with the second highest relevance score of relevance scores 414 ). These two relevance scores may be compared and the most relevant book may be identified for prominent display when the relevance score of the most relevant book is significantly greater than the relevance score of the second most relevant book. For example, the ratio of the relevance scores of the first most relevant book and the second most relevant book may be calculated, and a determination to prominently display the first most relevant book may be made when the ratio is greater than a particular threshold (e.g., 10). The particular threshold may be determined through, for example, empirical observation of a number of example search queries.
- a particular threshold e.g. 10
- the difference between the relevance scores of the first and second most relevant books may be calculated.
- the determination of whether to prominently display the first most relevant book may then be made when the difference is greater than a particular threshold.
- Other techniques could alternatively be used to make the determination of whether to prominently display the first most relevant book.
- the determination of whether to prominently display the first most relevant book may be based on the goal of determining whether the user has submitted a query that targets a specific book.
- Search formatting component 430 may receive the references to the relevant books 412 and relevance scores 414 . Search formatting component 430 may also receive an indication of whether prominence detection component 420 determined that one or more of the books should be prominently displayed. Search formatting component 430 may generate a search results document, such as a hyper-text markup language (HTML) document, that includes the results of the book search query. The search results document may be formatted differently based on whether a book was determined to be presented prominently. For instance, the first most relevant book may be prominently presented by increasing the visual area (relative to the visual area when no book is to be prominently presented) devoted to the first most relevant book and/or by including one or more messages in the visual area devoted to the first most relevant book.
- HTML hyper-text markup language
- FIG. 4 shows an example of functional components 400

- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process 500 for prominently presenting selected results of book search queries.
- Process 500 may be performed by, for example, search server 210 .
- Process 500 may include receiving a book search query (block 510 ).
- a user of a client 205 may desire to search for a book while accessing, browsing, or visiting a book store, such as an online book store implemented by server 220 .
- a book search query received directly from a client 205 and a book search query received from server 220 , on behalf of client 205 will be equivalently discussed as a book search query received from a client 205 .
- Process 500 may further include identifying a set of books (or references to books), relevant to the search query (block 520 ). Relevance scores corresponding to the set of books may also be identified (block 520 ). For instance, search component 410 may calculate, or otherwise determine, based on the search query, relevance scores associated with a number of books. Search component 410 may then identify a set of references to a certain quantity of relevant books (e.g., references to the 100 books most relevant to the search query).
- Process 500 may further include determining whether the highest ranked book is more relevant, by at least a threshold value, than the second highest ranked book (block 530 ). As previously discussed, this determination may be made by prominence detection component 420 and may be based on a comparison of the ratio, or the difference, of the relevance scores of the first and second highest ranking book, to a threshold value.
- process 500 may include transmitting search results, to client 205 , in which descriptive information for the highest ranked book is prominently presented relative to descriptive information for other books in a search results document that conveys the search results (block 540 ).
- a number of techniques can be used to prominently present the descriptive information for the highest ranked book.
- an image representing the book may be enlarged relative to images representing the other books, the location of the descriptive information for the highest ranked book may be set apart from the descriptive information for other books, a different color or font may be used in the description of the book relative to the other books, a custom message may be presented, an animation may be associated with the highest ranked book, etc.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an example search results document 600 that may present the results of a book search query, such as book search results transmitted in block 540 .
- the search query is the query “The Murder Book”
- prominence detection component 420 determines that the book “The Murder Book,” by Jonathan Kellerman, is the most relevant book and furthermore, that this book is likely to be the particular book being sought by the user (i.e., it is determined to be the highest ranked book and should be prominently presented).
- search results document 600 may present the book search results in a grid structure in which rows of the grid structure each include descriptive snippets for one or more books.
- the first row, row 610 may be entirely devoted to the most relevant book (“The Murder Book”).
- row 610 may include an image 615 for the book, such as a thumbnail image of the book's cover, the title of the book 620 , information identifying the author of the book, a rating 625 of the book, a brief description 630 of the book, and a graphical box 635 including the price of the book and links 640 to buy the book or view a sample of the book. Selecting the link to buy the book may, for example, initiate an interaction through which the user may purchase the book.
- structures other than a grid structure such as a list, may be used to present the search results.
- the second row, row 650 may include descriptive snippets for a number of books.
- Each descriptive snippet may include, as shown, a thumbnail image of the book's cover, the title of the book, the book's author, and the price of the book.
- Each descriptive snippet in row 650 is visually smaller and less prominently displayed than the descriptive snippet of the book shown in row 610 .
- each descriptive snippet in row 650 may present less information than the descriptive snippet in row 610 (e.g., a shorter description, no links 640 to directly buy the book or view a sample of the book, etc.).
- process 500 may include transmitting search results to client 205 using a normal presentation of relevant books in which the highest ranked book may be presented first but may not otherwise be visually distinguished (block 550 ).
- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating an example search results document 700 that may present the results of a book search query, such as book search results transmitted in block 550 .
- the search query is the query “science fiction books” and that no single book was determined by prominence detection component 420 to be relevant enough to be prominently presented.
- search results document 700 may present the book search results in a grid structure in which rows of the grid structure each include descriptive snippets for one or more books.
- the first row, row 710 may include descriptive snippets for a number of books.
- Each descriptive snippet may include, as shown, a thumbnail image of the book's cover, the title of the book, information identifying the book's author, and the price of the book.
- the second row, row 720 may similarly include a number of descriptive snippets.
- Each descriptive snippet in rows 710 and 720 may generally be of equal visual prominence.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram of example functional components 800 relating to prominence detection and presentation of search results.
- Functional components 800 may be implemented by a server, such as search server 210 .
- functional components 800 may determine whether a book search query is a search query for which the results should include an indication that the intended book is not available (e.g., not available for purchase or downloading in an online book store). The indication of the intended book, and the fact that the book is not currently available may be prominently presented to the user.
- functional components 800 may include a search component 810 , an availability detection component 820 , and a search formatting component 830 .
- Search component 810 may receive a search query from a client 205 .
- the search query may be a query associated with a search for a book.
- Search component 810 may generally be implemented similarly to search component 410 , except search component 810 may generate references to books corresponding to books that are relevant to the search query and available for download and/or purchase, and books that are relevant to the search query but are not available for download and/or purchase.
- the information relating to the available and unavailable books may be stored as two separate instances or indexes or stored as a single instance or index with a marker indicating whether each book is available or unavailable.
- Search component 810 may use the search query to identify a set of references to available books relevant to the search query and a set of references to non-available books relevant to the search query. For example, search component 810 may analyze search terms, of the search query, against terms in an index to identify books, or references to books ( 812 ), that are available and that include or are associated with those search terms. For each identified book 812 , search component 810 may generate a relevance score ( 814 ), which reflects a measure of relevance of the identified book to the search query. Search component 810 may also identify books, or references to books ( 816 ), that are not available (non-available) and that include or are associated with those search terms.
- search component 810 may generate a relevance score ( 818 ), which reflects a measure of relevance of the identified, non-available book to the search query.
- a relevance score 818
- the index or relevance determining technique used by search component 810 may be derived from or based on a number of sources of information, such as the sources of information described with respect to search component 410 .
- sources of information such as the sources of information described with respect to search component 410 .
- information relating to books such as book titles, the authors of books, descriptive information relating to the books (e.g., a synopsis of the book), genre or other category information, or other information relating to books may be used by search component 810 to match book search queries to relevant books. This information may be received for both available and non-available books.
- Search component 810 may additionally use book quality information (for both available and non-available books) when matching book search queries to relevant books.
- book quality information may include, for example, a value or values relating to the authoritativeness or legitimacy of books.
- the references to non-available books 816 and relevance scores 818 may include a single reference to the most relevant non-available book and the corresponding relevance score of the most relevant non-available book. In some implementations, the references to non-available books 816 and relevance scores 818 may include multiple references, corresponding to multiple books.
- Availability detection component 820 may receive the references to the books ( 812 and 816 ) and the corresponding relevance scores ( 814 and 818 ) determined by search component 810 . Based on this information, availability detection component 820 may determine whether the most relevant non-available book is the book that is being sought by the user.
- availability detection component 820 may compare the relevance score of the most relevant available book and the relevance score of the most relevant non-available book when determining whether the most relevant non-available book is the book that is being sought by the user. For example, the ratio of the relevance scores of the most relevant available block and the most relevant non-available book may be calculated, and the determination made when the ratio is less than a particular threshold (e.g., 10). The particular threshold may be determined through, for example, empirical observation of a number of example search queries. In some implementations, instead of calculating the ratio of the relevance scores, the difference between the relevance scores of the most relevant non-available book and the most relevant available book may be calculated and compared to a threshold.
- a particular threshold e.g. 10
- availability detection component 820 may issue a trigger ( 825 ) indicating that the most relevant non-available book is the book that is, with a particular degree of certainty, being sought by the user.
- Search formatting component 830 may receive the references to the relevant books 812 and relevance scores 814 . Search formatting component 830 may also receive an indication of whether availability detection component 820 determined that the most relevant non-available book is the book that, with a particular degree of certainty, is being sought by the user. Search formatting component 830 may generate a search results document, such as a HTML document that includes the results of the book search query. The search results document may be formatted differently based on whether the most relevant non-available book is being sought by the user. For instance, when the most relevant non-available book is determined to be the book that is sought by the user, the most relevant non-available book may be prominently displayed with a message indicating that the book is not currently available in the book store. Otherwise, non-available books may not be presented to the user in the search results.

- the identified book may be a book that is not available for purchase or download from the online book store.
- a relevance score corresponding to the book may also be obtained (block 930 ).
- the identified non-available book may be the highest ranked non-available book.
- Process 900 may further include determining whether the highest ranked available book is less relevant, by at least a threshold value, than the identified unavailable book (block 940 ). As previously discussed, this determination may be made by availability detection component 820 and may be based on a comparison of the ratio, or the difference, of the relevance scores of the highest ranking available book and the identified non-available book, to a threshold value.
- process 900 may include transmitting search results, to client 205 , in which the identified non-available book is included (block 950 ).
- the identified non-available book may be prominently presented relative to the available books.
- process 900 may include transmitting search results to client 205 in which the identified non-available book is not included (e.g., a “normal” presentation of search results) (block 960 ).
- the available books may, for instance, be provided to client 205 in which descriptive snippets are arranged in a grid structure (or other structure) for the available books, such as is shown in search results document 700 ( FIG. 7 ).

- search results document 1000 may present the book search results in a grid structure in which rows of the grid structure each include descriptive snippets to one or more books.
- the first row, row 1010 may be entirely devoted to the most relevant, but non-available, book (“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”).
- row 1010 may include an image 1015 for the book, such as a thumbnail image of the book's cover, name of the author, date of the book, number of pages in the book, the title of the book 1020 , a brief description 1030 of the book, and a graphical box 1040 informing the client that the particular book is not available.
- the second row, row 1050 may include descriptive snippets for a number of books that are available. Each descriptive snippet may include, as shown, a thumbnail image of the book's cover, information identifying the title of the book, the book's author, and the price of the book. Additionally, each descriptive snippet in row 1050 may present less information than the descriptive snippet in row 1010 (e.g., a shorter description, no links 640 to directly buy the book or view a sample of the book, etc.).
- FIG. 11 is a flow chart of an example process 1100 for presenting selected search results.
- Process 1100 may be performed by search server 210 .
- Process 1100 may generally represent a combination of the processes discussed with respect to processes 500 and 900 .

- Process 1100 may include determining whether the highest ranked available book is less relevant, by at least a first threshold value, than the non-available book (block 1110 ). When the highest ranked available book is determined to be less relevant, by at least the first threshold value, than the non-available book (block 1110 —YES), search results may be transmitted, to client 205 , in which the unavailable book is identified (block 1120 ). The search results may be presented in a search results document similar to search results document 1000 .
- process 1100 may include determining whether the highest ranking available book is more relevant, by at least a second threshold value, than the second highest ranking available book (block 1130 ).

The search results, corresponding to block 1140 , may be presented in a search results document similar to search results document 600 .
- process 1100 may include transmitting book search results, to client 205 , using a normal presentation of the available books (block 1150 ).
- the search results, corresponding to block 1150 may be presented in a search results document similar to search results document 700 .
