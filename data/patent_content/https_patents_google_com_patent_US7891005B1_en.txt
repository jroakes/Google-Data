Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to online security, and more particularly, to verification of interaction with a human being via rotated images.
- Human interaction proofs have been deployed to combat such abuse. Human interaction proofs are used to verify that the user is a human being before granting the user access.
- a CAPTCHA (“completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart”) is an example of a human interaction proof.
- a commonly deployed CAPTCHA is one that asks the user to identify or recognize text characters in an image, where the text characters are visually obscured or distorted.
- much progress has been made in the development of algorithms and programs that can solve such text identification or character recognition CAPTCHAs. As a result, the deterrence effect of such CAPTCHAs has been weakened.
- a computer-implemented method of restricting access includes receiving an access request and, in response to the access request, generating a challenge that includes a plurality of images and a question concerning orientations of the plurality of images. The method also includes transmitting the challenge for display, receiving a response to the question, and granting the access request if the response correctly answers the question.
- a computer-implemented method includes selecting a candidate image from an unscreened image repository, performing an image orientation detection test on the candidate image, and if the candidate image passes the test, including the candidate image in a plurality of challenges. The method also includes logging numbers of correct and incorrect identifications of the candidate image in responses to the plurality of challenges, and if the numbers of correct and incorrect identifications for the candidate image satisfy predefined criteria, adding the candidate image to a screened image repository.
- a system includes memory, one or more processors, and one or more modules stored in the memory and configured execution by the one or more processors.
- the one or more modules include instructions to receive a request to access the system; instructions to, in response to the request, generate a challenge that includes a plurality of images and a question concerning orientations of the plurality of images; instructions to transmit for display the challenge; instructions to receive a response to the question; and instructions to grant the request if the response correctly answers the question.
- a computer program product for use in conjunction with a computer system includes a computer program mechanism.
- the computer program mechanism includes instructions for performing the steps of receiving an access request; in response to the access request, generating a challenge that includes a plurality of images and a question concerning orientations of the plurality of images; transmitting for display the challenge; receiving a response to the question; and granting the access request if the response correctly answers the question.

- a human interaction proof (HIP) based on image orientation detection involves displaying a plurality of images, some of which have been rotated away from their “upright” orientations.
- a user attempting to open an account or to otherwise access a service at a computer system may be asked to solve such a HIP by answering a question concerning the orientations of the images, such as identifying which of the images are not “upright.”
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a computer network in accordance with some embodiments.
- the computer network 100 includes one or more clients 102 and a computer system 104 , and a network 106 interconnecting these components.
- the network 106 may include, without limitation, local-area networks (LAN), wide-area networks (WAN), wireless networks, and the Internet.
- the computer system 104 provides services to users 108 of clients 102 .
- Such services may include email, message boards or forums, online surveys or polls, and weblogs (blogs).
- Some of these services may require that the user open an account with the computer system 104 or the service.
- accounts are often required for email and weblog services, so that the user's email messages and weblog posts may be associated with the user.
- the interface to the services is a Web-based interface, using pages written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and perhaps other languages.
- the Web-based interface may be accessed via a client application such as a web browser.
- the computer system 104 may include one or more servers.
- the servers may perform a variety of functions, including provision of the services and managing accounts and access to the services.
- the clients 102 are devices from which a user may access services on the computer system 104 .
- the client 102 may be any device capable of communicating with other computers, devices, and so forth through the network 106 .
- client devices may include, without limitation, desktop computers, notebook (or laptop) computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, network terminals, and so forth.
- the client device includes one or more applications for communicating with other computers or devices through the network 106 . Examples of such applications include, without limitation, web browsers, email applications, and instant messaging or chat applications.
- Each client 102 may be operated by a user 108 . That is, the user 108 may activate or deactivate programs or operations, including communications with the computer system 104 , on the client 102 .
- the user 108 may be a human being or automated computer program (e.g., an automated script or a bot).
- a computer program acting as the user can access and use the same services that the human user can access and use, but often at a faster rate.
- a computer program acting as the user may also run on other computers or devices connected to the network 106 and communicate with the computer system 104 .
- bots may be deployed to automatically open email accounts and send many email messages, particularly spam.
- a bot may be deployed to access an online poll and engage in ballot stuffing.
- a human interaction proof is a class of techniques for verifying that the user is an actual human being rather than a computer program.
- a human interaction proof typically involves presenting a challenge to the user and the user providing a response to the challenge. If the user provides a correct response, the user is allowed access. If the user provides an incorrect response, the user is denied access.
- the challenges are chosen such that they are relatively easy for humans to solve but are difficult for computers.
- a well-known example of a human interaction proof is a CAPTCHA (completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart). Information regarding use of human interaction proofs and CAPTCHAs is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for verifying human interaction in accordance with some embodiments.
- Process flow 200 describes a process for verifying that a user 108 is a human being rather than a computer program and restricting access to services by computer programs.
- An access request is received by a computer system 104 ( 202 ).
- an access request refers to any request to access a computer system 104 , to access or use a service provided by a computer system 104 , or opening an account for access or use of the computer system or services provided by such.
- Examples of access requests include an attempt to open an account, an attempt to login to a computer system or a service, or an attempt to send an email message or post a message to a forum.
- the access request may be sent from a client 102 or some other computer or device.
- the sending of the access request may be initiated by a human user or a computer program (e.g., a script or a bot) acting as a user.
- a challenge is generated in response to the access request ( 204 ).
- the challenge is part of a human interaction proof for verifying that the user initiating the access request is a human being and not a computer program.
- the challenge is a problem involving detection of image orientation, further details of which are described below.
- the challenge is transmitted to the client (or other computer or device) from which the user initiated the access request, for display or presentation to the user ( 206 ).
- the challenge includes a plurality of images, some of which are not “upright.”
- the images are displayed at specified dimensions (e.g., 160 by 160 pixels). If an image is larger than the specified dimensions, it may be resealed to the specified dimensions for display.
- the challenge as displayed includes a question to the user concerning the orientations of the plurality of images.
- the question asks the user to identify the images that are not “upright.”
- the question asks the user to identify the images that are “upright.”
- the user formulates the response and initiates transmission of that response to the computer system 104 .
- the challenge generation and transmission may occur at different rates for different types of access requests.
- the challenge generation may always occur in response to an account opening attempt, but occur at specified or determined probabilities or rates in response to other types of access requests, such as an attempt to send an email message.
- the probability or rate may be based on any combination of a variety of factors, such as number of access requests or attempts by a user within a time interval, whether past emails sent by the user have indicia of spam, and so forth.
- the response to the challenge is received by the computer system 104 ( 208 ).
- the response includes the answer of the user to the question concerning the orientations of the images. If the response to the challenge is correct ( 210 —yes), the access request is granted or accepted ( 212 ). Otherwise ( 210 —no), the access request is denied ( 214 ). If the request is denied and the user repeats the attempt, the user may be presented with more challenges until the user stops making the access requests or responds correctly to a challenge.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for generating a human interaction proof involving rotated images, in accordance with some embodiments. As described above, in block 204 a challenge involving orientations of a plurality of images is generated. FIG. 3 illustrates in further detail a process for generating a challenge.
- a predefined number of images for a challenge are selected from one or more image repositories ( 302 ).
- 10 images are selected.
- more or less images may be selected.
- the images may be selected randomly or pseudo-randomly.
- the image repositories may include an image database.
- the Internet particularly the World Wide Web, may also be considered as an image repository from which images may be selected, as there are a vast number of images that are available on the Internet.
- the collection of Internet-accessible images may be indexed by an image search engine.
- images may be generated by the computer system 104 for use in the challenge.
- the plurality of images may include both generated images and images from image repositories.
- images may be generated for use in the challenge.
- the types of images that may be generated include image types that are known in the current or future state of the art as difficult for computers to detect orientation.
- An example of a type of image that is difficult, with respect to the current state of the art, for computers to detect orientation is cartoon images.
- the types of images that may be generated for use in the challenge may vary as the state of the art in the field of automatic image orientation detection develops further.
- the images that are candidates for inclusion in a challenge are inputted into an automated image orientation analyzer for testing.
- the automated image orientation analyzer may be one that implements automatic image orientation detection techniques that are now known or later developed.
- the automated image orientation analyzer implements one or more automatic image orientation detection techniques that are the best available.
- the automated image orientation analyzer attempts to detect the orientation of the candidate images and rotations thereof.
- Candidate images for which the analyzer can detect orientations with high degrees of accuracy and at high confidence levels are rejected from inclusion in the challenge.
- candidate images for which the correct orientation is detected with high accuracy and at a high confidence level may be saved from rejection and selected for inclusion in a challenge if modified with respect to lighting, color, etc., further details of which are described below.
- candidate images for which the analyzer has difficulty detecting orientations may be selected for inclusion in the challenge.
- the analyzer test acts as a filter for eliminating from inclusion in challenges candidate images that may be easy for computers.
- the screened image repository includes a seed set of images that have been tested with both actual human testers and with an automatic image orientation analyzer.
- the screened image repository may be further populated with images drawn from repositories of unscreened image such as an image database or the Internet.
- unscreened means that the image has not been tested by human testers or included in actual challenges for identification by users on a probational basis. The tests and probational inclusion in challenges help eliminate candidate images that are relatively difficult for humans with respect to orientation detection.
- Images may be selected for inclusion in a challenge from both the screened image repository and, on a probational basis, from the unscreened image repository. That is, a challenge may include images from both screened image and unscreened image repositories.
- process flow 700 describes a process for selecting an image from an unscreened image repository, including that image in challenges, and possibly adding that image to the screened image repository.
- a candidate image is selected from an unscreened image repository ( 702 ). As described above with respect to block 302 ( FIG. 3 ), an image may be selected randomly or pseudo-randomly.
- the candidate image is tested with an automatic image orientation analyzer ( 704 ), as described above. If the candidate image does not pass the analyzer test ( 706 —no), the candidate image is rejected ( 708 ). If the candidate image passes the analyzer test ( 706 —yes), the candidate image may be included in challenges ( 710 ).
- the candidate image “passes” the analyzer test if the analyzer incorrectly identifies the orientation of the image or the analyzer correctly identifies the orientation of the image but at a confidence level that is below a threshold.
- the threshold confidence level may be predefined. In some embodiments, the threshold confidence level is 20%; the “passing” confidence level is 20% or lower.
- a candidate image may be analyzed by multiple orientation detection analyzers and the candidate image “passes” if a predefined number (an absolute number or a percentage) of the analyzers correctly identifies the orientation of the candidate image.
- the candidate images selected from the unscreened image repository may be tested by a plurality of different automatic image orientation analyzers.
- a candidate image may be accepted or rejected based on the number or percentage of orientation analyzers that successfully identify the orientation of the image. For example, a candidate image may be rejected if 20% or more of the analyzers successfully identify the orientation of the image.
- the candidate image is included in challenges, statistics regarding the number of correct and incorrect identifications may be collected for the candidate image.
- that image may be added to the screened image repository.
- predefined criteria may be that the image is correctly identified by users 100 times without any intervening incorrect identification.
- Another example of the predefined criteria may be that the candidate image has at least a 95% correct identification rate based on at least 500 challenges in which the candidate image is included. More generally, if the candidate image has been included in a sufficiently large sample size of challenges ( 712 —yes), the correct identification rate is considered. If the correct identification rate exceeds a predefined threshold ( 714 —yes), the candidate image is added to the screened image repository ( 716 ).
- the candidate image is rejected.
- a candidate image may be selected from an unscreened image repository for inclusion in challenges. If the candidate image passes an initial test (the automatic image orientation analyzer fails to detect orientation correctly with a threshold level of certainty), then the image is included in challenges on a probational basis. If the correct identification rate of the image by users exceeds a threshold, suggesting that humans have relatively little difficulty detecting the orientation of the image, then the candidate image may be added to the screened image repository and it is no longer on probation status. Otherwise, the candidate image may be rejected.
- the candidate image may be added to the screened image repository and it is no longer on probation status. Otherwise, the candidate image may be rejected.
- the orientations of a subset of the images to be included in the challenge are modified ( 304 ). That is, a subset of the plurality of images is selected and the images in the selected subset are rotated away from their upright orientations.
- an “upright” image means that the image is in its proper orientation.
- the proper orientation is the orientation of the image as it appeared in the image repository, i.e. the original orientation.
- the proper orientation may be based on other criteria. For example, the proper orientation may be whatever orientation conforms best to common sense.
- An image in the subset may be rotated away from the proper orientation by any angle between 0° and 360°, non-inclusive.
- an image in the subset may be rotated by 90°, 180°, or 270°.
- the images that are to be rotated are randomly or pseudo-randomly selected from amongst the plurality of images.
- additional modifications may be applied to the images ( 306 ).
- additional modifications may be made to the images (both the ones that are rotated and ones that are not) in order to make the challenge more difficult for computers.
- the modifications that may be applied to the images include modifying the lighting effects or properties of the images, modifying the color properties of the images, cropping the images, removing a random portion from each image, and masking the images.
- An example of modifying the color properties of the images is converting the images into black-and-white or grayscale images. Another example is to change the color of the blue sky in the image, if there is any.
- Cropping an image may include trimming all around the image a predefined number of pixels per dimension or only particular sides. Removing a portion of an image may include removing a random quadrant of the image.
- modifications to the images may include changes to the attributes or characteristics of the image or removing content from the image; the modifications are targeted to image attributes or characteristics or content that may provide to a computer clues regarding the orientation of the image.
- the list of possible modifications described above are merely exemplary; other modifications that further complicate the image orientation detection task for computers may be used.
- the types of modifications that may be applied to the images may vary as the state of the art in the field of automatic image orientation detection develops further; different types of modifications may be applied to counter improvements in automatic image orientation detection techniques as they arise.
- the question for the challenge is generated ( 308 ).
- the question concerns the orientations of the images.
- the question asks the user to identify the images that are not upright (or are upright).
- the set of questions that may be generated may be described as: given N images, M images of which are not upright, identify P of the M images that are not upright, where 1 ⁇ P ⁇ M ⁇ N; or alternatively, identify Q of the N ⁇ M images that are upright, where 1 ⁇ Q ⁇ (N ⁇ M) ⁇ N.
- Each generated challenge may have different values of N, M, P, and Q.
- the actual question and the correct answer may vary across challenges, and the difficulty of the questions may vary across challenges because the probability of getting the correct answer by guessing changes with the different values.
- the challenge may also require that the user not incorrectly identify an image (e.g., selecting an upright image as non-upright, failing to select a non-upright image as non-upright when the question asked for all non-upright images, etc.).
- a response to a challenge may still be considered correct even if the response does not identify all of the non-upright images required by the question (or upright images if the question asks for such). For example, if the challenge question was “to identity all of the images that are not upright” (where there are at least two images that are not upright) or “to identify five images that are upright,” a response that missed one non-upright image or identified only four out of the required five upright images, respectively, may still be considered correct.
- the generated challenge is transmitted to the client (or other computer or device) for display to the user.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface for a human interaction proof involving rotated images, in accordance with some embodiments.
- FIG. 4 shows an exemplary account opening interface in a web browser window 402 .
- the interface includes common user interface components such as text fields for the username and the password.
- the interface also includes an exemplary human interaction proof (HIP) 404 based on image orientation detection.
- the HIP 404 includes a plurality of images (e.g., 12 images) and a challenge to the user to identify the images that are not upright.
- the example images used in HIP 404 are stick figures and rotations thereof. Eight of the stick figures shown in the HIP are upright (head on top and legs on bottom), while the other four are not.
- the user would click on the Submit button 406 . If the response to the HIP 404 is correct, the account opening request is accepted and the process continues. If the response is incorrect, the account opening request is denied, and a message alerting the user to that effect may be shown.
- HIP 404 is merely exemplary. Other images, formats for presenting the images, questions, and manners of providing the response may be used. Furthermore, the images in the HIP need not be all rotations of the same image. A HIP may present a plurality of different images at once, with some of them rotated.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a server 500 in a computer system 104 in accordance with some embodiments.
