Definitions
- This specification discusses information organizing systems and methods, and more particularly features relating to automated archiving and retrieval of documents.
- This specification describes methods and systems relating to document archiving. These methods and systems allow a user to store and readily retrieve digital representations of physical documents. Digital images of physical documents can be processed using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, then indexed and stored for later retrieval. Image acquisition, OCR processing and image archiving can be combined into an end-to-end system that can facilitate management of the myriad documents encountered in everyday life (e.g., receipts, business cards, doctor's prescriptions, tickets, contracts, etc.), and the user of this system need only take a picture to trigger the document archiving process in some implementations.
- OCR optical character recognition
- Users of the system can readily archive digital images of documents (with the same ease and informality of dropping a document in a drawer) and also readily retrieve the digital images using keyword searches.
- Digital cameras built into cell phones can be used to capture images, and OCR techniques can be used to recognize and extract relevant keywords from these images to allow effective searches later on.
- Acquired document images can be delivered directly from a mobile device to a back-end system (e.g., mobile gateway and email server).
- a user of the system need not download images from a mobile device to a personal computer in order to archive and store the images, thus making image archiving a simple process for the user.

- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example method 200 of archiving and retrieving a digital image.
- a message is received 210 from a mobile device having a digital camera.
- the mobile device can be a cell phone for which the user has registered the cell phone number with their account in an email system, and the message can be an email sent from a cell phone (e.g., to a known email address, such as archive@google.com) or an MMS sent to an email system shortcode (e.g., with a keyword indicating the archival service).
- the message from the mobile device includes one or more digital images taken by the digital camera, and the digital image(s) include information corresponding to words (i.e., image data that visually represents document text).
- the mobile device can be validated 220 based on the received message.
- a mobile gateway or the email system can validate the cell phone based on a previously employed authentication and association mechanism.
- a user account can be bound to a phone number, and the authentication and association mechanism can operate as follows.
- a user can initiate a binding by filling in a form at a Web site (e.g., the email system's Web site) specifying the user's mobile device number.
- An automated system can process the form and send an SMS (short message service) message to the user's mobile device for the Web request along with a randomly generated string.
- the user can then verify that string either on the Web or through an SMS sent back from the same mobile device.
- the user will know the string only if the mobile device belongs to the user.
- the user can initiate this binding from the mobile device instead, sending a message from it to an appropriate number or short code with an identifier associated with the user (e.g., as assigned by the Web site).
- the user's account receives a message with a string, to be verified similarly.
- the words are determined 230 from the digital image information using optical character recognition. This can involve determining all the words in the image or extracting only relevant keywords. For example, very common words, such as "a” and “the” can be ignored, while words that occur less often in a dictionary can be ranked as more likely relevant. This can involve traditional techniques of simply stripping out stopwords (e.g. "and”, “for”, "a”, “the”, etc.) as used in Web search technology. This can also involve actively identifying some words as likely being more relevant, such as identifying proper nouns or named entities (e.g., "John", “San Diego”, “Barnes & Noble”, etc.), which likely signify a person, place, business, etc. In some implementations, all the words can be identified, and a processing engine at the backend (e.g., the indexing engine) can handle the discrimination between relevant and non-relevant words.
- a processing engine at the backend e.g., the indexing engine
- the message can include at least two images of the same document, and the words can be determined by performing correlative optical character recognition on the at least two digital images to find the words.
- two digital images can be taken separately by a user and manually grouped together for email or MMS transmission, or two digital images can be taken of a single object in response to a single input to the digital camera.
- the digital camera 112 can have an input 114 that triggers two pictures to be taken in rapid succession and automatically sent to the first back-end component 150. Note that the input 114 can also be designed to trigger one picture and the automatic sending.
- the input 114 can be a physical button on the mobile device 110 or a graphical element in a graphical user interface of the mobile device 110.
- the input 114 can be multifunctional, such as a side-mounted pressable thumbwheel.
- the input 114 can be dedicated to the image archive system, such that any picture displayed on the mobile device's screen can be automatically transmitted for OCR-ing and archiving in response to a single user interaction with the input 114.
- the input 114 can be configured to trigger sending of an image to the first back-end component 150 in response to one or two user input actions (e.g., one or two button pushes).
- the determined words can be added to the subject line, header line or body of an email, and the full image(s) can be stored as an attachment to the email.
- the email can be automatically tagged with a pre-defined label (e.g., "PIC").
- the digital image can be indexed 240 based on the words, and also possibly based on the pre-defined label.
- Various types of word indexing can be used.
- the systems and techniques described in the following patent applications can be used: U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0222985 A1 , to Paul Buchheit et al., entitled “EMAIL CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM", filed March 31, 2004 and published October 6, 2005, and U.S. Patent Pub. No.
- One or more search terms can be received 260 from a network device. These search term(s) can be entered by a user, such as in a Web browser interface (on a mobile phone, personal computer, etc.), and sent to the image archive system. Alternatively, these search term(s) can be generated by a computer in response to some input. In any event, the digital image can be retrieved 270 based on the one or more search terms, and presented to a user or sent to another system component for further processing.
- the OCR techniques handle lower resolution images (e.g., images from one mega pixel cameras).
- steps can be taken to address issues raised by camera/lens quality, the distance from which the document is shot, and so on.
- Image enhancement and super-resolution techniques can be used to pre-process the document image for improved OCR-ability.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example method 300 of enhanced optical character recognition.
- a message including a digital image can be received 310, and the message can include an indication of type for a document represented in the digital image.
- This indication of type can be explicitly included, such as when a user notes a type for the document (e.g., business card versus receipt) when the picture is taken.
- the indication of type can be an aspect of the image itself, such as the relative vertical and horizontal dimensions of a document represented in the digital image.
- business cards typically have a common aspect ratio, which can be determined from a digital picture by checking for the edges of any paper document in the picture and their relation to the text on the document.
- the indication of type can also be determined by an initial OCR pass that finds some words, and then these words can be used to indicate the document type, which can affect later OCR processing.
- the digital image can be pre-processed 320 to improve optical character recognition.
- the pre-processing can involve denoising and deskewing the image using traditional techniques.
- the pre-processing can involve identifying a binarization threshold for the digital image by minimizing positional variance of left and right margins of a document represented in the digital image.
- the pre-processing can employ an iterative refinement scheme that obtains the gray level at each high resolution pixel by iteratively taking a weighted combination of the gray levels of its neighboring pixels in the low resolution image.
- ((x, y) ⁇ R 2 ) be the underlying true image.
- the h PSF need not be known explicitly since it is know that h PSF is generally a window function performing a weighted neighborhood smoothing. As such, the Point Spread Function can be modeled with a Gaussian function.
- the initial approximation of the underlying image, f (0) can be created via Bicubic B Spline interpolation.
- the iterative refinement scheme obtains the gray level at each high resolution pixel by iteratively taking a weighted combination of the gray levels of its neighboring pixels in the low resolution image.
- Optical character recognition can be performed 330 on the per-processed digital image to determine words in the digital image.
- the OCR operation can be performed at multiple scales.
- multiple versions of the document can be created and OCR'd. For example, a first version at original scale, a second version at 2x scale, and a third version at 3x scale can be fed individually into the OCR engine and the union of the resulting words can be stored.
- the original document may have a mixture of font sizes - the smallest font may be too small for the OCR engine to recognize. These fonts can be recognized from the higher resolution (and deblurred) versions of the document. On the other hand, larger font sizes in the original document, may become too large, after super-resolution, for the OCR engine to recognize. These fonts can be recognized from the lower resolution versions.
- the initial result of the optical character recognition will be strings of characters grouped together into words, which may or may not be real words (e.g., the word "clip” may be read as "c1ip", with the lowercase letter “I” replaced by the number "1 ").
- post-processing can be performed on the words to identify and correct common character misidentifications resulting from the optical character recognition.
- the post-processing can be language model based and can use one or more dictionaries.
- multiple dictionary based language models can be used.
- a selection can be made 340 between at least two dictionary based language models according to the indication of type for the document. Then, the words can be post-processed 350 in accordance with the selected dictionary based language model.
- a single dictionary based language model can be used for all images to be OCR'd (e.g., the dictionary can be a subset of words found on the Web).
- the language based post-processing can improve the quality of OCR results obtained from the document image.
- the language based post-processing can be understood within the context of a probabilistic framework that connects character string outputs from the OCR, with words found in a dictionary.
- the dictionary need not be a standard word dictionary, but can be any set of words derived from one or more corpora.
- s argmax w P s / w P w where P( w ) indicates the probability of the word w occurring, P( w
- a w that maximizes the a posteriori probability of a word given an observed OCR output string can be sought during post-processing.
- the post-processing can compute w * using two components: (1) A language model to estimate P( w ) in the given text context; and (2) an OCR error model to estimate the probability of reading word w as s , P( s
- the language model gives the likelihood of a word w occurring in the given context. For example, the occurrences of each word in a corpus of training documents can be counted to build a dictionary of words and word probabilities.
- a dictionary based language model can be represented by a weighted finite state machine (WFSM) with the input labels as characters and accepting states corresponding to all dictionary words. Note that this example language model may not cover the proper nouns well.
- WFSM weighted finite state machine
- Character based language models that estimate the probability of the next character given the string seen so far often do better with proper nouns.
- the representation can again be a WFSM, with the following cost measure: C s 1
- c 1 ... c i ⁇ 1 ⁇ log P s i
- c 1 ... c i ⁇ 1 ⁇ log P s i
- n-gram word based models can be used. These models use probability of occurrence of a word given the previous few words. Other language based models can also be used.
- the error model computes the probability of the OCR engine reading an input character sequence w as s .
- This too can be estimated using a machine learning approach, and an error model can be created using training data, i.e., example images with input text and the OCR output.
- Both input and output text can be segmented into corresponding character segments w and s respectively. For example, this segmentation can be done using Levenshtein edit distance.
- the Levenshtein distance measures the distance between two strings as the minimum number of operations (insertion/deletion/substitution of single character) necessary to transform one string to another.
- a weighted finite state transducer can be computed, with input labels corresponding to original characters and output labels being the OCR output characters. See, e.g., Kolak O., Resnik P., Byrne W., "A generative probabilistic OCR model for NLP applications", HLT-NAACL 2003 .
- the edit distance approach can be used for computing the transition probabilities directly by measuring P( s
- a corpus of documents with known ground truths can be used to estimate the cost/probability of letter substitution.
- the actual transformations (insertion/deletion/substitution of single characters) necessary to transform each observed OCR string to the known ground truth can be recorded.
- the number of occurrences of each transformation is a measure of the probability/cost of that particular transformation happening during the OCR process. Thus, there will likely be a large number of instances of the letter 'l' being mistaken as numeral '1', and hence assign a high probability to that occurrence.
- Training data for computing the error model can be created by artificially generating images from text, adding noise to the generated images, and then generating OCR engine output from the images.
- OCR engine output from the images For credit card receipts and business cards, local business listings data can be used to learn the dictionary/language model. Additionally, users of the system can be asked to submit document images of various types to serve as training data.

Description
- This specification discusses information organizing systems and methods, and more particularly features relating to automated archiving and retrieval of documents.
- In everyday life, people frequently receive physical documents with information that may or may not be important, and may or may not be needed at a later time. For example, receipts and business cards are often received in the course of a day, and the recipient is often unsure whether, and for how long, to save such documents. Such documents can be saved physically or scanned for storage on a computer. In either event, the saved document is typically either dropped in some location without any archiving meta information (e.g., dropped in a drawer or a folder), or a person must deliberately associate archiving meta information with the document (e.g., by placing the document in a specific folder according to some docketing system, or by typing in information to associate with the document saved on a computer).
- This specification describes methods and systems relating to document archiving. These methods and systems allow a user to store and readily retrieve digital representations of physical documents. Digital images of physical documents can be processed using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, then indexed and stored for later retrieval. Image acquisition, OCR processing and image archiving can be combined into an end-to-end system that can facilitate management of the myriad documents encountered in everyday life (e.g., receipts, business cards, doctor's prescriptions, tickets, contracts, etc.), and the user of this system need only take a picture to trigger the document archiving process in some implementations.
- Users of the system can readily archive digital images of documents (with the same ease and informality of dropping a document in a drawer) and also readily retrieve the digital images using keyword searches. Digital cameras built into cell phones can be used to capture images, and OCR techniques can be used to recognize and extract relevant keywords from these images to allow effective searches later on. Acquired document images can be delivered directly from a mobile device to a back-end system (e.g., mobile gateway and email server). A user of the system need not download images from a mobile device to a personal computer in order to archive and store the images, thus making image archiving a simple process for the user. Moreover, lower resolution images can also be handled using enhanced OCR techniques, including various pre-processing and post-processing operations. Thus, the myriad documents encountered in everyday life can be readily digitized, organized, stored and retrieved quickly and efficiently.
- In general, an aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented method that includes receiving a message from a mobile device configured to connect to a mobile device network, the mobile device including a digital camera, and the message including a digital image taken by the digital camera and including information corresponding to words; determining the words from the digital image information using optical character recognition; indexing the digital image based on the words; and storing the digital image for later retrieval of the digital image based on one or more received search terms. The method can further include receiving the one or more search terms; and retrieving the digital image based on the one or more search terms.
- The method can include validating the mobile device (e.g., based on a mobile phone number and/or information associated with the received digital image). Receiving the message can include receiving an email message having the digital image attached; and the method can include adding at least one of the words, and a pre-defined label corresponding to the mobile device, to the email message; and the determining, indexing and storing can be performed in an electronic mail system.
- Receiving the digital image can include receiving at least two digital images taken of a single object in response to a single input to the digital camera, and determining the words can include performing correlative optical character recognition on the at least two digital images to find the words. Determining the words can include performing the optical character recognition at multiple scales.
- The method can include pre-processing the digital image to improve the optical character recognition. The pre-processing can include identifying a binarization threshold for the digital image by minimizing positional variance of left and right margins of a document represented in the digital image. The pre-processing can include obtaining a gray level at a higher resolution pixel by iteratively taking a weighted combination of gray levels of neighboring pixels at a lower resolution.
- The method can include post-processing the words to identify and correct common character misidentifications resulting from the optical character recognition. Receiving the message can include receiving an indication of type for a document represented in the digital image, and the post-processing can include selecting between at least two dictionary based language models according to the indication of type for the document, and post-processing the words in accordance with the selected dictionary based language model. Moreover, receiving the indication of type can include receiving a user specified category in the message, the user specified category selected from a group including business cards and credit card receipts.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and one or more computer program products, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.

FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an example digitalimage archiving system 100. Thesystem 100 includes multiple mobile devices 110 (e.g., cell phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs)) that communicate through a mobile device network 120 (e.g., a private cell phone network or wireless email network). Thedevices 110 are mobile in the sense that they can communicate using wireless transmissions (short, medium, or long range). However, themobile devices 110 can also include connectors for wired communications (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector). - The
mobile devices 110 are configured to take digital images. Thus, amobile device 110 includes adigital camera 112. Thedigital camera 112 can be built into a device having other functions (e.g., a mobile phone or PDA with built in camera), or themobile device 110 can be thedigital camera 112, which also has wireless communication capability. - The
mobile device 110 can be used to take one or moredigital images 132 of aphysical document 105. Thedocument 105 can be any physical document that includes one or more words. For example, thedocument 105 can be a business card, an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) receipt, a credit card purchase receipt, a doctor's prescription, a ticket for travel (e.g., a plane ticket or railway ticket), a contract, a letter, a recipe seen in a magazine, etc. More generally, thedocument 105 need not be a paper document. Thedocument 105 can be any physical article with words for which one might want an archived and retrievable digital image, e.g., a road sign, a posted public notice, a lost pet sign, a T-shirt, etc. Note that as used herein, the term "words" includes all manner of text information that can be identified using optical character recognition techniques, and multiple tokens can be grouped together and considered to be a single "word" by the system, irrespective of separating white space. - The digital image(s) 132 can be sent to a first back-
end component 150 in amessage 130. Themessage 130 can be a Multimedia Message Specification (MMS) message including the digital image(s) 132. Other message formats are also possible. For example, themessage 130 can be an electronic mail message. - The first back-
end component 150 can connect to themobile device network 120 through anothernetwork 140, such as the Internet. Alternatively, the first back-end component 150 can connect directly to themobile network 120 or be included within themobile network 120. For example, the first back-end component 150 can be mobile gateway used to validate acell phone 110 before the digital image(s) 132 are accepted for archiving. - The first back-
end component 150 can include avalidation engine 152 configured to validate themobile devices 110, and anOCR engine 154 configured to apply optical character recognition to the digital image(s) 132. The first back-end component 150 can generateindex information 134 to add to the message 130 (e.g., by adding the information to a subject line of an email message), thereby associating theindex information 134 with the digital image(s) 132. - The
index information 134 includes one or more words identified in the document image(s) 132 using the optical character recognition. Theindex information 134 can also include additional information, such as a pre-defined label, document type information, and system state information. The pre-defined label can correspond to the mobile device (e.g., the source mobile phone number), a function name associated with the image archiving feature of the mobile device (e.g., "PIC" for "Personal Image Container" can be the label used in the mobile device's user interface to identify the image archiving function), or both. The document type information can indicate the nature of the document (e.g., business card versus credit card receipt) and can be entered by a user (e.g., by selecting from a menu on the mobile device's user interface) or automatically determined (e.g., based on the relative vertical and horizontal dimensions of a document represented in the digital image(s) 132). - The system state information can include information such as the time and date (e.g., time stamp) of image acquisition, transmission, receipt, or a combination of them. Further system state information can also be included, such as the geographic location of the mobile device at the time of image acquisition, transmission, receipt, or a combination of them.
- The first back-
end component 150 can send themessage 130, with includedindex information 134, to a second back-end component 160. The second back-end component 160 can connect to themobile device network 120 through anothernetwork 140, such as the Internet. Alternatively, the second back-end component 160 can connect directly to themobile network 120 or be included within themobile network 120. - The second back-
end component 160 can include anindex engine 162 and aretrieval engine 164. Theindex engine 162 can archive the document image(s) 132 based on theindex information 134. Theretrieval engine 164 can fetch the document image(s) 132, for delivery to anetwork device 170, based on one or more search terms received from thenetwork device 170. Thenetwork device 170 can connect to the mobile device network or theadditional network 140. Thenetwork device 170 be amobile device 110 or another machine. For example, thenetwork device 170 can be a personal computer connected to the Internet and running a Web browser. - It is to be understood that the
example system 100 shown inFIG. 1 can be implemented in multiple different ways, and the particular division of operational components shown is not limiting, but rather only presented as example. As used herein, the term "back-end component" includes both traditional back-end components (e.g., a data server) and middleware components (e.g., an application server). In general, the first and second back-end components end components - Furthermore, it is to be understood that the
message 130 can have its format modified between the various components of thesystem 100, and thus, may be considered separate messages at each stage. For example, the message received from themobile device 110 can be in MMS format, the message received from the first back-end component 150 can be in a proprietary messaging format used between the first andsecond components end component 160 by thenetwork device 170 can be in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format. - Regardless of the formats and component configurations used, the
system 100 integrates themobile devices 110, themobile device network 120, and the back-end components mobile devices 110. Thus, for example, a user can take pictures with their cell phone and email the images (or send as MMS) to their email account, where the images are automatically OCR'd and indexed. The user can then access and search the images using the electronic mail system's user interface. -
FIG. 2 is a flow chart of anexample method 200 of archiving and retrieving a digital image. A message is received 210 from a mobile device having a digital camera. The mobile device can be a cell phone for which the user has registered the cell phone number with their account in an email system, and the message can be an email sent from a cell phone (e.g., to a known email address, such as archive@google.com) or an MMS sent to an email system shortcode (e.g., with a keyword indicating the archival service). The message from the mobile device includes one or more digital images taken by the digital camera, and the digital image(s) include information corresponding to words (i.e., image data that visually represents document text). - The mobile device can be validated 220 based on the received message. For example, a mobile gateway or the email system can validate the cell phone based on a previously employed authentication and association mechanism. A user account can be bound to a phone number, and the authentication and association mechanism can operate as follows. A user can initiate a binding by filling in a form at a Web site (e.g., the email system's Web site) specifying the user's mobile device number. An automated system can process the form and send an SMS (short message service) message to the user's mobile device for the Web request along with a randomly generated string. The user can then verify that string either on the Web or through an SMS sent back from the same mobile device. The user will know the string only if the mobile device belongs to the user. Alternatively, the user can initiate this binding from the mobile device instead, sending a message from it to an appropriate number or short code with an identifier associated with the user (e.g., as assigned by the Web site). The user's account receives a message with a string, to be verified similarly.
- The words are determined 230 from the digital image information using optical character recognition. This can involve determining all the words in the image or extracting only relevant keywords. For example, very common words, such as "a" and "the" can be ignored, while words that occur less often in a dictionary can be ranked as more likely relevant. This can involve traditional techniques of simply stripping out stopwords (e.g. "and", "for", "a", "the", etc.) as used in Web search technology. This can also involve actively identifying some words as likely being more relevant, such as identifying proper nouns or named entities (e.g., "John", "San Diego", "Barnes & Noble", etc.), which likely signify a person, place, business, etc. In some implementations, all the words can be identified, and a processing engine at the backend (e.g., the indexing engine) can handle the discrimination between relevant and non-relevant words.
- In some implementations, the message can include at least two images of the same document, and the words can be determined by performing correlative optical character recognition on the at least two digital images to find the words. For example, two digital images can be taken separately by a user and manually grouped together for email or MMS transmission, or two digital images can be taken of a single object in response to a single input to the digital camera. For example, referring to
FIG. 1 , thedigital camera 112 can have aninput 114 that triggers two pictures to be taken in rapid succession and automatically sent to the first back-end component 150. Note that theinput 114 can also be designed to trigger one picture and the automatic sending. - The
input 114 can be a physical button on themobile device 110 or a graphical element in a graphical user interface of themobile device 110. Theinput 114 can be multifunctional, such as a side-mounted pressable thumbwheel. Alternatively, theinput 114 can be dedicated to the image archive system, such that any picture displayed on the mobile device's screen can be automatically transmitted for OCR-ing and archiving in response to a single user interaction with theinput 114. In any event, theinput 114 can be configured to trigger sending of an image to the first back-end component 150 in response to one or two user input actions (e.g., one or two button pushes). - Referring again to
FIG. 2 , the determined words can be added to the subject line, header line or body of an email, and the full image(s) can be stored as an attachment to the email. In addition, the email can be automatically tagged with a pre-defined label (e.g., "PIC"). The digital image can be indexed 240 based on the words, and also possibly based on the pre-defined label. Various types of word indexing can be used. For example, the systems and techniques described in the following patent applications can be used:U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0222985 A1 , to Paul Buchheit et al., entitled "EMAIL CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM", filed March 31, 2004 and published October 6, 2005, andU.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0223058 A1, to Paul Buchheit et al. , entitled "IDENTIFYING MESSAGES RELEVANT TO A SEARCH QUERY IN A CONVERSATION-BASED EMAIL SYSTEM", filed August 6, 2004 and published October 6, 2005, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The digital image is stored 250 for later retrieval of the digital image. Note that in some implementations, the indexing and storing operations are integrated with each other. - One or more search terms can be received 260 from a network device. These search term(s) can be entered by a user, such as in a Web browser interface (on a mobile phone, personal computer, etc.), and sent to the image archive system. Alternatively, these search term(s) can be generated by a computer in response to some input. In any event, the digital image can be retrieved 270 based on the one or more search terms, and presented to a user or sent to another system component for further processing.
- In some implementations, the OCR techniques handle lower resolution images (e.g., images from one mega pixel cameras). In addition, steps can be taken to address issues raised by camera/lens quality, the distance from which the document is shot, and so on. Image enhancement and super-resolution techniques can be used to pre-process the document image for improved OCR-ability.
-
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample method 300 of enhanced optical character recognition. A message including a digital image can be received 310, and the message can include an indication of type for a document represented in the digital image. This indication of type can be explicitly included, such as when a user notes a type for the document (e.g., business card versus receipt) when the picture is taken. Alternatively, the indication of type can be an aspect of the image itself, such as the relative vertical and horizontal dimensions of a document represented in the digital image. For example, business cards typically have a common aspect ratio, which can be determined from a digital picture by checking for the edges of any paper document in the picture and their relation to the text on the document. The indication of type can also be determined by an initial OCR pass that finds some words, and then these words can be used to indicate the document type, which can affect later OCR processing. - The digital image can be pre-processed 320 to improve optical character recognition. The pre-processing can involve denoising and deskewing the image using traditional techniques. The pre-processing can involve identifying a binarization threshold for the digital image by minimizing positional variance of left and right margins of a document represented in the digital image. In addition, the pre-processing can employ an iterative refinement scheme that obtains the gray level at each high resolution pixel by iteratively taking a weighted combination of the gray levels of its neighboring pixels in the low resolution image.
- Traditional super-resolution algorithms based on bicubic/bilinear/spline interpolation essentially run a low pass filter on the image, eliminating sharp edges. This results in further blurring of an image, which can be undesirable when the original image was already partially blurred. Blurring at letter boundaries can cause degradation of OCR quality. On the other hand, edge preserving super-resolution algorithms like nearest neighbor interpolation can cause aliasing artifacts that confuse the OCR engine. In contrast, the new approach described below can deblur, while super-sampling, without enhancing noise. Note that the words "super-sampling" and "super-resolution" are used synonymously herein.
- Let g(x, y)|(x, y) ∈[1...M, 1...N], where M, N are image dimensions, represent an observed image. Let f(x, y)|((x, y) ∈ R2) be the underlying true image. In this model, g is a blurred version of f, i.e., g = f*hPSF, where * denotes the convolution operator, and hPSF denotes the Point Spread Function (this function effectively models the blurring process). The hPSF need not be known explicitly since it is know that hPSF is generally a window function performing a weighted neighborhood smoothing. As such, the Point Spread Function can be modeled with a Gaussian function.
- Considering f(n) as an approximation to f and g(n) = f(n)*hPSF, the equations can be rewritten as,
- Hence, in practice, an iterative refinement scheme can be used: F(n+1) = F(n) + (G - G(n)) · (HBP)/c, where HBP and c are chosen such that 1 - (HBP)/c · HPSF > 0. Choosing c generally involves a tradeoff. Larger c implies more noise and error tolerance, but slower convergence and vice versa. The initial approximation of the underlying image, f(0), can be created via Bicubic B Spline interpolation. Thus, the iterative refinement scheme obtains the gray level at each high resolution pixel by iteratively taking a weighted combination of the gray levels of its neighboring pixels in the low resolution image.
- Optical character recognition can be performed 330 on the per-processed digital image to determine words in the digital image. The OCR operation can be performed at multiple scales. Running the above super-resolution cum deblurring algorithm, multiple versions of the document can be created and OCR'd. For example, a first version at original scale, a second version at 2x scale, and a third version at 3x scale can be fed individually into the OCR engine and the union of the resulting words can be stored. The original document may have a mixture of font sizes - the smallest font may be too small for the OCR engine to recognize. These fonts can be recognized from the higher resolution (and deblurred) versions of the document. On the other hand, larger font sizes in the original document, may become too large, after super-resolution, for the OCR engine to recognize. These fonts can be recognized from the lower resolution versions.
- In addition, irrespective of whether OCR is performed at multiple scales, often, the initial result of the optical character recognition will be strings of characters grouped together into words, which may or may not be real words (e.g., the word "clip" may be read as "c1ip", with the lowercase letter "I" replaced by the number "1 "). Thus, post-processing can be performed on the words to identify and correct common character misidentifications resulting from the optical character recognition. The post-processing can be language model based and can use one or more dictionaries.
- In some implementations, multiple dictionary based language models can be used. A selection can be made 340 between at least two dictionary based language models according to the indication of type for the document. Then, the words can be post-processed 350 in accordance with the selected dictionary based language model. In other implementations, a single dictionary based language model can be used for all images to be OCR'd (e.g., the dictionary can be a subset of words found on the Web).
- The language based post-processing can improve the quality of OCR results obtained from the document image. The language based post-processing can be understood within the context of a probabilistic framework that connects character string outputs from the OCR, with words found in a dictionary. Note that the dictionary need not be a standard word dictionary, but can be any set of words derived from one or more corpora.
-
- Given an observed string s, the goal is to obtain
- The language model gives the likelihood of a word w occurring in the given context. For example, the occurrences of each word in a corpus of training documents can be counted to build a dictionary of words and word probabilities. Such a dictionary based language model can be represented by a weighted finite state machine (WFSM) with the input labels as characters and accepting states corresponding to all dictionary words. Note that this example language model may not cover the proper nouns well.
- Character based language models that estimate the probability of the next character given the string seen so far often do better with proper nouns. The representation can again be a WFSM, with the following cost measure:
- The error model computes the probability of the OCR engine reading an input character sequence w as s. This too can be estimated using a machine learning approach, and an error model can be created using training data, i.e., example images with input text and the OCR output. Both input and output text can be segmented into corresponding character segments w and s respectively. For example, this segmentation can be done using Levenshtein edit distance. The Levenshtein distance measures the distance between two strings as the minimum number of operations (insertion/deletion/substitution of single character) necessary to transform one string to another. With the segmented string pairs (s,w) in hand, a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) can be computed, with input labels corresponding to original characters and output labels being the OCR output characters. See, e.g., Kolak O., Resnik P., Byrne W., "A generative probabilistic OCR model for NLP applications", HLT-NAACL 2003. Alternatively, the edit distance approach can be used for computing the transition probabilities directly by measuring P(s|w) from counts above, and using the inverse as the transformation cost.
- A corpus of documents with known ground truths can be used to estimate the cost/probability of letter substitution. The actual transformations (insertion/deletion/substitution of single characters) necessary to transform each observed OCR string to the known ground truth can be recorded. The number of occurrences of each transformation is a measure of the probability/cost of that particular transformation happening during the OCR process. Thus, there will likely be a large number of instances of the letter 'l' being mistaken as numeral '1', and hence assign a high probability to that occurrence.
- Training data for computing the error model can be created by artificially generating images from text, adding noise to the generated images, and then generating OCR engine output from the images. For credit card receipts and business cards, local business listings data can be used to learn the dictionary/language model. Additionally, users of the system can be asked to submit document images of various types to serve as training data.
