Abstract
The present disclosure describes apparatus and techniques for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In some aspects, as part of a registration process, a PLMN manager (144) of a user equipment (UE, 102) searches a data repository including PLMN information for PLMNs (104, 106) that are prevented from registration for a duration of time, and determines that the PLMNs are prevented due to signal related conditions (e.g., weak signals) associated with cells (110, 112) of the PLMNs. The PLMN manager (144) then determines that signal correlation conditions between the UE (102) and the cells (110, 112) have improved during the duration. In response to the improvement, the PLMN manager (144) unblocks the PLMN (104, 106) prior to expiration of the duration. By doing so, the UE (102) may re-attempt to register with the unblocked PLMN (104, 106) at least once before the duration expires, which may allow the UE to register faster and re-establish network services.
Description
Technical Field
The present application relates to an adaptive public land mobile network management apparatus and method for varying network conditions.
Background
The popularity of wireless communication technology has greatly increased the number of devices capable of accessing remote data or other services over a wireless network. For wide area networks, such as cellular networks, a core network operator typically provides telecommunication services to mobile stations throughout the network. One example of a network is a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) comprising a core network and base stations. The base stations collectively form a Radio Access Network (RAN) that is connected to the network. To communicate wirelessly with the network, the mobile station may establish a connection to the core network via a cell (e.g., base station, serving cell) of the PLMN.
During the ATTACH (atach) procedure to establish this connection, the network will query about the wireless communication capabilities supported by the mobile station. In order to attach successfully to a PLMN, the mobile station needs to respond to the network with its capabilities including supported wireless communication bands and other parameters. To increase the data rate, some mobile stations and networks implement Carrier Aggregation (CA) that allows the mobile station to use multiple channels to communicate data with the network. To enable carrier aggregation, the mobile station also communicates various combinations of CA parameters such as carrier, frequency band, and bandwidth to the network as part of its wireless communication capabilities.
However, as networks deploy more CA-supporting cells with multiple frequency bands, the number and size of CA parameter combinations supported by many mobile stations has grown significantly. With this increase in the number and size of CA parameter combinations, the capability messages of mobile stations transmitted to the network during the attach procedure also increase substantially in size. In case of poor network coverage or weak signal strength, transmission of capability messages comprising CA parameter combinations often takes longer to complete due to reduced network throughput. Due to the guard time implemented by many network operators, a connection with a mobile station may be dropped during the attach procedure when no full capability message is received from the mobile station within the guard time. Additionally, after a number of failed attach procedures, the mobile station will prevent the PLMN from proceeding with subsequent attach procedures for a certain length of time. As a result, mobile stations with poor network coverage often cannot complete an attach procedure with a PLMN or may be prevented from retrying the attach procedure for a length of time during which the mobile station's network service may be compromised or denied.
Disclosure of Invention
The present disclosure describes apparatus and techniques for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In some aspects, a user equipment performs a method that includes searching, as part of a registration process, a data repository including PLMN information for PLMNs that are prevented from registering for a predefined duration. The method then determines that the PLMN that is blocked from registration is blocked due to signal related conditions of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN. The method further comprises determining that signal related conditions of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN have improved during the predefined duration. In response to an improvement in the signal-related condition, the method unblocks PLMN registration. The method then transmits a request for registration with the unblocked PLMN to a cell of the PLMN to enable registration with the PLMN prior to expiration of the predefined duration.
In other aspects, a user equipment performs a method that includes transmitting a first request to a cell of a PLMN for registration with the PLMN. The method then detects a failure of the first request for registration with the PLMN during a phase of sending the UE capability message. The method comprises the following steps: determining that a signal-related characteristic for communicating with a cell of the PLMN fails to meet a threshold; and identifying a PLMN registration failure based on the signal correlation characteristic. The method then determines whether the signal related characteristics for communication with the cells of the PLMN remain unchanged, improve or degrade throughout the duration. In response to the determination of the signal correlation characteristic, the method uses fewer or more CA combinations in the UE capability message during a next request for registration with the PLMN. If the signal condition improves significantly, the UE may make another registration attempt before expiration of the duration.
In other aspects, a user equipment includes: a transceiver operatively coupled with one or more antennas; a hardware-based processor associated with the transceiver; and a computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by the hardware-based processor of the UE. The instructions are executable to implement a PLMN manager configured to direct the user equipment to search a data repository including PLMN information for PLMNs that are prevented from being registered for a predefined duration as part of a registration process. The PLMN manager determines that the PLMN prevented from registering is prevented due to a signal related condition of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The PLMN manager then determines, via the transceiver and during the duration, that signal related conditions of the connection between the UE and the cell of the PLMN have improved. In response to the improvement of the signal related condition, the PLMN manager unblocks PLMN registration. The PLMN manager then transmits, via the transceiver and to a base station of the PLMN, a request for registration with the unblocked PLMN to enable registration with the PLMN prior to expiration of the predefined duration.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
The user equipment accesses a cellular network, such as a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), through a communication link or "connection" with a base station or serving cell of the network. As part of establishing or maintaining a connection, a User Equipment (UE) may register with the PLMN, such as through an attach procedure or Tracking Area Update (TAU). When the UE attempts to register with the PLMN (network), the network will query the UE for wireless communication capabilities. For successful registration, the UE may respond to the network with its wireless communication capabilities (e.g., UE capability messages) to enable communication between the UE and the network. Some UEs and PLMNs provide increased bandwidth through Carrier Aggregation (CA) that enables the UE to use multiple channels to communicate data with the network. To enable carrier aggregation with the network, these UEs also communicate various combinations of CA parameters such as carrier, band and bandwidth to the network as part of their UE capability messages.
However, as networks deploy more CA-supporting cells with multiple frequency bands, the number and size of CA parameter combinations supported by many UEs has grown significantly. With this increase in the number and size of CA parameter combinations, UE capability messages transmitted during registration with a PLMN have also increased substantially in size. In case of poor network coverage or weak signal strength, the transmission of UE capability messages comprising a combination of CA parameters often takes longer to complete due to reduced network throughput. Due to the guard time implemented by many network operators, the network may release a connection (e.g., a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection) with the UE during registration if a full UE capability message is not received within the guard time. After a registration failure or a connection is released, the UE is forced to re-attempt registration through another attach procedure. According to conventional techniques for PLMN selection, the UE may only make five registration attempts before preventing a PLMN by adding the PLMN to the temporarily forbidden PLMN list for a certain duration (e.g., 12 minutes per T3402 timer). Thus, the UE may block the preferred PLMN due to poor previous network conditions, which may cause denial of service or impairment of service for a considerable duration. In some cases, the PLMN remains blocked throughout the duration (e.g., 12 minutes) regardless of whether the UE moves back to good network coverage or network conditions improve, which may further frustrate the user of the UE.
The present disclosure describes apparatus and techniques for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. As described, aspects of adaptive PLMN management may adaptively unblock PLMNs when signaling conditions of a UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with better network coverage. In general, as a result of adaptive PLMN unblocking, the UE may register with the PLMN faster than conventional technology permissions that lack any precautions for unblocking. In some cases, the UE may register with the PLMN after moving out of the bad signaling region (e.g., bad network conditions) without waiting for the entire duration (e.g., 12 minutes) as specified by the various communication specifications for PLMNs on the forbidden list.
As an example, in some scenarios, a UE receives coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and the cell may support only Long Term Evolution (LTE) services and not legacy access technologies. When poor network conditions (e.g., poor signaling) cause the UE to block the PLMN, the UE will typically block the PLMN and prevent the UE from receiving any voice or circuit switched services (e.g., legacy services) over LTE services for a significant length of time (e.g., 12 minutes). By implementing aspects of adaptive PLMN management, once the network conditions of the UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with medium or good network coverage, the UE may attempt registration faster (e.g., less than the full 12 minutes). In general, for a global UE with legacy support, the UE may be able to attempt registration based on expiration of a periodic Better System Reselection (BSR) timer (e.g., 90-120 seconds). Thus, aspects of adaptive PLMN management enable faster registration with PLMNs, such as when signaling conditions improve.
The present disclosure also describes apparatus and techniques for adaptive UE capability management for marginal network conditions. In some aspects, the UE capability manager may modify the UE capability information to increase the probability of successful registration under marginal network conditions (e.g., weak signal regions) without affecting the UE capability under good signal conditions. As noted, in some scenarios, a UE may receive coverage from only one cell of a PLMN and the cell may support only Long Term Evolution (LTE) services and not legacy access technologies. In these scenarios, the UE may be prevented from receiving any voice or circuit switched services from the LTE service for a significant length of time in response to multiple failed registration attempts. By implementing aspects of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may alternatively be able to register with a reduced or minimal set of UE capabilities, which enables the UE to receive voice and data services over LTE services. Additionally, by acquiring LTE services (or other third generation (3G) services), the UE is precluded from scanning legacy services (e.g., second generation (2G) services) for fallback services, thereby enabling the UE to save time and power.
In various aspects, as part of the registration process, a PLMN manager of the user equipment searches a data repository including PLMN information for PLMNs that are prevented from being registered for a duration of time, and determines that the PLMNs are prevented from being registered due to signal related conditions (e.g., poor signal coverage or poor signal area) of a connection between the UE and a cell of the PLMN. The PLMN manager then determines that signal related conditions between the UE and the cells of the PLMN have improved during the duration. In response to the improvement, the PLMN manager unblocks the PLMN. By doing so, the UE may re-attempt to register with the unblocked PLMN at least once before the duration expires, which may allow the UE to register faster and re-establish network services.
While any number of different environments, systems, devices, and/or various configurations are capable of implementing the features and concepts of the described techniques and apparatus for adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions, aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions are described in the context of the following example environments, devices, configurations, systems, and methods.
Example Environment
Fig. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 in which various aspects of adaptive Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) management for varying network conditions can be implemented. In the example environment 100, a user equipment 102 (UE 102) may communicate with or access network services provided by a PLMN 104 and/or PLMN 106. Although illustrated as a smart phone, the UE 102 may be implemented as any suitable computing or electronic device, such as a mobile communication device, a user device, a computing device, a client device, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a communication device, an entertainment device, a gaming device, a mobile gaming machine, a personal media device, a media playback device, a charging station, an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), a point-of-sale (POS) transaction system, a health monitoring device, a drone, a camera, a wearable smart device, a navigation device, a Mobile Internet Device (MID), an internet home appliance capable of wireless internet access and browsing, an internet of things (IoT) device, a fifth generation new radio (5G NR) user device, and/or other types of user devices.
Typically, UE 102 communicates with one or more of base station 108, base station 110, base station 112, base station 114, or another base station (not shown) over a wireless connection or communication link. Referring to fig. 1, ue 102 is capable of communicating via PLMN 104 through a connection 116 with base station 110 (e.g., a cell of PLMN 104) or via PLMN 106 through a connection 118 with base station 112 (e.g., a cell of PLMN 106), which may be implemented as any suitable type of wireless link or combination of wireless links.
The connection 116 or connection 118 (e.g., a wireless link or wireless connection) can include a downlink of data and control information communicated from one of the base stations 108 to 114 to the UE 102, an uplink of other data and control information communicated from the UE 102 to one of the base stations 108 to 114, or both. Connection 116 or connection 118 may include one or more wireless links or bearers using any suitable communication protocols or standards or a combination of communication protocols or standards such as: global system for mobile communications (GSM), universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), high Speed Packet Access (HSPA), evolved HSPA (hspa+) protocols, wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), third generation partnership project long term evolution (3 GPP LTE), LTE-advanced, fifth generation new radio (5G NR), 5G system (5 GS) mobility management (5 GMM) protocols, institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 (Wi-Fi TM), IEEE 802.16 (worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax TM)), IEEE 802.15 (e.g., bluetooth TM), IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., zigbee TM), ultra Wideband (UWB), and so on. Multiple carrier components or radio links of connection 116 or connection 118 may be aggregated in Carrier Aggregation (CA) to provide higher data rates for UE 102.
With continued reference to fig. 1, the base stations 108-112 are each illustrated as a tower of a cellular network or Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN). However, one of the base stations 108 to 112 may represent or be implemented as another device, a radio access node, a wireless communication node, or other suitable piece of equipment facilitating wireless communication (via a wireless link) between a user equipment and a communication network, such as a NodeB base station, a next generation base NodeB (gNB) base station, an enhanced NodeB (eNB) base station, an evolved NodeB (eNodeB) base station, a global system for mobile communication (GSM) base station, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) base station, a base station transceiver system, a Local Area Network (LAN) router, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) router, a Wireless Access Point (WAP) in a managed (infrastructure) wireless network, a satellite, a terrestrial television broadcast tower, an access point, a peer device, another smart phone as a base station, etc. Alternatively or additionally, the base stations 108 to 112 may be implemented in a macrocell, microcell, picocell, or the like, or any combination thereof.
The base stations 108-112 (e.g., serving cells) collectively form respective Radio Access Networks (RANs) of the PLMNs 104 and 106. The RANs are illustrated in fig. 1 as an evolved universal terrestrial access network 120 (E-UTRAN 120) and a new radio RAN 122 (NR RAN 122). The base stations 108 and 110 in the E-UTRAN 120 are connected to an evolved packet core 124 (EPC 124) and form a PLMN 104 (or first PLMN) with which the UE 102 may communicate. Base stations 112 and 114 in NR RAN 122 are connected to a fifth generation core 126 (5 gc 126) network and form PLMN 106 (or a second PLMN) with which UE 102 may communicate. Although illustrated in fig. 1 as an E-UTRAN and an NR RAN, it is possible to implement the RAN 120 or 122 as any form of radio access network (e.g., RAN, E-UTRAN, next generation radio access network (NG-RAN), 5G NR RAN, NR RAN). Alternatively or additionally, although PLMN 104 and PLMN 106 are illustrated as evolved packet core networks and 5G core networks, respectively, PLMN 104 or 106 may include EPC 124 and/or 5G core 126.
In this example, base stations 108 and 110 are connected to EPC 124 via a next generation 2 (NG 2) interface for control plane signaling and a next generation 3 (NG 3) interface (e.g., a 5G interface) for user plane data communications, respectively, at 128 and 130. Alternatively or additionally, the base stations 112 and 114 are connected to the 5gc 126 at 132 and 134, respectively, via a single interface 1 (S1) interface (e.g., LTE interface) for control plane signaling and user plane data communications. In addition to the connection to the core network, the base stations 108 to 114 of the respective RANs 120 and 122 may communicate with each other. For example, base stations 108 and 110 can communicate via an inter-base station Xn interface (e.g., 5G interface) at 136 and base stations 112 and 114 can communicate via an inter-base station X2 interface (e.g., LTE interface) at 138.
EPC 124 may also include mobility and management entity 140 (MME 140) that provides control plane functions such as registration and authentication of multiple UEs 102, authorization in E-UTRAN 120, mobility management, and the like. The 5gc 126 includes access and mobility management functions 142 (AMFs 142) that provide control plane functions such as registration and authentication of multiple UEs 102, authorization in the 5g NR RAN 122, mobility management, etc. MME 140 and AMF 142 communicate with base stations 108 to 114 (e.g., cells) of RANs 120 and 122 and may also communicate with multiple UEs 102 via base stations or serving cells. From core networks 124 and/or 126, the ue may receive services that enable access to various data or resources (e.g., internet access) via respective gateways or edge routers (not shown) of the network.
Referring to fig. 1, the UE 102 also includes an adaptive PLMN manager 144 (PLMN manager 144) and an adaptive UE capability manager 146 (UE capability manager 146). In some aspects, the PLMN manager 144 and/or UE capability manager 146 manage or direct the UE 102 when registering with one of the PLMNs 104 or 106 or attempting to register with one of the PLMNs 104 or 106. Although not shown in fig. 1, PLMN manager 144 and/or UE capability manager 146 may include, be coupled with, or have access to, components for: measuring signal related characteristics of the network, scanning for available cells or PLMNs, receiving connection parameters from the wireless network, performing an attach procedure to the PLMN, performing TAU to the PLMN, etc. In various aspects of adaptive PLMN management, the PLMN manager 144 may unblock PLMNs from the temporary forbidden list, such as to enable registration with PLMNs in response to improved signaling conditions. Alternatively or additionally, the UE capability manager 146 may reduce or remove carrier aggregation information from the UE capability message to increase the chance of successful registration with the PLMN. The use and implementation of PLMN manager 144 and/or UE capability manager 146 may vary in accordance with one or more aspects and is described throughout the disclosure.
Example apparatus
Fig. 2 illustrates a device diagram 200 of an example UE 102. UE 102 may be implemented as any suitable device, some of which are illustrated as smart phones 202, tablet computers 204, laptop computers 206, wearable computing devices 208 (e.g., smart watches), broadband routers 210 (e.g., mobile hotspots), and car computing systems 212 (e.g., navigation and entertainment systems). Although not shown, the UE 102 may also be implemented as any of the following: a mobile station (e.g., a fixed or mobile STA), a mobile communication device, a user device, a client device, a mobile phone, an entertainment device, a gaming device, a mobile gaming machine, a personal media device, a media playback device, an ADAS, a POS transaction system, a health monitoring device, an drone, a camera, a wearable smart device, a navigation device, a MID, an internet appliance capable of wireless internet access and browsing, an IoT device, a 5G NR user device, and/or other types of user devices. The UE 102 may include additional functions, components, or interfaces omitted from fig. 2 for clarity or visual brevity.
In this example, the UE 102 includes one or more antennas 214, a radio frequency front end 216 (RF front end 216), and at least one transceiver 218 for communicating with the base stations 108-114 of PLMNs 104 and 106, other wireless networks (e.g., WLANs), or other wireless communication enabled devices. Alternatively or additionally, any of the components of the UE 102 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of the UE 102.
The transceiver(s) 218 may include one or more of an LTE transceiver, a 5G NR transceiver, other types of transceivers configured to operate over a wide area network or cellular network, and/or another transceiver(s). The RF front end 216 of the UE 102 can couple or connect the transceiver(s) 218 to the antenna 214 to facilitate various types of wireless communications, such as acquiring and maintaining a connection with one of the base stations 108-114 of the PLMN 104 or PLMN 106. For example, the PLMN manager 144 of the UE 102 may utilize the connection scan to search for available network cells (e.g., base stations) of the PLMNs 104 and/or 106 for acquisition. The antenna 214 of the UE 102 may include an array of multiple antennas configured similarly or differently from one another. The antenna 214 and the RF front-end 216 can be tuned to, and/or tunable to, one or more frequency bands defined by the wireless communication standard and implemented by the transceiver(s) 218 of the UE 102.
The UE 102 may also include one or more sensors 220 that enable the UE 102 to sense various properties, changes, stimuli, or characteristics of the environment in which the UE 102 operates. For example, the sensor 220 may include various motion sensors, radar sensors, ambient light sensors, acoustic sensors, capacitive sensors, infrared sensors, temperature sensors, or magnetic sensors. Alternatively or additionally, the sensor 220 may enable interaction with a user of the UE 102 or receive input from the user of the UE 102, such as through touch sensing or proximity sensing. In some aspects, the UE 102 or the PLMN manager 144 can monitor the sensors 220, such as to receive input or feedback via one of the sensors 220. The data provided by the sensor 220 may be accessed by other entities of the UE 102, such as the PLMN manager 144. Although not shown, the sensor 220 may also include a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, a magnetometer, a microelectromechanical system (MEMS), an internal/external device temperature sensor, a resistive touch sensor, or input sensing logic associated with a hardware switch (e.g., a keyboard, dome, or dial), etc.
In some aspects, the PLMN manager 144 or the UE capability manager 146 can determine a motion state of the UE 102, such as an motionless state with no movement or a mobility state with the UE moving. For example, an accelerometer or gyroscope can sense movement or orientation of the UE 102 in any suitable aspect, such as in one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions, multiple axes, combined multiple axes, and so forth. Alternatively or additionally, a position sensor, such as a GNSS, may indicate a distance traveled, a rate of travel, or an absolute or relative position of the UE 102. The capacitive or proximity sensor may indicate that the location of the UE 102 is static or changing relative to the user (e.g., holding or redirecting the UE). In addition, other environmental sensors may indicate the internal or external temperature and humidity of the UE 102. Accordingly, the PLMN manager 144 or the UE capability manager 146 may access data from the sensors 220 and alter the UE capability information or PLMN status (e.g., blocked or blocked from unblocking) of the UE 102 in accordance with one or more aspects of adaptive connection management based on the sensor data (e.g., motion, orientation, temperature, proximity).
The UE 102 also includes a processor(s) 222 and a computer-readable storage medium 224 (CRM 224). Processor(s) 222 may be single-core processors or multi-core processors composed of various materials such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectrics, copper, and the like. The computer-readable storage medium 224 is configured as a storage device and thus does not include a transient signal or carrier wave. CRM 224 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as Random Access Memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NV-RAM), read Only Memory (ROM), or flash memory, that may be used to store device data 226 for UE 102.
UE data 226 may include user data, multimedia data, beamforming codebooks, applications 228, user interface(s) 230, and/or an operating system of UE 102, which may be executed by processor(s) 222 to enable user plane communications, control plane signaling, and user interaction with UE 102. The user interface 230 can be configured to receive input from a user of the UE 102, such as to receive input from the user that can define and/or facilitate one or more aspects of adaptive PLMN management. The user interface 230 can include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that receives input information via touch input. In other cases, the user interface 230 includes an intelligent assistant that receives input information via audible input or voice. Alternatively or additionally, the operating system of the UE 102 may be maintained as firmware or applications on the CRM 224 and executed by the processor(s) 222.
The CRM 224 also includes a PLMN manager 144, PLMN information 232, UE capability manager 146, and UE capability information 234. In some cases, the UE 102 or the PLMN manager 144 accesses the PLMN information 232 to search for PLMNs (e.g., known or preferred PLMNs) or to obtain information for PLMNs. PLMN information 232 may be implemented as one or more data repositories, lists, or databases of information for various PLMNs, such as PLMN 104 and PLMN 106. PLMN information 232 may include an acquisition database of identifiers of previously acquired cells or PLMNs. PLMN information 232 may also include a temporary forbidden PLMN list for one or more PLMNs that are prevented from registration. Typically, PLMNs to which registration fails a predefined number of times (e.g., five failed registration attempts) are placed on the temporary forbidden PLMN list. The PLMN may remain on the temporary forbidden PLMN list until a timer (e.g., T3402 timer) expires. In some cases, the timer is set for a predefined duration (e.g., 12 minutes) or is configured based on a time parameter provided by the wireless network operator.
UE capability information 234 may include parameters or other information regarding the wireless communication capabilities of UE 102, such as supported profiles, carriers, bands, layer configurations, radio Access Technologies (RATs), and the like. In some aspects, the UE capability information 234 also includes Carrier Aggregation (CA) information describing CA band combinations supported by the UE 102. In general, the CA band combination includes a configuration name (e.g., ca_1c (b1+b1)), a CA type (e.g., in-band or inter-band), a number of carrier components, a band (e.g., LTE band), a maximum aggregate bandwidth, and the like. In various aspects, the UE capability manager 146 may modify or reduce the number of CA band combinations of the UE capability message to effectively reduce the size or length of the UE capability message. By doing so, the UE capability manager 146 may increase the probability of successful registration with the PLMN over a low throughput connection with a base station or cell of the PLMN (such as in poor signaling conditions or poor cell coverage).
In some aspects, the PLMN manager 144 or the UE capability manager 146 can be implemented with a machine learning or machine learning model that is trained to receive one or more types of input data (e.g., network or signal related characteristics) and in response provide one or more types of output data (e.g., modified UE capability information messages, signal related thresholds, or timers). For example, any of the thresholds used or determined by the PLMN manager 144 and/or CA band combination reductions of the UE capability manager 146 can be derived from machine learning algorithms using data collected by the UE 102 while in the field or use environment.
In some implementations, the input data can include one or more characteristics associated with an instance of the UE 102, such as a current external temperature, an internal temperature (e.g., of the UE), humidity, UE orientation, UE mobility state, active antenna(s), blocked antenna(s), signal related parameters, number of failed registration attempts, size of previously successful UE capability messages with reduced CA combinations, and so forth. In some implementations, one or more features associated with an instance or example can be organized into feature vectors. In some implementations, the output data can include one or more predictions or inferences. Thus, given features associated with a particular instance of the UE 102 or PLMN manager 144, the machine learning model can output predictions or adjustments for such instance based on these features, which can include adaptive signal correlation thresholds (e.g., for signaling conditions), adaptive CA band combination reduction of UE capability messages, adaptive parameters for PLMN unblocking, and so forth.
As an example, the machine learning model may be or include one or more of a variety of different types of machine learning models. In particular, in some implementations, the machine learning model is capable of performing classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, recommendation generation, and/or other tasks. In some implementations, the machine learning model can provide the output data in the form of one or more recommendations, adjustments, or alterations. In some cases, the machine learning model is included or embodied in the PLMN manager 144 or the UE capability manager 146 of the UE 102.
As an example, given input data describing previous results for certain entities (e.g., a score, rank, signal strength, or rating indicating network connection quality), the machine learning model can output suggestions or recommendations of one or more additional entities or parameters that are expected to have a desired result based on the previous results, such as faster network registration when moving to a good signal area or successful registration with a PLMN in a poor signal area using a modified UE capability message. As one example, given a previous successful registration using a modified UE capability message (e.g., how many CA combinations were previously removed for successful registration), the UE capability manager can output a suggestion or recommendation for how many or which CA combinations to remove from the UE capability message to reduce the size of the message so that registration with the PLMN is likely to be successful in the poor signal region.
Aspects and functionality of the UE 102 may operate via operating system controls presented through at least one application programming interface 236 (API 236). In some aspects, PLMN manager 144, UE capability manager 146, or an application of UE 102 accesses API 236 (or API service) of UE 102 to control aspects and functionality of user equipment or transceiver 218. For example, the PLMN manager 144 can access low-level network enablement/connection settings of the UE 102 to enable aspects of adaptive PLMN management, such as to identify (e.g., flag) PLMNs to be blocked as being blocked due to signal-related conditions (e.g., low received signal strength), to verify or recheck signal-related conditions, or to unblock PLMNs. The CRM 224 of the UE 102 may also include a user equipment manager (not shown) that can be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the UE 102. In at least some aspects, the user equipment manager configures the RF front end 216 and/or transceiver(s) 218 to implement techniques for adaptive PLMN management as described herein.
The UE 102 also includes a display 238 for displaying and/or providing information to a user. For example, through the display 238, the UE 102 may provide information to the user regarding available network cells, connection status of the UE 102 (e.g., performing attach or TAU procedures), enabling user-initiated cell reselection, indication of blocked PLMN timers, indication of reduced network capability but active, and so forth. Based on such information, the user may choose to initiate a registration procedure through user interface 230, attempt to resend the UE capability message with the increased CA band combination, or adjust the threshold and/or offset that the connection is determined to be bad (e.g., received signal power less than-117 to-120 dBm) or good (e.g., received signal power equal to or greater than-110 dBm).
Fig. 3 illustrates a device diagram 300 that may represent or correspond to an example base station 302 of one of the base stations 108-114 as described with reference to fig. 1. The base station 302 of the example device diagram 300 may include additional functions, components, and/or interfaces omitted from fig. 3 for clarity or visual brevity. In the device diagram 300, the base station 302 is generally illustrated as a single network node (e.g., gNodeB or serving cell). The functionality of base station 302 and/or base stations 108-114 may be distributed across multiple network nodes or devices and may be distributed in any manner suitable for performing the functions described herein.
The base station 302 includes an antenna 304, a radio frequency front end 306 (RF front end 306), and one or more transceivers 308 for communicating with the UE 102 or providing connectivity for the UE 102. The RF front end 306 of the base station 302 can couple or connect the transceiver(s) 308 to the antenna 304 to facilitate various types of wireless communications. Antenna 304 of base station 302 may include an array of multiple antennas configured similarly or differently from each other. Antenna 304 and RF front end 306 can be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands defined by the communication standard and implemented by transceiver(s) 308.
The base station 302 also includes a processor(s) 310 and a computer-readable storage medium 312 (CRM 312). Processor(s) 310 may be single-core processors or multi-core processors composed of various materials such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectrics, copper, and the like. The CRM 312 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NV-RAM, ROM, or flash memory, that may be used to store the base station data 314 of the base station 302. The base station data 314 may include network scheduling data, radio resource management data, beamforming codebooks, applications, and/or operating systems of the base station 302, which may be executed by the processor(s) 310 to enable communication with the UE 102.
CRM 312 also includes network connection parameters 316 and base station manager 318. In some aspects, the network connection parameters 316 are predefined or configured by the wireless network provider to specify or indicate one or more parameters or thresholds that may be used by the user device to register (e.g., attach or TAU) with a network cell or base station of the wireless network. For example, the network connection parameters may specify an available frequency band for one or more network cells (e.g., base stations), a timer setting, a frequency band priority, a minimum signal strength for network cell connections, a minimum bit error rate or packet error rate for maintaining connections, and so forth. As described herein, the UE 102 may receive the network connection parameters 316 from the base station 302 or alter the network connection parameters 316 in accordance with one or more aspects. Alternatively or additionally, the UE 102 may be preconfigured with network connection parameters 316 or receive network connection parameters 316 via a different data interface, such as a WLAN or Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN).
In some aspects, the base station manager 318 configures the transceiver 308 for communication with the UE 102 or for communication with a core network. The base station 302 includes an inter-base station interface 320, such as an Xn interface and/or an X2 interface, which is configured by the base station manager 318 to exchange user plane and control plane data between another base station (e.g., base station 108, 110, 112, or 114)) and manage the connection of the base station 302 with the UE 102. The base station 302 also includes a core network interface 322 that the base station manager 318 can configure to exchange user plane and control plane data with the core network 124 or 126, core network functions, or other core linking entities. The core network interface 322 may include interfaces such as the NG2 interface, NG3 interface, and/or S1 interface described herein with reference to fig. 1. Alternatively or additionally, components of base station 302, such as base station manager 318, may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of base station 302.
Fig. 4 illustrates a diagram of an example network protocol stack 400 through which a UE may communicate with entities of a PLMN in accordance with one or more aspects. In general, the network protocol stack 400 (stack 400) characterizes the communication system of the example environment 100 in which the UE 102 communicates with entities (such as cells or core networks) of the PLMNs 104 and 106. With reference to the network protocol stack, the terms "upper layer" and "lower layer" are relative to each other, wherein each layer in the network protocol stack is an "upper layer" for the layers that are lower ("lower layers") in the protocol stack. For example, the upper layer may correspond to a non-access layer and/or the lower layer may correspond to a medium access control layer or a radio link control layer.
In this example, the network protocol stack 400 includes a user plane 402 and a control plane 404. The upper layers of the user plane 402 and the control plane 404 share a common lower layer in the network protocol stack 400. A wireless device, such as UE 102 or base stations 108-114, implements each layer as an entity for communicating with another device using a respective protocol defined for that layer. For example, the UE 102 uses an RRC entity to communicate with a peer RRC entity in the base station 108 using an appropriate RRC protocol or RRC connection.
The shared lower layer includes a physical layer 406 (PHY layer 406), a medium access control layer 408 (MAC layer 408), a radio link control layer 410 (RLC layer 410), and a packet data convergence protocol layer 412 (PDCP layer 412). In general, the physical layer 406 provides hardware specifications for devices that communicate with each other and the MAC layer 408 specifies how to transfer data between the devices. The RLC layer 410 may provide a data transfer service to a higher layer in the network protocol stack 400, and the PDCP layer 412 provides a data transfer service to a higher layer in the network protocol stack 400.
Above the PDCP layer 412, the network protocol stack 400 of the wireless network is divided into a user plane 402 and a control plane 404. The layers of the user plane 402 include an internet protocol layer 414 (IP layer 414), a transport layer 416, and an application layer 418 that uses the wireless connection 116 or 118 to transfer data. Although not shown, the user plane may also include an optional Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP) layer for quality of service (QoS) flow implementation and management in the 5G NR network. Generally, the IP layer 414 specifies how to transfer data from the application layer 418 to the destination node. Transport layer 416 may use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to verify that data packets intended for transfer to the destination node arrive at the destination node for data transfer by application layer 418. In some implementations, the user plane 402 may also include a data service layer (not shown) that provides data transfer services to transfer application data, such as IP packets including web browsing content, video content, image content, audio content, or social media content, among others.
The control plane 404 includes a radio resource control layer 420 (RRC layer 420) and a non-access layer 422 (NAS layer 422). The RRC layer 420 establishes and releases radio connections and radio bearers, broadcasts system information, or performs power control. For example, during registration with one of the PLMNs 104 or 106, the UE 102 may request an RRC connection by sending an RRC connection request message to one of the base stations 108 to 114 (e.g., eNB or cell) along with an establishment cause field (e.g., a "mobile originated signaling" value) for requesting attachment, detachment, or performance of a TAU. The UE 102 may then initiate registration with the PLMN 104 or PLMN 106 using the RRC connection, such as by transmitting an attach request message or TAU message to the network core via the NAS layer 422. As noted, poor cell coverage or weak signals for a connection may cause a registration attempt to fail, which may be detected as a registration failure due to release of an RRC connection by the network or due to an underlying cause (e.g., radio link failure), etc.
NAS layer 422 provides support for mobility management and packet data bearer context between UE 102 and entities or functions in the core network, such as MME 140 of EPC 124 or AMF 142 of 5gc 126. In UE 102, each layer of both user plane 402 and control plane 404 of network protocol stack 400 interacts with a corresponding peer layer or entity, core network entity or function, and/or remote service in the cell to support user application and control operations of UE 102 in RAN 120 or RAN 122.
Fig. 5 illustrates a diagram of an example registration state 500 between which a UE may transition during a network attach procedure or TAU procedure. As described with reference to fig. 4, to communicate with a wireless network, the user equipment 102 utilizes an RRC procedure to establish a radio connection to the network via a cell (e.g., base station, serving cell). Upon establishing a radio connection to the network via one of the base stations 108 to 114, the UE 102 enters a connected mode (RRC connection) in which the radio connection with the base station is active. When connected to a network over an active RRC connection, the UE can initiate a registration procedure to register with the network, such as one of PLMN 104 or PLMN 106. For clarity or visual brevity, the example registration state 500 does not include all possible UE states or transitions, and thus the UE 102 may transition to or from other states (or sub-states) not shown in fig. 5.
In general, the UE 102 may enter or maintain the registration state 502 through a registration procedure, such as an initial attach procedure or TAU procedure. As shown in fig. 5, the UE 102 in the deregistered state 504 may request attachment at 506 and enter a registration initiated state 508. From registration initiated state 508, if the attach request is accepted by the network (e.g., registration is successful) at 510, UE 102 may complete registration with the network in response to UE 102 entering registration state 502. Alternatively, the attachment failure at 512 may return the UE 102 to the de-registered state 504. The attach failure may occur during or after the transfer of the UE capability message to the network (e.g., as part of the attach request) during the attach procedure. In some aspects, the PLMN manager 144 or UE capability manager 146 determines that the attachment failure 512 is associated with or caused by a low throughput or signal related condition (e.g., weak signaling or poor network/cell coverage). For example, the UE capability manager 146 may determine that an amount of time between transmission of the UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds). Alternatively or additionally, the PLMN manager 144 or UE capability manager 146 can compare signal related characteristics (e.g., reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) or Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ)) to a threshold (e.g., -120 dBm) to determine whether the attachment failure is due to a signal related condition (poor signal strength).
For TAU, the UE 102 in the registration state 502 may request TAU at 514 and enter the TAU initiated state 516. From the TAU initiated state 516, if the TAU request is accepted by the network at 518, the UE 102 may complete registration with the network in response to the UE 102 entering or returning in the registration state 502. Alternatively, a TAU failure at 520 causes the UE 102 to enter the de-registration state 504. In some aspects, the PLMN manager 144 or UE capability manager 146 determines that the TAU failure 520 is associated with or caused by a low throughput or poor signaling condition. For example, the UE capability manager may determine that an amount of time between transmission of the UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., two to four seconds). Alternatively or additionally, the PLMN manager 144 or UE capability manager 146 can compare signal related characteristics (e.g., RSRP or RSRQ) to a threshold (e.g., -117 dBm) to determine if the TAU failure is due to a signal related condition (e.g., bad signaling).
Example method
The example method 600 and the example methods 800-1100 are described with reference to fig. 6-11B in terms of one or more aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In general, method 600 and methods 800-1100 illustrate a set of operations (or acts) that are performed in the order or combination of operations shown herein, but are not necessarily limited to. Further, any one or more of these operations may be repeated, combined, reorganized, omitted, or linked to provide a wide variety of additional and/or alternative approaches. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the example wireless network environment 100 of fig. 1, the example devices of fig. 2 and 3, the example systems of fig. 12-14, and/or the entities detailed in fig. 1, which are referenced by way of example only. The techniques and apparatus described in this disclosure are not limited to embodiments or implementations performed by an entity or entities operating on a device.
Fig. 6 illustrates an example method 600 for PLMN registration in accordance with one or more aspects. In general, the method 600 may implement adaptive UE capability management or adaptive PLMN management to enable registration with PLMNs under varying (e.g., improved) or marginal (e.g., poor signaling) network conditions. In some aspects, the operations of the method 600 are implemented by or using the PLMN manager 144, the UE capability manager 146, the PLMN information 232, and/or the UE capability information 234 of the user equipment 102.
At 602, a UE initiates registration with a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). Registration with the PLMN may include an attach request or a Tracking Area Update (TAU) request. In some cases, the attach request or TAU request includes a UE capability message of a band supported by the UE, a Radio Access Technology (RAT), and/or a Carrier Aggregation (CA) band combination. Alternatively or additionally, registering may include establishing an RRC connection with a cell or base station of the PLMN.
As an example, consider fig. 7, which illustrates an example message sequence diagram for PLMN registration in accordance with one or more aspects. Here, it is assumed that the UE 102 is attempting to register with the base station 110 of the PLMN 104 to access network services. For registration, the UE 102 sends an RRC connection request message 702 to the base station 110 (eNB or cell) of the PLMN 104. The UE 102 then receives an RRC connection setup message 704 including radio resource configuration information (not shown) from the base station 110. With the radio resource configuration information provided by the base station 110, the UE establishes an RRC connection 706 and may send an RRC connection complete message 708 (e.g., if sent separate from the attach request or TAU request).
Referring to fig. 7, the ue 102 then sends a request for registration, such as an attach request message or TAU request message, using the active RRC connection 706 at 710. The attach request message or TAU request message sent to the base station also includes a ue_ CapabilityInformation message 712 describing the frequency bands supported by the UE, radio Access Technology (RAT), and/or carrier aggregation frequency band combinations. As noted, the UE CapabilityInformation message 712 may have a substantial size due to the number of carrier aggregation band combinations supported by the UE 102.
Returning to fig. 6, the ue detects a failure to register with the PLMN at 604, which may include a failure of an attach request or a failure of a TAU request. The registration failure may include release of an RRC connection, radio link failure, or failure due to an underlying cause. In some cases, the UE may determine that an amount of time between transmission of the UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds). This may indicate that the UE cannot successfully transmit the entire UE capability message to the network within the guard time. In the context of the present example, when an RRC release message 716 is received from the base station 110 and the RRC connection is released by the UE 102 at 718, an attach request or TAU request failure is detected at 714.
At 606, the UE determines that the registration failure is due to a signal related condition of a connection with a cell of the PLMN. The UE may measure or monitor signal related characteristics of the connection with the cell of the PLMN. In some cases, the UE compares the signal correlation characteristics to a threshold (e.g., -110dBm, -115dBm, or-120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., bad signaling) or network condition (e.g., bad or marginal condition) associated with a cell of the PLMN. The signal correlation characteristics may include one or more of the following: received signal strength, received signal quality, reference signal received power, reference signal received quality, received signal strength indicator, carrier to interference ratio, signal to noise ratio, bit error rate, or packet error rate.
At 608, the UE implements adaptive UE capability management in response to the determination regarding the signal related conditions. In general, the UE may implement adaptive UE capability management in response to determining that the registration failure is due to or associated with poor signaling, marginal network conditions, or poor coverage provided by the cell. In some aspects, the UE predicts (e.g., through machine learning) or estimates a number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on CA band combinations sent in a previous successful registration attempt.
The UE then reduces or removes the CA information (e.g., one or more combinations of CA frequency bands) from the UE capability message to provide a modified capability message that is smaller in size. In some cases, the CA information is reduced based on a prediction or estimate of the UE. In other cases, the decrease in CA information may be predetermined, such as by half for each iteration of retrying registration. By doing so, the UE may increase the chance of successful registration with the PLMN when re-attempting registration with the modified capability message. Continuing with the ongoing example, UE 102 implements adaptive UE capability management at 720 to reduce the amount of CA information in UE CapabilityInformation message 712, which reduces the size of the message.
At 610, the UE retries registration with the PLMN using the modified UE capability message. This may include transmitting another attach request or TAU request with a modified UE capability message including a reduced number of CA information or a subset of CA information. The UE may re-attempt registration multiple times up to a threshold of maximum number of attempts or failures (e.g., five attempts or failures). With each iteration of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may remove the additional CA information with each retry registration. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may remove all CA information from the registration request, such as at the last registration attempt (e.g., fifth attempt).
Referring to fig. 7, the ue 102 retries registration with the PLMN 104 for attachment or TAU at 722. To do so, the UE 102 may reestablish the RRC connection 706 (if needed) and send another attach request or TAU request. The attach request or TAU request to retry registration includes a modified UE CapabilityInformation message with a subset or less carrier aggregation band combination than the previous request. As noted, the UE 102 may repeat multiple iterations of adaptive UE capability management such that subsequent registration requests include fewer and fewer CA band combinations to iteratively improve the probability of successful registration.
Returning to fig. 6, the method 600 may proceed to 612 where registration is accepted by the PLMN or to 614 where registration is unsuccessful. At 612, successful registration may be the result of retrying registration with a modified UE capability message that includes reduced or removed CA information. In general, adaptive EU capability management may enable user equipment to complete registration using modified UE capability messages under marginal or poor signaling conditions (which typically prevent registration due to low connection throughput).
At 614, the UE determines that registration has failed due to the maximum number of attempts. In some aspects, PLMN registration is prevented by adding the PLMN to the temporary PLMN list in response to the maximum number of attempts. In the context of the present example, UE 102 determines at 724 to exceed a registration (attach/TAU) attempt count.
At 616, the UE implements adaptive PLMN management in response to the determination regarding network conditions and registration failure. As noted, PLMN registration may be inhibited for a duration after a number of failed registration attempts. Here, the UE may search for available cells or preferred PLMNs or monitor network conditions of PLMNs while being blocked. Continuing with the ongoing example, after the attempt count is exceeded and the PLMN is placed on the temporary forbidden PLMN list, UE 102 implements adaptive PLMN management at 726.
At 618, the UE unblocks the PLMN to reattempt registration in response to the improvement in network conditions. As described, the UE may adaptively unblock the PLMN when signaling conditions of the UE improve, such as when the UE moves to an area with improved network coverage. As a result, the UE can register with the PLMN faster than is permitted by conventional techniques. In some cases, the UE can register with the PLMN after moving out of the bad signaling region (e.g., bad network conditions) without waiting for the entire duration (e.g., 12 minutes) as specified by the various communication specifications for PLMNs on the forbidden list. Ending the present example, the UE may try to do so by re-attempting registration by returning to 722 until the attempt/failure count is exceeded again and the PLMN is re-blocked.
Fig. 8 illustrates an example method 800 for adaptive UE capability management for marginal network conditions. In general, the method 800 reduces the amount of Carrier Aggregation (CA) information in a UE capability message for registration under poor network conditions. In some aspects, the operations of the method 800 are implemented by or using the PLMN manager 144, the UE capability manager 146, the PLMN information 232, and/or the UE capability information 234 of the user equipment 102.
At 802, the UE transmits a UE capability message to the base station as part of a request for registration with a PLMN. The request for registration may include an attach request or a TAU request for the PLMN. In some cases, the attach request or TAU request includes a UE capability message of a band supported by the UE, a Radio Access Technology (RAT), and/or a Carrier Aggregation (CA) band combination.
At 804, the UE detects a failure to register with the PLMN. The failure of registration may include a failure of an attach request or a failure of a TAU request. The failure to register with the PLMN may include release of RRC connection, radio link failure, or failure due to lower layer reasons. In some cases, the UE may determine that an amount of time between transmission of the UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than a predefined value (e.g., three seconds).
At 806, the UE determines that a signal-related condition for communicating with a base station of the PLMN fails to meet a predefined threshold. The UE may compare the signal correlation characteristics to a predefined threshold (e.g., -110dBm, -115dBm, or-120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., bad signaling) or network condition (e.g., bad or marginal condition) associated with the cells of the PLMN. From the determination operation of 806, the method 800 can proceed to operation 808 and/or operation 810, such as when a maximum number of registration attempts have not been made. Alternatively, the method 800 may proceed from operation 806 to operation 812, such as when the UE determines that the next registration attempt is the last registration attempt before the maximum number of registration attempts will be met.
At 808, the UE reduces the amount of CA information in the UE capability message. The UE may reduce the amount of CA information in response to a determination that the signal-related conditions of the connection with the base station are poor (e.g., weak signal coverage). In general, reducing the amount of CA information in the UE capability message includes removing many CA band combinations from the UE capability message. In some cases, the UE predicts (e.g., through machine learning) or estimates the number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on CA band combinations sent in a previous successful registration attempt. These CA band combinations may then be removed to reduce the size of the UE capability message.
At 810, the UE retries registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message with reduced CA information. This may include transmitting another attach request or TAU request with the modified UE capability message including a reduced number of CA information or a subset of CA information at operation 802. If the retry registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may reattempt to register multiple times up to a threshold of a maximum number of attempts or failures (e.g., five attempts or failures). With each iteration of adaptive UE capability management, the UE may remove the additional CA information with each retry registration. Thus, method 800 may repeat operations 802 through 810 until a maximum number of registrations are attempted. During the last iteration, method 800 may proceed from operation 806 to operation 812 in response to the UE determining that the next registration attempt is the last registration attempt before the maximum number of registration attempts will be met.
At 812, in response to the multiple registration failures, the UE removes the CA information from the UE capability message. For example, as a final attempt to register with the PLMN, the UE may remove any remaining CA band combinations from the UE capability message to minimize the size of the message and further increase the likelihood of successful registration with the network. In such a case, the UE capability message may include the minimum UE capability including the frequency band and RAT supported by the UE.
At 814, the UE retries registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message from which the CA information was removed. This may include transmitting another attach request or TAU request with the modified UE capability message including the minimum CA information or not including CA information at operation 802. If the registration is successful, the UE may then access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE may block the PLMN and implement adaptive PLMN management to enable fast reattachment when network conditions improve.
Fig. 9 illustrates an example method of altering Carrier Aggregation (CA) information useful for PLMN registration in accordance with one or more aspects. Generally, the method 900 detects a registration (e.g., attach request or TAU request) failure due to poor signal coverage during the UE capability query phase and gradually reduces the UE capability information in subsequent registration retries. In some aspects, the operations of the method 900 are implemented by or using the PLMN manager 144, the UE capability manager 146, the PLMN information 232, and/or the UE capability information 234 of the user equipment 102.
At 902, the UE transmits UE capability information to a cell of a PLMN as part of registration with the PLMN. The UE capability information may be included with an attach request or TAU request sent to the PLMN. In general, the attach request or TAU request may include UE capability messages for frequency bands supported by the UE, radio Access Technology (RAT), and/or Carrier Aggregation (CA) band combinations.
Optionally, at 904, the UE detects a signal related condition of the cell. In some cases, the UE compares a signal-related characteristic (e.g., RSRP or RSRQ) to a predefined threshold (e.g., -110dBm, -115dBm, or-120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., bad signaling) or network condition (e.g., bad or marginal condition) associated with a cell of the PLMN.
At 906, the UE detects release of a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection with the base station. The release of the RRC connection may be detected after transmitting the UE capability information to the cell of the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, the lower layer failure may cause a failure of registration or loss of RRC connection with a cell of the PLMN.
At 908, the UE determines that a duration between transmission of the UE capability information and release of the RRC connection meets a threshold. For example, the UE may determine that the amount of time between transmission of the UE capability message and release of the RRC connection is greater than three seconds (or another guard time). This may indicate that the UE cannot successfully transmit the entire UE capability message to the network within the guard time.
From the RRC release operation of 908, the method 900 can proceed to operation 910 and/or operation 912, such as when a maximum number of registration attempts have not been made. Alternatively, the method 900 may proceed from operation 908 to operation 914, such as when the UE determines that the next registration attempt will meet the threshold for the maximum number of registration attempts.
At 910, the UE determines a number of CA combinations to be removed from the UE capability message. In some cases, the UE determines or predicts (e.g., by machine learning) the number of CA band combinations that can be successfully transmitted to the network, such as based on the number or size (e.g., number of bytes) of CA band combinations sent in a previous successful registration attempt. Alternatively, the UE may remove a predetermined portion, ratio, or fraction of the CA combination from the UE capability message with each iteration of operation 910.
At 912, the UE removes the determined number of CA combinations from the UE capability information. The method 900 may then return to operation 902, where the UE retries registration with the PLMN using UE capability information with fewer CA combinations. If the retry registration is successful, the UE may access services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, method 900 may perform additional iterations of operations 902 through 912 until a maximum number of registrations are attempted.
At 914, the ue determines that the next registration attempt will meet a threshold for the maximum number of registration attempts. In other words, the UE determines that the next re-attempt registration will be the last attempt before the PLMN is blocked for a certain duration.
At 916, the UE removes the remaining CA combination from the UE capability message. For example, as a final attempt to register with the PLMN, the UE may remove any remaining CA band combinations from the UE capability message to minimize the size of the message and further increase the likelihood of successful registration with the network. The UE then reattempts registration with the PLMN using the UE capability message from which the CA information was removed. If the last registration attempt is successful, the UE may then access the services available through the PLMN. Alternatively, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE may implement adaptive PLMN management once the PLMN is blocked.
Fig. 10 illustrates an example method 1000 of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. In general, when the signal-related conditions improve, the method 1000 unblocks PLMNs identified as blocked due to the signal-related conditions. In some aspects, the operations of the method 1000 are implemented by or using the PLMN manager 144, the UE capability manager 146, the PLMN information 232, and/or the UE capability information 234 of the user equipment 102.
At 1002, a UE transmits a request to a cell for registration with a PLMN. The request for registration may include an attach request or a TAU request for the PLMN.
At 1004, the UE detects a failure to register with the PLMN. The failure may include a failure of an attach request or a failure of a TAU request. In some cases, the registration failure includes release of an RRC connection, a radio link failure, or a failure due to an underlying cause.
At 1006, the UE determines that the request for registration meets a threshold for a maximum number of registration attempts. In other words, the UE determines that a maximum number of registration attempts have been made before the PLMN is blocked for a certain duration.
At 1008, the UE prevents PLMN registration for a predefined duration. To block PLMNs, the UE may add the PLMNs to a temporary forbidden PLMN list configured to block PLMNs for a predefined duration (e.g., 12 minutes per T3402 timer).
At 1010, the UE determines that a signal-related characteristic for communicating with a cell of the PLMN fails to meet a predefined threshold. The UE may compare the signal correlation characteristics to a predefined threshold (e.g., -110dBm, -115dBm, or-120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., bad signaling) or network condition (e.g., bad or marginal condition) associated with the cells of the PLMN.
At 1012, the UE identifies the blocked PLMN as blocked based on the signal related characteristics. In some cases, the blocked PLMNs are marked, tagged, or identified in the PLMN database as blocked based on signal related conditions (such as a difference signal). Alternatively or additionally, this may enable the UE to track or monitor PLMNs on the temporarily forbidden PLMN list as candidate PLMNs for attachment when network conditions change or improve.
At 1014, the UE detects an improvement in signal-related characteristics of the blocked PLMN. The UE may monitor or measure signal related characteristics while the PLMN is blocked for a duration. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may periodically check network conditions to determine if signal correlation characteristics have improved. For example, a Better System Reselection (BSR) timer or other UE-specific event may trigger a cell scan in which the UE may detect an improvement or difference in the respective signal correlation characteristics of one or more cells.
At 1016, the UE unblocks the PLMN prior to expiration of the predefined duration. Typically, the UE unblocks the PLMN to enable another attempt when registering with the PLMN. In some cases, the UE unblocks the PLMN when the UE moves to an area with medium or good network coverage. In some aspects, detection of improved network conditions or unblocking may occur in response to a UE-specific event occurring during a duration that a PLMN will typically be blocked. Thus, adaptive PLMN unblocking may enable registration to be retried faster and/or with a greater frequency. For example, in the case of a 120 second BSR timer, the UE may check for signal conditions and/or retry registration (with 5 attempts) every two minutes, or six times within 12 minutes of the length of a typical temporary PLMN forbidden list timer.
Fig. 11A and 11B illustrate an example method 1100 of adaptive PLMN unblocking under varying network conditions. In general, the method 1100 unblocks a blocked PLMN that is indicated by a flag due to poor network conditions when the PLMN meets network conditions (e.g., signal strength improvement). In some aspects, the operations of the method 1100 are implemented by or using the PLMN manager 144, the UE capability manager 146, the PLMN information 232, and/or the UE capability information 234 of the user equipment 102.
At 1102, the UE detects an attach/TAU failure with the PLMN. The attachment may be an initial attachment or the TAU may be a periodic TAU. At 1104, the UE determines whether the attachment failure is the largest or last registration failure that results in a block to the PLMN. At 1106, if the attachment failure is not a maximum registration failure (false), the UE takes no further action with respect to the PLMN that prevented the attachment failure from being detected. The UE may reattempt registration with the PLMN by transmitting another attach request or another tracking area update request.
At 1108, if the attach failure is a maximum registration failure (true), the UE blocks the PLMN by adding the PLMN to the temporary PLMN list. The PLMN may remain on the temporary PLMN list until the T3402 timer expires, at which point the PLMN may be automatically removed from the PLMN list.
At 1110, the UE determines whether network conditions between the UE and a base station of the PLMN are poor (e.g., poor signal coverage). The UE may compare the signal correlation characteristics to a predefined threshold (e.g., 110dBm, -115dBm, or-120 dBm) to determine a signaling state (e.g., bad signaling) or network condition (e.g., bad or marginal condition) associated with the cells of the PLMN. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may determine that the signaling condition is poor in response to release of the RRC connection, radio link failure, or registration failure due to an underlying cause. At 1112, if the network conditions are not bad (false), the UE does not take further action with respect to marking or tagging the blocked PLMN with a flag on the temporary PLMN forbidden list. In some cases, the UE waits until the timer of the PLMN forbidden list expires before retrying registration with the PLMN.
At 1114, the UE marks PLMNs on the temporary forbidden list as blocked due to poor network conditions. By doing so, the UE may track or monitor PLMNs while on the temporary PLMN forbidden list. From fig. 11A, method 1100 proceeds to fig. 11B, where the operations of method 1100 continue as shown at 1116.
At 1118, the UE initiates a new registration procedure. The registration procedure may be initiated in response to user selection, a Better System Reselection (BSR) procedure, a UE-specific procedure, etc. At 1120, the UE performs a PLMN search, such as to obtain a preferred or previously associated PLMN, through an acquisition database of locally stored PLMN information. In some cases, PLMN searches are performed in response to initiation of a new registration procedure or a better cell reselection procedure.
At 1122, the UE reviews the search results of the PLMN search for searched cells that may be associated with PLMNs that are blocked due to poor network conditions. At 1124, if the search cell is not serving a blocked PLMN (false), the UE takes no further action with respect to those cells. At 1126, if the network condition (e.g., signal strength) of the searched cell of the blocked PLMN meets a threshold for reattempting attachment on the blocked PLMN, the UE unblocks PLMN registration before removing from the temporary PLMN forbidden list before expiration of time. In other words, the UE will temporarily unblock the PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list and will reinitiate the attach or TAU registration procedure. At 1126, if the searched cell does not meet the threshold for re-attempting registration, method 1100 takes no further action with respect to the blocked PLMN. Alternatively, if no PLMN is found during the search, the UE may perform a full band PLMN search.
At 1132, the UE successfully registers with the PLMN. The UE may then access the network service or resource and the T3402 timer of the temporary PLMN prohibit list will be stopped. Alternatively, at 1134, if the registration is unsuccessful, the UE returns the PLMN to the temporary PLMN list. In some cases, the timer of the temporary PLMN prohibit list is not reset and the UE may unblock the PLMN multiple times before expiration of the list timer (e.g., returning to operation 1118).
Example devices and systems
Fig. 12 illustrates various components of an example electronic device 1200 capable of implementing adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions in accordance with one or more aspects as described with reference to any of the preceding fig. 1-11. The electronic device 1200 may be implemented as any one or combination of fixed or mobile devices in any of the following forms: consumer devices, computing devices, portable devices, user equipment, user devices, servers, communication devices, telephones, navigation devices, gaming devices, media devices, messaging devices, media players, and/or other types of electronic devices or wireless-enabled devices.

In some aspects, a plurality of communication transceivers 1202, or components thereof, are operatively coupled to respective instances of antennas 214-1 through 214-n and RF front end 216 embodied on electronic device 1200. Antennas 214-1 through 214-n and RF front end 216 of electronic device 1200 may be implemented similarly or differently than antennas 214 and/or RF front end 216 as described with reference to fig. 1-11.
The electronic device 1200 may also include one or more data input/output ports 1206 (data I/O ports 1206), via which one or more data I/O ports 1206 any type of data, media content, and/or other inputs can be received, such as user-selectable inputs, messages, applications, music, television content, recorded video content, and any other type of audio, video, and/or image data received from any content and/or data source. The data I/O ports 1206 may include USB ports, coaxial cable ports, and other serial or parallel connectors (including internal connectors) for flash memory, DVDs, CDs, etc. These data I/O ports 1206 can be used to couple the electronic device to components, such as a keyboard, microphone, or camera, peripheral devices, or accessories.
The electronic device 1200 of this example includes at least one processor 1208 (e.g., one or more application processors, processor core microprocessors, digital Signal Processors (DSPs), controllers, etc.), which at least one processor 1208 can include a combined processor and memory system that executes computer-executable instructions stored on a computer-readable medium to control the operation or implement the functionality of the device. In general, a processor or processing system may be implemented at least in part in hardware, which can include integrated circuits or systems on a chip, digital Signal Processors (DSPs), application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), and other implementations in silicon and/or components of other hardware.
Alternatively or additionally, the electronic device 1200 can be implemented with any one or combination of electronic circuitry 1210, which electronic circuitry 1210 may include hardware, fixed logic circuitry, or physical interconnections (e.g., traces or connectors) implemented in connection with processing and control circuitry. The electronic circuitry 1210 can implement executable or hardware-based modules (not shown) through logic circuitry and/or hardware, such as an FPGA or a CPLD. Although not shown, the electronic device 1200 may also include a system bus, interconnect structure, crossbar switch, or data transfer system that couples the various components within the device. The system bus or interconnect structure can include any one or combination of different bus structures or IP blocks, such as a memory bus, a memory controller, a peripheral bus, a universal serial bus, an interconnect node, and/or a processor or local bus that utilizes any of a variety of bus architectures.
Electronic device 1200 also includes one or more memory devices 1212 that enable data storage, examples of which include RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NV-RAM, ROM, erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM), flash memory, and disk storage. Any or all of memory device 1212 may enable persistent and/or non-transitory storage of information, data, or code, and thus, transitory signals or carriers are not included in the general context of the present disclosure. For example, memory device(s) 1212 provide data storage mechanisms to store the device data 1204 and other types of data (e.g., user data). The memory device 1212 may also store the operating system 1214, firmware, and/or device applications 1216 of the electronic device as instructions, code, or information. Such instructions or code can be executed by the processor 1208 to implement various functionalities of the electronic device, such as to provide a user interface, enable data access, or manage connection to a wireless network. In this example, the memory device 1212 also stores processor executable code or instructions for providing respective instances of the PLMN manager 144 and the UE capability manager 146, which may be implemented similarly or differently than the PLMN manager or UE capability manager described with reference to fig. 1-11. The memory device also includes PLMN information 232 (e.g., acquisition database) and UE capability information that may be accessed by a PLMN manager or UE capability manager to implement aspects described throughout this disclosure.
As shown in fig. 12, electronic device 1200 may include an audio and/or video processing system 1218 for processing and/or delivering audio and video data to an audio system 1220 and/or a display system 1222 (e.g., a video buffer or device screen). The audio system 1220 and/or the display system 1222 can include any devices that process, display, and/or otherwise render audio, video, graphics, and/or image data. Display data and audio signals can be communicated to the audio component and/or display component via an RF link, S-video link, HDMI (high definition multimedia interface), display port, composite video link, component video link, DVI (digital video interface), analog audio connection, or other similar communication link, such as media data port 1224. In some implementations, the audio system 1220 and/or the display system 1222 are external or separate components of the electronic device 1200. Alternatively, the display system 1222 may be an integrated component of the example electronic device 1200, such as part of an integrated display with a touch interface.
Alternatively or additionally, the electronic device 1200 may represent an example implementation of the UE 102 as described throughout this disclosure. Thus, in some cases, processor 1208 is an example of processor 222 (not shown) and/or memory device 1212 is an example of computer-readable storage medium 224 (not shown) for storing various data, instructions, or code for implementing a diversity controller or other application. Thus, aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions as described herein can be implemented by the electronic device 1200 of fig. 12 or in conjunction with the electronic device 1200 of fig. 12.
Fig. 13 illustrates an example system on a chip (SoC) that may implement aspects of adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. SoC 1300 may be embodied as or within any type of UE 102, user equipment, apparatus, other device or system as described with reference to fig. 1-12 to enable adaptive PLMN management for varying network conditions. Although described with reference to chip-based packaging, the components shown in FIG. 13 may also be embodied as other systems or component configurations, such as, but not limited to, field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), application Specific Standard Products (ASSPs), digital Signal Processors (DSPs), complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), system-in-package (SiPs), package-on-package (PoPs), processing and communication chipsets, communication coprocessors, sensor coprocessors, and so forth.
In this example, soC 1300 includes a communication transceiver 1302 and a wireless modem 1304 that enable wired or wireless communication of data 1306 (e.g., received data, data being received, data scheduled for broadcast, packetized data, etc.). In some aspects, the wireless modem 1304 is a multimode-multiband modem or baseband processor that is configurable to communicate in accordance with various communication protocols and/or in different frequency bands, such as those described throughout this disclosure. The wireless modem 1304 may include a transceiver interface (not shown) for communicating encoded or modulated signals with transceiver circuitry.
The data 1306 or other system content can include configuration settings (e.g., PLMN information or UE capability information) of the system on chip 1300 or various components, media content stored by the system, and/or information associated with a user of the system. The media content stored on the system-on-chip 1300 may include any type of audio, video, and/or image data. The system-on-chip 1300 also includes one or more data inputs 1308 via which any type of data, media content, and/or input can be received, such as user input, user-selectable input (explicit or implicit), or any other type of audio, video, and/or image data received from a content and/or data source.
