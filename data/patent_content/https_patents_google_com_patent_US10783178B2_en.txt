Definitions
- Some note keeping computer applications and/or other computer applications enable a user to create note entries that include content that is explicitly set by the user. For example, the user may create a note of “call Bob.” Further, some computer applications may enable limited searching of the user created notes.
- the note keeping computer applications may only enable searching for note entries based on exact keyword matching between terms of a search and terms of the notes. For instance, “call Bob” would only be identified if a search included “call” and/or “Bob”.
- some note keeping computer applications may not automatically filter and/or rank note entries that are responsive to a search and/or may only do so based on limited user provided content.
- some note keeping computer applications may require that a user explicitly designate that content provided by the user is to be utilized to create a note entry and therefore do not create any entries for many types of input of the user, such as inputs provided during dialog with a personal assistant and/or during dialog with one or more additional users. Additional and/or alternative drawbacks may be presented.

- FIG. 6 illustrates an example architecture of a computing device.
- Implementations of this specification are directed to generating a personal database entry for a user based on free-form natural language input formulated by the user via one or more user interface input devices of a computing device of the user.
- the personal database entry may be generated by an automated personal assistant in response to natural language input provided to the automated personal assistant.
- a personal database entry is an entry in a personal database that is accessible to the user and non-accessible to a plurality of additional users that differ from the user.
- the personal database may be accessible to only the user and one or more applications and/or systems specified by the user and non-accessible by any other users, applications, and/or systems.

- the locational metadata may indicate a location of the user (e.g., a ZIP code, “home”, “work”, a City, a Neighborhood) when the natural language input was received.
- the additional user metadata may indicate one or more additional users to whom the natural language input was directed and/or one or more additional users who were engaged in communication with the user when the natural language input was received. For example, when the natural language input is received from an ongoing message exchange thread (e.g., chat, SMS) between the user and an additional user, the additional user metadata may indicate the additional user.
- an ongoing message exchange thread e.g., chat, SMS
- Implementations of this specification are additionally and/or alternatively directed to generating, based on one or more personal database entries of a user, output that is responsive to further free-form natural language input of the user.
- one or more entries that are responsive to further natural language input of the user can be identified based on matching (soft and/or exact) content of those entries (e.g., descriptive metadata and/or natural language input terms of those entries) to one or more search parameters determined based on the further natural language input.
- content of an identified entry may be utilized in generating the output and/or in ranking multiple identified entries (where multiple entries are identified) relative to one another. The ranking can be utilized to select a subset of entries to utilize in generating the response and/or to determine a presentation order of multiple pieces of content in a generated response (based on the rankings of the entries from which the multiple pieces of content were derived).

- the ranking engine 130 optionally calculates a score for each of one or more entries that are responsive to the query using the one or more criteria.
- the score of an entry may itself be used as the ranking for the entry, or may be compared to scores of other entries (where other entries are determined) to determine the ranking of the entry.
- Each criteria used to rank an entry provides information about the entry itself and/or the relationship between the entry and the natural language input.
- the ranking of a given entry may be based on conformance of a semantic label of descriptive metadata of the entry to a semantic label generated for the natural language input. For example, if a semantic label for one or more terms of the natural language input matches a semantic label in descriptive metadata of the given entry, the ranking of the given entry may be positively influenced.
- the ranking of the given entry may additionally and/or alternatively be based on conformance of locational metadata of the given entry to a current location of the user (e.g., determined by contextual engine 124 ) when the natural language input was received. For example, if a current location of the user is the same as, or within a threshold distance of, a location indicated by locational metadata of the given entry, the ranking of the given entry may be positively influenced.
- the ranking of the given entry may additionally and/or alternatively be based on conformance of temporal metadata of the given entry to a current date and/or time (e.g., determined by contextual engine 124 ) when the natural language input was received. For example, if a current date is within a threshold of a date indicated by temporal data of the given entry, the given entry may be promoted more than if the current date was not within the threshold.
- the ranking of the given entry may additionally and/or alternatively be based on memoryness metadata for the given entry.

- the rankings of the entries may be based on whether and/or to what degree the natural language input is intended as a request for personal information from a personal database of the user (e.g., as described above with respect to searching engine 128 ). For example, if characteristics of the natural language input indicate it is highly likely to be a request for personal information from a personal database of the user, any identified entries from the public database 154 may be demoted.
- the output generation engine 132 utilizes content of one or more entries identified by searching engine 128 , and optionally the rankings of those entries determined by ranking engine 130 , to generate output for presentation to the user as a response to the provided natural language input. For example, the output generation engine 132 may select a subset (e.g., one) of identified entries based on the ranking and may generate output based on the selected subset. Also, for example, the output generation engine 132 may additionally and/or alternatively utilize the ranking to determine a presentation order of multiple pieces of content in a generated response (based on the rankings of the entries from which the multiple pieces of content were derived).
- the output generation engine 132 may include one or more of the terms of the given entry that are from the natural language input for which the given entry was generated and/or may include output that is based on generated descriptive metadata for the entry.

- the automated personal assistant 120 provides a response 390 I that includes part of the steps for putting new tires on a bike.
- the response 390 I is an example of a response that may be generated by the automated personal assistant 120 based on a public entry of public database 154 .
- the further natural language input 380 H includes the terms “tires” and “bikes” that may also be included in a personal entry generated based on the user input 380 C ( FIG. 3A )
- the automated personal assistant 120 does not provide responsive content that is based on the personal entry. This may be based on one or more of various factors.
- a semantic label for the input 380 H may not match a semantic label for the personal entry generated based on the user input 380 C. This may lead to that entry not being determined and/or may negatively influence the ranking of that entry.
- the ranking for the public entry utilized to generate response 390 I may be higher than the ranking of the personal entry—and the response 390 I generated based on only the public entry based on a rule that dictates responses are to be generated based on only the highest ranked entry and/or based on only the highest ranked entry when its ranking score satisfies a threshold relative to the next highest ranked entry.
- the automated personal assistant 120 provides a response 390 J that includes content from a private database entry and content from a public database.
- the response 390 J includes content (“You put new tires on your bike on May 7, 2016”) that is based on a personal entry generated for the input 380 C ( FIG. 3A ).
- the response 390 J also includes content (“Do you want to learn how to install new bike tires?”) that may be based on a public entry of public database 154 .
- the automated personal assistant 120 may include content that is based on an entry generated for the input 380 C based on matching search parameters of “new” “tires” and “bike” to content of the entry.
- the content from the private database entry may be presented before the content from the public database based on a ranking of the entries underlying the content.
- FIG. 4A illustrates the client computing device 106 1 with the display screen 140 displaying another example of dialog that may occur between the user of the client computing device 106 1 and the automated personal assistant 120 according to implementations described herein.
- the dialog includes natural language inputs 480 A and 480 B provided by the user to the automated personal assistant 120 and responses 490 A and 490 B that may optionally be provided by the automated personal assistant 120 to confirm the assistant 120 has generated an entry in response to the inputs.
- FIG. 4A also shows, in parentheses, a date and a time that the user provided each of the inputs 480 A and 480 B.
- the dates and times may be utilized in generating descriptive metadata. The dates and/or times may optionally not be shown in the display provided to the user, but are illustrated in FIG. 4A for purposes of clarity.
- the display screen 140 further includes a textual reply interface element 484 that the user may select to generate user input via a virtual keyboard and a voice reply interface element 485 that the user may select to generate user input via a microphone.
- the display screen 140 also includes system interface elements 481 , 482 , 483 that may be interacted with by the user to cause the computing device 106 1 to perform one or more actions.
- the user provides first user input 480 A that includes “my locker combination is 7, 22, 40” and provides it at the “Gym” on “May 1, 2016” at “6:00 AM”.
- a first entry may be created for the first user input that includes one or more terms from the input, includes locational metadata indicative of the “Gym”, and that includes temporal metadata indicative of May 1, 2016 and/or 6:00 AM.
- the user provides second user input 480 B that includes “my locker combination is 40, 20, 10” and provides it at “Work” on “May 10, 2016” at “8:00 AM”.
- a second entry may be created for the first user input that includes one or more terms from the input, includes locational metadata indicative of “Work”, and that includes temporal metadata indicative of May 10, 2016 and/or 8:00 AM.
- FIGS. 4B and 4C each illustrates a portion the example client computing device 106 1 with the display screen 140 displaying dialog that may occur subsequent to the dialog of FIG. 4A according to implementations described herein.
- the user provides further input 480 C of “What is my locker combination?” and provides it at 5:45 AM while the user is at the Gym.
- the automated personal assistant 120 provides a response 490 C that is generated based on the first entry for the user input 480 A of FIG. 4A —and that does not include any content generated based on the second entry for the user input 480 B. This may be based on, for example, conformance of the locational metadata of the first entry to the current location of the user and/or conformance of the temporal metadata to a current time. Compare this to a situation where the user was at “Work” at “8:00 AM”. In such a situation the response may be generated based on the second entry and independent of the first entry.
- the user provides further input 480 D of “What is my locker combination?” that is the same as the input 480 C of FIG. 4B .
- the automated personal assistant 120 provides the response 490 D that is generated based on both the first entry for the user input 480 A of FIG. 4A —and the second entry for the user input 480 B.
- Generating a response based on both entries instead of just one may be based on, for example, the user's current location not conforming strongly to the locational metadata of either of the entries and/or the current time not conforming strongly to the temporal metadata of either of the entries.
- content generated based on the second entry may be presented before content generated based on the first entry based on the date of temporal metadata of the second entry being more proximal to the current date than that of the first entry.
- FIGS. 3A-3G and 4A-4C illustrate example graphical user interfaces that may be provided to a user
- responses provided by automated personal assistant 120 may be provided for presentation audibly (e.g., via a speaker), without necessarily providing graphical indications of those responses.
- a user may provide natural language input via a microphone and the automated personal assistant 120 may respond to such input with output that is configured for presentation audibly.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B present a flowchart illustrating an example method 500 of generating personal database entries for a user based on free-form natural language input formulated by the user and generating, based on one or more of the personal database entries, natural language output that is responsive to further free-form natural language input of the user.
- the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems, such as automated personal assistant 120 .
- operations of method 500 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- the system awaits natural language input.
- the system receives natural language input that is formulated by a user via one or more user interface input devices.
- the system determines whether the natural language input of block 552 indicates a request for personal information, such as a request for personal information from a personal database of the user. For example, in some implementations, the system may determine the input indicates a request for personal information if it includes one or more key terms (e.g., “What”, “Who”, “Where”, “my”, “I” and/or “don't forget”) and/or that includes those key terms in certain positions of input. Also, for example, in some implementations the system may additionally and/or alternatively y determine the input indicates a request for personal information based on output received in response to providing at least some of input to a classifier trained to predict whether and/or to what degree natural language input is intended as a request for personal information.
- key terms e.g., “What”, “Who”, “Where”, “my”, “I” and/or “don't forget”
- the system may additionally and/or alternatively y determine the input indicates a request for personal information based on output received in response to providing at least some of
- block 554 may be omitted (e.g., one or more of blocks 562 - 570 may be performed for each input) or instantiated (for the first time or again) after one or more of blocks 562 - 570 (e.g., the decision of block 554 may be based on whether any entries are determined at block 570 and/or may be based on the content and/or ranking of any returned entries).
- block 556 the system determines whether the input indicates a desire for recall. For example, in some implementations the system may determine the input indicates a desire for recall based on the presence of certain terms in the input (e.g., “remember”, “don't forget”) and/or based on output received in response to providing the input to a classifier trained to predict whether and/or to what degree natural language input indicates a desire for the natural language input to be “remembered.” In some implementations, block 556 may be omitted. For example, one or more of blocks 558 and 560 may be performed for each input or for each input that is determined not to indicate a request for personal information at block 554 and/or that satisfies one or more other criteria.
- certain terms in the input e.g., “remember”, “don't forget”
- block 556 may be omitted. For example, one or more of blocks 558 and 560 may be performed for each input or for each input that is determined not to indicate a request for personal information at block 554 and
- the system determines at block 556 the input does not indicate a desire for recall, the system proceeds back to block 550 and awaits further natural language output, optionally after providing an error output (e.g., “I don't understand your request”) and/or proceeding to other unillustrated blocks (e.g., blocks for searching a public database and/or providing other output).
- an error output e.g., “I don't understand your request”
- other unillustrated blocks e.g., blocks for searching a public database and/or providing other output.
- the system determines at block 556 that the natural language input of block 552 does indicate a desire for recall, the system proceeds to block 558 where the system generates an entry for the input of block 552 in a personal database of the user.
- the system in performing block 558 , the system generates descriptive metadata for the entry at block 558 A (e.g., based on terms of the input and/or contextual features associated with receiving the input) and stores one or more terms of the input of block 552 and the generated descriptive metadata in the entry at block 558 B.
- the system may then optionally perform one or more other actions at block 560 , such as providing output that confirms an entry has been generated for the input, then proceeds back to block 550 .
- the system determines one or more search parameters based on the input of block 552 .
- the system searches a personal database of the user based on the search parameters determined at block 562 .
- the system determines at least one personal entry of the personal database that is responsive to the search.
- the system generates natural language output based on content of the at least one personal entry determined at block 566 .
- the system may generate output based on a personal entry only when a ranking for that personal entry satisfies a threshold. The ranking may be for the personal entry itself, or for the personal entry relative to one or more other personal entries that may be determined at block 566 to be responsive to the search.
- the system provides the output of block 568 for presentation to the user via one or more user interface output devices.
- the system then returns to block 550 ( FIG. 5A ) and awaits further natural language input.
- the system may optionally search one or more public databases in the method 500 and may optionally generate output with content from the public databases.
- Such public database content may be included in output in combination with content from a personal entry and/or in lieu of content from the personal entry.
