- An application specific user interface may allow the safe use of media applications on a mobile computing device in conjunction with a vehicle-based computing device, while still presenting a unique user interface for different media applications.
- a mobile computing device such as a smartphone or tablet, may include a number of media applications, including, for example, music players that playback locally and remotely stored music, subscription-based music players and Internet radio players.
- Each media application may have its own unique user interface to display on the user's mobile computing device, which may allow the user to interact with and control the media applications via a touchscreen on the mobile computing device.
- the user may connect the mobile computing device to a vehicle computing device, for example, the head unit of an audio/visual system in a car, for example, using a wired or wireless connection.
- the user may then use one of the media applications on the mobile computing device, for example, to playback music through the car stereo.
- the media application may expose, for example, through an Application Programming Interface (API), the various features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application.
- API Application Programming Interface
- the vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application, which may include commands such as play, next track, previous track, and pause, and ranking inputs such as thumbs up and thumbs down.
- the vehicle computing device may then display, on a display that is part of the vehicle computing device, a user interface translated from a template user interface and the ranking of the features, and customized using a media application theme.
- the translated interface may include controls that allow the user to access certain features of the media application that are deemed safe to access while driving, while preventing access to other controls.
- the controls may be presented in a manner that makes them safer for a driver to use than the controls would be if they presented on the display of the vehicle computing device in the same manner as the controls are presented on the display of the mobile computing device by the media application.
- the template user interface may be used with any media application the user selects to use while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. This may allow for a standardized display for all media applications used through the vehicle computing device while still allowing the media applications to control media playback.
- Media applications may have their own themes, which may be used to customize the translated interface for the media applications. This may allow the translated interface to include controls for features that are unique to a specific media application, and may also allow for easier identification of which media application is currently being used, based on background colors, overall color scheme, and media application logos displayed with the translated interface.
- a mobile computing device such as, for example, a smartphone or tablet, may include any number of different media applications. Different media applications may have access to different media items from different sources of media, and may have independent media databases stored on the mobile computing device.
- Media players may have access to media items stored in the local storage of the mobile computing device, media items stored in remote storage accessible by the mobile computing device, or access to media items through subscription services.
- Media items may include audio tracks, such as music tracks, and videos. For example, a user may install three separate music players on their smartphone. The first and second music player may detect music tracks stored in the local storage of the smartphone, and may build their own separate media databases.
- the second music player may also have access to music tracks stored by the user in a remote music track storage service, and may include these music tracks as part of its media database, though the tracks may not be part of the media database built by the first music player.
- the third music player may have access to music tracks through a subscription service, and may have no media database, or, if the service allows for local storage, a media database that includes only music tracks the user has stored locally from the subscription service. These locally stored subscription service music tracks may not appear in the media database for the first or second music player.
- the different media applications may also have different user interfaces.
- Each media application may have a different placements for common media application user interface controls, such as play and pause buttons, and may include their own unique controls, such as thumbs up and thumbs down controls, or other controls for rating media items, or controls for posting messages to social media services.
- a music player may include a next track, previous track, play, and pause buttons, for controlling playback of locally stored music tracks, while another music player may include only a play, pause, and next track buttons, for controlling playback of music tracks accessed through an Internet radio service which may not allow skipping back to the previous track.
- the mobile computing device with the media applications may be connected to a vehicle computing device, which may be, for example, a head unit in a car, truck, or other personal vehicle, or any other type of vehicle.
- vehicle computing device may include a display, which may be, for example, a touchscreen in the center console of the vehicle, and may be connected to the vehicle's stereo system, allowing for audio playback.
- the mobile computing device may be connected to the vehicle computing device in any suitable manner.
- a smartphone may be connected to a car head unit using a USB cable, a Bluetooth connection, a device-to-device WiFi connection, or to an in-vehicle Wireless LAN.
- the vehicle computing device may access various features of the mobile computing device, and may, for example, allow for control of the mobile computing device through the controls for the vehicle computing device.
- a user may be able to, for example, view applications available on the mobile computing device using the display of the vehicle computing device, for example, through screen sharing or duplication, or through a separate interface that lists the available application, and run the applications.
- the display of the mobile computing device may also be used as the display for the vehicle computing device, which may not have its own separate display hardware, or may have simple display hardware not suitable for interaction with applications on the mobile computing device.
- the mobile computing device may be a tablet, and the tablet display may also be used as the display of the vehicle computing device.
- a media application may be run on the mobile computing device while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device.
- a user may use the controls for the vehicle computing device, such as a touchscreen display, to select and run a music player on a smartphone that is connected to the vehicle computing device with a USB cable.
- the media application may include an API that exposes the features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application to the vehicle computing device.
- the vehicle computing device may include a component, for example, a software application installed on the vehicle computing device or as part of the operating system of the vehicle computing device, which may access the API of the media application to receive a list of the features available in the application.
- the features may include, for example, controls used by the media application.
- the vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application based on, for example, how safe the features are for use by a driver during operation of the vehicle. For example, a play button may be considered very safe and ranked high, while a button that allowed for posting to social media services may be considered unsafe, and ranked low.
- the features of the media application may be combined with a template user interface and a media application theme to create a translated interface that may be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device for the media application running on the mobile computing device.
- the template user interface may include locations and sizes for the controls or buttons for different features, so that the features of the media application can be controlled through, for example, a touchscreen that is part of the display for the vehicle computing device.
- the template user interface may have a location for previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons, such that those controls are always displayed in the same location no matter which media application is being run on the mobile computing device.
- a first music player may include the features of previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons.
- a second music player may include next track, pause, and play buttons.
- the common features may be displayed in the same location on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- no previous track button may be displayed.
- Certain low ranked features may also not have displayed controls.
- the second music player may include the feature of a button for posting to social media services.
- the vehicle computing device may rank the button low enough that the button may not be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- Unique features of media applications may also be displayed on the translated interface, and may be taken from, for example a media application theme.
- a media application may include a bookmark button.
- the bookmark button may be taken from the media application theme, which may include a location, size, and icon for the bookmark button, and become part of the translated interface displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- the translated interface may also have different color schemes for different media applications. For example, a first media application may have a media application theme that includes a blue and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the first media application.
- a second media application may have a media application theme that includes an orange and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the second media application.
- the media application theme may also include an application logo, or different icons for common controls, that may be included in the translated interface. This may allow for the different translated interfaces to be application specific user interfaces, and may make it easier, for example, for a driver to tell which media application is currently being run based on the colors, logos, and other identifiers displayed on the translated interface, despite the identical placement of controls across different translated interfaces for different media applications.
- Media application themes may be created by, for example, the creator of the media application, and may be stored with the media application, or may be stored on the vehicle computing device.
- a media application may send its media application theme to the vehicle computing device to be used in a translated interface whenever the media application is run while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device.
- the media application theme may also be stored on the vehicle computing device, for example, with the template user interface, and retrieved whenever the vehicle computing device creates a translated interface for the media application.
- the translated interface for a media application may be used to control the media application in a similar manner to using the media application's user interface on the mobile computing device.
- Commands issued through the translated interface for example, by the touching of buttons displayed on the touchscreen of the display of the vehicle computing display, may be sent to the media application running on the mobile computing device.
- the mobile computing device may respond to the commands as if they were issued through the user interface of the mobile computing device. For example, a user may press the play button on the display of the translated interface, which may result in the media application beginning or resuming playback of a media item.
- the media application may still have access to any media databases the media application has stored on the mobile computing device and to any local, remote, subscription based, or otherwise accessible media items that media application has access to when run on the mobile computing device.
- an Internet radio player may still have access to Internet radio stations
- a subscription music player may still access music tracks through the subscription service
- a local music player may still play local music tracks based on the media database for the local music player.
- Media items played back using a media application on a mobile computing connected to a vehicle computing device may be played through the audio/visual devices attached to the vehicle computing device.
- the user may use the translated interface to start playback of a music track using a media application on the mobile computing device.
- the music track may be played through the vehicle's stereo.
- the audio signal for the music track may be processed through the media application, by hardware and software for audio processing associated with the vehicle computing device and vehicle stereo, or both. This may allow for the use of equalizer settings in media application on mobile computing devices when using the media application to playback audio through the vehicle's stereo.
- the API for the media application may also expose data to the vehicle computing device.
- the API may be used by the vehicle computing device to media database data such as media libraries and playlists, metadata for media items, available Internet radio stations, and other data associated with media applications.
- This may allow the translated interface to display metadata, for example, artist, album, and track title for music being played back using a media application, and allow the user to browse and select media items in a manner appropriate to the media application.
- the user may use the translated interface to view available Internet radio stations when running an Internet radio music player on the mobile computing device, or browse a library of available music tracks when using a local music player on the mobile computing device.

FIG. 10 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - An application specific user interface may allow the safe use of media applications on a mobile computing device in conjunction with a vehicle-based computing device, while still presenting a unique user interface for different media applications. A mobile computing device, such as a smartphone or tablet, may include a number of media applications, including, for example, music players that playback locally and remotely stored music, subscription-based music players and Internet radio players. Each media application may have its own unique user interface to display on the user's mobile computing device, which may allow the user to interact with and control the media applications via a touchscreen on the mobile computing device. The user may connect the mobile computing device to a vehicle computing device, for example, the head unit of an audio/visual system in a car, for example, using a wired or wireless connection. The user may then use one of the media applications on the mobile computing device, for example, to playback music through the car stereo. The media application may expose, for example, through an Application Programming Interface (API), the various features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application. The vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application, which may include commands such as play, next track, previous track, and pause, and ranking inputs such as thumbs up and thumbs down. The vehicle computing device may then display, on a display that is part of the vehicle computing device, a user interface translated from a template user interface and the ranking of the features, and customized using a media application theme. The translated interface may include controls that allow the user to access certain features of the media application that are deemed safe to access while driving, while preventing access to other controls. The controls may be presented in a manner that makes them safer for a driver to use than the controls would be if they presented on the display of the vehicle computing device in the same manner as the controls are presented on the display of the mobile computing device by the media application. The template user interface may be used with any media application the user selects to use while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. This may allow for a standardized display for all media applications used through the vehicle computing device while still allowing the media applications to control media playback. Media applications may have their own themes, which may be used to customize the translated interface for the media applications. This may allow the translated interface to include controls for features that are unique to a specific media application, and may also allow for easier identification of which media application is currently being used, based on background colors, overall color scheme, and media application logos displayed with the translated interface.
- A mobile computing device, such as, for example, a smartphone or tablet, may include any number of different media applications. Different media applications may have access to different media items from different sources of media, and may have independent media databases stored on the mobile computing device. Media players may have access to media items stored in the local storage of the mobile computing device, media items stored in remote storage accessible by the mobile computing device, or access to media items through subscription services. Media items may include audio tracks, such as music tracks, and videos. For example, a user may install three separate music players on their smartphone. The first and second music player may detect music tracks stored in the local storage of the smartphone, and may build their own separate media databases. The second music player may also have access to music tracks stored by the user in a remote music track storage service, and may include these music tracks as part of its media database, though the tracks may not be part of the media database built by the first music player. The third music player may have access to music tracks through a subscription service, and may have no media database, or, if the service allows for local storage, a media database that includes only music tracks the user has stored locally from the subscription service. These locally stored subscription service music tracks may not appear in the media database for the first or second music player.
- The different media applications may also have different user interfaces. Each media application may have a different placements for common media application user interface controls, such as play and pause buttons, and may include their own unique controls, such as thumbs up and thumbs down controls, or other controls for rating media items, or controls for posting messages to social media services. For example, a music player may include a next track, previous track, play, and pause buttons, for controlling playback of locally stored music tracks, while another music player may include only a play, pause, and next track buttons, for controlling playback of music tracks accessed through an Internet radio service which may not allow skipping back to the previous track.
- The mobile computing device with the media applications may be connected to a vehicle computing device, which may be, for example, a head unit in a car, truck, or other personal vehicle, or any other type of vehicle. The vehicle computing device may include a display, which may be, for example, a touchscreen in the center console of the vehicle, and may be connected to the vehicle's stereo system, allowing for audio playback. The mobile computing device may be connected to the vehicle computing device in any suitable manner. For example, a smartphone may be connected to a car head unit using a USB cable, a Bluetooth connection, a device-to-device WiFi connection, or to an in-vehicle Wireless LAN. This may allow the vehicle computing device to access various features of the mobile computing device, and may, for example, allow for control of the mobile computing device through the controls for the vehicle computing device. A user may be able to, for example, view applications available on the mobile computing device using the display of the vehicle computing device, for example, through screen sharing or duplication, or through a separate interface that lists the available application, and run the applications. In some implementations, the display of the mobile computing device may also be used as the display for the vehicle computing device, which may not have its own separate display hardware, or may have simple display hardware not suitable for interaction with applications on the mobile computing device. For example, the mobile computing device may be a tablet, and the tablet display may also be used as the display of the vehicle computing device.
- A media application may be run on the mobile computing device while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. For example, a user may use the controls for the vehicle computing device, such as a touchscreen display, to select and run a music player on a smartphone that is connected to the vehicle computing device with a USB cable. The media application may include an API that exposes the features of the media application and the data accessible by the media application to the vehicle computing device. The vehicle computing device may include a component, for example, a software application installed on the vehicle computing device or as part of the operating system of the vehicle computing device, which may access the API of the media application to receive a list of the features available in the application. The features may include, for example, controls used by the media application. The vehicle computing device may rank the features of the media application based on, for example, how safe the features are for use by a driver during operation of the vehicle. For example, a play button may be considered very safe and ranked high, while a button that allowed for posting to social media services may be considered unsafe, and ranked low.
- The features of the media application may be combined with a template user interface and a media application theme to create a translated interface that may be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device for the media application running on the mobile computing device. The template user interface may include locations and sizes for the controls or buttons for different features, so that the features of the media application can be controlled through, for example, a touchscreen that is part of the display for the vehicle computing device. For example, the template user interface may have a location for previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons, such that those controls are always displayed in the same location no matter which media application is being run on the mobile computing device. For example, a first music player may include the features of previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons. A second music player may include next track, pause, and play buttons. When either the first or second music player is run on the mobile computing device connected to the vehicle computing device, the common features may be displayed in the same location on the display of the vehicle computing device. When the second music player is running, no previous track button may be displayed. Certain low ranked features may also not have displayed controls. For example, the second music player may include the feature of a button for posting to social media services. The vehicle computing device may rank the button low enough that the button may not be displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device.
- Unique features of media applications may also be displayed on the translated interface, and may be taken from, for example a media application theme. For example, a media application may include a bookmark button. When a media application lists a bookmark button among its features, the bookmark button may be taken from the media application theme, which may include a location, size, and icon for the bookmark button, and become part of the translated interface displayed on the display of the vehicle computing device. The translated interface may also have different color schemes for different media applications. For example, a first media application may have a media application theme that includes a blue and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the first media application. A second media application may have a media application theme that includes an orange and white color scheme, which may be applied to the translated interface for the second media application. The media application theme may also include an application logo, or different icons for common controls, that may be included in the translated interface. This may allow for the different translated interfaces to be application specific user interfaces, and may make it easier, for example, for a driver to tell which media application is currently being run based on the colors, logos, and other identifiers displayed on the translated interface, despite the identical placement of controls across different translated interfaces for different media applications.
- Media application themes may be created by, for example, the creator of the media application, and may be stored with the media application, or may be stored on the vehicle computing device. For example, a media application may send its media application theme to the vehicle computing device to be used in a translated interface whenever the media application is run while the mobile computing device is connected to the vehicle computing device. The media application theme may also be stored on the vehicle computing device, for example, with the template user interface, and retrieved whenever the vehicle computing device creates a translated interface for the media application.
- The translated interface for a media application may be used to control the media application in a similar manner to using the media application's user interface on the mobile computing device. Commands issued through the translated interface, for example, by the touching of buttons displayed on the touchscreen of the display of the vehicle computing display, may be sent to the media application running on the mobile computing device. The mobile computing device may respond to the commands as if they were issued through the user interface of the mobile computing device. For example, a user may press the play button on the display of the translated interface, which may result in the media application beginning or resuming playback of a media item. The media application may still have access to any media databases the media application has stored on the mobile computing device and to any local, remote, subscription based, or otherwise accessible media items that media application has access to when run on the mobile computing device. For example, an Internet radio player may still have access to Internet radio stations, a subscription music player may still access music tracks through the subscription service, and a local music player may still play local music tracks based on the media database for the local music player.
- Media items played back using a media application on a mobile computing connected to a vehicle computing device may be played through the audio/visual devices attached to the vehicle computing device. For example, the user may use the translated interface to start playback of a music track using a media application on the mobile computing device. The music track may be played through the vehicle's stereo. The audio signal for the music track may be processed through the media application, by hardware and software for audio processing associated with the vehicle computing device and vehicle stereo, or both. This may allow for the use of equalizer settings in media application on mobile computing devices when using the media application to playback audio through the vehicle's stereo.
- The API for the media application may also expose data to the vehicle computing device. For example, the API may be used by the vehicle computing device to media database data such as media libraries and playlists, metadata for media items, available Internet radio stations, and other data associated with media applications. This may allow the translated interface to display metadata, for example, artist, album, and track title for music being played back using a media application, and allow the user to browse and select media items in a manner appropriate to the media application. For example, the user may use the translated interface to view available Internet radio stations when running an Internet radio music player on the mobile computing device, or browse a library of available music tracks when using a local music player on the mobile computing device.

Avehicle computing device 200 may include avehicle interface translator 210, adisplay 220, acontrol interface 230, alocal wireless interface 260, awired interface 270, and astorage 240. Thevehicle computing device 200 may be any suitable device, such as, for example, acomputer 20 as described inFIG. 9 . Thevehicle computing device 200 may be a single computing device, or may include multiple connected computing devices, and may be, for example, part of the head unit of a vehicle's audio/visual system. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may use atemplate user interface 242 andmedia application themes 244 from thestorage 240 to generate a translated interface that may be displayed on thedisplay 220. Thedisplay 220 may be any suitable display device connected to thevehicle computing device 200, and may be used to display the translated interface. Thecontrol interface 230 may receive control input from a user, for example, the driver of the vehicle. Thestorage 240 may store thetemplate user interface 242 and themedia application themes 244 in any suitable manner. - The
vehicle interface translator 210 may be any suitable combination of hardware and software in thevehicle computing device 200 for accessing the features of media applications on a mobile computing device, for example, themedia applications template user interface 242 andmedia application themes 244 to generate a translated interface. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may access the features through the feature anddata access template user interface 242 may define locations, sizes, and positions, in a user interface for controls for common features of media applications. The translated interface may include controls for features of a specific media application in the locations, and with the size and shape, defined by thetemplate user interface 242 for those controls. Themedia application themes 244 may include media application themes specific to different media applications. The translated interface may be customized for each media application using a one of themedia application themes 244, which may, for example, change the colors use in the translated interface, add controls for features unique to the media application, add logos, or change icons for controls in the translated interface. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may also receive media application database data, including, for example, metadata for media items, and display the media application database data to a user using the translated interface on thedisplay 220, and translate commands for a media application received through thecontrol interface 230 to ensure the proper command is sent to the media application. In some implementations, thevehicle interface translator 210 may be run, for example, as an application or operating system component, on themobile computing device 100. - The
display 220 may be any suitable hardware and software for a display device connected to thevehicle computing device 200. For example, thedisplay 220 may be a touchscreen display in the center console of a vehicle. Thedisplay 220 may be used to display the translated interface to the user, who may be the driver of the vehicle, and to receive input through a touchscreen interface. Thecontrol interface 230 may be, for example, the touchscreen interface of thedisplay 220, and may also include hard and soft keys and other control devices inside the vehicle, such as, for example, play, pause, next track, and previous track buttons located on a steering wheel of the vehicle. In some implementations, thedisplay 220 may be the display on themobile computing device 100.

FIG. 3 shows an example arrangement for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. A user may bring themobile computing device 100 into a vehicle. For example, a driver may carry their smartphone with them into their car. Themobile computing device 100 may establish a connection to thevehicle computing device 200 using, for example, thelocal wireless interface 160 of themobile computing device 100 andlocal wireless interface 260 of thevehicle computing device 200. For example, the driver's smartphone may connect via Bluetooth to the head unit of a vehicle. Thevehicle computing device 200 may be used to select a media application, such as themedia application 110, to run on themobile computing device 100. Thedisplay 220 may display allavailable media applications mobile computing device 100, and the user may use thecontrol interface 230 to select and run themedia application 110. - The
vehicle interface translator 210 may use the feature anddata access 112 to access the features of themedia application 110. The features may include, for example, the various controls that would be used on the native user interface of themedia application 110, such as previous track, next track, pause, and play buttons. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may rank the features of themedia application 110, for example, based on how the safe the features are for use by a user who is driving the vehicle. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive thetemplate user interface 242 and one of themedia application themes 244 for themedia application 110 from thestorage 240, and combine thetemplate user interface 242 and media application theme for themedia application 110 with the ranked features to generate a translated interface. The translated interface may include the features of themedia application 110 that were ranked highly, for example, deemed safe enough to be used while driving. The translated interface may include controls for the features of themedia application 110 in positions defined by thetemplate user interface 242 and by the media application theme from themedia application themes 244, and not by the native user interface of themedia application 110. For example, the translated interface may include the controls in positions and sizes that make them safer for the driver to use when the translated interface is displayed on thedisplay 220. The translated interface may use a color scheme defined by the media application theme for themedia application 110, and may include a logo or other identifiable marking allowing the translated interface to be more easily identified as being for themedia application 110. - The translated interface may be displayed on the
display 220 of thevehicle computing device 200. The user, for example, the driver of the vehicle, may use the translated interface and thecontrol interface 230 to issue control commands to themedia application 110 on themobile computing device 100. For example, the driver may use a touchscreen of thedisplay 220 to press a play button on the translated interface. The pressing of the play button on the translated interface may be sent to thevehicle interface translator 210, which may translate the control command in order to relay it to themedia application 110, for example, using the features anddata access 112. For example, thevehicle translator interface 210 may translate the control command into an API call for themedia application 110. Themedia application 110 may receive the control command, and may respond as if the control command had been received through native user interface of themedia application 110. This may allow the controls of the translated interface shown on thedisplay 220 to control themedia application 110 as themedia application 110 were being controlled by its native user interface on the display of themobile computing device 100. For example, a music player running on a smartphone may be controlled from the display of a vehicle's head unit without requiring that the user issue any commands through the touchscreen of the smartphone. This may allow for safer operation of themedia application 110 by the driver of the vehicle, while not requiring that thevehicle computing device 200 implement any of the media access and playback functionality of themedia application 110. - The
vehicle translator interface 210 may receive media database data from themedia application 110, for display on thedisplay 220. For example, thevehicle translator interface 210 may receive, through feature anddata access 112, metadata for a currently playing media item from themedia items 142, taken from themedia database 144. Thevehicle translator interface 210 may also receive media library and playlist data taken from themedia database 144, to be displayed on thedisplay 220 using the translated interface. This may allow the translated interface to include any data about media items and media selection functionality that may be included in themedia application 110, for example, allowing the user to browse through themedia items 142 that are accessible to themedia application 110 andselect media items 142 for playback. For example, a music player on a smartphone may have access to locally stored music tracks, and may have built a library from those music tracks. The translated interface may be used to browse the library built by smartphone, rather than having thevehicle computing device 200 build its own library from the music tracks stored on the smartphone. The translated interface may, though thevehicle translator 210, may allow for use of themedia database 144 of themedia application 110 as if the native user interface of themedia application 110 were being used. The translated interface may use a different format, layout, or controls for accessing themedia database 144 through themedia application 110, as may be necessary to increase the safety of the use of the translated interface. - The
media application 110, controlled by inputs from thecontrol interface 230 to the translated interface on thedisplay 220, may play back media items, for example, from themedia items 142. Themedia items 142 that are played back may be output to thevehicle computing device 100, which may then output themedia items 142 appropriately, for example, through the vehicle stereo. Themedia application 110 may handle any decoding and processing of themedia items 142 necessary for playback, for example, converting encoded digital music into analog audio output. -
FIG. 4 shows an example arrangement for an interface for multiple media applications according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may be used with any media application on themobile computing device 100, including, for example, themedia application 130. Themedia application 130 may be, for example, a subscription music player. For example, a user may bring their smartphone into their car, connect the smartphone to the vehicle head unit via Bluetooth, and use thedisplay 220 andcontrol interface 230 to run a subscription music player on the smartphone. Thevehicle interface translator 210 may receive the features of themedia application 130, rank the features, and generate a translated interface for themedia application 130 using thetemplate user interface 242 and a media application theme for themedia application 130 from themedia application themes 244. - The translated interface may be displayed on the

This may allow the user to control themedia application 130 using thecontrol interface 230 anddisplay 220, accessing the data and media items available through the subscription service, and playing back the media items through, for example, the vehicle stereo, as if the user were using the native user interface of themedia application 130. Thevehicle computing device 200 may not need to be able to access the subscription service itself, as access may be handled throughmedia application 130 on themobile computing device 100. - The
media application 130 may have features in common with themedia application 110. The translated interface may include controls for these common features in the same location, having the same size and shape, as defined by thetemplate user interface 242, and different icons, for example, as defined by themedia applications themes 244 for themedia application 110 and themedia application 130. This may allow for easier and safe control of both themedia application 110 and themedia application 130, as the driver of the vehicle may not have to adjust to different control locations on thedisplay 220 when switching between themedia application 110 and themedia application 130. This may result in the driver needing to spend less time looking at thedisplay 220 in order to operate a touchscreen interface to control either of themedia application 110 andmedia application 130. -
