Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to a technique for protecting a user device from cookie theft. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to using co-located secondary devices to prevent cookie theft.
Background
A hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) cookie (hereinafter "cookie") may refer to a file that is stored at a client device and holds a quantity of data that is specific to a particular client device or application (e.g., browser). Existing service provider platforms (e.g., content sharing platforms, financial platforms, e-commerce platforms, etc.) can use cookies to authorize user accounts or client device applications during a session. For example, a user may log into the service provider platform using user account information (e.g., a user name and password). The service provider platform may authorize the user account and may send a cookie to the client device. Any subsequent requests to the service provider platform during the session may include a cookie in the request, where the cookie may be used to authorize the service requested by the user account.
Cookie theft occurs when a third party replicates a Cookie and uses the Cookie to impersonate a user of the client device. For example, cookie theft may occur when a user accesses a service provider platform through an unprotected or public Wi-Fi network. Using cookies, a third party may perform malicious actions, such as posting a false post on behalf of the user or transferring funds from the user account.
Disclosure of Invention
The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
In one aspect of the disclosure, a method includes a server receiving a service request from a first client device and receiving a first instance of an authentication token associated with the service request and generated by the first client device. The server may further receive a second instance of the authentication token associated with the service request and generated by the first client device from the second client device. In response to determining that the first instance of the authentication token matches the second instance of the authentication token, the server may process the service request.
A further aspect of the present disclosure provides a system comprising: a memory; and a processing device coupled to the memory, the processing device performing a method according to any aspect or embodiment described herein.
A further aspect of the disclosure provides a method comprising generating, by a first client device, a first instance of an authentication token and a second instance of the authentication token. The first client device may send a service request and a first instance of an authentication token to the server. The first client device may further send a second instance of the authentication token to the second client device. The first client device may further receive a response from the content sharing platform indicating that the first instance of the authentication token sent by the first client device to the server matches the second instance of the authentication token sent by the second client device to the service provider platform indicating that the server accepts the service request.
Optional features of one aspect may be combined with other aspects where appropriate.

Detailed Description
Aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure provide a mechanism for preventing cookie theft. The content sharing platform (or any other platform that provides services to the user) may use cookies to authorize service requests issued from user accounts or applications of the client device. The client device may be a Personal Computer (PC), notebook computer, smart phone, tablet computer, or the like. The service request may include a login request, a content upload request, a content search request, a content consumption request, a purchase request, and the like. To prevent third parties from copying cookies and using the cookies to impersonate users of client devices, existing systems may use secondary service verification methods, such as two-factor authentication, to authenticate certain service requests (e.g., login requests and purchase requests). The two-factor authentication may include the content sharing platform sending a verification code to another application associated with the user, such as to an email address or phone number. The user may then send the received verification code to the content sharing platform to authenticate the pending service request. However, using two-factor authentication is time consuming and cumbersome because the user may need to log out (or switch) of an application or website of the content sharing platform to retrieve the passcode. This results in undesirable delays, particularly if for each service request, additional time and computing resources may be consumed and inconvenience to the user.
Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by providing a mechanism that enables a secondary client device to be physically co-located (e.g., within a relatively short or predetermined distance, within a shared line of sight, etc.) to act as an authentication device capable of authenticating all or some types of service requests initiated by a primary client device to a service provider platform. According to some aspects of the disclosure, a primary client device and a secondary client device may register with a service provider platform. Two client devices may be associated with the same user account. For example, using a primary client device, a user may access their user account by providing user account information such as a user name and password. Once accessed, the user may register the primary client device with the user account using, for example, client device identification data (e.g., a device serial number, an identification number, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, location data, or other identification data associated with the primary client device, etc.). Similarly, the user may register the secondary client device with the user account by providing the user account information to the service provider platform via the secondary client device. In some embodiments, in response to registration, the service provider platform may send one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, to the primary client device and/or the secondary client device. The cryptographic key may be used to verify the identity of the corresponding client device. The primary client device and the secondary client device may each receive a different set of cryptographic keys.
The primary client device may then request the service provider platform to use the secondary client device as an authentication device. The authentication device may be a physically co-located secondary client device that is used to authenticate service requests issued by the primary client device. Using a co-located secondary device to authenticate a service request issued by a primary client device prevents a remote third party from impersonating a user of the primary client device because the third party must be physically located in proximity to the primary client device. In some embodiments, the type of service request that needs to be authenticated by the authentication device (e.g., secondary client device) may be predefined. For example, in response to user input, the service provider platform may enable secondary device authentication only for upload content requests and purchase requests.
In some implementations, the primary client device can issue a service request that requires secondary device verification to also generate an authentication token. The authentication token may include a random number, a random string, a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, and the like. The primary client device may then send a service request and an authentication token to the service provider platform. In some embodiments, the primary client device may attach an authentication token to the service request. In other embodiments, the primary client device may send the service request and the authentication token in two separate transmissions. The primary client device may further send an authentication token to the secondary client device (e.g., authentication device). In some embodiments, the primary client device may send the authentication token to the secondary client device using a short-range communication technique. Short-range communication techniques may be used to establish that the primary client device and the secondary client device are physically co-located. In some embodiments, short-range communication techniques may include, for example, wireless techniques such as point-to-point (P2P), Wi-Fi direct (Wi-Fi P2P), infrared technology, or ultrasonic technology. In some embodiments, the short-range communication technology may include wired technology, such as a cable connection (e.g., universal Serial Bus (USB) connector, ethernet connector, lighting connector, etc.). Once received, the secondary client device may send an authentication token to the service provider platform. In some embodiments, the secondary client device may first encrypt the authentication token or sign the authentication token using a private key and/or public key received from the service provider platform to verify the identity of the secondary client device.
The service provider platform may receive authentication tokens from both client devices, optionally using private and/or public keys to decrypt or verify the authenticity of the client devices, and compare the authentication tokens received from the primary client device with the authentication tokens received from the secondary client devices. In response to determining that the two authentication tokens match (e.g., the number or string of received transmissions from the primary client device is the same as the number or string of received transmissions from the secondary client device), the service provider platform may authorize or process the service request received from the primary client device. In some embodiments, the secondary client device may perform relaying (e.g., receiving and transmitting) the authentication token as a background process (e.g., a process performed without user intervention). Thus, each service request initiated by a user may be handled with little or no additional delay, with additional security provided via secondary device authentication.
In some embodiments, the physical co-location of the two client devices may be established using location data, such as, for example, internet Protocol (IP) addresses, media Access Control (MAC) addresses, global Positioning System (GPS) data, and the like. In particular, the primary client device and the secondary client device may send authentication tokens with corresponding location data attached to the service provider platform. Upon receiving the authentication tokens, the service provider platform may compare the location data of each token and determine whether the location data matches (e.g., determine whether the IP address appended to one authentication token corresponds to the IP address appended to another authentication token). In response to determining that the two authentication tokens match and that the location data appended to each authentication token also matches, the service provider platform may authorize or process the service request received from the primary client device.
Accordingly, aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure provide user protection for third parties that attempt to impersonate users by using a stolen cookie by authenticating a service request via a co-located secondary client device. The technique disclosed herein is advantageous because it overcomes the limited capabilities and functionality that current users can use to prevent unauthorized service requests from their accounts. Instead, the user can now securely issue a service request to the service provider platform with little or no additional delay and without generating a prompt that requires user input (e.g., without requiring the user to manually enter any verification code on any user device). In this way, the techniques disclosed herein enable a user to conduct a more secure session with a service provider platform and reduce the time and computing resources that would otherwise be consumed to support the user's switching to a different application or website to retrieve the passcode, generate a prompt to request the user to enter the passcode, and monitor and process the user's input.
For simplicity and brevity, embodiments of the present disclosure reference authentication of a service request for a content sharing platform. However, the teachings of the present disclosure may be applied to any service provider platform that utilizes cookies (or other authorization data), such as, for example, financial platforms, banking platforms, social media platforms, e-commerce platforms, and the like.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a system architecture 100 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The system architecture 100 (also referred to herein as a "system") includes a first client device 110, a second client device 120, a server 130, a network 150, and a data repository 135.
Network 150 may include a public network (e.g., the internet), a private network (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN)), a wired network (e.g., an ethernet network), a wireless network (e.g., an 802.11 network or Wi-Fi network), a cellular network (e.g., a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), a router, hub, switch, server computer, and/or combinations thereof.
The data repository 135 may be a persistent storage device capable of storing content items, such as media items, as well as data structures for marking, organizing, and indexing content items. The data repository 135 may be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage-based disks, tape or hard drives, NAS, SAN, and the like. In some embodiments, the data repository 135 may be a network-attached file server, while in other embodiments, the data repository 135 may be some other type of persistent storage, such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, or the like, which may be hosted by the service provider platform 130 or one or more different machines coupled to the service provider platform 130. In some embodiments, the data repository 135 may be coupled to the service provider platform 130 via a network 150.
The client devices 110, 120 may each include a computing device, such as a Personal Computer (PC), a laptop computer, a mobile phone, a smart phone, a tablet computer, a netbook computer, a network connected television, and the like. In some embodiments, the client devices 110, 120 may also be referred to as "user devices". In some embodiments, each client device 110, 120 may include a media player 112 (or media viewer), a link module 112, and a token module 116.
In some embodiments, the media player 112 may be an application that allows a user to play back, view, or upload content, such as images, video items, web pages, documents, audio items, and the like. For example, the media player 112 may be a Web browser that may access, retrieve, render, or navigate content (e.g., web pages such as hypertext markup language (HTML) pages, digital media items, etc.) provided by a Web server. The media player 112 may render, display, or otherwise present content (e.g., web pages, media viewers) to the user. The media player 112 may also include an embedded media player embedded in a web page (e.g., a web page that may provide information about products sold by an online merchant) (e.g., A player or HTML5 player). In another example, the media player 112 may be a stand-alone application (e.g., a mobile application or a native application) that allows a user to playback digital media items (e.g., digital video items, digital images, electronic books, etc.). According to aspects of the present disclosure, the media player 112 may be a content sharing platform application for a user to record, edit, and/or upload content for sharing on the content sharing platform. Thus, the media is playedThe server 112 may be provided to the client devices 110, 120 by the service provider platform 130. For example, the media player 112 may be an embedded media player embedded in a web page provided by the service provider platform 130. In another example, the media player 112 may be an application downloaded from the service provider platform 130. For simplicity and brevity, embodiments of the present disclosure refer to the media player 112 as an application for communicating with a content sharing platform (e.g., sending service requests, receiving content, etc.). However, in other embodiments, the media player 112 may be one or more applications that enable communication with other types of service provider platforms, such as, for example, financial platforms, banking platforms, social media platforms, e-commerce platforms, and the like.
In some embodiments, the first client device 110 may use the linking module 114 to couple (e.g., pair) and/or communicate with one or more second client devices 120. In some embodiments, the coupling may be based on short-range communication technology, and both client devices 110, 120 may be physically co-located (e.g., within a relatively short or predetermined distance, within a shared line of sight, etc.). In some embodiments, the first client device 110 and the second client device 120 may include wireless technology for establishing a short-range coupling between the first client device 110 and the second client device 120. Wireless communication techniques may include point-to-point (P2P), Wi-Fi direct (Wi-Fi P2P), infrared, ultrasound, or other technologies. In some embodiments, the first client device 110 and the second client device 120 may include wired techniques for establishing a short-range coupling between the first client device 110 and the second client device 120. The wired communication technology may include a cable connection such as, for example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector, an ethernet connector, a lighting connector, or any other capable connector.
In some embodiments, the linking module 114 may generate location data that can be used by the service provider platform 130 to establish that the first client device 110 and the second client device 120 are physically co-located. For example, the linking module 114 (of each client device 110, 120) may send location data associated with the respective client device 110, 120 to the service provider platform 120. The location data may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with the client devices 110, 120, media Access Control (MAC) addresses associated with the client devices 110, 120, geographic location data (e.g., global Positioning System (GPS) data, mobile phone tower data, wi-Fi access point data, etc.), any other location data, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the location data may be appended to other data, such as an authentication token or a service request. In other embodiments, the location data may be sent to the service provider platform 130 independent of other data. To establish physical co-location, the service provider platform 130 may compare the location data received from the client devices 110 and 120 and determine whether the location data matches (e.g., the location data indicates that the client devices 110 and 120 are in close proximity). For example, the service provider platform 130 may determine whether the IP address associated with the first client device 110 is the same as the IP address associated with the second client device 120 (e.g., if both client devices are connected to the same network at the same time).
The token module 116 may be used to generate one or more authentication tokens. The authentication token may be generated for a service request issued to the service provider platform 130 and may be used to authenticate the service request through the use of a verification client device (e.g., a client device physically co-located with the client device requesting the service). The service request may be any type of request issued by the client device 110, 120 to the service provider platform 130, such as, for example, a login request, an upload content request, a content search request, a consume content request, an approve content request, a disapprove content request, a comment content request, a setting change request, a personal details change request, a purchase request, and the like. In some embodiments, the authentication token may be a randomly generated number (e.g., a 64-bit number, a 128-bit number, etc.) or a string of characters. In other embodiments, the authentication token may be a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, or the like.
The authentication token may be sent by the client device 110, 120 to the client device 120, 110, respectively, and to the service provider platform 130. In some embodiments, the client device 110, 120 and/or the service provider platform 130 may perform an authentication process on the received authentication token by decrypting the authentication token, determining a cryptographic signature of the authentication token, and/or performing any other process associated with the authentication token, as will be discussed in more detail below. In response to authenticating the authentication token, the service provider platform 130 may accept or execute the requested service request. For example, the service provider platform 130 may initiate or continue playback of the requested digital media item, allow uploading of the requested digital media item, and so forth.
In some embodiments, the type of service request that needs to be authenticated (by the authentication client device) may be predefined. For example, the user may use the media player 112 to select the type of service request that requires authentication by a physically co-located authentication device, where all other requests may not require authentication by the authentication device. For example, in response to user input, the authorization data service 124 may enable verification device authentication for only login requests, upload content requests, and purchase requests.
In some embodiments, the service provider platform 130 may include one or more computing devices (such as rack-mounted servers, router computers, server computers, personal computers, mainframe computers, notebook computers, tablet computers, desktop computers, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disk, memory, database), networks, software components, or hardware components that may be used to provide users with access to or media items. For example, the service provider platform 130 may allow users to consume, upload, search, approve ("like"), disapprove ("dislike") or comment on media items. The service provider platform 130 may also include a website (e.g., web page) or application backend software that may be used to provide users with access to media items.
In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a "user" may be represented as a single individual. However, other embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate a "user" as an entity controlled by a set of users and/or automation sources. For example, a set of individual users that are joined as a community in a social network may be considered a "user. In another example, the automated consumer may be an automatic ingestion pipeline of the service provider platform 130, such as a theme channel.
The service provider platform 130 may include a plurality of channels. A channel may be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic, theme or substance. The data content may be digital content selected by a user, digital content available for use by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content selected by a content provider, digital content selected by a broadcaster, and so forth. For example, channel X may include videos Y and Z. The channel may be associated with an owner, which is a user that may perform an action on the channel. Different activities may be associated with a channel based on actions of the owner, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., enjoying) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, etc. The activity associated with the channel may be collected into an activity feed for the channel. Users other than channel owners may subscribe to one or more channels of interest to them. The concept of "subscription" may also be referred to as "like", "focus", "buddy" and the like.
Once the user subscribes to a channel, the user may be presented with information from the active feeds for that channel. If a user subscribes to multiple channels, the activity feeds for each channel to which the user subscribes may be combined into a syndicated activity feed. Information from the syndicated activity feed may be presented to the user. The channel may have its own feed. For example, when navigating to a home page of a channel on a service provider platform, feed items generated by the channel may be displayed on the channel home page. The user may have a syndication feed, which is a feed that includes at least a subset of content items from all channels to which the user subscribes. The syndication feed may also include content items from channels to which the user is not subscribed. For example, the service provider platform 130 or other social network may insert recommended content items into the user's syndication feed, or may insert content items associated with the user's related connections in the syndication feed.
Each channel may include one or more media items. Examples of media items may include, but are not limited to, digital video, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, audio content, melodies, website content, social media updates, electronic books, electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic romantic books, software applications, and the like. In some embodiments, the media items are also referred to as content or content items.
For simplicity and simplicity, and not limitation, video items, audio items, or game items are used throughout this document as examples of media items. As used herein, "media," "media item," "online media item," "digital media item," "content," and "content item" may include electronic files that may be executed or loaded using software, firmware, or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity. In one embodiment, the service provider platform 130 may use the data warehouse 106 to store media items 132. In another embodiment, the service provider platform 130 may use the data repository 135 to store video items or fingerprints as electronic files in one or more formats.
In some embodiments, the media item is a video item. A video item is a set of consecutive video frames (e.g., image frames) representing a motion scene. For example, a series of consecutive video frames may be captured consecutively or reconstructed later to produce an animation. Video items may be presented in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, analog, digital, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional video. Further, the video items may include movies, video clips, or any set of animated images to be displayed in sequence. In addition, the video item may be stored as a video file including a video component and an audio component. The video component may refer to video data in a video encoding format or an image encoding format (e.g., H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC), H.264MPEG-4 part 2, graphics Interchange Format (GIF), webP, etc.). The audio component may refer to audio data in an audio coding format (e.g., advanced Audio Coding (AAC), MP3, etc.). It may be noted that the GIF may be saved as an image file (e.g., GIF file) or as a series of images in an animated GIF (e.g., GIF89a format). It may be noted that h.264 may be a video coding format, which is a block-oriented motion compensation based video compression standard for, for example, recording, compression or distribution of video content.
In some embodiments, the media items may be streamed, such as in a live stream, to one or more of the client devices 110, 120. It should be noted that "streamed" or "streaming" refers to the transmission or broadcast of content, such as a media item, where the received portion of the media item may be played back by the receiving device immediately upon receipt or while other portions of the media content are being delivered (within technical limitations), and the entire media item has not been received by the receiving device. "stream" may refer to streamed or streamed content, such as a media item. A live streaming media item may refer to a live play or transmission of a live event, wherein the media item is transmitted at least partially concurrently when the event occurs to receive a device, and wherein the media item is not fully available.
In some embodiments, the service provider platform 130 may allow a user to create, share, view, or use a playlist containing media items. A playlist refers to a collection of media items that are configured to be played one after another in a particular order without any user interaction. In some embodiments, the service provider platform 130 may maintain a playlist on behalf of the user. In some embodiments, the playlist feature of the service provider platform 130 allows users to group their favorite media items together in a single location for playback. In some embodiments, the service provider platform 130 may send media items on the playlist to the client device 110, 120 for playback or display. For example, the media viewer 112 may be used to play media items on a playlist in the order they are listed on the playlist. In another example, a user may transition between media items on a playlist. In yet another example, the user may wait for the next media item on the playlist to play or may select a particular media item in the playlist for playback.
In some embodiments, the user may access content on the shared platform 130 through a user account. The user may access (e.g., login) the user account by providing user account information (e.g., a user name and password) via an application on the client device 110, 120 (e.g., the media viewer 112). In some embodiments, a user account may be associated with a single user. In other embodiments, the user account may be a shared account (e.g., a family account shared by multiple users) (also referred to herein as a "shared user account"). The shared account may have multiple user profiles, each associated with a different user. Multiple users may log into a shared account using the same account information or different account information. In some embodiments, multiple users of a shared account may be distinguished based on different user profiles of the shared account.
In some embodiments, the authorization data service 134 may authorize the user account such that the user account is licensed to obtain the requested content. In some embodiments, authorization data service 134 may authorize a user account (e.g., a client device associated with the user account) to access requested content, authorize delivery of the requested content to the client device, or both. Authorization of a user account to access requested content may involve authorizing what content to access and who is permitted to access the content. Authorization of content delivery may relate to how the content is authorized to be delivered.
In some embodiments, authorization data service 134 may use user account information to authorize a user account. In some embodiments, an authentication token (e.g., session-based authentication token, content-based authentication token, etc.) associated with the client device 110, 120 or the media player 112 may be used to authorize the user account and/or playback the requested content. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 134 is part of the service provider platform 130. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 134 is not part of the service provider platform 130 and is an external service, such as an authorization service (e.g., a trusted authentication service) provided by a third party.
While embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed in terms of a content sharing platform and facilitating social networking sharing of content items on a service provider platform 130, embodiments may also be generally applied to any type of network, content delivery platform, or service provider platform that provides connectivity between users. Embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide users with channel subscriptions.
Further to the above, a control may be provided to the user that allows the user to make selections as to whether and when the systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location), and whether to send content or communications from the server to the user. In addition, some data may be processed in one or more ways to remove personal identity information before being stored or used. For example, the identity of a user may be processed such that the user's personal identity information cannot be determined, or the user's geographic location (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) may be summarized in the case of location information being obtained such that the user's specific location cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
Fig. 2 is a diagram of operations for authenticating a service request initiated by a primary client device using a secondary client device, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. System 200 may include similar components as system architecture 100 of fig. 1. It may be noted that the components of fig. 1 may be used to help describe fig. 2. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the operations with respect to system 200 are described as being performed by data service 124, primary client device 205, and secondary client device 210 of authorization service provider platform 130. In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may be similar or identical to the client device 110 and the secondary client device 210 may be similar or identical to the client device 120. As such, unless otherwise described, operations with respect to the system 200 may be performed by any component of the client devices 110, 120, such as, for example, the media player 112, the linking module 114, and/or the token module 116. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the operations described with respect to FIG. 2 are shown as being performed sequentially. It may be noted that these operations may be performed in any order, and that any operations may be performed concurrently with one or more other operations. In some implementations, the same, different, fewer, or greater number of operations may be performed in any order.
At operation 212, the primary client device 205 may send a registration request to the authorization data service 124 to register the primary client device 205 with a user account associated with a content sharing platform (e.g., the service provider platform 130). For example, a user may access a user account by providing user account information such as a user name and password using a media viewer application (e.g., media viewer 112) on the primary client device 205. Once accessed (e.g., the content sharing platform authorizes the user account), the media viewer 112 may present a device registration button. The user may select a device registration button to send a registration request to register the primary client device 205 with the content sharing platform. In some embodiments, the registration request may include client device identification data that the authorization data service 124 may use to register the primary client device 205. The client device identification data may include a device serial number, an identification number, an IP address, location data, or other identification data associated with the primary client device 205. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send a cookie to the primary client device 205. The primary client device 205 may then use the cookie to prove registration during subsequent requests to the content sharing platform. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the primary client device 205, which may be used by the content sharing platform to verify the identity of the primary client device 205.
At operation 214, the secondary client device 210 may send a registration request to the authorization data service 124 to register the secondary client device 210 with a user account associated with a content sharing platform (e.g., the service provider platform 130). Registering the secondary client device 210 may be similar to registering the primary client device 205. In particular, a user may access a user account by providing user account information such as a user name and password using a media viewer application (e.g., media viewer 112) on the secondary client device 210. Once accessed (e.g., the content sharing platform authorizes the user account), the media viewer 112 may present a device registration button. The user may select a device registration button to send a registration request to register the secondary client device 210 with the content sharing platform. In some embodiments, the registration request may include client device identification data that the authorization data service 124 may use to register the secondary client device 210. The client device identification data may include a device serial number, an identification number, an IP address, location data, or other identification data associated with the secondary client device 210. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send a cookie to the secondary client device 210. The secondary client device 210 may then use the cookie to prove registration during subsequent requests to the content sharing platform. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the secondary client device 210, which may be used by the secondary client device 210 to sign (or add to) messages sent to the content sharing platform to allow the content sharing platform to verify the identity of the secondary client device 210.
At operation 216, the primary client device 205 sends a request to the authorization data service 124 to enable the secondary client device 210 as an authentication device. The authentication device may be a physically co-located secondary device that is used to authenticate service requests issued by the primary client device 205. The service request may be any type of request issued by the client device to the content sharing platform for a particular service. In some embodiments, the type of service request that needs to be authenticated (by the authentication device) may be predefined. For example, in response to user input, the authorization data service 124 may enable secondary device authentication only for login requests, upload content requests, and purchase requests.
At operation 218, the primary client device 205 sends a service request to the authorization data service 124. For example, the primary client device 205 may send a request to the authorization data service 124 to upload content to a channel associated with the user account.
In operation 220, the primary client device 205 generates an authentication token in response to determining that the service request of operation 216 requires secondary device authentication. The authentication token may be a randomly generated number (e.g., a 64-bit number, a 128-bit number, etc.), a string, a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, etc. In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may determine that the service request requires secondary device authentication by scanning a data structure listing the types of service requests that require secondary device authentication and determining that the service request types are included in the list. In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may receive an indication (e.g., an alert) from the authorization data service 124 that secondary device authentication is required.
At operation 222, the primary client device 205 sends the first instance of the authentication token to the authorization data service 124. The first instance of the authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the primary client device 205. In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may append the first instance of the authentication token with a private and/or public key, certificate, cookie, or any other identifying data capable of identifying the primary client device 205 to authorize the data service 124. In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may append location data, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, etc., to the first instance of the authentication token. The location data may be used by the authorization data service 124 to verify that the primary client device 205 and the secondary client device 210 are physically co-located.
In some embodiments, the first instance of the authentication token may be appended to the service request. For example, in response to receiving user input of a service request to the content sharing platform, the primary client device 205 may generate a service request, generate an authentication token, append a first instance of the authentication token to the service request, and send the appended service request to the authorization data service 124.
At operation 224, the primary client device 205 sends a second instance of the authentication token to the secondary client device 210. The second instance of the authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the primary client device 205. Because authentication is based on the secondary client device 210 being physically co-located with the primary client device 205, in some embodiments the primary client device 205 may send a second instance of the authentication token to the secondary client device 210 using a short-range communication technique. For example, the primary client device 205 may use short range wireless communication techniques, such as, for example, P2P,Wi-Fi direct (Wi-Fi P2P), infrared, ultrasonic, or other short-range communication technology, sends a second instance of the authentication token to the secondary client device 210. In some embodiments, the second instance of the authentication token may be sent from the primary client device 205 to the secondary client device 210 using a wired communication technique, such as a cable connection (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector, an ethernet connector, a lighting connector, or any other capable connector). In some embodiments, the primary client device 205 may use more than one type of short-range communication technology to send the authentication token to the secondary client device 210. For example, the primary client device 205 may first try to use +. >Techniques send authentication tokens to secondary client devices 210And, in response to the failed attempt, the primary client device 205 may then attempt to send a second instance of the authentication token to the secondary client device 210 using infrared techniques. The type of short-range communication technology used, the priority of each short-range communication technology to be used, and the number of attempts of each type of short-range communication technology may be configured by the client device (e.g., set by a user via a user account) or by the content sharing platform.
At operation 226, the secondary client device 210 sends a second instance of the authentication token to the authorization data service 124. In some embodiments, the secondary client device 210 confirms that it is co-located with the primary client device 205 before sending the second instance of the authentication token. In some embodiments, one may useThe co-location is confirmed (e.g., using a discovery function to determine whether the primary client device 205 is within range, using a pairing function, etc.), using an ultrasonic audio modem (e.g., using a speaker and microphone of the client device to communicate data to establish the co-location), using shared IP detection (e.g., determining whether both the primary client device 205 and the secondary client device 210 use the same IP address), using geographic location data (e.g., global Positioning System (GPS) data, mobile phone tower data, wi-Fi access point data, etc.), using a wired connection, etc. The second instance of the authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the secondary client device 210. In some embodiments, the secondary client device 210 may append a private and/or public key, certificate, cookie, or any other identifying data capable of identifying the secondary client device 205 to the second instance of the authentication token to authorize the data service 124. In some embodiments, the secondary client device 210 may append location data, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, etc., to the second instance of the authentication token. The location data may be used by the authorization data service 124 to verify that the primary client device 205 and the secondary client device 210 are physically co-located.
At operation 228, the authorization data service 124 compares (e.g., after decrypting the received message) the first instance and the second instance of the authentication token received from each client device and determines whether the instances of the authentication tokens match. For example, the authorization data service 124 may determine whether the number or string received from the primary client device 205 is the same as the number or string received from the secondary client device 210, whether the credentials received from each client device match, and so on. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 124 may first decrypt one or both of the authentication tokens, thereby determining the cryptographic signature of the authentication token, and/or performing any other process associated with the authentication token. In embodiments where the instances of the authentication token do not match, the authorization data service 124 may reject the pending service request.
At operation 230, the authorization data service 124 may optionally determine that the primary client device 205 and the secondary client device 210 are physically co-located. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 124 may determine physical co-location by using location data appended to authentication tokens received from the primary client device 205 and the secondary client device 210. For example, the authorization data service 124 may compare the location data appended to each respective token and determine whether the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data appended to the authentication token received from the primary client device 205 matches the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data appended to the authentication token received from the secondary client device 210, respectively. In embodiments where the location data does not match, the authorization data service 124 may reject pending service requests. Note that operation 230 is optional in that in other embodiments physical co-location of the client devices 205, 210 may be established by receiving an authentication token from the secondary client device 210, in that in these other embodiments the secondary client device 210 is configured to send an authentication token only when it acknowledges co-location with the primary client device 205 (this may be acknowledged, for example, if the secondary client device 210 is able to communicate with the primary client device 205 using short-range communication techniques, for example).
At operation 232, the authorization data service 124 authorizes the service request. For example, the authorization data service 124 processes pending service requests received from the primary client device 205.
Fig. 3 is another diagram of operations for authenticating a primary client device-initiated service request using a secondary client device, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The system 300 may include similar components as the system architecture 100 of fig. 1. It may be noted that the components of fig. 1 may be used to help describe fig. 3. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the operations with respect to system 300 are described as being performed by data service 124, primary client device 305, and secondary client device 310 of authorization service provider platform 130. In some embodiments, the primary client device 305 may be similar or identical to the client device 110 and the secondary client device 310 may be similar or identical to the client device 120. As such, unless otherwise described, operations with respect to the system 300 may be performed by any component of the client devices 110, 120, such as, for example, the media player 112, the linking module 114, and/or the token module 116. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the operations described with respect to FIG. 3 are shown as being performed sequentially. It may be noted that these operations may be performed in any order, and that any of these operations may be performed concurrently with one or more other operations. In some implementations, the same, different, fewer, or greater number of operations may be performed in any order.
At operation 312, the primary client device 305 may send a registration request to the authorization data service 124 to register the primary client device 305 with an associated content sharing platform (e.g., the service provider platform 130). The registration request may include client device identification data that the authorization data service 124 may use to register the primary client device 205. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send a cookie, one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the primary client device 305.
At operation 314, the secondary client device 310 may send a registration request to the authorization data service 124 to register the secondary client device 310 with an associated content sharing platform (e.g., the service provider platform 130). Registering the secondary client device 310 may be similar to registering the primary client device 305. In some embodiments, in response to the registration request, the authorization data service 124 may send a cookie, one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the secondary client device 310.
At operation 316, the primary client device 305 sends a request to the authorization data service 124 to enable the secondary client device 310 as an authentication device. In some embodiments, the type of service request that needs to be authenticated (by the authentication device) may be predefined.
At operation 318, the primary client device 305 sends a service request to the authorization data service 124. For example, the primary client device 305 may send a request to the authorization data service 124 to upload content to a channel associated with the user account. In some embodiments, the primary client device 310 may request additional location data from the service, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, and the like. The location data may be used by the authorization data service 124 to verify that the primary client device 305 and the secondary client device 310 are physically co-located.
In operation 320, the authorization data service 124 generates an authentication token in response to determining that the service request of operation 316 requires secondary device authentication. The authentication token may be a randomly generated number (e.g., a 64-bit number, a 128-bit number, etc.), a string, a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, etc. In some embodiments, authorization data service 124 may determine that the service request requires secondary device authentication by scanning a data structure listing service request types that require secondary device authentication and determining that the service request types are included in the list. In some embodiments, the primary client device 305 may receive an alert from the authorization data service 124 indicating that secondary device authentication is required.
At operation 322, the authorization data service 124 sends the authentication token to the primary client device 305. The authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the authorization data service 124.
At operation 324, the primary client device 305 sends the authentication token to the secondary client device 310. The authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the primary client device 305. Because authentication is based on the secondary client device 310 being physically co-located with the primary client device 305, in some embodiments the primary client device 305 may send an authentication token to the secondary client device 310 using short-range communication techniques. For example, the primary client device 305 may send the authentication token to the secondary client device 310 using a short range wireless communication technique or a wired communication technique. In some embodiments, the primary client device 305 may use more than one type of short-range communication technology to send the authentication token to the secondary client device 310.
At operation 326, the secondary client device 310 sends the authentication token to the authorization data service 124. Similarly, the authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the secondary client device 310. In some embodiments, the secondary client device 310 may append a private and/or public key, certificate, cookie, or any other identifying data capable of identifying the secondary client device 305 to the authentication token to authorize the data service 124. In some embodiments, the secondary client device 310 may append location data, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, etc., to the authentication token. The location data may be used by the authorization data service 124 to verify that the primary client device 305 and the secondary client device 310 are physically co-located.
At operation 328, the authorization data service 124 compares the authentication token received from the secondary client device 310 with the authentication token issued to the primary client device 305 at operation 322 and determines whether the authentication tokens match. For example, the authorization data service 124 may determine whether the number or string received from the secondary client device 310 is the same as the number or string generated by the authorization data service 124. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 124 may first decrypt the received authentication token, determine the cryptographic signature of the authentication token, and/or perform any other process associated with authenticating the token received from the secondary client device 310. In embodiments where the authentication tokens do not match, the authorization data service 124 may reject pending service requests.
At operation 330, the authorization data service 124 may optionally determine that the primary client device 305 and the secondary client device 310 are physically co-located. In some embodiments, the authorization data service 124 may determine physical co-location by using location data appended to a service request received from the primary client device 305 and location data appended to an authentication token received from the secondary client device 310. For example, the authorization data service 124 may compare the location data and determine whether the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data appended to the service request received from the primary client device 305 matches the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data appended to the authentication token received from the secondary client device 310, respectively. In embodiments where the location data does not match, the authorization data service 124 may reject pending service requests.
At operation 332, the authorization data service 124 authorizes the service request. For example, the authorization data service 124 processes pending service requests received from the primary client device 305.
Fig. 4 depicts a flowchart of a method 400, showing a process for authenticating a service request initiated by a primary client device, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. Method 400 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the method is performed by a server of the service provider platform 130 or the authorization data service 124 associated with the server of the service provider platform 130 of fig. 1, while in some other embodiments, one or more blocks of fig. 4 may be performed by another machine. In one embodiment, the processing device of the authorization data service 134 performs the method 400.
At operation 412, the processing device registers the primary client device with the user account. For example, the processing device may receive a registration request from a primary client device (e.g., first client device 110) to register the primary client device with a user account associated with the service provider platform. In some embodiments, the processing device may first receive user account information, such as a user name and password, to enable the primary client device to access the user account. In some embodiments, the registration request may include client device identification data, such as a device serial number, an identification number, an IP address, location data, or other identification data associated with the primary client device. In some embodiments, once registered, the processing device may send a cookie to the primary client device. The primary client device may then use the cookie to prove registration during subsequent requests to the service provider platform. In some embodiments, upon registration, the processing device may send one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the primary client device.
At operation 414, the processing device registers the secondary client device with the user account. For example, the processing device may receive a registration request from a secondary client device (e.g., the second client device 120) to register the secondary client device with a user account associated with the service provider platform. In some embodiments, the processing device may first receive user account information, such as a user name and password, to enable the secondary client device to access the user account. In some embodiments, the registration request may include client device identification data, such as a device serial number, an identification number, an IP address, location data, or other identification data associated with the secondary client device. In some embodiments, upon registration, the processing device may send a cookie to the secondary client device. The secondary client device may then use the cookie to prove registration during subsequent requests to the service provider platform. In some embodiments, upon registration, the processing device may send one or more cryptographic keys, such as one or more public keys and/or one or more private keys, certificates, etc., to the secondary client device.
At operation 416, the processing device receives a request from the primary client device or the secondary client device to enable the secondary client device to act as an authentication device. In some embodiments, the type of service request that needs to be authenticated (by the authentication device) may be predefined. For example, the processing device may receive user input to enable secondary device authentication only for login requests, upload content requests, and purchase requests.
At operation 418, the processing device receives a service request from a primary client device. For example, the processing device may receive a request to upload content to a channel associated with a user account. In some embodiments, the service request may include a cookie or any other type of identification data for verifying the identity of the primary client device. In addition, the processing device receives a first instance of an authentication token from the primary client device. The first instance of the authentication token may be associated with a service request. In some embodiments, the first instance of the authentication token is appended to the service request. The first instance of the authentication token may be a randomly generated number (e.g., a 64-bit number, a 128-bit number, etc.), a string, a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, etc. In some embodiments, the first instance of the authentication token may include location data associated with the primary client device, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, and the like. In some embodiments, upon receiving the first instance of the authentication token, the processing device may decrypt the first instance of the authentication token, determine a cryptographic signature of the authentication token, and/or perform any other process associated with the authentication token.
At operation 420, the processing device receives a second instance of an authentication token from the secondary client device. In some embodiments, the second instance of the authentication token may include location data associated with the secondary client device, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, and the like. In some embodiments, the second instance of the authentication token includes a private and/or public key, a certificate, a cookie, or any other identifying data capable of identifying the secondary client device. In some embodiments, the secondary client device may first confirm that it is co-located with the primary client device and then send a second instance of the authentication token (e.g., after signing it with its private key). In some embodiments, the processing device may first decrypt the second instance of the authentication token (e.g., using the corresponding public key), determine a cryptographic signature of the authentication token, and/or perform any other process associated with the authentication token.
At operation 422, the processing device compares the first instance of the authentication token with the second instance of the authentication token to determine if the two instances match. For example, the processing device may determine whether the number or string associated with the first instance is the same as the number or string associated with the second instance. In embodiments where the instances of the authentication token do not match, the processing device may reject the pending service request.
At operation 424, the processing device may optionally determine that the primary client device and the secondary client device are physically co-located. In some embodiments, the processing device may determine the physical co-location by using location data received from the first instance and the second instance of the authentication token. For example, the processing device may determine whether the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data associated with the first instance of the authentication token (or associated with the service request) corresponds to the IP address, MAC address, or GPS data associated with the second instance of the authentication token, respectively (e.g., matches or otherwise indicates close proximity). In embodiments where the location data of the primary client device does not correspond to the location data of the secondary client device, the processing device may reject the pending service request.
At operation 426, the processing device grants the service request. For example, the processing device may process pending service requests received from the primary client device.
Fig. 5 depicts a flowchart of a method 500 for initiating a service request that requires authentication by an authentication device, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. Method 500 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the method is performed by the first client device 110 of fig. 1, while in some other embodiments, one or more blocks of fig. 5 may be performed by another machine. In one embodiment, the processing device of the first client device 110 performs the method 500.
At operation 512, the processing device sends a service request to a server (e.g., a server of a content sharing platform or any other service provider platform). For example, the processing device may send a request to upload content to a channel associated with the user account. In some embodiments, the service request may include a cookie or any other type of identifying data for verifying the identity of the primary client device associated with the processing device. In some embodiments, the primary client device may be registered with the service provider platform.
At operation 514, the processing device generates an authentication token. The authentication token may be a randomly generated number (e.g., a 64-bit number, a 128-bit number, etc.), a string, a cryptographic signature, a key-value pair, a hash value, a certificate, etc.
At operation 516, the processing device sends a first instance of the authentication token to the server. In some embodiments where the first instance of the authentication token is appended to the service request, operations 512 and 516 are combined into a single operation that is performed after operation 514. In some embodiments, the first instance of the authentication token may include location data associated with the primary client device, such as an IP address, MAC address, GPS data, and the like. In some embodiments, the authentication token may be appended with a private and/or public key, certificate, cookie, or any other identifying data.
At operation 518, the processing device sends a second instance of the authentication token to the secondary client device. The secondary client device may be a physically co-located authentication device for authenticating service requests issued by the primary client device. The second instance of the authentication token may be sent as unencrypted data or may be encrypted by the processing device. Since authentication is based on a secondary client device being physically co-located with the primary client device, in some embodiments the processing device may send an authentication token to the secondary client device using wired or wireless short-range communication techniques.
At operation 520, the processing device receives a response from the server indicating that the first instance of the authentication token sent by the first client device to the server matches the second instance of the authentication token sent by the second client device to the server, indicating that the service request was accepted by the server. In some embodiments, the response includes an indication that the service request has been processed or completed. The service request may be processed or completed in response to the server comparing the first instance of the authentication token with the second instance of the authentication token and determining that the two instances match. In embodiments where the instances of the authentication token do not match, the processing device may receive an indication that the service request is denied.

The instruction set may further be transmitted or received over a network 618 via a network interface device 622.
While an example of computer-readable storage medium 624 is shown to be a single medium, the term "computer-readable storage medium" can include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the instruction set. The term "computer-readable storage medium" can include any medium that can store, encode, or carry a set of instructions for execution by a machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure. The term "computer readable storage medium" can include, but is not limited to, solid state memories, optical media, and magnetic media.
In the preceding description, numerous details are set forth. However, it will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure that the present disclosure may be practiced without such specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present disclosure.
Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. Such algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. Such operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as "generating," "providing," "adjusting," "receiving," "cancelling," or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system memories or registers into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
The present disclosure also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. The apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, compact disk read-only memories (CD-ROMs), magneto-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random Access Memories (RAMs), erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
The word "example" or "exemplary" is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as "example" or "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word "example" or "exemplary" is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion. As used in this disclosure, the term "or" is intended to mean an inclusive "or" rather than an exclusive "or". That is, unless otherwise indicated, or as apparent from the context, "X includes A or B" is intended to mean any natural inclusive permutation. That is, if X includes A; x comprises B; or X includes both A and B, then "X includes A or B" is satisfied in any of the foregoing examples. In addition, the articles "a" and "an" as used in this disclosure and the appended claims may generally be construed to mean "one or more" unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form. Furthermore, the use of the terms "an example" or "one example" or "an embodiment" or "one embodiment" throughout is not intended to mean the same example or embodiment unless so described. The terms "first," "second," "third," "fourth," and the like as used herein are intended as labels distinguishing between different elements and not necessarily for a sequential meaning as specified by their figures.
For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies herein are depicted and described as a series of acts or operations. However, acts in accordance with the present disclosure can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.
