Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to communication systems and, more particularly, to coding information signals in such communication systems.
- Digital speech compression systems typically require estimation of the fundamental frequency of an input signal.
- the fundamental frequency ⁇ 0 is usually estimated in terms of the pitch period ⁇ 0 (otherwise known as “lag”).
- sampling frequency ⁇ s is commonly 8000 Hz for telephone grade applications.
- a speech signal Since a speech signal is generally non-stationary, it is partitioned into finite length vectors called frames (e.g., 10 to 40 ms), each of which are presumed to be quasi-stationary. The parameters describing the speech signal are then updated at the associated frame length intervals.
- the original Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) algorithm further updates the pitch period (using what is called Long Term Prediction, or LTP) information on shorter subframe intervals, thus allowing smoother transitions from frame to frame.
- LTP Long Term Prediction
- An enhancement to this method involves allowing ⁇ 0 to take on fractional values.
- An example of a practical implementation of this method can be found in the GSM half rate speech coder, and is shown in FIG. 1 .
- lags within the range of 21 to 222 ⁇ 3 are allowed 1 ⁇ 3 sample resolution
- lags within the range of 23 to 345 ⁇ 6 are allowed 1 ⁇ 6 sample resolution, and so on.
- the open-loop method involves generating an integer lag candidate list using an autocorrelation peak picking algorithm.
- the closed-loop method searches the allowable lags in the neighborhood of the integer lag candidates for the optimal fractional lag value.
- the pitch period is estimated for the analysis window centered at the end of the current frame.
- the lag (delay) contour is then generated, which consists of a linear interpolation of the past frame's lag to the current frame's lag.
- the linear prediction (LP) residual signal is then modified by means of sophisticated polyphase filtering and shifting techniques, which are designed such that the 1 ⁇ 8 sample interpolation boundaries are not crossed during perceptually critical instances in the waveform.
- the primary reason for this residual modification process is to account for errors introduced by the open-loop integer lag estimation process. For example, if the integer lag is estimated to be 32 samples, when in fact the true lag is 32.5 samples, the residual waveform can be in conflict with the estimated lag by as many as 2.5 samples in a single 160 sample frame.
- the RCELP algorithm accounts for this by shifting the residual waveform during perceptually insignificant instances in the residual waveform (i.e., low energy) to match the delay contour. In the event that there are no such opportunities for shifting, the shift count is accumulated and reserved for use during the next frame. By modifying the residual waveform to match the estimated delay contour, the effectiveness of the LTP is preserved, and the coding gain is maintained. In addition, the associated perceptual degradations due to the residual modification are claimed to be insignificant.
- the EVRC full rate mode i.e., 8.5 kbps
- the EVRC half rate mode which operates at 4.0 kbps. This is because of the relative ability of the fixed codebooks to model the associated inverse error signal. That is, if coding distortions are introduced by inefficiencies in the LTP, and those distortions can be effectively modeled by the fixed codebook, then the net effect is that the distortion will be canceled. So, while the EVRC full rate mode allocates 120 of 170 its per frame for fixed codebook gain and shape, the half rate mode can afford only 42 of 80 bits per frame for the same. This results in a disproportionate performance degradation due, in part, to the fixed codebook's inability to model the coding distortion introduced by the LTP.
- FIG. 1 generally depicts fractional lag values for a GSM half-rate speech coder.
- FIG. 2 generally depicts a speech compression system employing open-loop lag estimation as is known in the prior art.
- FIG. 3 generally depicts a open-loop lag estimation system in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 4 generally shows the structure of an ith adaptive filter element within the filter bank of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 5 generally depicts the process of variable length sequencing, variable offset, and subsequent windowing in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 7 generally depicts a comparison of voiced speech lag estimation between a prior art method and lag estimation in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 8 generally depicts a comparison of average absolute accumulated shift between a prior art method and lag estimation in accordance with the invention.
- a method and apparatus for improved pitch period estimation in a compression system uses original estimates of integer lag and open-loop prediction gain as input to an adaptive filter parameter initialization block which supplies inputs to a plurality of adaptive filter elements.
- Adaptive filter elements provide information regarding the harmonics of the residual signal to an adaptive filter parameter analysis block.
- Adaptive filter parameter analysis block estimates the fundamental frequency of the residual signal based on the analysis of the harmonics and outputs a pitch period for eventual use in a delay contour computation.
- a method for estimating a fundamental frequency of a signal includes the steps of analyzing harmonics of the signal and estimating the fundamental frequency of the signal based on the analysis of the harmonics.
- the step of analyzing harmonics of the signal further comprises phase locking to the harmonics of the signal and the step of estimating further comprises quantizing the fundamental frequency of the signal and converting the quantized fundamental frequency of the signal to the lag domain for use as a pitch period ⁇ .
- the signal further comprises a residual of a speech coded signal.
- FIG. 2 generally depicts a speech compression system 200 employing open-loop lag estimation as is known in the prior art.
- the input speech signal s(n) is processed by an linear prediction (LP) analysis filter 202 which flattens the short-term spectral envelope of input speech signal s(n).
- the output of the LP analysis filter is designated as the LP residual ⁇ (n).
- the LP residual signal ⁇ (n) is then used by the open-loop lag estimator 204 as a basis for estimating the delay contour ⁇ c (n) and the open-loop pitch prediction gain ⁇ ol .
- the RCELP residual modification process 206 uses this information to map the LP residual to the delay contour, as described above.
- the modified residual signal is then passed through a weighted synthesis filter 207 before being processed by the long term predictor 208 and eventually by the fixed codebook 210 , which characterizes the synthesizer excitation sequence.
- the fixed codebook index/gain is input to an excitation generator 212 which outputs an excitation sequence.
- the excitation sequence is passed through long and short term synthesis filters 214 and 216 to produce the reconstructed speech output.
- FIG. 3 generally depicts a open-loop lag estimation system 300 in accordance with the invention.
- the LP residual signal ⁇ (n) is used as the input to the autocorrelation analysis block 302 which uses the prior art method shown in section 4.2.3 of IS-127 as “pre-optimized” values for the integer lag ⁇ 0 and open-loop prediction gain ⁇ ol . These values are then used to calculate the initial parameters for the adaptive harmonic filter bank.
- the filter bank is used to estimate the residual signal's fundamental frequency ⁇ 0 by “phase locking” to the LP residual harmonic frequencies.
- the fundamental frequency is then quantized and converted to the lag domain for use as the optimal pitch period ⁇ in accordance with the invention.
- H ⁇ ( z ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ z - 1 1 - 2 ⁇ r ⁇ ⁇ cos ⁇ ( ⁇ 0 ) ⁇ z - 1 + r 2 ⁇ z - 2 ( 4 )
- q ⁇ is a unit delay operator and n represents the sampled time index.
- the input signal ⁇ (n) is used as an input to a filterbank of adaptive filter elements 306 - 308 .
- Each of the adaptive filter elements 306 - 308 pre-filters the residual at a fixed harmonic frequency.
- FIG. 4 shows the corresponding structure of an ith adaptive filter element, for example adaptive filter element 306 , contained within the filter bank of FIG. 3 .
- the pre-filtered output is windowed 404 to prevent spurious signal conditions, and then used as input to an adaptive resonator 406 of the form given in Eq. (5).
- the adaptive filter coefficients for each of the harmonics is analyzed, and an estimate of the fundamental frequency is generated.
- the LP residual signal ⁇ (n) is first filtered by the zero-state harmonic pre-filter 402 , given as:
- p i ( n ) ⁇ 1i ⁇ ( n+j )+ c i p i ( n ⁇ 1)+ d i p i ( n ⁇ 2), 0 ⁇ n ⁇ L, 1 ⁇ i ⁇ N, (7)
- N the number of harmonics to be analyzed
- ⁇ 0 is the pre-optimized lag from autocorrelation analysis block 302
- ⁇ min 800 Hz
- ⁇ s 8000 Hz
- the filter gain variable ⁇ 1i can then be calculated as:
- the sequence length L is defined such that at least three full pitch periods must be contained within the LP residual signal ⁇ (n), up to a given maximum. This guarantees a meaningful input to the adaptive filters 306 - 308 .
- the LPC residual sequence ⁇ (n) consists of 320 samples of information, the first 80 of which represent the last half of the last frame of information. These are used to “prime” the state of the LP analysis filter 202 and are used here to extend the pitch analysis frame for low frequencies. The next 160 samples represent the current frame of information, and the following 80 samples represent the “look-ahead” to the next frame. Since RCELP attempts to interpolate the lag from frame-to-frame, it is desirable to estimate the lag corresponding to the point at the end of the current frame.
- the sequence length L is equal to 240 for lags ⁇ 80. For lags >80 and ⁇ 120, the analysis window is stretched back in time successively until the beginning of the look-back of the previous frame is reached.
- the window ⁇ (n) can be described as a smoothed trapezoid window.
- Other window types may be used with varying degrees of performance, however, keeping the window “tails” constant is a computational advantage since only L ⁇ /2 samples need be stored or calculated.
- Other window types that have dependence on L in the trigonometric function e.g., sin 2 ( ⁇ (n+0.5)/L)) would require recalculation and/or different storage memory for each value of L.
- the windowed pre-filter output x(n) is then used as input to a zero-state adaptive harmonic resonator 406 of the form:
- y i ( n ) ⁇ 2i x ( n )+a i ( n ) y i ( n ⁇ 1)+ b i y i ( n ⁇ 2), 0 ⁇ n ⁇ L, 1 ⁇ i ⁇ N, (16)
- the resonant frequency coefficient for each harmonic is modified according to:
- a i ( n+ 1) a i ( n )+ ⁇ i x i ( n ) y i ( n ⁇ 1), 0 ⁇ n>L, 1 ⁇ i ⁇ N, (19)
- the coefficients a i (L) can be analyzed for deviation from the initial center frequencies.
- ⁇ (i) is a weighting function that appropriately weights the importance of each of the harmonic elements, such that the sum of all elements of ⁇ (i) equal unity.
- ⁇ (i) is highly dependent on the input data; other functions may or may not yield better performance.
- the quantized value of the fundamental frequency ⁇ * is then found by choosing the value of the index k that minimizes the following:
- f table (k) are the allowable values of the quantized fundamental frequency and m is the number of bits allocated to the lag parameter.
- m 7 bit trained scalar quantization table is given in FIG. 6 .
- ⁇ c ⁇ ( n ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( m - 1 ) + ( n ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ( m - 1 ) - ⁇ ⁇ ( m ) ) ) / L f , ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( m - 1 ) - ⁇ ⁇ ( m ) ⁇ ⁇ 16 ⁇ ⁇ ( m ) , otherwise ⁇ , ( 23 ) 0 ⁇ n ⁇ L f
- a database of over 80,000 frames of speech and music signals was used to generate the data shown in FIG. 6 based on the dataset's probability density function. While this data is statistically optimal over the various fundamental frequency values from the training set, it is interesting to note that the distribution more closely reflects the properties of the human auditory system. That is, psychoacoustics principles reveal that the critical bands of hearing are uniform in frequency below 500 Hz; in the prior art open-loop lag estimator shown in FIG. 2, the distribution of quantization range is uniform over pitch period, which is inversely proportional to frequency.
- the psychoacoustically optimal distribution for a 7 bit quantizer would consist of a uniform frequency distribution spaced at 2.6 Hz intervals.
- FIG. 7 The support for objective improvement can be observed in FIG. 7, where the lag trajectory for a short passage of strongly voiced speech is shown. While the prior art shows distinct “staircase” effects during transitional (frames 52 to 58 ) and steady state (frames 37 to 45 ) passages, the lag estimation in accordance with the invention effectively smoothes out the rough edges associated with the integer lag boundaries.
- improvements to the RCELP algorithm can be evaluated objectively by measuring the accumulated shift that results from the inability of the LP residual signal ⁇ (n) to be appropriately mapped to the estimated delay contour. Since one purpose of the preferred embodiment in accordance with the invention is to more accurately estimate the RCELP delay contour, the efficiency of the RCELP algorithm is improved since lag estimation in accordance with the invention requires less error to be tolerated by lowering the accumulated average shift factor. The improvement can be observed in FIG. 8, which was generated from a 80,000+ frame database.
- the subjective performance improvement is highly audible. Testing shows consistent preference to lag estimation in accordance with the invention during blind A/B tests, and it is estimated that the inventive method and apparatus provides 0.1 to 0.2 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) points improvement in Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests when used with the EVRC half-rate maximum mode of operation (4.0 kbps).
- MOS Mean Opinion Score
- lag estimation in accordance with the invention can additionally benefit other, more general algorithms/vocoders which require accurate open-loop estimation of the fundamental frequency of an input signal.
- algorithms/vocoders include, but are not limited to, harmonic vocoders, sinusoidal transform coders (STC), and homomorphic vocoders.
- STC sinusoidal transform coders
- homomorphic vocoders include digital hearing aids, audio speech coders, voice mail systems, etc.
