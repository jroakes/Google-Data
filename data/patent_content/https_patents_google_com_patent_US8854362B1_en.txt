Definitions
- three-dimensional modeling involves generation of a representation of a 3D surface of an object.

- 3D object data models represent a 3D object using a collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc.
- 3D models can be created by hand, algorithmically, or objects can be scanned, for example.
- an artist may manually generate a 3D image of an object that can be used as the 3D model.
- a given object may be scanned from a number of different angles, and the scanned images can be combined to generate the 3D image of the object.

- 3D object data models may include solid models that define a volume of the object, or may include shell or boundary models that represent a surface (e.g., the boundary) of the object. Because an appearance of an object depends largely on an exterior of the object, boundary representations are common in computer graphics.
