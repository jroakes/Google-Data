Description
Description of the division
The present application belongs to the divisional application of the Chinese patent application 201780091615.1 with the application date of 2017, 12 months and 12 days.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to the field of video content, and more particularly to determining user interest in a media content item corresponding to one of a plurality of search results and providing a preview of the media content item while presenting the search results.
Background
In searching for media content items, a user is provided with a search result list representing a list of potential media content items of interest. The search result list may identify corresponding media content items to the user. In order for a user to determine whether a particular media content item from a search result list is being sought by the user, the user may need to select the media content item and view it. However, if the media content item is not the media content item that the user wishes to view, the user will have to return to the provided search result list to select another media content item from the search result list.
Disclosure of Invention
The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This abstract is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate any scope of the particular embodiments of the disclosure or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
Implementations of the present disclosure may include a method, such as a computer-implemented method, of receiving a plurality of search result items at a client device. Each of the search result items corresponds to a media content item, e.g., each of the search result items corresponds to a different media content item. The method may further, for example, present, on the client device, a user interface including a scrollable search result area to present a subset of the plurality of search result items and a focus area to present a preview of a media content item corresponding to one of the plurality of search result items. The client device may receive user input, such as a user gesture in a scrollable search results area. In response to receiving the user gesture, the client device may determine whether the user gesture indicates a user selection of a second search result item of the plurality of search result items (and thus indicates a user interest in a second media content item corresponding to the second search result item of the plurality of search result items). Further, in response to determining that the user gesture indicates a user selection of the second search result item (and thus indicates a user interest in the second media content item), the client device may present a preview of the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item.
Another embodiment of the present disclosure includes a method, e.g., a computer-implemented method, of: receiving, at a client device, a plurality of search result items each corresponding to a media content item; presenting a user interface comprising a scrollable search result area to present a subset of the plurality of search result items and a focus area to present a preview of a media content item corresponding to one of the plurality of search result items; receiving, at the client device, a user gesture in the scrollable search result area; responsive to receiving the user gesture, determining whether the user gesture indicates a user interest in a second media content item corresponding to a second search result item of the plurality of search result items; and responsive to determining that the user gesture indicates a user interest in a second media content item corresponding to the second search result, presenting a preview of the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item.
In some embodiments, determining that the user gesture indicates an interest in a user of a second media content item corresponding to a second search result item may be based on a previously received user gesture associated with the user.
In some embodiments, the user gesture received in the scrollable search result area is a tap gesture on the second search result item. In some embodiments, the user gesture received in the scrollable search result area is a swipe gesture that vertically displaces the subset of the plurality of search result items upward and positions a second search result item within the focus area.
In some embodiments, presenting a preview of the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item includes: transmitting a request for a second media content item corresponding to a second search result item; receiving a second media content item corresponding to a second search result item; and presenting, on the client device, a second media content item corresponding to the second search result item in the focal region.
In some embodiments, the second media content item may be one of: a video trailer of the video represented by the second media content item, a video clip containing sub-segments of the video, or the video is described.
In some embodiments, the type of the second media content item presented by the client device is based on the previously presented media content item and the user interaction with the previously presented media content item.
In some embodiments, the client device presents the thumbnail associated with the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item in the focal region prior to presenting the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item.
In some embodiments, each of the plurality of search result items includes metadata describing the corresponding media content item.
In some embodiments, presenting the preview of the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item includes overlaying the preview of the second media content item in the focal region with metadata describing the second media content item.
In some embodiments, a system may include a memory and a processing device coupled to the memory. The processing device may be configured to receive a plurality of search result items. Each of the search result items corresponds to a media content item. The processing device may be further configured to present a user interface comprising a scrollable search result area to present a subset of the plurality of search result items and a focus area to present a preview of a media content item corresponding to one of the plurality of search result items. The processing device may receive a user gesture in the scrollable search results area. In response to receiving the user gesture, the processing device may determine whether the user gesture indicates a user interest in a second media content item corresponding to a second search result item of the plurality of search result items. Further, in response to determining that the user gesture indicates a user interest in the second media content item, the processing device may present a preview of the second media content item corresponding to the second search result item.
In some embodiments, a machine-readable storage medium (which may be a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, although the invention is not limited in this respect) stores instructions that, when executed, cause a processing device to perform operations comprising a method according to any embodiment or aspect described herein.
In some embodiments, a system includes: a memory; and a processing device operably coupled with the memory to perform operations comprising a method according to any embodiment or aspect described herein.
Embodiments of the present disclosure may provide the technical effect of reducing the number of user selections and reselections of media content items associated with search results. This reduces the required computing resources and network bandwidth as unnecessary downloading/streaming of content media items to the user device that are not of interest to the user is eliminated.

Detailed Description
Aspects of the present disclosure relate to presenting previews of media content items associated with search result items from a plurality of search result items received on a client device. The client device may include, but is not limited to, a personal computer, a tablet computer, a smart phone, or any other computing device. Typically, a user of a client device may type a search query to obtain a particular media content item for viewing. The client device may send the search query to a search engine platform configured to search a data store of the content sharing platform for media content items related to the search query. For example, a user of a client device may initiate a search for video of a well-known hollywood actor by submitting a search query that includes the actor's name. The client device may then send a search query to the search engine platform to search for related media content items maintained on the content sharing platform.
In response to receiving a search query from a client device, the search engine platform may perform a search based on the search query and send a resulting set of search result items corresponding to a plurality of media content items related to the search query to the client device. For example, the set of search result items may correspond to media content items related to a well-known actor.
Upon receiving the set of search result items, the client device may then display the set of search result items within a user interface on a display unit of the client device. The search result items may display descriptive text or images that illustrate their corresponding media content items. The user may then select a particular search result item and view the corresponding media content item. For example, a particular search result item from the set of search result items may display descriptive text or images indicating that the corresponding media content item is a movie, such as movie XYZ, starring actor a. If the user wishes to view movie XYZ, the user may select a particular search result item, which in turn initiates a request to play a corresponding media content item, which in this example is movie XYZ. However, if the corresponding media content item is not movie XYZ or something the user intends to view, the user will have to return a search result list (typically in a different user interface) in order to select a different search result item. The process of selecting and playing media content items corresponding to different search result items may result in the user having to repeatedly select and reselect different search result items (and often also switch between different user interfaces) until the desired search result item and corresponding media content item are found.
One of the reasons that a user may repeatedly select and reselect different search result items until a desired media content item is found is that the user's selection is typically based on a description of the corresponding media content item within the search result item. For example, if a particular search result item displays text such as "movie XYZ, classical 80 s action movie," then when that search result item is selected, the user may expect to view movie XYZ itself. However, the description within the search result item may correspond to a video in which the reviewer discusses the advantages of movie XYZ, rather than the movie itself. The descriptive text and/or representative images displayed within each search result item may not provide the user with sufficient information about the corresponding media content item. As a result, the user may eventually repeatedly select and re-select multiple search result items and switch between different views or user interfaces until the desired media content item is selected. This can be particularly troublesome for returning search queries that require a large number (e.g., more than 50) of search results to be presented on a small-sized screen of the mobile device.
Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other drawbacks by providing a user interface including a focus area and a scrollable search area. The focus area may be configured to present a preview of the media content item corresponding to the particular search result item for which the user has indicated an interest in viewing. For example, a user may indicate an interest in a particular search result item describing movie XYZ using a particular gesture. The client device may then be configured to present a preview of the corresponding media content item within the focus area while the scrollable search area continues to display other search result items. Based on the preview, the user can verify that the media content item of the emphasis show (feature) in the preview is what the user wants to view, and can select the media content item for playback. Alternatively, if the user decides that the media content item that is emphasized in the preview is not what the user wants to view, the user may continue to review the search results and may indicate an interest in another media content item associated with a different search result item using a particular gesture. In response, another media content item may appear in the preview area and the user may be able to verify that the other media content item that is highlighted in the preview is what the user wants to view. Thus, the user can scroll through the search result items in one area of the UI while also being able to view previews of some of the media content items corresponding to the search result items in another area of the UI, thereby providing more information about potentially interesting media content items in the same UI as the list of scrollable search result items without navigating between different views or UIs.
In some implementations, detecting an indication of user interest in media content items associated with a particular search result item from a scrollable list may involve detecting a predefined user gesture with respect to the particular search result item. For example, if a user taps or otherwise selects a particular search result item, the client device may present a preview of the corresponding media content item within the focal region. If the user slides in a particular direction, causing one of the search result items to shift its position into, to, or within at least a predetermined distance from the focal region, the client device may initiate a preview of the media content item corresponding to the shifted search result item in the focal region. Additionally, the client device may determine a user interest in the search result item based on the user input behavior matching a particular input behavior from the historical user input. For example, when scrolling through a list, the user's previous different types of user gestures (e.g., swipes or taps) with respect to search result items and subsequent user actions of selecting or not selecting media content items corresponding to those search result items for playback may be used as training data for a machine learning model that may be trained to predict user interests for media content items associated with future search results.
In some implementations, different types of preview items can be presented within the focal region based on the corresponding media content items or user interactions with previously presented content. For example, if the corresponding media content item is a movie or other lengthy video, the client device may present a video trailer or video clip of the corresponding media content item in the focus area. Alternatively, if the corresponding media content item is a short video clip, the client device may present a preview of the actual media content item in the focus area instead of a trailer for the media content item. In addition, the client device may use the video previews and the user gesture history to determine what type of previews the user prefers. For example, if a previous user cancels or otherwise navigates away from a preview as a trailer, the client device may prefer to present a video clip or actual video preview of the media content item to the user rather than a video trailer.
Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure may accurately predict or more accurately predict user interest in certain search results and provide previews of corresponding media content items in a UI that is also a scrollable search result list. As a result, the number of user selections and reselections of media content items associated with search results is reduced, which in turn reduces computing resources and increases network bandwidth, as unnecessary downloading/streaming of media content items that are not of interest to the user is eliminated. In addition, this increases the reliability of the content sharing platform, especially when used with small-sized mobile devices, and also makes the content sharing platform easier to use.
Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary system architecture 100 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The system architecture 100 includes client devices 110A-110Z, a network 105, a data store 106, a content sharing platform 120, a server 130, and a search engine platform 150. In one embodiment, the network 105 may include a public network (e.g., the internet), a private network (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN)), a wired network (e.g., an ethernet network), a wireless network (e.g., an 802.11 network or Wi-Fi network), a cellular network (e.g., a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), a router, hub, switch, server computer, and/or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the data store 106 may be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a cache, a drive (e.g., hard drive), a flash drive, a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data. The data store 106 can also include multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases) that can also span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).
Client devices 110A through 110Z may each include a computing device, such as a Personal Computer (PC), a laptop computer, a mobile phone, a smart phone, a tablet computer, a network-connected television, a netbook computer, and so forth. In some implementations, client devices 110A through 110Z may also be referred to as "user devices. Each client device includes a media viewer 111. In one implementation, the media viewer 111 may be an application that allows a user to view content such as images, videos (e.g., media content items and video previews of media content items), web pages, documents, and the like. For example, the media viewer 111 may be a web browser that may access, retrieve, render, and/or navigate content (e.g., web pages such as hypertext markup language (HTML) pages, digital media items or content items, etc.) served by a web server. The media viewer 111 may render, display, and/or present content (e.g., web pages, media viewers) to a user. The media viewer 111 may also display an embedded media player (e.g., A player or HTML5 player). In another example, the media viewer 111 may be a stand-alone application that allows a user to view digital media content items (e.g., digital videos, digital images, electronic books, etc.).
The media viewer 111 may be provided to the client devices 110A-110Z by the server 130 and/or the content sharing platform 120. For example, the media viewer 111 may be an embedded media player embedded in a web page provided by the content sharing platform 120. In another example, the media viewer 111 may be an application in communication with the server 130.
Generally, the functions described as being performed by the content sharing platform 120 in one embodiment may also be performed on the client devices 110A-110Z in other embodiments, if appropriate. In addition, functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The content sharing platform 120 may also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through an appropriate application programming interface and is thus not limited to use in a website.
In one implementation, the content sharing platform 120 may be one or more computing devices (such as a rack-mounted server, router computer, server computer, personal computer, mainframe computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, network-connected television, desktop computer, etc.), a data store (e.g., hard disk, memory, database), a network, software component, and/or hardware component that may be used to provide users with access to media items (also referred to as content items) and/or to provide users with media items. For example, the content sharing platform 120 may allow users to consume, upload, search, approve ("like"), dislike, and/or comment on media items. The content sharing platform 120 may also include a website (e.g., web page) that may be used to provide users with access to media items.
In embodiments of the present disclosure, a "user" may be represented as a single individual. However, other embodiments of the present disclosure include "users" that are entities controlled by a collection of users and/or an automation source. For example, a collection of individual users that are combined into a community in a social network may be considered a "user. In another example, the automated consumer may be an automated ingest pipeline of the content sharing platform 120, such as a theme channel.
The content sharing platform 120 may include multiple channels (e.g., channels a through Z). A channel may be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic, theme or gist. The data content may be user-selected digital content, digital content made available to the user, user-uploaded digital content, content provider-selected digital content, broadcaster-selected digital content, and so forth. For example, channel X may include videos Y and Z. The channel may be associated with an owner, which is a user that may perform an action on the channel. Different activities may be associated with a channel based on actions of the owner, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., enjoying) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, and so forth. The activity associated with a channel may be collected into an activity feed for the channel. In addition to channel owners, users may subscribe to one or more channels of interest to them. The concept of "subscription" may also be referred to as "like", "focus", "buddy" and so on.
Once the user subscribes to a channel, the user may be presented with information from the active feeds for the channel. If the user subscribes to multiple channels, the activity feeds for each channel to which the user subscribes may be combined into a syndicated activity feed. Information from the syndicated activity feed may be presented to the user. The channels may have their own feeds. For example, when navigating to a channel homepage on a content sharing platform, feeds generated by the channel may be presented on the channel homepage. The user may have a syndication feed, which is a feed that includes at least a subset of content items from all channels to which the user subscribes. The syndication feed may also include content items from channels to which the user is not subscribed. For example, the content sharing platform 120 or other social network may insert recommended content items into the syndication feed of the user, or may insert content items associated with related connections of the user into the syndication feed.
Each channel may include one or more media content items 121. Examples of media content items 121 may include, but are not limited to, digital videos, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, website content, social media updates, electronic books (ebooks), electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic romatics, software applications, and the like. In some implementations, the media content item 121 is also referred to as a video content item.
The media content item 121 may be consumed via the internet and/or via a mobile device application. As used herein, "media," "media item," "online media item," "digital media item," "content item," and "video content item" may include electronic files that may be executed or loaded using software, firmware, or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity. In one implementation, the content sharing platform 120 may use the data store 106 to store media content items 121.
In one implementation, the search engine platform 150 may be one or more computing devices (e.g., rack-mounted servers, server computers, etc.) configured to allow users to query one or more content media items stored within the data store 106, the content sharing platform 120, and/or the server 130. In one implementation, the query results sent to the client device may include a set of search result items, where each search result item corresponds to a media content item stored within the data store 106, the content sharing platform 120, and/or the server 130.
In one implementation, the server 130 may be one or more computing devices (e.g., rack-mounted servers, server computers, etc.). The server 130 may be included in the content sharing platform 120 or be part of a different system. The server 130 may host a preview component 140 configured to store associations between different media content items and preview videos of the selected different media content items. For example, a media content item that is a movie may have multiple preview videos associated with the media content item, such as a video trailer, multiple video clips of the movie, and/or related summary videos describing or discussing aspects of the movie. In one implementation, the preview video of the media content item may be stored within the data store 106, the content sharing platform 120, and/or the server 130.
The preview component 140 can receive a search query from the user device 110, generate a list of media content items from the data store 106 that satisfy the search query, and generate a user interface to present search result items corresponding to the media content items from the list. In particular, the user interface may include a scrollable search area that contains search result items and an area referred to herein as a "focus area" that may present previews of media content items corresponding to particular search result items for which the user has indicated an interest in viewing. Based on the preview, the user can verify that the media content item that is emphasized in the preview is what the user wants to view, and can request to view the media content item that is emphasized in the preview (e.g., by selecting a play indicator or similar UI element). In response, the preview component 140 streams or downloads the requested media content item to the user device 110.
If the user decides that the media content item that is emphasized in the preview is not what the user wants to view, the user may continue to review the search results and may indicate an interest in another media content item associated with a different search result item using a particular gesture. In response, the preview component 140 provides previews of other media content items to the user device 110 such that the focal region of the UI is updated with previews of other media content items.
In some implementations, the preview component 140 includes a training engine that trains the machine learning model using a training set that reflects different user actions with respect to the search result items and associated media content items. The training agent may train the machine learning model using user gestures from the user and/or other users regarding previous inputs of the search result items as training inputs and using user selections of corresponding media content items for playback as target outputs. The training agent may train a machine learning model for a particular user and provide the trained machine learning model to the user device of the corresponding user for use, as discussed in more detail below.
Although embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed in terms of a content sharing platform and facilitating social networking sharing of content items on the content sharing platform, embodiments may be generally applicable to any type of social network that provides connections between users. Embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide users with channel subscriptions.
Where the systems discussed herein collect or may utilize personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform 120 collects user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, user purchase transaction history, entered user gestures, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways prior to storage or use such that personally identifiable information is eliminated. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as generalized to a city, ZIP code, or state level) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information about the user is collected and used by the content sharing platform 120.
FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary media viewer 111 of client devices 110A-110Z providing previews of media content items corresponding to search results selected from a search results list based on determined user interests. The media viewer 111 may include a communication component 205, a gesture component 210, and a display component 215. In one implementation, the communication component 205 may be configured to communicate with the content sharing platform 120, the search engine platform 150, and the preview component 140 to request and receive search result items, preview videos, and content media items for display and viewing in the UI of the media viewer 111.
In one embodiment, gesture component 210 may be configured to recognize user inputs and determine a different gesture for each user input. For example, gesture component 210 may recognize touch input, such as when a user's finger is approaching or contacting a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen) of a display of client device 110A. Gesture component 210 may also be configured to associate different gestures from different users with different types of input. For example, user a may input a gesture that gesture component 210 determines to be a tap gesture, while user B may input a similar gesture that gesture component 210 determines to be a press and hold gesture. Different users may have different touch inputs that gesture component 210 may be configured to learn and use to distinguish between different intended gestures. In an embodiment, gesture component 210 may be configured to implement a machine learning model to distinguish between different types of user gestures from a user and predict user interests for different types of previews of media content items based on the user's particular user gestures.
In an embodiment, gesture component 210 may use a machine learning model trained based on a training set reflecting different user actions with respect to search result items and associated media content items. Training may be performed by a training agent of the preview component 140 of the server 130 or by a training agent hosted by the user device 110.
The training agent may train the machine learning model using user gestures from the user and/or other users regarding previous inputs of search result items as training inputs and user selections of corresponding media items for playback as target outputs. For example, the training agent may be associated with a particular user, a user input trend, such as distinguishing user gestures based on how long the user tends to remain with a tap gesture or how fast the user slides their finger versus drags their finger.
In other embodiments, the training agent may train the machine learning model to predict user preferences for a desired type of preview video based on a training set including, but not limited to, different user gestures, previously viewed preview videos, associated content media item types, and subsequent user actions after presenting a particular preview video to the user. For example, if the user is presented with a preview video as a trailer and the user historically continues to scroll through the search result items before the trailer playback is complete, the training agent may include a negative response to the trailer preview video for the user in the training set.
Alternatively, the preview component 140 of the server 130 can use a machine learning model to distinguish between different types of user gestures from different users and predict user interests for different types of previews of media content items based on particular user gestures that can be communicated by the user's user device 110 to a particular user of the preview component 140. Upon predicting user interest in a preview of a media content item corresponding to one of the search result items presented to the user, the preview component 140 can provide a preview (e.g., a trailer, clip, or full video) of the media content item to the user device.
In an embodiment, the display component 215 is configured to render content of the user interface on the media viewer 111, including but not limited to a scrollable search results area with search results items and a focus area with preview content. For example, if gesture component 210 determines that a user selected a particular search result item for previewing, communication component 205 can request and then receive a preview video of a media content item corresponding to the particular search result item. The display component 215 may then render the preview video for display within the focal region on the media viewer 111. The display component 215 may automatically begin playing the preview video (after receiving the preview video and without any user input requesting playback). In some embodiments, if gesture component 210 determines that two search result items are located within the same focus area, display component 215 may render and play two different preview videos simultaneously within the focus area.
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method of receiving a plurality of search result items and presenting a preview of media content items corresponding to the selected search result items. In general, method 300 may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., processing devices, circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, method 300 may be performed by a component within media viewer 111 of FIG. 1 or FIG. 2.
For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies of the present disclosure are depicted and described as a series of acts. However, acts in accordance with the present disclosure may occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addition, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methodologies could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the methodologies disclosed herein are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computing devices. The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device or storage media.
As shown in FIG. 3, the method 300 may begin with processing logic receiving a plurality of search result items each corresponding to a media content item (block 305). In an embodiment, in response to receiving a search query from client device 110A, search engine platform 150 may send a plurality of search result items to client device 110A.
As a result of the user entering a search into the media viewer 111, a search query may be generated from the media viewer 111. Fig. 4A and 4B illustrate exemplary embodiments of user interfaces including a search input view 405 within the media viewer 111. Referring to fig. 4A, a user may enter text of a search query for related media content items in a search text box 410 using an input keyboard 420. Alternatively, the search input view 405 may display one or more search suggestions in the suggestion region 415. In an embodiment, one or more search suggestions in suggestion region 415 may be suggestions based on historical searches performed by a user or historical searches performed by other users using search engine platform 150 and/or content sharing platform 120. For example, upon initiating the search input view 405, the communication component 205 can request a set of one or more search suggestions based on historical searches from the search engine platform 150. In FIG. 4A, suggestion region 415 depicts an example of search suggestions received from search engine platform 150 and available genres that a user may select for narrowing the search.
FIG. 4B illustrates an embodiment of receiving updated search suggestions based on partially entered text in the search text box 410. In an embodiment, as characters are typed into the search text box 410, the communication component 205 can request a set of one or more search suggestions from the search engine platform 150 based on the characters typed into the search text box 410. For example, if the character "To" is entered into the search text box 410, the communication component 205 can request one or more search suggestions starting with "To" from the search engine platform 150. In fig. 4B, suggestion region 415 depicts an example of suggestions received from search engine platform 150 based on the partially entered text "To".
After entering text in search text box 410 and initiating a search by selecting search button 425, communications component 205 can send a search query including the entered text to search engine platform 150. Search engine platform 150 may send a plurality of search result items to client device 110A. Referring back to block 305, the communication component 205 of the client device 110A receives a plurality of search result items that each correspond to a media content item.
In an embodiment, each of the received plurality of search result items may include metadata describing its corresponding media content item. For example, the search result items corresponding to media content items of movie XYZ may include metadata specifying the title of movie XYZ, actors and actresses starring in the movie, the release date of the movie, descriptive text providing a movie summary, the genre of the movie, representative thumbnails of the movie, and/or any other descriptive or related metadata.
Upon receiving a plurality of search result items, processing logic presents a search result User Interface (UI) that includes a scrollable search result area and a focus area (block 310). FIG. 4C illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a search results UI including a search text box 410, a focus area 430, and a scrollable search results area 435. Other embodiments of the search results UI may include displaying a focus area 430 and a scrollable search results area 435 without the search text box 410. Still other embodiments may also include a display of an input keyboard 420, the input keyboard 420 may allow a user to enter search text when updating a search request. Embodiments of the search results UI may include displaying search text box 410, focus area 430, scrollable search results area 435, and/or input keyboard 420 in different locations within the user interface.
In one implementation, display component 215 renders the search result UI to include a search text box 410, a focus area 430, and a scrollable search result area 435, as shown in fig. 4C. The search text box 410 may display the input search text for the current search query. For example, if the input search text of the current search query is "actor A," then search text box 410 will display "actor A" in the input search text.
In one embodiment, scrollable search results area 435 may display a subset of the plurality of search result items received from search engine platform 150. The plurality of search result items received from the search engine platform 150 may be ranked according to relevance to the search request, with the first search result item being the most relevant search result item. Alternatively, the plurality of search result items may be ordered by other criteria, such as popularity, date of release, or type of content media item based on other users of the content sharing platform 120. For example, content media items that are live video, previously uploaded video, or released movies may be prioritized in search result item ranking. Additionally, the plurality of search result items may be ordered based on viewing preferences of the requesting user. For example, if the user prefers video from a subscribed channel, the plurality of search result items may be ranked such that video from the subscribed channel is first.
In an embodiment, the processing device of client device 110A may be configured to determine a prioritization of search result items based on local user preferences stored on client device 110A.
FIG. 4C depicts an exemplary embodiment of four search result items 441-444. Display component 215 may configure the display height of each of search result items 441-444 to be narrower or wider depending on the metadata displayed for each search result item. For example, search result item 441 contains metadata describing the title (movie ABC) and release date (1986) of the corresponding media content item. If additional metadata, such as summary text, is displayed, display component 215 may configure a higher height for search result item 441. Alternatively, if very little metadata is displayed, the display component may be configured to a lower height. The lower height of the search result items 441-444 may allow additional search result items from the plurality of search result items to be displayed within the scrollable search result area 435.
In an embodiment, the display component 215 may be configured to display the focal region 430 at a configured height relative to the display size of the client device 110A. For example, the display component 215 may configure a larger focal region 430 for the client devices 110A-110Z as smartphones or other devices having smaller display screens. While client devices 110A-110Z with larger screens may have a configured focal region 430 that occupies less relative space than scrollable search result area 435, allowing for a larger scrollable search result area 435 for displaying additional search result items.
In an embodiment, the display component 215 may be configured to present a preview of the media content item corresponding to the particular search result item within the focus area 430. For example, referring to FIG. 4C, the received plurality of search result items are search results corresponding to media content items related to a search for "actor A". The display component 215 may render a preview video of a media content item corresponding to a first search result item from the received plurality of search result items. In the example depicted in fig. 4C, the preview rendered in the focus area 430 is a preview video of movie XYZ of actor a's lead actor.
In an embodiment, processing logic may send a preview request to preview component 140 for a media content item corresponding to a particular search result item. Fig. 5 depicts an exemplary flow chart for sending a preview request and receiving a preview of a media content item for presentation within a focus area 430. Block 505 shows the communication component 205 sending a preview request to the preview component 140 for a preview corresponding to the media content item. In an embodiment, a particular search result item corresponding to a media content item may be selected to be previewed within a focus area. Using the example depicted in fig. 4C, a particular search result item corresponds to a media content item of movie XYZ.
In an embodiment, the preview component 140 can receive the preview request and then determine the appropriate preview video to send back to the client device 110A. As previously described, the preview component 140 is configured to maintain an association between the media content item and the preview of the media content item. For example, the received preview request may comprise a request for a preview related to the media content item movie XYZ. The preview component 140 can maintain one or more relevant preview videos of the media content item movie XYZ. For example, the preview video of movie XYZ may include other media content items such as a trailer of a movie, a selected video clip of a movie, a related summary video of a movie, an actual video of movie XYZ, or any other associated video related to movie XYZ.
In an embodiment, the preview video may be a lower resolution video with or without sound. For example, the associated preview video of movie XYZ may include a low resolution video, such as a 15 frames per second video without sound. Low resolution video may be advantageous to save bandwidth when transferring preview video between preview component 140 and client device 110A. When multiple preview videos are requested and received over the network 105, transmitting smaller video sizes, such as low resolution videos, may improve network efficiency and may reduce video playback lag because rendering smaller sized videos uses less processing resources and time.
In an embodiment, the preview request may specify the type of preview video requested. For example, the processing device may determine that the user prefers video trailers over video clips for the media content item based on historical viewing preferences of the user preview. In another example, the type of preview video requested may be based on the media content item itself. For example, if the media content item is a short video, the sent preview request may include a request for the actual video of the media content item because the media content item is a short video rather than a long movie. In an embodiment, the preview component 140 may be configured to determine the type of preview video to send based on user preferences stored within the content sharing platform 120 or within the client devices 110A-110Z. For example, the preview component 140 upon receiving a preview request can communicate with the content sharing platform 120 to determine what type of preview the user prefers based on the stored user profile and viewing history.
Referring back to fig. 5, block 510 depicts receiving, by the communication component 205, the preview video from the preview component 140. In an embodiment, the preview component 140 transmits a preview video of the media content item corresponding to the search result item via the network 105. At block 515, the display component 215 renders and presents a preview video of the media content item within the focus area 430. For example, if the received preview video is a trailer of movie XYZ, the display component 215 renders and presents the trailer within the focus area 430.
In an embodiment, upon receiving a plurality of search result items (block 305), the display component 215 may initially present a thumbnail of the first search result item within the focus area 430. The metadata for the first search result item may include a thumbnail or other related illustration of the corresponding media content item that may be displayed within the focus area 430. After displaying the thumbnail of the first search result item, the communication component 205 can then request a preview of the media content item corresponding to the first search result item, as depicted in FIG. 5.
In an alternative embodiment, when multiple search result items are sent from the search engine platform 150 to the client device 110A, a preview video of the media content item corresponding to the first search result item (the search result item with the highest ranking) may be sent to the client device 110A. Referring back to block 305, for example, when the communication component 205 receives multiple search result items from the search engine platform 150, the search engine platform 150 may also initially retrieve from the preview component 140 a preview video of the media content item corresponding to the first search result item. The search engine platform 150 then sends the plurality of search result items and the preview video associated with the first search result item to the communication component 205. The display component 215 may then render and present the preview video within the focus area 430 and render and display a subset of the search result items in the scrollable search result area 435.
Referring back to FIG. 3, processing logic may receive a user gesture within scrollable search results area 435 on the touch screen of client device 110A (block 315). In an embodiment, the user gesture may be input from a user's finger or other tool such as a stylus onto the touch screen surface of client device 110A. The user gesture may include, but is not limited to, a tap gesture, a press and hold gesture, a drag gesture, a swipe gesture, or any other trackable touch gesture. A tap gesture may refer to a user initiating contact with a touch screen surface, such as by touching or pressing the surface with a finger or other input item at a particular location on the touch screen surface. Once contact is made, gesture component 210 determines coordinates of the input relative to the current user interface.
The press and hold gesture may refer to user input as continuous input over a period of time. For example, a user may initiate contact with a touch screen surface and maintain such contact for a period of time (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 seconds), such as by touching or pressing the surface with a finger or other input item at a particular location. Once contact has been maintained for a predefined period of time, gesture component 210 determines press and hold coordinates of the input relative to the current user interface.
A drag gesture may refer to a behavior or instance in which a user input moves a finger or other item of input in contact with the touch screen over the touch screen to activate a function, where the speed of movement of the input is below a threshold. A swipe gesture may refer to a behavior or instance in which a user input moves a finger or other item of input in contact with the touch screen over the touch screen to activate a function, where the speed of movement of the input is above a threshold. Once contact has been made and the act of moving the input while maintaining contact with the touch screen occurs, gesture component 210 determines start and end coordinates of the input and a speed of movement of the input based on a threshold of the speed of movement to determine whether the input is a drag, swipe, or other type of gesture.
At block 320, processing logic determines whether the received user gesture indicates a user interest in the second media content item. In an embodiment, gesture component 210 determines whether the received user gesture is a user gesture that moves a particular search result item into focus area 430 that indicates an interest in the particular search result item. For example, referring to fig. 4D, the received user gesture 450 is a tap gesture. Gesture component 210 may then determine that user gesture 450 indicates a user interest in search result item 443 located at the coordinates entered by user gesture 450. Gesture component 210 may then shift search result items 441-444 upward such that search result item 443 is located in focal region 430 and search result item 444 is located at a position directly below focal region 430 within scrollable search result region 435. In an embodiment, as search result items 441-444 are shifted upward, display component 215 may determine a subset of new search result items from the plurality of search result items and render and display an updated search result UI with search result items 444-447 within scrollable search result area 435, as depicted in FIG. 4E.
In another example, the received user gesture may be a drag gesture or a swipe gesture. Referring to fig. 4D, gesture component 210 may determine whether user gesture 455 is a drag gesture or a swipe gesture based on the input item and the speed of movement of the user associated with the input gesture. In an embodiment, gesture component 210 may determine that user gesture 455 is a swipe gesture based on a speed of movement of the user input and a threshold of the user associated with the gesture input. For example, gesture component 210 may determine a particular threshold for the current user's speed of movement based on machine learning or other criteria. The threshold for this determination may be based on a determination between past user input and past dragging and sliding of the user. In an embodiment, configuring the user-specific threshold enables gesture component 210 to be more accurate in determining subsequent user inputs. If gesture component 210 determines that user gesture 455 is a swipe, gesture component may shift search result items 441-444 at a speed corresponding to the speed of user gesture 455. Additionally, gesture component 210 may determine that search result item 444 is a search result item that the user is interested in previewing based on the starting location and speed of movement of user gesture 455.
Alternatively, gesture component 210 may determine that user gesture 455 is a drag gesture based on the speed of movement of the user input being below a threshold of the user associated with the gesture input. In an embodiment, gesture component 210 may then determine that the user is interested in viewing a preview of each search result item that overlaps with focus area 430 while the drag gesture is occurring. For example, the user may slowly drag the search result item 444 upward such that each of the search result items 441-444 slowly overlaps the focus region 430 such that a preview of each corresponding media content item may be viewed while the drag gesture is occurring. In this example, when the user gesture 455 occurs, the gesture component 210 may determine the user interest based on the speed of the drag gesture and the overlapping position of the search result items.
In an embodiment, gesture component 210 may determine that user gesture 450 is a press and hold gesture based on continuous input over a period of time. Gesture component 210 may then determine that the user intends to save the media content item selected by the press and hold gesture. Referring to FIG. 4D as an example, if the user gesture 450 is a press and hold gesture on the search result item 443, the gesture component 210 may determine that the user wants to download a media content item ("movie DEF") associated with the search result item 443. In an implementation, the communication component 205 can request a download of the selected media content item and save the selected media content item to the user device 110A. In another implementation, the communication component 205 can request that the selected media content item be saved to a cloud storage or other remote storage location associated with the user. In addition, if the selected media content item represents a "live stream," the communication component 205 can request that the "live stream" of the media content item be recorded and saved to the user device 110A or a remote storage location.
Referring back to FIG. 3, as a result of determining that the user gesture indicates user interest in the second media content item, processing logic presents a preview of the second media content item (block 325). In an embodiment, the processing device may perform the acts depicted in flowchart 5 for sending a preview request for a preview of a second media content item and receiving a preview of the second media content item for presentation within the focus area 430. For example, at block 505, the communication component 205 may send a preview request for a preview of a second media content item (e.g., movie DEF) corresponding to the search result item 443.
In an embodiment, the type of preview requested in the preview request may be based on the type of user gesture determined by gesture component 210. For example, gesture component 210 may be configured to distinguish between different types of preview requests for a particular content media item based on whether user gesture 450 is a tap gesture or a press and hold gesture. If it is determined that the user gesture 450 is a tap gesture, the preview request may request a default preview video, such as a trailer or other video, associated with a particular media content item of the search result item. However, if it is determined that the user gesture 450 is a press and hold gesture, the preview request may request a particular type of preview video, such as a clip of the media content item or the actual media content item itself. Embodiments of determining the type of preview requested in the preview request may be configured based on user-defined specific user preferences or may be derived from machine learning techniques based on historical viewing trends of the user.
At block 510, the communication component 205 may receive a preview video of the second media content item from the preview component 140. At block 515, the display component 215 may render and display the preview video of the second media content item within the focus area 430. Fig. 4E depicts the display component 215 rendering and displaying an exemplary view of a second media content item in the focus area 430, wherein the second media content item corresponds to a preview video of the movie DEF starring actor a.
Referring back to the example of receiving the user gesture 455, if it is determined that the user gesture 455 is a drag gesture, then it may be determined that each search result item that overlaps with the focus area 430 during the drag is an interest search result item. The display component 215 may then render and display a preview video of each media content item while the drag gesture is occurring.
Referring to FIG. 4F, as search result item 441 is shifted into focus area 430, a preview video associated with search result item 441 is played. If only a portion of search result item 441 overlaps with focal region 430, a corresponding amount of preview video of search result item 441 will be displayed and played within the focal region. In an embodiment, the display component 215 may determine a percentage of the rendered preview to display within the focus area 430 based on the amount of the particular search result item that overlaps with the focus area 430. For example, as search result item 441 is shifted into focus area 430, a percentage of preview video corresponding to the content media item associated with search result item 441 is displayed in focus area 430. The displayed percentage corresponds to the percentage of search result items 441 that overlap with the focus area 430. For example, in FIG. 4F, 50% of the search result items 441 corresponding to the content media items of "movie ABC" are displayed within the bottom 50% of the focus area 430. The top 50% of the focus area 430 continues to display the preview video of the content media item associated with movie XYZ. In another example, if only the top 5% of the search result item overlaps with the focus area 430, the display component 215 will display only the top 5% of the corresponding preview video within the bottom 5% of the focus area 430, while the top 95% of the focus area 430 will still display the bottom 95% of the previous preview video. The simultaneous presentation of preview videos of movies XYZ and ABC enables seamless playback of preview videos for a user.
Referring back to the example of receiving the user gesture 455, if it is determined that the user gesture 455 is a swipe gesture, the display component 215 may render and display only preview videos of media content items determined to be of interest to the user. For example, user gesture 455 begins on search result item 444. As search result items 444 are shifted upward toward focal region 430, search result items 441-443 overlap and pass through focal region 430. Since the search result items 441-443 are determined not to be of interest to the user, the display component 215 does not render and display the preview video. In an embodiment, as search result items 441-443 pass through focus area 430, display component 215 may display relevant metadata, such as thumbnails or relevant illustrations, within focus area 430.
In an embodiment, the display component 215 may be configured to overlay descriptive text related to the content media item onto a preview video of the content media item. For example, if a preview video of movie ABC is being played within the focus area 430, the display component 215 may overlay descriptive text from metadata in the corresponding search result item onto the preview video. As a result, the user may view the summary of the content media item while viewing the preview of the content media item.
Referring to fig. 4E, gesture component 210 may detect a user gesture 460 within focal region 430. In an embodiment, if gesture component 210 detects user input within focal region 430, such as user gesture 460, gesture component 210 may determine that the user intends to view the corresponding media item being previewed. The user gesture 460 may then cause the communication component 205 to request a corresponding media content item for playback. Fig. 4G depicts an embodiment of a playback user interface in which corresponding media content items are rendered and played by display component 215 for viewing by a user. Playback view 465 illustrates an embodiment of a playback user interface. In other embodiments, the playback user interface may be configured differently according to client device 110A and other user preferences. In yet other embodiments, playback may be initiated within another application or may be streamed to a second client device, such as a smart television or monitor.
