And (c) uses at least some of cluster set to determine at least one class of predefined taxonomic hierarchies
Not (such as, verticals categories).
At least some embodiment according to the present invention can (such as term co-occurrence gathers Semantic Clustering
Class) it is associated with one or more classifications (such as verticals categories) of predefined taxonomic hierarchies.
These embodiments can be completed by following: (a) accepts Semantic Clustering, and (b) uses and connect
The cluster being subject to identify the collection that one or more scoring concept is constituted, (c) use one or
At least some of multiple scoring concepts identifies the collection that one or more classification is constituted, and (d)
At least some in one or more classifications is associated with Semantic Clustering.
At least some embodiment according to the present invention can make assets (such as website) with predefined
One or more classifications (such as verticals categories) of taxonomic hierarchies are associated.This embodiment can
To be achieved in that (a) accepts the information about assets, (b) uses the money accepted
Product information identifies what one or more scoring Semantic Clustering (such as term co-occurrence clusters) was constituted
Collection, (c) uses at least some in one or more scoring Semantic Clustering to identify one or many
The collection that individual classification (such as verticals categories) is constituted, and (d) is one or more classifications extremely
Some are associated with assets less.

The exemplary embodiment according to the present invention is described in 4.2.§ 4.3 provides diagram according to
The example of the operation in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Finally, illustrate in § 4.4 about
Some conclusions of the present invention.
§ 4.1 defines
" assets (property) " is above providing some things of advertisement.Assets can
Within including online content (such as website, MP3 audio program, game on line etc.), off-line
Hold (such as newspaper, magazine, arenas performance, concert, sports tournament etc.) and/or off-line
Object (such as notice board, stadium scoreboard and outfield wall, side of truck trailer etc.).
Having substantial assets (such as magazine, newspaper, website, email message etc.) can be by
It is referred to as " media asset ".Although assets itself can be off-line, but about assets
Relevant information is (such as (multiple) attribute, (multiple) theme, (multiple) concept, (many
Individual) classification, (multiple) key word, relevant information, (multiple) adline of being supported
Deng) can be online available.Such as, outdoor jazz can input theme red-letter day
" music " and " jazz ", the position of concert, the time of concert, arrangement occur in
The artist in this red-letter day and available ad spot types (such as wide in printing programme
Accuse release position, advertisement putting point before the lights, the advertisement putting point in seat back, patronage
The audio announcement etc. of person).
" document " will be interpreted broadly the work being to include any computer-readable and machine-storable
Make product.Document can be file, file combination, have the inline linking to other file
One or more files etc..File can have any type, such as text, HTML,
XML, audio frequency, image, video etc..By permissible for the reproduced part to the document of terminal use
It is considered as " content " of described document.Document can include " structural data ", comprises
Some instruction (such as e-mail fields of the meaning of content (word, picture etc.) and this content
With the data being associated, html tag and the data etc. being associated).Advertisement in a document
Position can be defined by embedded information or instruction.In the range of the Internet, general document
It it is webpage.Webpage usually include content and can include embedded information (such as metamessage,
Hyperlink etc.) and/or embedded instruction (such as java script etc.).As a rule, literary composition
Shelves have storage position unique, addressable and therefore can be come by this addressable position
Uniquely identify.Resource locator URL) it is for accessing the unique of information on the Internet
Address.Another example of document includes the website of multiple relevant (such as linking) webpage
(website).The another example of document is advertisement.
" web document " includes any document announced on WWW.The example example of web document
As included website or webpage.
" document information " can include in a document included any information, can be from document
Information (being referred to as " document derived information ") that included information derives and/or with document phase
Close information (being referred to as " document related information ") and this information extension (such as from
The information that relevant information derives).The example of document derived information is content of text based on document
Classification.The example of document related information includes from having other of the link of document up till now
The document information of document, and the document information of other document being linked to from current document.
" vertical (vertical) " is Related product, service, industry, content format, audient
Demographic information and/or the group of theme, it may find or in website in web site contents
Hold.
" cluster (cluster) " is intended to a group element of the compactest appearance.Such as, poly-
Class can be that the one group of word often tending to jointly to occur is (such as on webpage, look in search
In inquiry, in catalogue, in speech article (online or off-line), discussing or electronics
Mail threads (email thread) is medium).
" concept (concept) " be the meaning carrier (with the meaning representative (agent) relative,
Such as press the specific word in language-specific).It is thus possible, for instance single concept can be by arbitrary number
Language express, or selectively express with given language.Such as, word STOP, HALT,
ANSCHLAG, ARRESTO and PARADA broadly fall into identical concept.Concept is abstract
, this is owing to they have ignored the things difference in its outer Yanzhong, they are considered as seem
Identical.Concept is general, this is because they are equally applicable to every of its outer Yanzhong
Things.
" taxonomic hierarchies (taxonomy) " be structurized, be typically layering (but can
Being flat) collection of classification or class (or classification or class are implied principle)." classification
(category) " can correspond to " node " in taxonomic hierarchies.
" score " can be allocated to any numerical value of object.Thus, score can include by
Number determined by formula, it can be called " according to the score of formula ".Score can be wrapped
Including the object ranking in the ordered set of object, it can be called " sequentially score ".
§ 4.2 is according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention
Fig. 1 illustrate the operation that can be provided in an exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention with
And can be by the information that this operation used and/or produced.Cluster based on term co-occurrence generation/
Mark operation 110 can accept the word 105 in context and produce word-clustering information (example
Such as index) 115.Produce this information 115, then term co-occurrence produces/mark operation
110 can be used in response to (multiple) input word 105 to identify one or more (such as
Word) cluster 120.Filtration/data reduction operation 122 can be used to produce " more preferably " and gathers
The subset 122 of class.
Concept produces/mark operation 130 can accept to cluster 120 or 124 and produce cluster-
Conceptual information (such as index) 135.Having produced this information 135, concept produces/mark
Know operation 130 and can be used in response to input cluster 120 or 124 one or more to identify
Concept 140.Filtration/data reduction operation 142 can be used to produce the subset of " more preferably " concept
144。
Classification produces/mark operation 150 can accept concept 140 or 144 and produce concept-
Classification information (such as index) 155.Having produced this information 155, classification produces/mark
Know operation 150 to can be used to identify one or more class in response to input concept 140 or 144
Other 160.These classifications can be the node of taxonomic hierarchies.Filtration/about reducing 162 can for classification
To be used for producing the subset 164 of " more preferably " classification.
Deposit many examples of word 105 within a context.Such as, the word in context can
To be included by search inquiry and/or to include in the search sessions of one or more search inquiry
Word and/or phrase.As another example, the word in context can be at document (such as net
Page) in or collection of document (such as website) or group in the word that found and/or phrase.As again
One example, the word in context can be the word in initiative advertisement and/or phrase.
Produce/identify operation 110, in certain or some referring back to cluster based on term co-occurrence
Hereafter (such as search inquiry, search sessions, webpage, website, article, blog, discussion sequence
Row etc.) in word jointly occur can be used to produce phrase or term clustering.Once define
These clusters, then word-cluster index can be stored.Use this index, given one or many
Individual word, can identify the one or more clusters including this word.Gather for producing and/or identify this
The example of the operation of class is probabilistic hierarchical reasoning learning machine, such as that on October 3rd, 2002
Entitled " the Methods and Apparatus for Probabilistic Hierarchical submitted to
Inferential Learner " U.S. Provisional Application sequence number 60/416,144 (be referred to as that " ' 144 are faced
Time " and at this by for reference for its content quotation) and within 30th, carry in JIUYUE in 2003

The U.S. patent application serial number 10/676,571 of inventor (is referred to as " ' 571 application " and at this
By for reference for its content quotation) described in.
One exemplary embodiment of PHIL is that one is tended to search at www.google.com
The system of the word cluster that is mutually related occurred together in session.Word in this cluster is permissible
By it, the statistical significance of this cluster is weighted.The word that such cluster is had can be from
Several words are to thousands of words.It is poly-that one embodiment of PHIL model comprises hundreds of thousands
Class and cover all language, proportional to their search rate.Cluster can be assigned
The attribute that will be used by application (such as online advertising system), such as STOP is (such as
Mainly comprise such as " be somebody's turn to do ", " one ", " a kind of " etc. do not express the word of what meaning),
PORN, NEGATIVE (comprise and occur frequently in reverse side, constrain or word in sensitive article,
Such as " bomb ", " suicide " etc.) and LOCATION etc..Another enforcement at PHIL
In example, safeguard model for every kind of language, safeguard to simplify and update.
PHIL server can using document (such as webpage) as input and return with content "
Join " cluster.Advertising creative and/or target keyword as input and can also be returned
The cluster joined.Thus, it can be used to advertisement to match with web page contents.
Produce/identify operation 130 referring back to concept and classification produces/identify operation 150, these behaviour
Work can accept one or more cluster and identify one or more classification (examples of taxonomic hierarchies
Such as node).When using when cooperating with term co-occurrence clusters mark operation 110, these operations 130
One or more word can be accepted with 150 and identify one or more classifications of taxonomic hierarchies.
Example for generation and/or the operation 130 and 150 of identified category is that semantics recognition draws
Hold up, such as at U.S. Patent number 6,453,315 (at this by for reference for its content quotation) title
For " Meaning-Based Information Organization and Retrieval " and list Adam
Weissman and Gilad Isreal Elbaz is described in the document of inventor；And such as exist
U.S. Patent number 6,816,857 (at this by for reference for its content quotation) is entitled
" Meaning-Based Advertising and Document Relevant Determination " arranges
Go out described in Adam Weissman and document that Gilad Israel Elbaz is inventor.
Exemplary semantics recognition engine (being referred to below as " Circadia ") can check document
And it is classified in any taxonomic hierarchies.It is general that Circadia includes that hundreds of thousands is mutually related
Read and the proprietary body (ontology) of corresponding word.Concept in Circadia body is and language
Say unrelated.The word of language-specific (language-specific) and these conceptual dependencies.
Circadia server supports that two primary operational " sense " and " searching ".Sensing operation
Accept document or text string (to be claimed as the weighted concept collection inputting and being returned for this input
For " main points (gist) ") as output.Thus, the sensing operation in Circadia is concept
The example of mark operation 130.Then this main points are used as finding request input.As
Response, optimal classification and corresponding semantic score thereof in specified taxonomic hierarchies are returned.
Thus, searching in Circadia operation is that classification logotype operation 150 (and is probably classification mistake
Filter/about reducing 162) example.Of course, it is possible to use such as open directory project (" ODP ")
Other taxonomic hierarchieses such as taxonomic hierarchies, standard industrial classification (" SIC ") taxonomic hierarchies.
Fig. 2 illustrate the operation that can provide in an exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention and
The information that institute uses and/or produces can be operated, for cluster (such as word and/or word by this
Collection) be associated (such as map or index) with the classification of taxonomic hierarchies.Cluster is to taxonomic hierarchies
Category associations produces operation 220 and accepts clustering information 210 and produce the cluster information to classification
230.Such as, operation 220 can be (the most poly-to concept mark operation 130' transmission clustering information
Class identifier), concept mark operation 130' can use this cluster-conceptual information (such as index)
135' obtains one or more concept.Then this operation 130' can be to cluster to taxonomic hierarchies class
Guan Lian not produce operation 220 these (multiple) concepts of return.Then these to operate 220 permissible

Individual or the inverted index of multiple document.
The method that § 4.2.1 is exemplary
Fig. 5 may be employed in the manner of the present invention one or more clusters with one or more
The flow chart of the illustrative methods 500 that classification is associated.Referring back to Fig. 2, method 500 can be used
Perform to operate 220.Can be for each main actions performing method 500 of multiple clusters.
As selection, cluster can be grouped and be processed as group and treat.But for letter
The description of change method 500, will describe the process of single cluster.Cluster accepted (block 510) and
And use the collection (block 520) that this cluster constituted to identify one or more concept.Can about subtract and
/ or filter (multiple) concept (block 530) identified.It is then possible to what use was identified
Concept identifies the collection (block 540) that one or more classification is constituted.Can about subtract and/or filter
(multiple) classification (block 550) identified.Finally, (node 570) is exited in method 500
Before, the cluster accepted can be with (multiple) classification being identified (and possibly filtering out)
Be associated (block 560).
Referring back to block 510, cluster can be PHIL cluster, or such as tends at search inquiry
Or the common word collection occurred in search sessions.This cluster can be intended to the most common
The word collection occurred.
Referring back to block 530, such as can be by its scoring, to one or more threshold application
Concept score (definitely and/or relatively), only take the highest N number of scoring concept or above-mentioned any group
Incompatible filtration and/or about subtract concept.Similarly, referring back to block 550, such as can be by it
Scoring, to one or more threshold application category score (definitely and/or relatively), only take the highest
M scoring concept or above-mentioned any combination are filtered and/or about subtract classification.
As indicated in bracket, action 520-550 can be combined into individual part, is used for using
Accepted cluster identifies one or more classification.But, Circadia is designed to be used in " sense
Survey " operation be followed by " searching " operate classify.First according to cluster mark concept then root
Carry out identified category according to concept rather than be directly from the advantage clustering classification: if
Between concept (" main points ") stored, then they can be used directly to be categorized into multiple can
Taxonomic hierarchies any one in without repeat sensing operate.I.e., once it has been determined that
Concept, then it is prone to arrive word, classification, other concept etc..
Referring back to block 560, by producing and storing, cluster (identifier) can be mapped to one
Individual or the index of multiple classification (identifier), and cluster is associated with one or more classifications.
Alternatively or additionally, can produce and store classification (identifier) is mapped to one or many
The inverted index of individual cluster (identifier).
Referring back to block 510, can be with refinement cluster so that only including optimal T (such as,
50) word (such as based on marking between cluster and/or clustering interior scoring).Here, in cluster
Scoring can increase with the increase of the number of times that word occurs in cluster, and can be with this word
The number of times that language occurs in document (such as webpage, search inquiry, search sessions) is gathered increases
And reduce.Thus, in cluster, score such as can be defined as such as count_in_cluster/
count_in_search_query_collection.Furthermore it is possible to excite (firing) based in cluster
Determine that number (T) rather than each cluster of the optimal word of each cluster are fixed with identical
The word of number.The cluster score used in the application of ' 571 can also be used.
Referring back to the block 520-550 of Fig. 5, at least one the exemplary reality according to the present invention
Execute in example, concept can be determined with Circadia server used as described below according to cluster.
Referring back to the block 520 of Fig. 5, the first step in using Circadia classification is by " sense
Survey " operation, it returns " main points ".This is characterized by the concept matching from Circadia body
Internal weight-sets.Thus, it is thus achieved that the main points (such as based on 50 words) of each cluster.
Referring back to the block 540 and 550 of Fig. 5, second step include carrying out " searching " operation with
Just from taxonomic hierarchies request optimum N (such as N=2) specified in the case of given main points
Classification and corresponding semantic score.
According at least one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, from finding, operation requests is optimal
Two classifications and corresponding semantic score thereof.In this exemplary (multiple) embodiment, this is
Good two classifications are called " mainly " classification (for optimal scoring one) of each cluster
" secondary " classification.If Circadia does not determine any classification for cluster, then this cluster
Receive the main and secondary classification of " NONE ".If Circadia only determine primary categories and
Do not determine secondary classification, then secondary classification is arranged to " NONE ".
Referring back to block 550, filter those scores according at least one embodiment of the present invention and be less than
The classification of threshold value.Threshold value can be predetermined threshold.If additionally, existed more in original cluster
Many words, then this threshold value can be configured so that lower, actually the word in each cluster
Number regards that a kind of statistical significance calling Circadia is measured as.Such as, if cluster has
There is the word of more than M (such as, 50), then people can more believe that only use is wherein
Optimal 50 words can provide preferable representative sample, and this allows to relax described threshold value.So
And if cluster is only less than M word, then because word sampling is less and potentially includes
The most significant word in cluster, therefore improves threshold value and is probably desirable.

§ 4.2.3.3 extracts website-cluster from the advertising service daily record relevant with content and maps and obtain
Point
Referring back to the word-clustering information (index) 115 of Fig. 1, website (example can be the following is
The website in advertising network as relevant in participated in content, such as from California, USA Mountain
The AdSense of the Google in View city) produce the weight-sets clustered.
Can be to each page browsing for web displaying (such as, AdSense) advertisement
(pageview) log recording is produced.This log recording can be utilized to record for webpage
The collection that scoring (PHIL) clusters.For given webpage, exist multiple (such as at one
And between a dozen) cluster, and each cluster have be associated activation score (for example, see
' 571 application of " activating (activation) " is described.) activate score be given cluster for
More important measuring conceptually is had for analyzed document.The activation score of lower value shows
Relatively low concept importance, and the activation score of high value shows higher concept importance.
§ 4.2.3.4 is the collection that each website determines scoring cluster
Can ignore and be not reaching at least activating for predetermined value (such as 1.0) of this webpage
Those clusters (as mentioned above) (looking back the operation 122 of such as Fig. 1) divided.This predetermined value can
To be configured to the minimum threshold that ad system is used when providing advertisement.Can also be ignored certain
A little particular cases cluster (such as those are marked as the cluster of STOP).
For remaining cluster (being referred to as " qualified cluster "), it may be determined that these clusters
The sum of activation score.Each qualified cluster for webpage obtains " score ".Cluster scores
The two product following can be defined as: the activation score of qualified cluster, (b) on (a) webpage
The page browsing number that this webpage receives.
Following examples illustrate and can how to come for qualified cluster score as mentioned above.Assuming that at net
Given cluster c1 is activated on two webpages in standing.Assuming that this cluster activating on webpage p1
It is divided into 10.0 and activates to be divided into 20.0 on webpage p2.During one week, webpage p1 connects
1000 page browsings are received and webpage p2 have received 1500 page browsings.Within a week
Cluster scores and the page browsing number for website long-pending and be 100,000.Then cluster will connect
Receive the following whole score of described website:
SCORE=((10.0 activation/page browsing * 1000 page browsing)+
(20.0 activation/page browsing * 1500 page browsing))/100,000 activation
=(10,000+30,000)/100,000
=0.4
This adds by the page browsing number on each webpage of website and activation score effectively
Total cluster scores of power website.The collection of the cluster scores of website amounts to 1.One of the method lacks
Point is that the high flow of given webpage does not necessarily implys that and relatively low stream from the point of view of classification position
The webpage of amount is compared more representative.It is thus possible to wish regulation page browsing number parameter and/or
Cluster webpage is activated score and gives higher weights.Of course, it is possible to according to one or more factors
Function carry out weighted activation score, these factors are using scope according to an embodiment of the invention
It is inside rational.
After the collection of scoring cluster obtaining website, can be by only selecting optimal S (example
Such as 25) higher assessment segregation class (having all clusters of website less than S cluster) reduces
The number of cluster.Can be by only keeping the optimal Y% of composition institute identification sets according to score (such as
70%) the class of higher assessment segregation about subtracts this set.
Remaining score clustered can be made to standardize so that they summations are 1.
§ 4.2.3.5 is that each website determines " most preferably " classification
Referring back to the operation 162 of Fig. 1, can be that each website determines the classification collection (example about subtracted
Such as main and secondary classification).The classification 160 serving as this operation input can be the scoring of website
The abatement of classification (be associated in PHIL cluster correlation and be referred to below as " cluster classification ")
Collection (described above).Typically, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention
In, there is the final collection of about ten (10) cluster classification in each website.It is usually present cluster
The overlap of classification, but each cluster can have diverse classification.
According to one embodiment of present invention, classification is that each branch includes up to Z (example
Such as 5) part of the hierarchical classification system of grade.In this embodiment, except at classified body
Outside judging between the difference " branch " of system, also determine that the optimal level along branch.Such as,
Certain ground that classification should be in "/Automotive (/ automobile) " branch may be will be apparent from
Side, but problem is "/Automotive (/ automobile) ", "/Automotive/Auto Parts
(/ automobile/automobile component) ", "/Automotive/Auto Parts/Vehicle Tires (/ vapour
Car/automobile component/vehicle tyre) " or "/Automotive/Vehicle Maintenance (/
Automobile/vehicle maintenance) " in which be best one.The score of each input cluster
Affect the main and secondary cluster classification importance for the global classification of website.
For websites collection, no matter there being how many cluster classification to contend with one other, can in the middle of them
Can all not have enough concept importance (such as, as by the score of the category and measure)
It is worth selecting.In other words, it is possible to classification too may be weakened among website thus
Any single classification can not be allowed " to win ".In at least some embodiment according to the present invention,
Can be strengthened this as required by arranging threshold value (being such as stored as floating decimal)
Little concept importance.Assuming that the cluster scores of given website is typically canonicalized as amounting to 1, at least
In some embodiments, the minimum concept importance threshold value of 0.24 or about 0.24 can produce well
Result.This means if the optimal candidate of main or secondary classification has asking less than 0.24
And score, then the classification of " NONE " can be distributed.Note, can be based on for website
The cluster method that carries out marking to regulate this threshold value.
In at least some embodiments, it may be desirable to omit secondary cluster classification carry out classifieds website and
It not to use main and secondary cluster classification to carry out classifieds website.
Below the description of exemplary embodiment uses following term.To definite form it is
The hierarchical categories path of/level-1/level-2/.../level-m, the deepest etc. during wherein m is path
Progression, " subsume-level-n " refers to: if n < m, then comprise until grade n
Path；And if n >=m, the most do not comprise this path.Such as, for the feelings of wherein n < m
For condition, category path "/Automotive/Auto Parts/Vehicle Tires "
Subsume-level-2 (comprising rank 2) is "/Automotive/Auto Parts/ ".As separately
One example, for wherein n >=m in the case of for, "/Automotive/Auto
Parts/Vehicle Tires " subsume-level-4 (comprising rank 4) be "/Automotive/
Auto Parts/Vehicle Tires " self and do not revise.
Noting, grade n classification includes intra-category cluster (multiple) score of their own, and
The cluster scores of any comprised deeper level classification.These cluster scores and be referred to as grade n
" comprising categorical clusters score from & " (or " S&S categorical clusters score ") of classification.
For document (such as website) is classified, no matter there being how many classifications to contend with one other, it
Either of which do not have enough concept importances to make to be worth selected, concept is important
Property utilizes S&S categorical clusters score to measure.In other words, the cluster of website may be
Too weakened among possible classification so that any one classification can not be allowed to be considered beyond doubt should
The optimal classification of website.
In at least some embodiment according to the present invention, can apply by arranging threshold value
Little concept importance requirement.Certainly, because compared with de-luxe compartment containing grade corresponding to more general classification,
The classification having passed through threshold value at grade is contained at relatively de-luxe compartment so being easier to obtain.According to this
In bright at least some embodiment, select threshold value so that striding across each total quality comprising grade
Maximize, but even if owing to these classifications most suitable classification may comprise ranking score relatively low
At grade the most necessarily lower than at higher level, relatively low comprise grade so being slightly partial to.
According in one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, it is assumed that the cluster scores of given website
And be 1 (as described in detail above) and use have that the order of magnitude is 500 nodes five
Layer category classification system, then the minimum concept importance threshold ratio of about 0.24 is more applicable.Phase
The minimum concept importance threshold value of believer in a certain religion 0.20 to 0.30 should be more applicable.This means if
Optimal candidate in the given main or secondary classification comprised at grade has the summation less than threshold value
Score, then the classification of " NONE " can be distributed.Note, determine that suitable threshold value can rely on
The method carrying out marking for the cluster being classified on document.
In the case of having been incorporated into some terms, presently describe for the side according to the present invention
Formula determines the illustrative methods of " most preferably " classification of document.If t is minimum concept importance threshold
Value.If d is the deepest grade in taxonomic hierarchies." most preferably " can be determined as follows main
Want classification.Determine and most preferably comprise grade 1 (subsume-level-1) and corresponding S&S classification thereof
Cluster scores.To until all grades of grade d repeat this process.Select most preferably to comprise grade p
Maximum (the deepest) value of the p of S&S categorical clusters score >=t that classification has.As replacement,
S&S categorical clusters can be analyzed from the deepest classification grade to optimal (the most general) classification grade to obtain
Point.By this way, the method can be after processing the grade of wherein S&S category score >=t
Stop.If v (optimal primary categories) is for most preferably comprising grade p classification, or without class
Do not meet threshold value and so set v as " NONE ".
" most preferably " secondary classification can be defined as described below.If optimal primary categories v is
" NONE ", then optimal secondary classification is " NONE ".If v is not " NONE ",
Then it is determined that most preferably comprise grade 1 and comprise grade 1 score accordingly, wherein comprise grade 1
It is not equal to v.Up or for all grades of grade d, comprising grade n and be not equal to the constraint of v
Under the constraint of condition, repeat this process.Select most preferably to comprise the S&S class that grade q classification has
Other cluster scores > maximum (the deepest) value of q of=t.If w (optimal secondary classification) is
The good grade q classification that comprises, or meet threshold value without classification and so set w as " NONE ".
