- This disclosure relates generally to systems, apparatus, and methods for processing electronic document programs and applications, and more particularly to systems, apparatus, and methods for inserting a media file into an electronic document.
- Electronic documents and programs for viewing and creating electronic documents are widely-used in a variety of computing environments. For example, a spreadsheet application can be accessed by a user via a network according to a cloud computing model or from a computer local to the user (e.g. desktop computer). A spreadsheet application is a type of software that allows access to a spreadsheet in which data is arranged in table form, i.e. as rows and columns. In a typical use of a spreadsheet, data and mathematical formulas are entered in ledger-like forms for analysis, tracking, planning, or evaluations of the impacts of real or proposed changes on data.
- To facilitate formulaic use of electronic documents, spreadsheet applications and similar programs may include built-in functions that perform standard calculations based on parameters input by a user (e.g. computing a sum or average of a set of numbers.) Built-in functions allow a user to input a series of parameters, which are evaluated by the program to produce a particular output. Typical examples include mathematical functions that produce numbers or text manipulation functions that generate strings of characters.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a method of presenting a media file in an electronic document is provided. A formula comprising at least one parameter is received. The formula is evaluated based on the at least one parameter in the formula in order to identify the media file. The media file is accessed, and data adapted to cause the media file to be displayed in the electronic document is generated. The at least one parameter may comprise a reference to a storage location.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a method of presenting a media file in an electronic document is provided. A formula comprising at least one parameter is received. The at least one parameter may comprise a search string. The formula is evaluated to generate a query that is transmitted to a search engine. In response to the query transmitted to the search engine, one or more search results are received. The search results are operable to identify one or more media files. The at least one parameter may include a parameter that identifies a media file. The media file is accessed, and data adapted to cause the media file to be displayed in the electronic document is generated.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a media file may be presented in an electronic document, and there may be a search engine query that may include one or more parameters that identify a plurality of media files to be searched by the search engine. In an embodiment, the step of evaluating the formula further includes identifying a plurality of media files. In an embodiment, the method may include receiving a selection of one of the plurality of media files as the media file to be inserted. In an embodiment, the at least one parameter can include an identification of a search engine and a selection parameter.
- In an embodiment, the formula may be evaluated to identify a web page. The page may include a plurality of links, each link identifying a media file and a parameter identifying one of the plurality of links. The electronic document containing the media file may be presented.
- In an embodiment, generating data adapted to cause the media file to be embedded in the electronic document may include identifying a clip of the media file to be embedded in the electronic document. Examples of clips include a portion of an image, one or more scenes from a video presentation, one or more sections of an audio presentation or similar processed portions of a media file. For example, a clip of an image may include a portion, e.g. the upper left-hand quadrant, or a circle of a given radius centered at a particular position in the image. Alternatively a clip of an audio file may include the portion of the audio file that starts at a certain point in the playing of the file (e.g. one minute after the start of the audio file) and lasts for a certain duration (e.g. ninety seconds). In a media file that presents its contents in a temporally ordered fashion (e.g. an audio presentation or a video presentation) the clip may be specified by specifying the media file, specifying an offset from the beginning of the media file and specifying the duration of the clip.
- In an embodiment generating data adapted to cause the media file to be embedded in the electronic document may include identifying a clip of the media file based on the at least one parameter. In an embodiment generating data adapted to cause the media file to be embedded in the electronic document may include retrieving the media file from a location, extracting a clip from the media file, and storing the clip in memory. In an embodiment, an electronic document may be configured to present a clip when the electronic document is accessed. In an embodiment, an electronic document may present a user interface input feature such as a button or a mouse-over sensor that when activated will cause an embedded clip to be presented or played.
- In accordance with another embodiment, an apparatus is provided. The apparatus comprises means for providing simultaneous access to an electronic document, and means for receiving a formula from a user. The apparatus further comprises means for evaluating the formula received from the user to identify the media file. The apparatus further comprises means for presenting a media file that has been inserted into an electronic document.

For example, a spreadsheet data set that a user creates or edits may be displayed ondisplay 270. -
FIG. 3 shows functional components ofonline spreadsheet manager 130 in accordance with an embodiment.Online spreadsheet manager 130 comprises aspreadsheet process 310 and aspreadsheet data repository 325.Spreadsheet process 310 manages spreadsheet data and performs operations requested by users, such as mathematical operations, graphing, filtering, etc. One or more spreadsheet data sets created by users are stored inspreadsheet data repository 325. A spreadsheet data set created by a user may be stored in association with his or her user account, for example. Multiple versions of a user's spreadsheet data set may be stored inspreadsheet data repository 325. - In accordance with the embodiment of
FIG. 1 , a user may accessonline spreadsheet manager 130 and create and/or edit a spreadsheet data set. For example, a user may employbrowser 210 to access a World Wide Web site maintained byonline spreadsheet manager 130. In a well-known manner, the user may be required to log into a user account to access his or her documents. The user may be required to authenticate his or her identity, e.g., by entering a user name and password, before accessing his or her user account and spreadsheet data associated with the account. - Suppose, for example, that a user employs
browser 210 to accessonline spreadsheet manager 130 and creates a new spreadsheet data set, such asspreadsheet data set 400 illustrated inFIG. 4 .Online spreadsheet manager 130 storesspreadsheet data set 400, or a representation thereof, inspreadsheet data repository 325, as shown inFIG. 3 . - To enable the user to view and edit
spreadsheet data set 400,online spreadsheet manager 130 transmits data causinguser device 160 to display a representation of all or a portion of thespreadsheet data set 400 on a Web page, in a well-known manner. For example,online spreadsheet manager 130 may transmit to browser 210 a request, in the form of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), adapted to causebrowser 210 to display a representation ofspreadsheet data set 400. In response,browser 210 displays a representation of all or a portion ofspreadsheet data set 400 in awindow 407, as shown inFIG. 4 . In a conventional manner,browser 210 displaysspreadsheet data set 400 as a plurality of cells, such ascells Browser 210 also displays atoolbar 415 which may display various available options and/or functions available to the user, such as afile function 417. When the user edits and savesspreadsheet data set 400, the edited data set is stored inspreadsheet data repository 325.Browser 210 may also display aformula bar 416 into which a user may enter information for transmission to thespreadsheet manager 130. - By way of example, suppose that a user wishes to utilize a spreadsheet to record how many points various users have accumulated in a particular game. Accordingly, the user accesses
online spreadsheet manager 130 and inserts information into aspreadsheet data set 400, illustrated inFIG. 4 . - Referring to
FIG. 4 , suppose that a user enters, in rows 421-428, information identifying various users (Users 1-8), and a score associated with each respective user. For example,cell 421 which is located at the intersection of column “A” and row “1” and can be referred to as cell (A,1) identifies “User 1” andcell 431 indicates that “User1” has accumulated 12 points;cell 422 identifies “User 2” andcell 432 indicates that “User2” has accumulated 16 points, etc. Referring again toFIG. 3 ,online spreadsheet manager 130 stores the information inspreadsheet data set 400 inspreadsheet data repository 325. - When a document, such as a
spreadsheet data set 400 is created and stored,online spreadsheet manager 130 may accept spreadsheet data that is transmitted via anetwork 105 from auser device 160 for insertion into a cell (e.g. cell 421) ofspreadsheet data set 400. In particular, a user may also transmit a formula toonline spreadsheet manager 130 by entering information intoformula bar 416 on auser device 160.Formula bar 416 accepts inputs that are processed byspreadsheet process 310 and can be used to generate input to cells of the spreadsheet. - For example, in an embodiment, a formula input to
formula bar 416 may specify that a number in a first cell be added to a number in a second cell. One means of specifying a particular cell in a formula is to identify the cell by referring to a row and column. For example, if a user wishes to specify acell 444 located at the intersection of column “D” 433 and row “2” 457, he may refer to that location as, cell (D,2). For example, a user may input into the formula bar 416 a formula that specifies that the cell (D,2) is equal to the sum of the numbers in cells (B,1) and (B, 2), by entering “(D,2)=SUM((B,1)+(B,2))” informula bar 416. - Supposing that a user enters such a formula in the
formula bar 416,spreadsheet process 310 evaluates the formula and places the result into the specified cell. In the illustrative embodiment ofFIG. 4 ,spreadsheet process 310 inserts thesum 28 intocell 444, in accordance with the formula. In an embodiment,spreadsheet process 310 can accept formulae entered intoformula bar 416 that include various operators. Operators may include, for example mathematical operators such as SUMO, text manipulation operators such as CONCATENATE, or operators that specify a location from which the object of the formula can be read, such as a formula that specifies reading a value from one spreadsheet or a formula that specifies a value to be read from a network location. -
Spreadsheet data set 400 may receive inputs into cells or intoformula bar 416 in various forms including numbers, text, and information related to media files such as images, video or sound files. The inputs to the cells may be entered into a cell directly by a user accessing a spreadsheet from auser device 160, or via a formula entered intoformula bar 416. - In accordance with an embodiment, a user may use a formula to insert a media file, such as an image, into a cell of
spreadsheet 400. For example a media file insertion application may be invoked by a formula that may include a set of parameters. The set of parameters can be referred to as a “signature” of the formula. A signature may contain two parameters, the first of which specifies a media file location and the second of which specifies a scaling function to be performed on the media file as part of the presentation in the program. The number and type of parameters may be used to determine how the formula identifies the media file for inserting and displaying in the electronic document. For example, a formula including a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and a parameter may be entered intoformula bar 416, such as =FORMULA_INSERT(“URL”, scaleparameter). In this example, the URL refers to a location of a media file and the second parameter is recognized by the function FORMULA_INSERT( ) as defining an operation to be performed on that media file as part of its presentation in the cell associated with the FORMULA_INSERT( ) call. - Depending on the type of media file invoked by
spreadsheet manager 130, various presentation parameters may be used. For a media file that comprises audio, presentation parameters may include, for example, volume, playback speed, playback position, or other parameters appropriate for providing audio. For a media file that comprises an image, the presentation parameter may include, for example, the size of the image, the aspect ratio, color presentation, blinking or other presentation parameters. For a media file that comprises video, presentation parameters may include playback size, volume, playback speed, playback position, or other parameters appropriate for presenting video. - In some embodiments the presentation parameters may include, parameters that indicate where in a document a media file be presented. For example, for electronic files containing media files that are presented on a display, parameters may specify the position of the media file within the electronic document, the shading, the size, or other parameters that can specify the presentation of the electronic document containing the media file.
- For example, a possible set of scale parameters that may be used to determine the presentation of a media file in a spreadsheet may be the numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. These numbers may be used to each correspond to a particular presentation feature. In one example: “1” scales the media file to fit the cell, “2” stretches the media file to fit the cell, “3” inserts the media file into the cell in its original size, without changing the size of the cell, and “4” allows the user to specify a custom media file size. It should be noted that a scaleparameter of 4 may require the user to insert additional parameters being input into the function such as a media file height and a media file width. Alternative identifiers for various scale parameters may be used.
- In some embodiments presentation parameters may be used to determine the format of the media file presented in an electronic document. Presentation parameters that may be used to determine the formatting of an electronic document include parameters that define various aspects of the presentation of a media file. In some embodiments in which a visible media file is presented, the presentation parameters may include, for example: size, shape, cropping, scale, hue, tone, opacity, transparency, color balance gamma, grey scale, stretch/scale, flip/rotate, or other parameters. In some embodiments in which an audible media file is presented, the presentation parameters may include, for example: pitch, tempo, speed, volume, key or other presentation parameters. In some embodiments in which a video media file is presented, the presentation parameters may include, for example: duration, speed, start time, end time, skip segments, or other parameters.
- Suppose, in an exemplary embodiment, that the user wishes to insert an image into cell (C, 5) in
spreadsheet data set 400. Accordingly, the user inputs “(C, 5)” and a formula “FORMULA-1” intoformula bar 416, as shown inFIG. 4 . Suppose further that FORMULA-1 is associated with a particular media file 585 stored inspreadsheet data repository 325, as shown inFIG. 3 . In the illustrative embodiment, FORMULA-1 may include an address, such as a URL, associated withmedia file 585. Other types of parameters, and other information that may be included with a parameter, are discussed below.User device 160 transmits FORMULA-1 tospreadsheet manager 130. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a method of inserting a media file into an electronic document in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 501, a formula comprising at least one parameter is received. In the exemplary embodiment,spreadsheet process 310 receives FORMULA-1 fromuser device 160. - At
step 502, the formula is evaluated based on the at least one parameter and the media file is identified. Thus,spreadsheet process 310 evaluates FORMULA-1 and identifies media file 585 based on the URL within FORMULA-1. For example,spreadsheet process 130 may examine the URL within FORMULA-1 and determine that it represents a storage location associated with themedia file 585. In some embodiments, the media file may be an audio file. In some embodiments, the media file may be an image file. In some embodiments, the media file may be a video file. In accordance with some embodiments described below, a media file may be identified via an invocation of a search function. - At
step 503, the media file is accessed. Thus,spreadsheet process 310 accesses media file 585 based on the URL within FORMULA-1, and retrievesmedia file 585. For example,spreadsheet process 310 may access the media file from storage, such asspreadsheet data repository 325, or from a remote location via anetwork 105. - In some embodiments, a search is initiated as a result of the evaluation of the formula. For example,
spreadsheet process 310 may perform a search and, as a result, access information overnetwork 105 to identify the media file. The search may include search parameters that can be used to identify one or more media files that suitable for presentation according to the received formula. The media file may be identified from a set of one or more files that have been returned as a result of the received formula. For example, the formula may include parameters that specify a search engine and a search string. The formula may also include parameters that can be used to determine which media file among those returned as a result of the search should be presented. For example the parameter or parameters may identify the third media file in the set of media files returned as the media file to be presented. - At
step 504, the media file is inserted into the electronic document. In some embodiments, data representing the media file is inserted into the electronic document so that the media file and the electronic document are combined and the combined file is stored as a single file. In some embodiments a link or pointer to the media file is inserted into the electronic document so that the media file can be accessed when the electronic document is accessed. In some embodiments, the media file will be accessed and appear in the context of the electronic document in order to give the impression to the user that the media file and the electronic document are merged together. In an illustrative embodiment, an image associated withmedia file 585 is displayed incell 495 located at location (C, 5), as shown inFIG. 4 . - At
step 505, data adapted to cause the media file to be displayed is generated. The data adapted to cause the media file to be generated may include presentation parameters that are evaluated in order to determine the manner in which the media file is displayed when the electronic document is accessed. For example, supposing that the media file is an image, the presentation parameters may determine the position in the electronic document at which the image is displayed. In the exemplary embodiment,image 450 is inserted intocell 495, as shown inFIG. 4 . - In accordance with some embodiments, the presentation parameters may determine the orientation of an image within the electronic document or some other aspect of the presentation of the electronic document.
- As discussed above, once the media file is accessed, and inserted, the presentation parameters for the media file are determined, and the media file is presented. One skilled in the art will understand that media files may be presented in various ways. For example, according to some embodiments, a media file may be presented via an application that is invoked from the electronic document in which the media file has been inserted.
- In some embodiments, the media file to be inserted in the electronic document may be identified through a process that initiates a search by invoking a search engine. For example,
spreadsheet process 310 may generate a search request and transmit the request to a selected search engine. The initiation of the search through the invocation of the search engine may include parameters that can be used to form the query string that is passed to the search engine. The invocation of the search engine can specify a collection of images to be searched. For example a search may be made of a photo-sharing site or a search may be made of all the sites that are contained in an index maintained by the search engine or of some other set of searchable locations. In some embodiments the initiation of the search may be made over a local disk. The search engine may be invoked using a formula using a variety of parameter signatures. The parameter signatures may include various parameters including search terms, search operators, other search parameters such as those that define a type of search or a set of documents to be searched, or a combination of several parameters. The search engine can be invoked from an input interface for the program through which the electronic document is viewed. - In some embodiments, the media file to be identified for insertion in the electronic document may be selected from a plurality of files that are returned from a search engine that has been invoked by a formula. For example, a user may input a string such as
-
- =FORMULA_IMAGE_INSERT_SEARCH(“cute puppy”, “MyPhotoAlbum”)
- In this example the search may be identified by a selection of an image from a plurality of images that are identified by the string “MyPhotoAlbum” and the search may include the query string, “cute puppy”.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a search for a media file to be inserted may return a plurality of media files that meet the criterion identified in the formula. A user may be prompted to select the media file to be inserted in the electronic document from the returned media files. Alternatively, the formula may include a parameter that identifies a particular one or more of the returned media files for insertion in the electronic document.
- In an embodiment, a set of media files to be searched may be protected so that the files can only be accessed after authentication such as supplying credentials, for example a username-password combination. A user who is not authenticated cannot access the set of media files, and may receive a response indicating that the formula was unable to perform the search.
- In an embodiment, the FORMULA_INSERT( ) function may accept a parameter signature that defines a location and a parameter that is used by the FORMULA_INSERT( ) function in selecting a specific media file from that location. For example, the location could be the front page of a news web site and the parameter would be used by the function to return the largest media file appearing on the news web site at the time that the function is invoked. Another guidance parameter may define the fifth media file down the page or the media file in the upper right-hand corner of the web page. Another parameter might be used to identify the FORMULA_INSERT( ) function to return the most important media file on a web page or in a corpus. For example the importance of the media file can be determined by a default setting for the function or customized according to a user's input.
- In some embodiments in which the media file is inserted into the electronic document, an API is accessed so that the media file from a program that manipulates files of the type in which the media file is inserted. For example, if the media file is an image and the electronic document is an encoded document, the media file may be inserted into the electronic document through the functionality provided by an API. In some embodiments, where the step of inserting the media file into the electronic document is performed by inserting a link into the electronic document, a link may be entered in the electronic document. For example, in an example where the electronic document is a plain text document such as an XML document, a string corresponding to a link to the media file may be inserted in the electronic document.
- In an embodiment, a formula can be invoked with parameters that specify that the media file may be of various types. For example, the media file may be a video file, or another media file rather than a media file. Different types of media file may have associated parameters that can change the presentation of that type of media file.
- In an embodiment, a video file may be inserted into a position in an electronic document associated with location (C, 5) by using an invocation of a function such as the following:
-
- (C, 5) =FORMULA_INSERT(video, “URL to video”,
- Audio_or_video_only, loop_after playing, play_speed, play_begin,
- play_end, video_height, video_width, play_on_load or play_on_hover).
- In this example there are several parameters that may be accepted by the FORMULA_INSERT( ) function and used to determine the manner in which the video is presented in the electronic document. Examples of some of the parameters that might be included as part of controlling the presentation of the video include:
-
- URL to video—Inserts a video located at a particular URL into the electronic document.
- Audio only—Inserts a media file comprising a video but only provides the video without the accompanying audio from that media file.
- Video_only—Inserts a media file comprising a video but only provides the audio without the accompanying video from that media file.
- Loop_after playing—Inserts a media file and loops the file after it finishes playing.
- Play_speed—Inserts a media file and presents the file at a specific play speed.
- Play_begin—Inserts a media file and presents the file starting at a specific point within the file.
- Play_end—Inserts a media file and presents the file up until a specific point in the media file.
- Video_presentation parameters—Inserts a media file and presents it with a specified width, height, aspect ratio or other formatting parameter.
- Play_on_load—Inserts a media file and begins to play it as soon as the electronic document into which the file is inserted is loaded into memory.
- Play_on_hover—Inserts a media file and begins to play it as soon as the interface detects that the user is hovering over the media file with his pointing device.
- The FORMULA_INSERT( ) functions may be called with other parameters or with combinations of these and other parameters in order to optimize response for a particular application.
- In some embodiments, the formula may refer to multiple cells. For examples,
spreadsheet process 310 may evaluate a formula and identify media files to be inserted into a plurality of cells. In some embodiments, a different media file may be identified for each of a plurality of cells based on the formula. Therefore, in some embodiments, thespreadsheet process 310 evaluates the formula to determine different parameters to use in presenting media files in each of a plurality of cells. - In various embodiments, the method steps described herein, including the method steps described in
