Embodiment
Fig. 1 is schematically illustrating of system 100, and user's calibration history record is used for improving search for the active user in this system.It is to by the change of value to the sign of instance properties that the user proofreaies and correct.But instance is indivedual identified entities.Attribute is character, characteristic or the characteristic of instance.For example, Tom (Tom), Di Ke (Dick) and Harry (Harry) are individual instances.Each this type of people has such as attributes such as name, height, body weight.As another example, the city instance has geographic position, the mayor and population separately.As another example, product example can have model name, fabricator and time.The attribute of instance can be characterized by value.The value of the particular community of particular instance characterizes this particular instance.For example, individual name can have value " Tom ", and urban population can have value " 400 ten thousand ", and the product type title can have value " shepherd (Wrangler) ".
It also can be to attempt more revaluate to the sign of instance properties that the user proofreaies and correct.The user proofreaies and correct and is undertaken by human user.User's correction is usually designed to from the user's who proofreaies and correct angle and proofreaies and correct or the improvement value.The user proofread and correct can be for example through the deletion value, through editing value, through refinement value, through calibrated value being replaced with corrected value not, or coming more revaluate through the combination of these and other change.Attempting change can comprise the sign of instance properties and utilize the followed the tracks of user affirmation of electronic document (for example, on the Internet available electronic document) to value.Therefore user's correction entries can comprise calibrated value, corrected value and in the note of whether confirming or multinomial not.Comprise that record that a plurality of users to one or more value proofread and correct can reflect the group wisdom and the work of a plurality of human users.The inventor has realized that this type of record can be used for improving the serviceability of search system for subsequent user.
System 100 comprises search engine 105, user's calibration history 110 and client 115.The active user can be mutual with client 115, with the following search inquiry of typing, the response of this search inquiry is comprised the property value of instance.For example, search inquiry can be inquired the instance properties value.The electronic document that search engine 105 can document compiles through for example searching for (information repository that characterizes such as the Internet, to electronic document or through data base management system (DBMS) (DBMS) tissue and the structured database of checking) comes search inquiry is made response.Search engine 105 can operate with inside or external module, for example to come this rank as a result according to the degree of correlation of result in the result set and search inquiry.Search engine 105 can be implemented on one or more computing machine of following set of machine-readable instructions programming with one or more of disposing in one or more geographic position, and this set of machine-readable instructions is used for searching in response to the request that comes from a plurality of client devices.
In some situation, or many-valued result set in response to search inquiry can searched for and return to search engine 105.That kind as described further below, the content of result set, the result in result set are arranged or the two can reflect correction that the user had before carried out and record in user's calibration history 110.
The following information of user's calibration history 110 storages, the correction that had before carried out at this information table requisition family.In some are realized, can be from receiving correction in the background of search with the mutual user of client.For example, that kind as described further below, the user can present (structuring shown in Fig. 3-Fig. 5 appears) alternately with the structuring that shows in client 115.
User's calibration history 110 can be stored on one or more data storage device of disposing in one or more geographic position.Information in user's calibration history 110 is by search engine 105 or directly addressable by one or more following intermediate module, and this intermediate module can provide following information to search engine 105, the information content of this information table requisition family calibration history 110.
Client 115 is to be used for the equipment of user interactions and can be implemented on the computing machine with the machine readable instructions programming.Client 115 can comprise one or more input-output apparatus (such as the display screen 120 that is used for to active user's display message).For example, client 115 can show on display screen 120 and presents 125.
Present 125 and show that (for example, " attribute _ X of instance _ Y is instance properties: value _ Z by value 130 signs.”)。Hereinafter is more specifically described other that show that instance properties characterizes by value 130 and is presented (being that structuring appears).
Generally speaking, will during search procedure, show below and appear, this appears and shows that instance properties is characterized by value.For example, currently just can use input equipment (such as mouse or keyboard) to come typing inquiry with client 115 mutual users.Response to search inquiry can comprise the property value that is used for instance.In some were realized, search inquiry can identify the attribute that will be characterized of instance and this instance.For example, search inquiry can be an instance: attribute pairing (for example " France: capital " perhaps " mayor: Birmingham (Birmingham) ").As another example, can form search inquiry, thereby make the identifier of in following language mode, finding instance and attribute, this language mode shows the value that need characterize instance properties.The example of this quasi-mode comprises " what < attribute>of < instance>be ", " whom < attribute>of < instance>be " etc.
As another example, the user can be through with to be shown in structuring on the display screen 120 mutual or quote this structuring and present to come the typing search inquiry.For example, that kind as described further below, the user can click the unit or artificial of structuring in appearing and formulate following inquiry, and the unit during this inquiry reference structureization appears is as attribute and instance (for example, " unit _ 1: unit _ 2 ").
In some were realized, search inquiry need not to identify the attribute that will be characterized of instance and this instance.On the contrary, search inquiry can be for example in following background only identity property or instance, this background shows one or more attribute that characterizes one or more instance.For example, can obtain inquiry " mayor ", the value of the attribute " mayor " of this inquiry request mark city instance as inquiry as follows.As another example, can obtain inquiry " in the world be rich in most woman " as inquiry as follows, the value of the attribute " name " of this inquiry request mark " in the world be rich in most woman " instance.
In response to receiving search inquiry, client 115 in message 135 to the expression or the search inquiry itself of search engine 105 transmission search inquiries.Can pass through data communication network message transfer 135.Search engine 105 can receive message 135 and use the content of message 135 to be defined for the parameter of search.For example, the content of message 135 can be used for limiting the term that the indexation that is used for searching for electronic document compiles, to limit inquiry according to the DBMS query language, and the perhaps combination of these and alternate manner.
Search engine 105 is searched for according to the parameter that is used to search for that the content message 135 limits.Search can produce the result set in response to one or more value of the search inquiry of in message 135, describing.The content of result set, the result in result set arrange or this two can reflect correction that the user had before carried out and record in user's calibration history 110.For example, the user of record proofreaies and correct in the database or other data volume that can be incorporated into by search engine 105 search in historical 110.Therefore the user proofreaies and correct can itself be the source of the value that comprises in the result set.As another example, can to the value rank in the result set time, use the user of record in historical 110 to proofread and correct.
Value in the value result set is to be used for candidate that one or more attribute to one or more instance characterizes and in response to search inquiry.The content of the value in the value result set can reflect that with arranging particular value correctly characterizes one or more change of the degree of confidence of instance properties.For example, when the user proofreaies and correct when being the source of the value that in result set, comprises, this value can be contained in the rational degree of confidence that becomes in the result set from having low confidence and therefore from result set, being excluded to become to have to be high enough to make.As another example, the rank of the value in result set can reflect the degree of confidence of individual values.The value that especially, more possibly correctly characterize instance properties is higher than rank usually more can not the correct value that characterizes instance properties.
Search engine 105 transmits the expression to the result set of reflection user correction to client 115 in message 140.Can be for example through the data communication network message transfer 140 identical with message transfer 135.Client 115 can receive message 140 and use the content of message 140 on display screen 120, to show and present 125.The value 130 that presents the reflection user correction of finding in the 125 usefulness value result sets characterizes instance properties.In some are realized, appear 125 can as shown in use text to show that instance properties is by value 130 signs.In some are realized, appear 125 can use attribute and the identifier of instance arrange and show that the identity property that identifies instance is by value 130 signs.For example; That kind as described further below; Presenting 125 can be that following structuring appears, and that this structuring is presented on is organized, show the value and the identifier of instance properties in the layout of system, thereby makes that be tangible to the sign of instance properties to the user by value.In some were realized, system (such as system 100) can be used for replenish user calibration history 110.
Fig. 2 is the schematically illustrating of replenish user calibration history 110 in system 100.As shown in, proofread and correct tracker 205 and be coupled to client 115.Proofreading and correct tracker 205 is like lower component, and these parts are used to follow the tracks of at client 115 places the correction of being undertaken by the user to the sign of instance properties.For example, proofreading and correct tracker 205 can be implemented on one or more computing machine that one or more set of machine-readable instructions of usefulness of one or more geographic position deployment is programmed.Proofreading and correct tracker 205 can for example be implemented in the client-side script in the client 115, and perhaps it can be implemented in the search engine 105, the element of perhaps proofreading and correct tracker 205 can be implemented on this two in.
Shown in realize, the user at client 115 places calibrated present 125.Especially, the user has deleted not corrected value 130 and it has been replaced with calibrated value 205.
Proofread and correct tracker 205 and can come tracking correction to the expression of the change undertaken by the user through record.Proofread and correct the data that tracker 205 also can be proofreaied and correct to search engine 105 direct perhaps indirect communication representative of consumer in message 210, to be used for being stored in user's calibration history 110.Message 210 can be the data encapsulation of XML document or other form.The content of message 210 can be used for creating the new record 215 that the user proofreaies and correct.New record 215 replenishes user's calibration history record at user's calibration history 110 places.
Fig. 3-Fig. 5 is the example that the structuring that instance properties is related with value appears.Fig. 3 is that the sample table structuring presents 300 schematically illustrate.Table 300 is layouts of organized, system of value of particular community of one or more identifier and those instances of instance.In some were realized, structuring presented (such as table 300) and also can comprise the identifier of attribute and the identifier of the unit of expression values therein.
Information block in can option table 300, cut apart and arrange to help the user to understand information.In this regard, table 300 comprises compiling of row 302.Every row 302 comprises compiling of Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 and relating attribute value 307.Therefore property value 307 and the layout and the location of Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 of being expert in 302 show the association between them with graphics mode.For example, the user can recognize related between property value 307 and the Provisioning Instance Identifier of in same lines 302, finding 306.
Table 300 also comprises compiling of row 304.Every row 304 comprise compiling of attribute-identifier 308 and relating attribute value 307.Therefore property value 307 in the row 304 and attribute-identifier 308 layout and location show the association between them with graphics mode.For example, the user can recognize the association between them based on property value 307 and the attribute-identifier's 308 who in same column 304, finds aligning.
Every row 302 is structured record 310, because the compiling of the related single Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 of every row 302 and relating attribute value 307.In addition, be used in a structured record 310 these related layouts of expression and be positioned at that (that is, in other row 302) reproduces in other structured record 310.In fact, in many cases, present all structured record 310 in 106 in structuring and be limited to and have that identical information is arranged and the location.For example, the value 307 of attribute " ATTR_2 " is limited in all row 302 and comes across in the same column 304.As another example, the same space relation of the value 307 in the same column 304 is all carried and come across to attribute-identifier 308.In addition, the layout of the information in the structured record 310 and the change of location are propagated to other structured record 310 that structuring appears in 106 usually.For example; If add the new property value 307 that new attribute (for example " ATTR_
In some are realized, can present the value 307 in the table 300 by some measuring unit.The example of measuring unit comprise foot, sign indicating number, inch, mile, second, gallon, rise, degree centigrade etc.In some instances, the measuring unit that wherein is present worth 307 is shown by unit identifier 309.Unit identifier 309 can come across and for example be worth 307 next doors and/or association attributes identifier 308 next doors.Come related between the person of the checking unit of being illustrated in identifier 309 and the value 307 that measuring unit is shown through this type of location.In many cases, be limited to according to identical measuring unit with all values 307 (for example, all values 307 in single row 304) of single Attribute Association and appear.
Value in value result set (such as the value result set of in message 140 (Fig. 1), describing) can be used for appearing according to multitude of different ways ST Stuffing Table 300 or other structuring.For example, can present automatically (promptly unmanned for intervene ground) to structuring and fill compiling of the value that extracts from a plurality of following search result sets, each search result set is in response to the inquiry to instance properties.For example, the most probable individual values that correctly characterizes instance properties can be given tacit consent to and is shown in during structuring appears.The user can be through for example appearing mutual with structuring or reference structureization appears and changes or attempt to change those values.Other value conduct that can be in the present worth result set is used to replace the candidate of following value, and search engine has confirmed that this value most probable correctly characterizes instance properties.
Fig. 4 is that structuring presents the schematically illustrating of another realization of (being that structuring presents table 400).Except comprise tissue embark on journey 302 with the attribute-identifier 308 of row 304, Provisioning Instance Identifier 306, value 307, unit identifier 309, table 400 also comprises a plurality of interactive elements that are used for user interactions.Especially, table 400 comprises that instance selects compiling and remarks row 420 of little 415 of the compiling of the compiling of little (widget) 405, action-trigger 410, row action triggers.
It is following user interface component that instance is selected little 405, and this user interface component allows the structured record 310 in user's option table 400.For example, it can be that one or more can click compiling of check box as follows that instance is selected little 405, and this check box is associated with this structured record 310 by layout and the location with respect to particular structured record 310.Instance is selected little 405 " can click "; Because the user (for example can use mouse; Hover in parts tops and click the particular mouse button), stylus (for example, pushing the user interface component that shows on the touch screen), keyboard or other input equipments of being used to call the function that provides by these parts with stylus come with little 405 mutual.
Action-trigger 410 is following user interface component, and this user interface component allows the user to trigger the execution of the action of little 405 one or more structured record 310 selected of use-case selection in the his-and-hers watches 400.For example, action-trigger 410 can be can click text phrases as follows, and each text unit can be used for triggering the action of in this phrase, describing by the user.For example, " keep and remove other " action-trigger 410 triggers and from the demonstration of table 400, removes not use-case and select little 405 structured record of selecting 310.As another example, " remove and select " action-trigger 410 triggers and from the demonstration of table 400, removes little 405 structured record of selecting 310 of use-case selection.As another example, " illustrating on the map " action-trigger 410 triggers the position that on geographical map, shows little 405 structured record of selecting 310 of use-case selection.For example, if selected instance is a car, then can on map, show the car dealer's who sells selected car position.As another example, if selected instance is the destination of spending a holiday, then these destinations can be shown on the map.
Little 415 of row action triggers is following user interface component, and this user interface component allows user all unit in single row 304 to apply action.When the user with can click '+' symbol when mutual, show another following user interface component, this user interface component is given the set that possibly move to be carried out to the user.Action in this set can comprise that for example presenting the whole row 304 of 400 removals from structuring perhaps is worth with discovery for all unit searches of the current blank the row 304.
Remarks row 420 are following user interface component, and this user interface component allows the user to carry out related with Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 information.Especially, remarks row 420 comprise one or more following remarks 425, and each remarks 425 is associated with this structured record 310 by layout and the location with respect to structured record 310.The information content of remarks 425 is unrestricted, since different with row 304, and do not require that remarks 425 are values of any particular community.Information in remarks 425 replaces aspect the instance that can be characterized in the structured record 310 sign irrelevant.
In some were realized, table 400 can comprise the additional information except the value of any particular community.For example, table 400 can comprise that like the compiling of hypograph 430 this image comes to be associated with the instance that in this structured record 310, identifies by layout and location with respect to structured record 310.As another example, table 400 can comprise compiling from the text fragments (snippet) 435 that compiles the electronic document extraction 102.The source of fragment can be the high ranking result in the search that use-case identifier 306 carries out as search string.Text fragments 435 comes to be associated with the instance of sign in this structured record 310 by layout and location with respect to structured record 310.
As another example, table 400 can comprise that one or more sensing compiles the hypertext link 440 of the indivedual electronic documents in 102.For example, linked document can be the high ranking result in the search that use-case identifier 306 carries out as search string.As another example, linked document can be the source of the value 307 of extraction for ST Stuffing Table 400.In some instances, the information (for example, station address) that embeds that can be based on alternately in the hypertext link 440 with hypertext link 440 triggers to the source electronic document and navigates.
Fig. 5 is that structuring presents the schematically illustrating of another realization of (that is, card compile 500).It is layouts of organized, system of value of particular community of one or more identifier and those instances of instance that card compiles 500.The attribute of instance can be specified by value.In addition, card compiles 500 and generally includes the identifier of attribute and be included in the wherein identifier of the unit of expression values in due course.
Can selection card compile packets of information in 500, cut apart (segmentation) and arrange to help the user to understand information.In this regard, card compiles 500 and comprises compiling of card 502.Each card 502 comprises compiling of Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 and relating attribute value 307.Therefore the property value 307 in card 502 and the layout of Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 and location show the association between them with graphics mode.For example, the user can recognize related between property value 307 and the Provisioning Instance Identifier of in same card 502, finding 306.
Shown in realize that the card 502 that compiles in 500 at card also comprises compiling of attribute-identifier 308.In row 504 organizational attribution identifier 308 and in row 506 organizational attribution value 307.Row 504,506 are with location adjacent one another are and aim at, thereby make individual attribute identifier 308 be positioned property value 307 next doors that the attribute to this sign characterizes.This location and layout allow the person of checking to recognize related between attribute-identifier 308 and the property value 307 that characterizes those attributes.
Each card 502 is structured record 310, because each blocks compiling of 502 related single Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 and relating attribute value 307.In addition, being used in a card 502 these related layouts of expression and being positioned in other card 502 reproduces.In fact, in many cases, all cards 502 are limited to and have that identical information is arranged and the location.For example, the value 307 of characterization attributes " ATTR_1 " is limited to carrying and same space relation of blocking the Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 in 502 at all.As another example, the attribute-identifier's 308 in all cards 502 order is identical with the location.In addition, the change of information placement in the card 502 and location is propagated to other card 502 that card compiles in 500 usually.For example; In a card 502, be inserted between property value " value _ 1_1 " and " value _ 2_1 " the then same location that changes the corresponding property value 307 in other card 502 if characterize the new property value 307 of new attribute (for example " ATTR_
").
In some were realized, the card 502 that compiles in 500 at card can comprise further feature.For example, card 502 can comprise be used for user interactions select little, action-trigger, attribute to select interactive elements such as little, remarks clauses and subclauses such as instance.As another example, the card 502 that compiles in 500 at card can comprise the additional information except that the value of any particular community, such as the image and/or the text fragments that are associated with the instance that identifies.As another example, the card 502 that compiles in 500 at card can comprise that one or more sensing compiles the hypertext link of the indivedual electronic documents in 102.This category feature can be associated with particular instance by coming across on the following card 502, and this card 502 comprises the Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 that identifies this instance.
During operation, the person of checking can with appear card compile 500 system interaction, to change the demonstration of one or more card 502.For example, much more more the person of checking can trigger two or (side-by-side) arranged side by side demonstration of card 502, thereby makes the particular instance that helps comparison on those cards, to identify.As another example, the person of checking can trigger blocking 502 rearrangement names, finishing the demonstration of particular card 502 etc.As another example, the person of checking can triggering selection, change, interpolation and/or deletion show in card 502 attribute and/or instance.As another example, the person of checking can be categorized into a plurality of heaps with card according to the value of the property value 307 in for example blocking.
In some are realized, card 502 will be shown two " sides ".For example, first side can comprise the diagrammatic representation by the instance of Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 signs, and second side can comprise Provisioning Instance Identifier 306 and value 307.This can be of great use, for example, when the user searches the particular card in compiling of card 500, allows the rough diagrammatic representation of looking back on first side of card 502 of user to identify particular card.
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that is used to utilize the user to proofread and correct and improves the process 600 of search.Process 600 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 600 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 100 (Fig. 1) 105.In some are realized, can trigger (such as the user's request that improves search to using the user to proofread and correct) in response to receiving and come implementation 600.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 700.
The system of implementation 600 can receive the description (step 605) to user's correction of instance properties value.It is that more revaluate is perhaps attempted in change that the user proofreaies and correct.Can submit to the user to proofread and correct to prevent by improper value to the mistake sign of instance properties, to use the correct instance properties that characterizes of appropriate value, perhaps to refine to the sign of instance properties.Therefore example correction to the instance properties value can comprise that for example deletion value, interpolation newly are worth, the change value, perhaps with source document affirmation value.To the example of value change the spelling that comprises corrected value for example, to the accuracy of value interpolation time-constrain, added value etc.
The system of implementation 600 can also change following confidence value, and this confidence value shows that corrected value not correctly characterizes the confidence level (step 610) of instance properties.Corrected value is not the value before being proofreaied and correct by the active user.For example, that kind as described further below, not corrected value can be document compile or the initial ranging of database after the value returned.Initial ranging-and corrected value itself-can reflect other users' correction not.
Degree of confidence is the sign to the possibility that is worth correct sign instance properties.For example, the value that degree of confidence is high is to have confirmed as the value that correctly characterizes instance properties probably.On the other hand, confirmed the unlikely correct instance properties that characterizes of the low value of degree of confidence.
Can correctly characterize the degree of confidence of instance properties with confidence or other parameter embodiment value.That kind as described further below, system can be proofreaied and correct in response to the user to property value who receives and changed or create the degree of confidence parameter.In some were realized, the degree of confidence parameter can be the convergent-divergent grading of the degree of confidence of property value.For example, the degree of confidence parameter can be the correct number percent degree of certainty (for example, " 90% confirms ") that characterizes instance properties of value.In other was realized, the degree of confidence parameter can be following increment (increment) (i.e. " increment "), and this increment can be applied to the convergent-divergent grading to the degree of confidence of property value.For example, the degree of confidence parameter can be the increase of the correct number percent degree of certainty that characterizes instance properties of value or reduce (for example, " 2% is more definite " perhaps " 3% is more uncertain ").
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram that is used to utilize the user to proofread and correct and improves the process 700 of search.Process 700 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 700 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 100 (Fig. 1) 105.In some are realized, can trigger (such as the user's request that improves search to using the user to proofread and correct) in response to receiving and come implementation 700.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 700.
The system of implementation 700 can receive the description (step 605) that the user of instance properties value is proofreaied and correct, and changes the degree of confidence (step 610) that corrected value not correctly characterizes instance properties.
The system of implementation 700 also can change the degree of confidence (step 705) that calibrated value correctly characterizes instance properties.Calibrated value is the value after being proofreaied and correct by the active user.For example, that kind as described further below, calibrated value can be the values of from the version of candidate value tabulation, the not change of corrected value or the brand-new value by user's typing, selecting.Can use degree of confidence parameter (perhaps can be applied to the increment of convergent-divergent grading such as the convergent-divergent grading) to embody the change of degree of confidence.
Fig. 8 is that structuring presents schematically illustrating of (user that in this structuring appears, can receive the instance properties value proofreaies and correct) (being that structuring presents 800).Structuring presents 800 and for example can be used for the user that step 605 in method 600,700 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) receives the instance properties value and proofread and correct.
It can be that any type of structuring appears that structuring presents 800, comprises that any structureization of above-described structuring in appearing appears.For example, structuring appear 800 can as shown in be the tables of data that is shown in the electrical form framework.Structuring presents 800 tables of data and comprises compiling of row 302 and row 304.Every row 302 comprises respective instance identifier 306, and every row 304 comprise respective attributes identifier 308.Be expert at 302 with row 304 in instance properties 306 and attribute-identifier's 308 layout and location relational structureization appear 800 be shown in electrical form framework wherein each unit and instance and attribute.For example, be associated with instance that is designated " tesla's sport car (Tesla Roadster) " and the attribute that is designated " mpg " in the unit 805 that structuring appears in 800.The unit 810 that appears in 1000 in structuring is associated with instance that is designated " Chevrolet (Chevy Volt) " and the instance that is designated " mileage (range) ".The unit 815 that appears in 800 in structuring is associated with instance that is designated " Myers NmG " and the attribute that is designated " top speed (top speed) ".The unit 1020 that appears in 800 in structuring is associated with instance that is designated " Myers NmG " and the attribute that is designated " mpg ".
Association between instance, attribute and unit (such as unit 805,810,815,820) can be used for identifying the attribute of the instance of being proofreaied and correct by the user.For example, the user interactions of reception selected cell 820 can identify attribute instance, that be designated " mpg " that is identified as " Myers NmG ".The user interactions of selected cell can comprise that for example receiving input, user that cursor 825 is positioned on this unit clicks this unit etc.In some are realized, can through in the unit or the visable indicia around the unit (such as circumference height bright 830) position the selection of representing this unit.
Shown in realize that selected unit 820 is included in the not corrected value 835 (" 50mpg ") when selecting.For example, for example can utilize in response to user and unit 820 mutual or in response to user's precedents 820 use-cases: attribute matches the result of the search carried out and comes interstitital textureization to present the unit 820 in 800.Value 835 is corrected values not, shows, is designated value instance, that be designated the attribute of " mpg " of " Myers NmG " because be worth 835 by system.
Fig. 9 has presented 800 schematically illustrate to being worth 835 the user structuring after proofreading and correct having received.As shown in, therefore 820 deleted value 835 from the unit.The user maybe be 820 have deleted value 835 to proofread and correct following content from the unit, and promptly the user characterizes the mistake that this content is regarded as being designated by 835 pairs of values attribute instance, that be designated " mpg " of " Myers NmG ".
Figure 10 is that the structuring after having received corrected value 1005 presents 800 schematically illustrate.As shown in, the customer-furnished value 1005 of the white space that stays through the 820 deletion values 835 from the unit is filled.Therefore correcting structureization presents 800 in unit 820, to comprise value 1005 (i.e. " 75mpg ").The user possibly carry out this deletion and replace to proofread and correct following content; The mistake that to be the user be regarded as being designated by 835 pairs of values attribute instance, that be designated " mpg " of " Myers NmG " with this content characterizes, and to be designated attributes instance, that be designated " mpg " of " Myers NmG " with value 1005 correct signs.
Figure 11 is that structuring presents schematically illustrating of (user that in this structuring appears, can receive the instance properties value proofreaies and correct) (being that structuring presents 1100).Structuring presents 1100 and for example can be used for the user that step 605 in method 600,700 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) receives the instance properties value and proofread and correct.Especially, the user interactions of selection or precedents 820 can be used for triggering and present candidate's window 1105.Candidate's window 1105 presents the calibrated value of following candidate, and the calibrated value of this candidate is considered to be suitable for probably replacing the not corrected value of current sign instance properties.In some were realized, candidate value can be other value in the value result set (such as the value result set of in message 140 (Fig. 1), describing).Therefore, in some were realized, it is own that the character of the calibrated value of candidate and rank can be reflected in user they before proofreading and correct.
Candidate's window 1105 comprises title 1110, select little 1115 compile, the compiling of the compiling of the identifier 1120 of calibrated candidate value, source identifier 1125, fragment 1130 compile and search for interactive elements 1135 compile, select trigger 1140, search trigger device 1145 and cancel trigger 1150 entirely.
Title 1110 can comprise following text or out of Memory, the instance properties that the text or out of Memory sign are characterized by the value that can be corrected.Shown in realize attribute and instance (that is Myers NmG:mpg) that sign is characterized by the value in the unit 820 835.
Select little 1115 to be following interactive display devices, this interactive display device allows the user to select following value, and this value will be used for being characterized in the attribute and the instance of sign in the title 1110.Shown in realize that the user never selects among corrected value 835 and two the calibrated values of candidate being identified by value identifier 1120.
Value identifier 1120 comprises following text or out of Memory, and the text or out of Memory sign are used for being characterized in the attribute of title 110 signs and the calibrated value of candidate of instance.The electronic document that can for example compile (such as the Internet) from electronic document extracts the calibrated value of candidate by value identifier 1120 signs.
Source identifier 1125 comprises following text or out of Memory, the text or out of Memory ident value 835 and come across one of them or a plurality of electronic documents by the calibrated value of candidate of value identifier 1625 sign.In some were realized, source identifier 1125 also can comprise following hyperlink, this hyperlink sensing value 835 and come across one of them perhaps a plurality of electronic document by the calibrated value of candidate that value identifier 1125 identifies.The user can confirm corrected value 835 not with one or more source document of direct usefulness and by the analog value in the calibrated value of value identifier 1120 signs according to this type of hyperlink.
Each fragment 1130 is following text or out of Memory, the text or out of Memory description value 835 and the background of the calibrated value of candidate in electronic document that is identified by value identifier 1120.Fragment 1130 can allow the user indirectly (that is) from candidate's window 1105 confirm not proofread and correct 835 and the calibrated value of candidate that identifies by value identifier 1120 analog value, and linked to source document not.
Search interactive elements 1135 is following hyperlink, and this hyperlink allows the user to come across electronic document navigation wherein to value 835 or by the analog value in the value of value identifier 1125 signs.The user can according to search interactive elements 1135 confirm corrected value 835 not with direct electronic document with link and the calibrated value of candidate that identifies by value identifier 1120 in each value.
Selecting trigger 1140 is following interactive elements, and this interactive elements allows the user to agree that use value is characterized in the attribute and the instance of sign in the title 1110.Especially, corrected value 835 perhaps uses by the arbitrary value in the calibrated value of candidate of value identifier 1120 signs to select trigger 1140 to allow the user to agree to use not.When the user agrees to use the calibrated value of arbitrary candidate, the value 835 in the selected value replacement unit 820.Therefore selected value no longer is the calibrated value of candidate but corrected value.
Search trigger device 1145 is to trigger the interactive elements that the search electronic document compiles.Search trigger device 1145 can allow the user directly from another source (such as the electronic document on the web) confirm corrected value 835 not and by two calibrated values of value identifier 1120 signs.The search that search trigger device 1805 triggers can be " full search " because it be through use the common internet search engine (such as
Www.google.comObtainable GOOGLE
TMSearch engine) makes and be used for carrying out.In some are realized, can present the next inquiry that generates automatically of instance properties that use identifies in title 1110 to search engine.Can use the affirmation of search by recording user to value.
Cancellation trigger 1150 is following interactive elements, and this interactive elements allows the correction of user's cancellation to following value, and this value is characterized in the instance properties of sign in the title 1110.Use cancellation trigger 1150 in the time of for example can identifying error unit on user error ground.
Figure 12 is the process flow diagram that is used to utilize the user to proofread and correct and improves the process 1200 of search.Process 1200 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 1200 can be used users to proofread and correct 110 historical record by the search engine in the system 100 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) 105 to carry out.In some are realized, can trigger (such as the user's request that improves search to using the user to proofread and correct) in response to receiving and come implementation 1200.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 1200.For example, can implementation 1200 as the arbitrary process in the process 600,700 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7).
The system of implementation 1200 can receive the description (step 605) to user's correction of instance properties value.For example, the system of implementation 1200 may be received in and shows that ((Fig. 8-Figure 11)) user of carrying out when mutual proofreaies and correct to present 800,1100 such as structuring.
Classify (step 1205) can also be proofreaied and correct to the user by the system of implementation 1200.Can proofread and correct the user according to the activity that the user carries out when the corrected value and classify.For example, in some are realized, can with the user proofread and correct be categorized into one of different classes of seven shown in the following table 1.
Proofread and correct classification
Classification 1: the user selects the calibrated value of candidate and does not directly confirm with the source from compile.
Classification 2: after the user was directly with source acknowledgement, the user selected the calibrated value of candidate from compile.
Classification 3: the user will be not corrected value replace with calibrated value and the user does not directly use source acknowledgement.
Classification 4: after the user was directly with source acknowledgement, user not corrected value replaced with calibrated value.
Classification 5: after the user was directly with source acknowledgement, the user did not change not corrected value (that is, attempting the change failure).
Classification 6: the user deletes not corrected value and does not replace with calibrated value, and the user does not directly use source acknowledgement.
Classification 7: after the user was directly with source acknowledgement, the user deleted not corrected value and does not replace with calibrated value.
Table 1 that kind described above can be used for the user is proofreaied and correct the activity (comprising any to the search of confirming) of classifying by record during user and demonstration (present 800,1100 such as structuring (Fig. 8-Figure 11)) are mutual.
The system of implementation 1200 can for example proofread and correct through storage user in digital data storage equipment and write down (log) its (step 1210).Can write down that the user proofreaies and correct as the information that the instance properties that is corrected is identified, corrected value and any calibrated value does not compile.Generally speaking, the user proofreaies and correct the sign that daily record also will comprise the correction classification.
Figure 13 is that the user proofreaies and correct schematically illustrating of daily record (tables of data 1300 that promptly comprises user's correction entries 1305,1310,1315,1320,1325).Tables of data 1300 is the data structures by the computer program accesses of on digital data system, operating that are used for that are stored in the digital data storage equipment.Table 1300 comprises compiling of row 1330,1335,1340,1345,1350.Row 1330 comprise the Provisioning Instance Identifier that the instance in the correction of writing down is identified.Row 1335 comprise the attribute-identifier that the instance properties in the correction of writing down is identified.Row 1340 comprise the correction class indication symbol that the classification to the correction of writing down identifies.For example, row 1340 can comprise the corresponding integer of numbering with the correction classification of in table 1, enumerating.Row 1345 comprise the not corrected value identifier that the not corrected value to the correction of writing down identifies.Row 1345 comprise the calibrated value identifier that the calibrated value to the correction of writing down identifies.Under the situation of no calibrated value (for example, proofread and correct classification 5: when user when after the source is directly confirmed, not changing not corrected value), the respective entries in row 1350 then can remain empty or comprise void value (dummy value).
As shown in Figure 12, the system of implementation 1200 can receive, classifies and write down the user times without number and proofread and correct (step 605,1205,1210).For example, system can form user's correction database, proofreaies and correct 110 historical record (Fig. 1) such as the user.
The system of implementation 1200 can receive following search inquiry, the response of this search inquiry is comprised the property value (step 1215) of instance.What for example, the search inquiry of reception can identify instance and this instance will reference structureization present the attribute that characterizes in language mode or owing to appear alternately perhaps with structuring.
Daily record (step 1220) can be proofreaied and correct by calling party by the system of implementation 1200.For example, system can read the user from one or more digital data storage equipment and proofread and correct daily record.System also can confirm in response to the content of the result set of the search inquiry that receives whether with to proofread and correct the correction coupling (step 1225) of the instance properties that writes down in the daily record the user.For example, system can comparative example and instance properties (as the theme of the search inquiry that receives) and user proofread and correct instance and the identifier of attribute in the daily record.Proofread and correct in the background of daily record (such as tables of data 1300 (Figure 13)) the user, system can at first compare content as the instance of search inquiry theme and row 1330, it is relevant to proofread and correct the search inquiry which user in the daily record 1305,1310,1315,1320,1325 proofreaies and correct daily record and reception with identifying user.System then can the comparative example attribute and associated user's content of proofreading and correct the row 1335 in the daily record 1305,1310,1315,1320,1325.
If system confirms the search inquiry that receives and does not proofread and correct coupling with the user to instance properties who writes down that then system can return to receive the additional description that the user is proofreaied and correct in step 605.If the search inquiry that system confirm to receive is proofreaied and correct coupling with the user to instance properties of record, then system can change one of not corrected value and the calibrated value of instance properties or degree of confidence (step 1230) of the two correct sign instance properties.Can use one or more degree of confidence parameter (such as convergent-divergent grading or the increment that can use to the convergent-divergent grading) to embody one or more degree of confidence changes.
Figure 14 is the process flow diagram that is used to utilize the user to proofread and correct and improves the process 1400 of search.Process 1400 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 1400 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 100 (Fig. 1) 105.In some are realized, can trigger (such as the user's request that improves search to using the user to proofread and correct) in response to receiving and come implementation 1400.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 1400.For example, can combine implementation 1400 with the activity of one or more process in the process 600,700,1200 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Figure 12).
The system of implementation 1400 can receive the description (step 605) to user's correction of instance properties value.System can verify that also the user proofreaies and correct (step 1405).In some are realized, the form that this checking can the foundation value and the well-formedness of grammer.For example, can be through capitalization, spelling and the unit (rice, foot, inch etc.) that confirms to proofread and correct the value of affirmation with other source (for example at one or more available on the Internet electronic document).In some were realized, this type of checking can be as preliminary threshold value screening, to determine whether carrying out successor activity-correctly characterize such as the change value degree of confidence of instance properties.For example, the user will proofread and correct the degree of confidence change that need not to cause arbitrary value for value " 139 meters " to the sign of " highly (height) " attribute of instance " Giza Pyramids Egypt Africa (Great Pyramid of Giza) " from value " 455 feet ".In fact, system can discern automatically and confirm that for example foot is changed to units such as liter/100km to rice, mpg.
In some were realized, the checking user proofreaies and correct compiled and they is merged into and gather feedback data and compile.Gather feedback data and compile and to comprise the information that instance properties is described, the candidate value that is used for those instance properties, and compile the descriptor that characterizes what the user proofreaied and correct.As described in hereinafter, this type of user proofreaies and correct to gather and can be used for confirming that the degree of confidence of candidate value proofreaied and correct the degree that increases or reduce by the user.
Figure 15 gathers feedback data to compile schematically illustrating of (that is, gathering feedback data table 1500).Tables of data 1500 is the data structures by the computer program accesses of on digital data system, operating that are used for that are stored in the digital data storage equipment.Tables of data 1500 comprises compiling of the record 1505,1510,1515,1520,1525,1530 that comprises following descriptor separately; One or more user that this descriptor characterizes following value proofreaies and correct, and this value is suitable for characterizing the particular community of particular instance potentially.
Table 1500 comprises compiling of row 1535,1540,1545,1550.Row 1535 comprise following Provisioning Instance Identifier, the instance that this Provisioning Instance Identifier sign descriptor has been gathered.Row 1540 comprise following attribute-identifier, and what this attribute-identifier identified instance proofreaies and correct the attribute that the signaling information of derivation has been gathered according to the user.Row 1545 comprise following value identifier, the value that this value identifier sign descriptor has been gathered.The value of sign is characterized in the instance properties of sign in the row 1535,1540 potentially in row 1545.
Row 1550 comprise that the following user of sign proofreaies and correct the control information catalogue of kind, and these users proofread and correct the value that kind relates to the instance properties of sign in row 1535,1540 and in row 1545, identifies.Shown in realize, the kind that in row 1550, characterizes individual other, proofread and correct classification on the basis of proofreading and correct one by one by the user and in row 1545 value of sign be calibrated value or corrected value does not define (delineate).Shown in realize that type of service classifies to the kind that each individual user proofreaies and correct for the three unit codes of " w#B ", wherein:
-" w " is following identifier, and this identifier shows classifies to user's correction;
-numbering " # " identifies the classification that each individual user proofreaies and correct (here between one and seven, with seven integers that classification is corresponding of description in table 1); And
-value " B " be following value, and the value that this value is identified at sign in the row 1545 is calibrated value or corrected value (here " U " show correction and " C " shows calibrated) not in user's correction.
In other is realized, also can based on such as the user's who proofreaies and correct sign, in the date of carrying out timing, weighting factor, the information such as background of wherein proofreading and correct that the correctness of other correction of being undertaken by the certain user is characterized, gathering feedback data and the user proofreaied and correct in compiling and classify.
As shown in Figure 14, the system of implementation 1400 also can change one of not corrected value and calibrated value or the two correct degree of confidence (step 1230) that characterizes instance properties of instance properties.The user is proofreaied and correct in the realization of indivedual classification in compiling gathering feedback data, can change degree of confidence through weighting specifying calibration kind.For example, can use weighting parameters to come weighting specifying calibration kind in weighting parameters data sink centralized collection.
Figure 16 is that the weighting parameters data are compiled schematically illustrating of (that is, the weighting parameters tables of data 1600).Tables of data 1600 is the data structures by the computer program accesses of on digital data system, operating that are used for that are stored in the digital data storage equipment.Tables of data 1600 comprises and comprises compiling of following recording of information 1605,1610,1615,1620,1625,1630,1635,1640 separately that this information characterizes the certain user and proofreaies and correct the weights of kind.
Table 1600 comprises compiling of row 1645,1650.Row 1645 comprise that characterizing the user proofreaies and correct the correction kind class identifier of kind.For example, proofread and correct kind of class identifier can according to gather feedback data compile in (in the row 1550 that gathering feedback data table 1500 (Figure 15)) characterize the user and proofread and correct the identical mode identifying user of kind and proofread and correct kind.
Row 1650 comprise following weighting parameters, and this weighting parameters embodies the value of proofreading and correct the degree of confidence change that is associated with the user of corresponding kind.For example; Shown in realize that the weights 0.9 in record 1615 can show that the user selects equal values (as " calibrated value ") and not review and degree of confidence is had bigger influence when directly confirming from the source at calibrated value (the being classification 2) ratio looking back and after the source is directly confirmed, from compile, select the user.
Because it is different different user to be proofreaied and correct the weighting of kind, so can carry out the appropriate change to the degree of confidence that is worth correct sign instance properties.For example, the correction of after search, carrying out can have bigger influence to degree of confidence than not searching for the correction of just carrying out.As another example, attempt through with the source directly affirmation be worth and change this value and can delete not corrected value and confirm directly from the source that degree of confidence is had bigger influence than the user.
In other is realized, can classify to user's correction and/or add other characteristic of considering that temporary the user proofreaies and correct.The user that for example, can carry out the individual with the history of suitably proofreading and correct proofreaies and correct the user who carries out than other people and proofreaies and correct the power more added.As another example, can proofread and correct more recent user than more old user and proofread and correct the power more added.
As shown in Figure 14, the system of implementation 1400 also can be in response to one of the not corrected value of the instance properties in the result set of search inquiry and calibrated value or the two rank (step 1410).The common rank of value that in this regard, more possibly correctly characterize instance properties is higher than the unlikely correct value that characterizes instance properties.
The degree of confidence that rank can the reflection value correctly characterizes instance properties changes.For example, can for example use shown in weighting parameters tables of data 1600 (Figure 16) weighting parameters to different types of correction different weights, to generate the increment of using to the convergent-divergent grading.
For example, in some are realized, can be in database or electronic document compile the search of the attribute of the value of being directed against.Database can comprise following information, and what the structuring that this information sign had for example before shown for other users appeared compiles.Search can produce the candidate value that has following indivedual initial confidence separately, and this initial confidence embodies the likelihood score that candidate value correctly characterizes instance properties.This type of initial confidence can be based on the measurements such as content such as the exact position of keyword coupling, font, segmentation, each speech, contiguous webpage.Initial confidence can be the form according to convergent-divergent grading (for example, the grading of convergent-divergent between minimum probable value (for example, " 0 ") and the highest probable value (for example, " 1 ")).
Then, can use following increment to initial confidence, the degree of confidence that this increment embodiment value correctly characterizes instance properties changes.Use increment to initial confidence and can produce the confidence of following change, the content that this confidence can be used for for example changing result set is perhaps to the content in result set rank again.For example, need a certain minimum confidence level, then use degree of confidence that increment increases this value to more than the minimum confidence level, thereby make the content changing of result set to the initial confidence of value if be contained in the result set.As another example, use increment and can increase more than the level of confidence of degree of confidence to another value of this value (perhaps reducing below the level of confidence of degree of confidence to another value of this value) to the initial confidence of a value.If to the rank as a result in the result set, then this type of level of confidence changes the rank that can change the result in the result set.If the result in result set is limited to a certain number (for example, being limited to four most probable results), then this type of level of confidence change as a result can change the content of result set.
In some are realized, to use increment to initial confidence and comprise that the occurrence number that each user is proofreaied and correct kind multiply by following weighting parameters, this weighting parameters embodies the value direction of change (and possibly embody) of the degree of confidence change that is associated with this kind.Product then can with corresponding initial confidence addition.In some are realized, can confirm the value of weighting parameters and for example for guarantee according to the ratio of initial confidence come the value of the scalar value that the convergent-divergent weighting uses, with the sum of maximization correct value after using confidence.
Can be based on summation to the rank as a result in the result set.Can for example in message (for example message 140 (Fig. 1)), the result set with one or more rank value be provided to the user through the data transmission network transmission.
Figure 17 is the process flow diagram that is used to utilize the user to proofread and correct and improves the process 1700 of search.Process 1700 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 1700 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 100 (Fig. 1) 105.In some are realized, can trigger (such as the user's request that improves search to using the user to proofread and correct) in response to receiving and come implementation 1700.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 1700.For example, can combine implementation 1700 with the activity of one or more process in the process 600,700,1200,1400 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Figure 12, Figure 14).
The system of implementation 1700 can receive the search inquiry description of (response to this search inquiry comprises the property value that is used for instance), be used to characterize the result set of the candidate value of instance properties, and the correct initial degree of confidence (step 1705) that characterizes instance properties of those values.System also can proofread and correct daily record (such as user's calibration history 110 (Fig. 1)), proofread and correct (step 1710) with the user who searches the candidate value in the result set by calling party.
The system of implementation 1700 also can determine whether to proofread and correct the correction of finding in the daily record the candidate value in the result set (step 1715) the user.If system confirms not find the correction to the candidate value in the result set, then system can keep the correct initial degree of confidence constant (step 1717) that characterizes instance properties of those values.If system confirms to find the correction to the candidate value in the result set that then kind weighting (step 1720) can be proofreaied and correct to different user by system.For example, in some were realized, system can use the weighting parameters in the weighting parameters tables of data 1600 (Figure 16) that different user is proofreaied and correct the kind weighting.
Figure 18 is schematically illustrating of another weighting parameters tables of data 1800.Tables of data 1800 is the data structures by the computer program accesses of on digital data system, operating that are used for that are stored in the digital data storage equipment.Tables of data 1800 comprises and comprises compiling of following recording of information 1805,1810,1815,1820,1825,1830,1835,1840,1845,1850,1855,1860,1865,1870 separately that this information characterizes the certain user and proofreaies and correct the weights of kind.
Table 1800 comprises compiling of row 1875,1880.Row 1875 comprise that characterizing the user proofreaies and correct the correction kind class identifier of kind.For example, proofread and correct kind of class identifier can according to gather feedback data compile in (in the row 1550 that gathering feedback data table 1500 (Figure 15)) characterize the user and proofread and correct the identical mode identifying user of kind and proofread and correct kind.
Row 1880 comprise following weighting parameters, and this weighting parameters embodies the value and the direction of proofreading and correct the degree of confidence change that is associated with the user of corresponding kind.For example, shown in realize that negative weights in record 1805,1810,1815,1820,1830,1835 show that the degree of confidence that the user who receives corresponding kind proofreaies and correct the value of restriction reduces.As another example, shown in realize that positive weights in record 1825,1840,1845,1850,1855 show that the degree of confidence that the user who receives corresponding kind proofreaies and correct the value of restriction increases.The absolute value of weights shows the value that degree of confidence changes.
As shown in Figure 17, the system of implementation 1700 can gather the weights (step 1725) to the correction of various candidate values.In some were realized, system can be with the weights summation so that gather them.For example, in the background of the weighting parameters in tables of data 1800 (Figure 18), system can carry out five user's timings of kind W5U are reached summation " 10 ".As another example, system can carry out five user's timings of kind W4U are reached summation " 10 ".
The system of implementation 1700 also can influence assignment (step 1730) to what gather that weights will have the degree of confidence of the value in the result set.The assignment influence that gathers weights need not to gather the value linear scale along with weights.For example, in some were realized, the influence that gathers weights was S shape (sigmoid) function that gathers value of weights.For example, can use equality 1 to the assignment that influences that gathers weights,
Wherein F (s) is the influence " s " that gathers weights and k is following formal parameter, and this formal parameter helps to confirm in the influence that gathers weights and gathers the relation between the value of weights.Gathering in the realization of weights (such as the weights in the row 1880 of tables of data 1800 (Figure 18)) through summation, k can have and is approximately two value.
The system of implementation 1700 also can change the correct degree of confidence (step 1735) that characterizes instance properties of one or more value in the result set.For example, system can and multiply each other in the corresponding influence that gathers weights of step 1730 assignment the indivedual degree of confidence that receive in step 1705.System also can be worth rank (step 1740) to these according to the respective confidence of the value in the result set.
Figure 19 is the schematically illustrating of system 1900 that wherein identifies the grouping of related example.Related example is to share the instance of one or more predicable.In system 1900, identify the grouping of related example in response to search inquiry.Search inquiry is specified the attribute of being shared by related example.Attribute by the grouping of related example is shared can be shown clearly by search inquiry, hint or show clearly and impliedly specify.For example, search inquiry " city " hint is specified the instance in discrete densely populated city.As another example, search inquiry " is positioned at the city of North America " show clearly the sign this type of city will be positioned at the North America.
System 1900 comprise search engine 1905, Provisioning Instance Identifier grouping compile 1910 and client 1915.Client 1915 is to be used for the equipment of user interactions and to may be embodied as the computing machine with the machine readable instructions programming.1915 of client computer can comprise one or more input-output apparatus and can receive following search inquiry from the user that this search inquiry is specified the attribute of being shared by the grouping of related example.For example, current and client 1915 mutual users can use input equipment (such as mouse or keyboard) to come the typing search inquiry.Search inquiry can comprise text.The example of text search query comprises " US President " and " city, North America ".As another example, the user can be through perhaps quoting this pattern primitive typing search inquiry usually with the graphic element that is shown on the display screen 1920 alternately.For example, the user can click structuring in appearing the unit or formulate following search inquiry, this search inquiry is quoted and is come across the characteristic (for example " OK _ 1 ") of structuring in appearing.Hereinafter more specifically description schemeization appears.
Client 1915 also can present the grouping of the identifier of following related example, and these instances are shared the attribute by the search inquiry appointment.In the example shown, client 1915 comprises that demonstration presents 1925 display screen 1920.Present 1925 and show that (that is, kind _ X) comprises compiling of the related example instance of (that is, by identifier " instance _ A ", " instance _ B " and " instance _ C " sign) in grouping.Shown in realize that presenting 1925 is texts.For example, structuring presents compiling of grouping and the related example in the unit in the row under this title in can the identity column title.
In response to receiving search inquiry, client 1915 in message 1935 to the expression or the search inquiry itself of search engine 1905 transmission search inquiries.Can pass through data communication network message transfer 1935.Search engine 1905 can receive message 1935 and use the content of message 1935 to be defined for the parameter of search.
Search engine 1095 can be implemented on one or more computing machine of following set of machine-readable instructions programming with one or more of disposing in one or more geographic position, and this set of machine-readable instructions is used for the associated packets of sign related example from the grouping that compiles 1910 instance.In some are realized, other function-promptly, the function except the function of search engine 1905-can be implemented on this one or more computing machine.The parameter that is used to search for that search engine 1905 limits according to the content message 1935 identifies the associated packets of related example.Search can produce the result set in response to the related example of the search inquiry of in message 1935, describing.The two can reflect the content of result set, the example arrangement in result set or this and form the instance likelihood relevant with search inquiry.In some were realized, example arrangement in result set or content also can reflect other factor, such as the relative Link Importance of instance or instance really in response to the degree of confidence of search inquiry.
Can in the electronic document that the destructuring electronic document compiles, find perhaps to extract the grouping that compiles the Provisioning Instance Identifier 1910 from these electronic documents.For example, compiling 1910 can be the grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier that can in electronic document available on the Internet, find.Therefore the source document of the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier may not be limited to defers to the predetermined structure that can be used for information extraction.For this reason, one or more computing machine can be carried out and be compiled into one or more set of machine-readable instructions that from the destructuring electronic document compiles, identifies and extract the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier.The machine readable instructions of establishment can be called " extraction apparatus " in such a way.
Compiling 1910 can comprise the tabulation of Provisioning Instance Identifier for example 1945, Provisioning Instance Identifier table 1950 and comprise the structured text 1955 of Provisioning Instance Identifier.Provisioning Instance Identifier tabulation 1945 is orderly consecutive speech or number.The Provisioning Instance Identifier tabulation can come to light in text and for example can be by grammer convention or markup tags sign.For example, the Provisioning Instance Identifier in tabulation can be defined by comma in the text or branch.Provisioning Instance Identifier table 1950 is layouts of the system of Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, can be expert at or be listed as in the arrangement examples identifier.In electronic document, table can for example perhaps be identified by markup tags by line that defines row and column or space.Structured text 1955 comprises other structuring layout of Provisioning Instance Identifier, such as the Provisioning Instance Identifier according to bullets (bullet point) or instance rank in the consecutive paragraph heading.In electronic document, structured text 1955 can be for example by the architectural feature of example arrangement or identify by markup tags.
In some are realized, compile 1910 and also can comprise the grouping of using one or more Provisioning Instance Identifier that the text extractive technique forms.Especially, show clearly or hint that Text Mode that the instance that shows sign has some attribute can be used for forming the grouping of one or more Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, can use the pattern identification technology to identify text, such as " New York, the North America largest city ... " " Quebec is first city, North America of being appointed as the UNESCO world heritage ".For example; Can use following text extractive technique; These text extractive techniques use Hirst (Hearst) pattern perhaps at for example M.Pasca, B.Van Durme and N.Garera " The Role of Documents vs.Queries in Extracting Class Attributes from Text " (CIKM07; In November, 2007 24-8; Portugal Lisbon) and M.Pasca, " Weakly-Supervised Acquisition of Open-Domain Classes and Class Attributes from Web Documents and Query Logs " (Proceedings of ACL-08:HLT, 19-27 page or leaf of B.Van Durme; Ohio, USA Columbus, in June, 2008) the middle mode of describing.Can extract Provisioning Instance Identifier and example combinations identifier from text and have with formation and show clearly and the impliedly grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of associated attributes, for example, the city, North America.Extraction apparatus can use the grouping of this class feature with sign from the destructuring electronic document compiles and extraction instance.
Search engine 1905 can be to the expression of client 1915 transmission to result set in message 1940.Can be for example through the data communication network message transfer 1940 identical with message transfer 1935.Client 1915 can receive message 1940 and use the content of message 1940 to present 1925 on display screen 1920, to show.Present 1925 and show that one or more predicable is shared by the grouping (that is at least some instances in the result set of, in message 1935, describing) of instance.In some are realized, present 1925 and can use text to identify shared attribute and Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, shown in realize, present 1925 and describe the shared attribute that belongs to kind " kind _ X " of the instance that is designated " instance _ A ", " instance _ B " and " instance _ C ".The attribute that appointment is shared by the instance that is designated " instance _ A ", " instance _ B " and " instance _ C " can shown or hint to kind " kind _ X " clearly.
In some are realized, present 1925 and can use the spatial placement of information is shared one or more predicable with the grouping that the location identifies instance.For example, that kind as described further below, presenting 1925 can be that structuring appears.
Figure 20 is the process flow diagram of process 2000 that is used to identify the grouping of related example identifier.Process 2000 can come the computing machine of executable operations to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2000 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1,900 1905.
The system of implementation 2000 receives inquiry (step 2005).For example, in the background of system 1900 (Figure 19), system can receive the expression or the search inquiry itself of search inquiry through data communication network in message 1935.
The grouping (step 2010) of this queried access related example of the system banner of implementation 2000.Can with inquiry be designated inquiry from the background of the grouping of the related example of query contents, inquiry or this two.For example; Because the plural term " city " in the text search query " city in the California " is characterized by the predicable (i.e. " in the California ") of related example; Can the term in this inquiry be designated those instances of inquiry, such as " Santiago ", " Los Angeles " and " Petrus Beukers is luxuriant and rich with fragrance ".As another example; Because the plural term " school " of search inquiry " school of Ivy League " China is characterized by predicable " Ivy League "; Can the term in the search inquiry " school of Ivy League " be designated the grouping of inquiry related example, such as " Connell ", " Colombia " and " Blang ").The reception background of search inquiry also can be used for identifying the grouping of queried access related example.For example, user's clearly indication or previous query history can be used for identifying the grouping of search inquiry inquiry related example.
The electronic document (step 2015) that the system banner of implementation 2000 is relevant with search inquiry.Can the two identifies electronic document with clauses and subclauses in the indexation database of electronic document through matched text, notion or this.Text in electronic document or the coupling between the notion can be used for confirming page rank and other factor of the degree of correlation of embodiment of electric document and search inquiry.Number, this electronic document that the example of these other factors comprises the age of this electronic document for example, point to the link of this electronic document from other electronic document is the likelihood score of " rubbish document " etc.
The grouping (step 2020) of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the system banner associated electrical document of implementation 2000.For example, the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier can be by defining of arranging of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the associated electrical document, markup tags or other characteristic sign.In some are realized, can extract them from the respective sources electronic document of the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier and they are merged into and compile, for example, compile 1910 in the system 1900 (Figure 19).
The system of implementation 2000 confirms each grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier and the degree of correlation (step 2025) of search inquiry.Generally speaking, the degree of correlation of the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier and search inquiry will be different from its source electronic document and the degree of correlation or the page rank of this same queries.For example, come across in the grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier that at least some texts and notion in the electronic document of source usually will be from the document and omit.In some are realized, that kind as described further below, the degree of correlation of the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier can be confirmed according to its degree of correlation or page rank and other factor of source electronic document.
The system of implementation 2000 is to the degree of correlation that comes across the instance in the grouping score individually (step 2030).The mark of indivedual Provisioning Instance Identifier can embody each indivedual instance likelihood score relevant with search inquiry.In some were realized, the combination that Provisioning Instance Identifier is come across further feature that grouping wherein identifies or these and other factor that comes across overlapping, search between the degree of correlation of grouping wherein, the Provisioning Instance Identifier in coming across not on the same group according to Provisioning Instance Identifier was scored to indivedual Provisioning Instance Identifier.The compiling of Provisioning Instance Identifier that therefore can comprise different score from the single grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of single source electronic document.Hereinafter further describes the example of the different modes that is used for the degree of correlation of dividing into groups is scored,
The mark of the indivedual Provisioning Instance Identifier of system's basis of implementation 2000 is to they ranks (step 2035).Rank can characterize indivedual instances likelihood score relevant with search inquiry.For example, the instance that rank is high is the instance that is likely following entity, and this entity has the attribute of in search inquiry, showing clearly or hinting sign.On the other hand, the instance that rank is low is unlikely to be the instance of following entity, and this entity has the attribute of in search inquiry, showing clearly or hinting sign.The Provisioning Instance Identifier of rank can be the for example output in the result set that the user provides in the message of transmitting through data transmission network (for example, message 1940 (Figure 19)).
Figure 21 be used to identify the related example identifier grouping process schematically illustrate 2100.This process can come the computing machine of executable operations to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, expression 2100 can represent that use (such as process 2000 (Figure 20)) identifies the related example identifier in system (such as system 1900 (Figure 19)).
Can search for electronic document compiles 2105 and compiles 2110 with the grouping that produces Provisioning Instance Identifier.Compiling 2105 can be that the destructuring electronic document compiles 2105.Can carry out search in response to the search inquiry of the parameter that is used for being defined for search.Search can identify the relevant documentation of the grouping that comprises Provisioning Instance Identifier.Can extract them from the respective sources document of the grouping of these Provisioning Instance Identifier and compile 2110 with generation.
Then, can basis with the degree of correlation of search inquiry to the indivedual Provisioning Instance Identifier ranks in the grouping that compiles the instance in 2110.Therefore instance can be to be shared in the entity that hints or show clearly one or more attribute of sign in the search inquiry.The Provisioning Instance Identifier of rank can be the output in the result set that the user provides.In some are realized, can in the different grouping of compiling the Provisioning Instance Identifier in 2110, find the Provisioning Instance Identifier of high rank.For example, can in first of Provisioning Instance Identifier divides into groups, find the Provisioning Instance Identifier of high rank, and second the Provisioning Instance Identifier of high rank possibly not be present in during first of said Provisioning Instance Identifier divides into groups.
Figure 22 is the process flow diagram that is used to identify the process 2200 of electronic document associated with the query.Process 2200 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2200 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1900 (Figure 19) 1905.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 2200.For example, can for example combine implementation 2200 with the activity of process 2000 in step 2015 (Figure 20).
The system of implementation 2200 receives search inquiry (step 2205).For example, in the background of system 1900 (Figure 19), system can receive the expression or the search inquiry itself of search inquiry through data communication network in message 1935.
The system of implementation 2200 forms one or more query (step 2210) of being partial to identify the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier.Text or the notion of can be through text or the notion represented in the search inquiry that is combined in reception and being partial to identify the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier form this type of has the deflection inquiry.For example, the text that extracts from the search inquiry that receives (for example " roller-coaster " perhaps " motor vehicle driven by mixed power ") can with the text of the sign of being partial to divide into groups (for example " [query text] tabulation ", " this year [query text] ", " I favorite [query text] ", " grouping of [query text] ", " best [query text] ", " [query text] such as ", " comprise ... [query text] " etc.) combination.
In some are realized, there is deflection to inquire about and comprises that some grouping that is intended to prevent Provisioning Instance Identifier is by text or notion that deflection inquiry sign is arranged.For example, in some are realized, can be formed with compiling of deflection inquiry and each inquiry comprises following text, the text is specified the subclass by the more broad sense kind of query text appointment.This type of has example of deflection inquiry to comprise " [subclass _ 1] [query text] such as ", " [subclass _ 2] [query text] such as " and " [subclass _ 3] [query text] such as ".
For example, suppose to receive search inquiry " restaurant ".That kind as discussed above, can form the grouping of being partial to identify Provisioning Instance Identifier (such as " and comprise ... [restaurant] ") inquiry.Yet; Except sign individual restaurants (for example Provisioning Instance Identifier " bagel of Bodo ", " Point Loma seafood " and " Pizza of Pat "); This has the deflection inquiry also can identify the Provisioning Instance Identifier (for example, " French restaurant ", " italian restaurant ", " Thailand restaurant " and " fast food restaurants ") of restaurant culinary art subclass.In this type of instance, can comprise following text having in the compiling of deflection inquiry, the text is specified more this type of subclass of broad sense kind.For example, can be formed with deflection inquiry, such as " comprise ... [France] [restaurant] ", " comprise ... [Italy] [restaurant] " and " comprise ... [Thailand] [restaurant] ", " comprise ... [fast food] [restaurant] ".
The system of implementation 2200 also forms one or more and is limited to the query (step 2215) of searching for some source.In some were realized, search can be limited to one or more summary, such as encyclopedia (for example,
Www.wikipedia.org) or dictionary.In some are realized, the source of limiting search according to the subject content of inquiry.For example, the search to " motor vehicle driven by mixed power " can be limited to news media and the consumer commission merchant that search relates to motor vehicles.
The system of implementation 2200 uses the search inquiry that receives, be partial to identify Provisioning Instance Identifier grouping search inquiry and be limited to the search inquiry of searching for some source and search for (step 2220).Can serial or parallel running search.Can compile as follows and search for same unstructured electronic document (for example, at electronic document available on the Internet), these search be used the search inquiry that receives and the deflection search inquiry are arranged.Each search can produce following roving commission result set, the electronic document that this Search Results set identifier is relevant with corresponding search inquiry.For example basis is scored and rank with indivedual documents that the degree of correlation and each Search Results of other factor pair of corresponding search inquiry are concentrated.
The system of implementation 2200 will be combined into the search result set (step 2225) of combination by the search result set that the difference search produces.Can be for example according to the relevance score of in indivedual search, confirming or page rank to electronic document rank in the Search Results centralised identity of combination.In some are realized; The relevance score of for example in indivedual search, confirming according to standard criterionization or and page rank, thereby make that the electronic document of the highest rank concentrated at each Search Results is the electronic document of high rank of the Search Results of combination concentrate three.In other is realized, concentrate the electronic document of finding perhaps to concentrate the electronic document of finding to prefer at the Search Results that produces by certain search at a plurality of Search Results to relevance score or page rank weighting.For example, can be to by the relevance score or the preferential weighting of page rank that are limited to the electronic document that the Search Results that inquiry produced of searching for some source concentrates, come across with highland more in the rank of search result set of combination.
Figure 23 be used to identify electronic document associated with the query process schematically illustrate 2300.This process can come the computing machine of executable operations to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, expression 2300 can represent that use (such as process 2200 (Figure 22)) identifies electronic document in system (such as system 1900 (Figure 19)).
Can repeatedly search for destructuring electronic document (for example, at document available on the Internet) compile 2305, with the limited Query Result set 2310 in generation source, by the result set that inquiry was produced 2315 of being partial to identification packet and query results 2320.Result set 2310,2315 and 2320 can identify the identical or different electric subdocument that compiles in 2305.Result set 2310,2315,2320 can be combined to form the result set 2325 of combination.Result set 2325 signs of combination come across destructuring and compile the electronic document in 2305.
Figure 24 is the process flow diagram of process 2400 of the degree of correlation that is used for confirming grouping and the search inquiry of Provisioning Instance Identifier.Process 2400 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2400 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1900 (Figure 19) 1905.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 2400.For example, can for example combine implementation 2400 with the activity of process 2000 in step 2025 (Figure 20).
The system of implementation 2400 receives search inquiry (step 2405).For example, in the background of system 1900 (Figure 19), system can receive the expression or the search inquiry itself of search inquiry through data communication network in message 1935.
Each source document during the system-computed source document of implementation 2400 compiles and the degree of correlation (step 2410) of inquiry.Can be for example the two calculates the degree of correlation through the text in matching inquiry and the electronic document, notion or this.Text in electronic document or the coupling between the notion can be used for confirming embodiment of electric document and the page rank of the degree of correlation of search inquiry and definite potentially other factor.
The potential grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the system-computed source document of implementation 2400 is actually the likelihood score (step 2415) of the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier.That kind described above, the potential grouping that Provisioning Instance Identifier in the associated electrical document is arranged defines, markup tags or other characteristic can be used for identifying Provisioning Instance Identifier.In some cases, do not confirm in fact to have identified the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier fully.For example, though comma is commonly used to define the tabulation member in the text, possibly from tabulation, inadvertently or otherwise omit comma sometimes.Under these circumstances, the consecutive Provisioning Instance Identifier in fact is the determinacy minimizing of tabulation.As another example, different Text Modes can more maybe or more can not identify the Provisioning Instance Identifier with some attribute exclusively.Can calculate the likelihood score that in fact the potential grouping of using the Provisioning Instance Identifier that this type of Text Mode converges comprises correct Provisioning Instance Identifier according to the accuracy of used Text Mode.
As another example, can be used for identifying the potential grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier such as mark html tags such as <b >, < li >, < td >, < a >.Yet this type of html tag does not always define bulleted list.HTML author replaces and can they be used for other purpose.For example, html tag < li >-be designed to limits list-item-also can be used for other format purpose or comprises the auxiliary text of the grouping that does not identify Provisioning Instance Identifier.Therefore, confirm fully even in fact the markup tags that is designed to limit the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier also can be used for identifying the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier.
Can the likelihood score of the grouping that has identified Provisioning Instance Identifier at the absolute degree of certainty of the grouping that has identified Provisioning Instance Identifier (for example be calculated and be expressed as; " 1 ") with the absolute degree of certainty (for example, " 0 ") that does not identify the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier as yet between normalized value.
Each the potential grouping of the system-computed Provisioning Instance Identifier of implementation 2400 and the degree of correlation (step 2420) that comprises the source document of this potential grouping.In some cases, the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier is irrelevant with other content of the electronic document of this grouping that comprises Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, the front cover of company's newsletter can comprise like following table, the address of the agency that this table elaboration company has.Though this table is the grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier, the content of this table (for example, agency address) can be irrelevant with other content of newsletter.System can through the text in the potential grouping of comparative example identifier, notion or this two with source document in text, notion or this two degree of correlation of coming each potential grouping of calculated examples identifier and comprising the source document of this potential grouping.
The system of implementation 2400 according to the potential grouping of the degree of correlation of source document and inquiry, Provisioning Instance Identifier be the degree of correlation of the likelihood score that divides into groups and potential grouping and source document, to potential grouping rank (step 2420).For example, can calculate examination mark " S according to formula that depends on multiplication, addition, exponentiation or following other to each potential grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier
G", the potential grouping of the source document of the potential grouping of this calculating use-case identifier and the degree of correlation of inquiry, Provisioning Instance Identifier in fact is the potential grouping of the likelihood score that divides into groups and Provisioning Instance Identifier and the degree of correlation of the source document of the potential grouping that comprises Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, in some are realized, calculate examination mark " S according to following formula to each potential grouping of instance
G":
S
G=R
DQL
GR
GDEquality 1 is " R wherein
DG" be source document and the degree of correlation of inquiry of the potential grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier, " L
G" be that the potential grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier in fact is the likelihood score that divides into groups, and " R
GD" be the potential grouping and the degree of correlation that comprises its source document of Provisioning Instance Identifier.Examination mark " the S of the potential grouping of each of Provisioning Instance Identifier
G" therefore can embody the degree of correlation of those potential groupings and search inquiry.
As another example, can use machine learning techniques to calculate examination mark " S to each potential grouping of Provisioning Instance Identifier
G".For example, can be that the degree of correlation of likelihood score and potential grouping and source document of grouping is as characteristic to the potential grouping of using the forecast analysis tree of training with the known grouping of the degree of correlation of search inquiry to make up the degree of correlation, the Provisioning Instance Identifier of incoming source document and inquiry in the algorithm.Make up the examination mark " S that algorithm produces by the forecast analysis tree
G" can embody number percent to the decision tree of the voting of dividing into groups.This number percent can be expressed as the number between 0 and 1.In some are realized, can regulate to the number percent of the decision tree of the voting of dividing into groups with the number of times considering to occur, degree that the grouping member has been refined and the factor other factor such as dividing into groups.
Figure 25 is used for coming across the process flow diagram of the degree of correlation of grouping wherein to the process 2500 of Provisioning Instance Identifier score according to Provisioning Instance Identifier.Process 2500 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2500 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1900 (Figure 19) 1905.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 2500.For example, can for example combine implementation 2500 with the activity of process 2000 in step 2030 (Figure 20).
The system of implementation 2500 receives the descriptor (sign that comprises the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping) of the potential grouping of description and the degree of correlation (step 2505) of these potential groupings and search inquiry.For example, the examination mark S that can receive the tabulation of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in each potential grouping and be used for each potential grouping of system
G
The system of implementation 2500 estimates that according to the degree of correlation that Provisioning Instance Identifier comes across potential grouping wherein each Provisioning Instance Identifier comes across the likelihood score (step 2510) in the associated packets.Relevant with search inquiry during being grouped in this grouping and comprising following Provisioning Instance Identifier of Provisioning Instance Identifier, this Provisioning Instance Identifier is shared in the search inquiry hint or shows the attribute of appointment clearly.Therefore the likelihood score that each Provisioning Instance Identifier occurs in associated packets can embody the degree of correlation of Provisioning Instance Identifier and search inquiry.
In some are realized, estimate that according to the method that depends on expectation-maximization algorithm each Provisioning Instance Identifier comes across the likelihood score in the associated packets.Expectation-maximization algorithm is carried out the maximal possibility estimation to one or more parameter that distributes according to incomplete data set and missing variable.Expectation-maximization algorithm can be selected at model and give the regularly parameter set of best descriptor data set.
In this paper context, data set is potential grouping.Some potential group of model hypothesis relevant with inquiry (" R " divides into groups) and other potential group relevant (grouping " N ") with inquiry.In addition, given (i) has the probability " P (i|R) " in the associated packets of coming across and comes across the probability " P (i|N) " in irrelevant the grouping.Can be originally be actually the likelihood score of grouping and the degree of correlation of grouping and its source document is come estimated probability P (i|R), P (i|N) based on the grouping of the degree of correlation of the source document that for example divides into groups and search inquiry, instance.Then, can use expectation-maximization algorithm to maximize probability P (i|R), P (i|N).
Expectation-maximization algorithm may be embodied as the iterative process that between desired step and maximization steps, replaces.In desired step, estimate missing variable according to observation data with to the current estimation of distribution parameter.In maximization steps, maximization is to the estimation of distribution parameter under the hypothesis of missing variable known (that is, having the value of estimating in the desired step formerly).Along with repeating step iteratively, to the estimation convergence of distribution parameter.For example; In A.P.Dempster, N.M.Laird, D.B.Rubin " Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the EM Algorithm " (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Methodological) 39 (1) 1-38 pages or leaves (1977)), expectation-maximization algorithm has been described more specifically.
Figure 26 is used for coming across the process flow diagram of the degree of correlation of grouping wherein to the process 2600 of Provisioning Instance Identifier score according to Provisioning Instance Identifier.Process 2600 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2600 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1900 (Figure 19) 1905.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 2600.For example, can for example combine implementation 2600 with the activity of process 2000 in step 2030 (Figure 20).
The system of implementation 2600 receives the degree of correlation (step 2605) of the descriptor (sign that comprises the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping) of describing potential grouping and these potential group and search inquiry.For example, the examination mark S that can receive the tabulation of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in each potential grouping and be used for each potential grouping of system
G
The system of implementation 2600 shows the characteristic (step 2610) of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping in one or more point-edge graph.Point-edge graph is the expression of object set, and the paired object of some of them is connected by link.The object of interconnection is represented by the summit, and the link that connects some paired summits is called the limit.
Figure 27 is a little-the schematically illustrating of edge graph 2700, and this point-edge graph shows the characteristic of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping.Point-edge graph 2700 comprises by the grouping on one or more limit 2735,2740,2745,2750,2755,2760,2765 by the summit 2705,2710,2715,2720,2725,2730 to connecting.Point-edge graph 2700 is non-directed graphs.
The Provisioning Instance Identifier of finding in the potential grouping of each summit 2705,2710,2715,2720,2725,2730 representative sign in one or more search.For example, summit 2720 representative instance identifiers " George Washington ", summit 2720 representative instance identifiers " Franklin D. Rossfu ", and summit 2730 representative instance identifiers " agate Sha Washington ".Can be limited to the degree of correlation that has with at least some threshold levels of search inquiry from its potential grouping of extracting summit 2705,2710,2715,2720,2725,2730.For example, the degree of correlation of can use 2400 (Figure 24) confirming potential grouping and search inquiry.
Each of limit 2735,2740,2745,2750,2755,2760,2765 divides into groups to represent the summit that is connected by the limit in the potential grouping to occur jointly.For example, four different edge in limit grouping 2755 can be represented and find " George Washington " summit 2720 in four potential groupings that also comprising " Franklin D. Rossfu ".In some were realized, further feature can be represented by the limit.Table 1 is the sample list of this category feature.
Exemplary characteristics
-inquiry that the source document that comprises summit pairing is identified;
-query categories (for example, deflection inquiry, the limited inquiry in source being arranged) that the source document that comprises summit pairing is identified;
-by the number of the potential grouping that inquiry identified that the source document that comprises summit pairing is identified;
The degree of correlation of-source document;
The source document of-summit pairing;
The extraction apparatus of-sign summit pairing;
-wherein find other instance in the potential grouping of summit pairing;
Table 1
In some were realized, can confirm according to the characteristic of neighbouring entry can be by the further feature of limit representative.
Figure 28 is schematically illustrating of another point-edge graph 2800, and this point-edge graph shows the characteristic of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping.Point-edge graph 2800 comprises by indivedual limits 2835,2840,2845,2850,2855,2860,2865 by the summit 2805,2810,2815,2820,2825,2830 to connecting.Each limit 2835,2840,2845,2850,2855,2860,2865 is by corresponding weight value 2870,2875,2880,2885,2890,2895,2899 weightings.Therefore point-edge graph 2800 is weighted undirected graph.
The potential grouping of each summit 2805,2810,2815,2820,2825,2830 representative instance identifier.For example, the grouping of six Provisioning Instance Identifier is represented on summit 2815, and the grouping of three Provisioning Instance Identifier is represented on summit 2820, and the grouping of three Provisioning Instance Identifier is represented on summit 2825.The potential grouping of representative can be limited to the degree of correlation that has with a certain at least threshold level of search inquiry in summit 2805,2810,2815,2820,2825,2830.For example the degree of correlation of potential grouping and search inquiry is confirmed in use 2400 (Figure 24).
Each limit 2735,2740,2745,2750,2755,2760,2765 representative " overlapping " between the paired summit that it connects." overlapping " between two summits is the number by the total Provisioning Instance Identifier of the potential grouping of those summit representatives.Overlapping can the expression by the corresponding weight value that is associated with each limit 2735,2740,2745,2750,2755,2760,2,765 2870,2875,2880,2885,2890,2895,2899.For example, there is not the total Provisioning Instance Identifier of potential grouping by summit 2815,2820 representatives in weights 2880 representatives, and there are three the total Provisioning Instance Identifier of potential grouping by summit 2815,2825 representatives in weights 2885 representatives.For the sake of clarity, omitted other zero weights limit from point-edge graph 2800.Therefore point-edge graph 2800 shows overlapping between the potential grouping of wherein finding Provisioning Instance Identifier.
Need not summit and the limit according to graphic form displayed map 2700,2800 as shown in the figure.In fact, Figure 27 00,2800 can for example keep abstract representation in the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation.
Get back to Figure 26, the system of implementation 2600 according to by the characteristic of the representative of the limit in point-edge graph to the score of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping (step 2615).The character of score can depend on characteristic and this effect in point-edge graph of Provisioning Instance Identifier that in point-edge graph, shows.
In some are realized, can use the result of the machine learning techniques of carrying out by the computing machine of carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions that the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping is scored.Training dataset can at first be used for allowing machine to set up the rule set that is used for the Provisioning Instance Identifier score.This rule set that is used to score can be applied to other data set then.
For example; In the background of point-edge graph 2700 (Figure 27); Forecast analysis tree make up likelihood score that algorithm (such as the classification and regression tree analysis) can belong to associated packets according to instance to their score, whether belong to associated packets about Provisioning Instance Identifier they classified, perhaps the two has concurrently.Tree makes up algorithm and confirms to be used for the IF-THEN logic rules collection to the Provisioning Instance Identifier score that allows example prediction accurately or classification.Compile the variate-value of concentrating based on modeling data through rule and make up tree.How well the fractionation that can be the basis based on the value with different variablees can be distinguished observation and come selective rule.For example; At people such as Breiman " Classification and Regression Trees " (Chapman & Hall (Wadsworth; Inc.) New York (1984)), the example that tree makes up algorithm has been described in " Random Forests " (Machine Learning 45:1 rolls up (2001) 5-32 pages or leaves) of " CART:Tree-structured Non-parametric Data Analysis " (Salford Systems, California, USA Santiago (1995)) of people such as Steinberg and Breiman.
The set of the potential grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier that can use the grouping that the Provisioning Instance Identifier of confirming accuracy arranged relevant with search inquiry, from the destructuring electronic document compiles, has identified and the characteristic of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping train this type of forecast analysis tree to make up algorithm.Decision tree can carry out their judgement based on characteristic (characteristic of for example, in table 1, enumerating).For example, US President's exclusive list, can be used for setting up classification and regression tree by machine in response to the set of the potential grouping of inquiry US President's the Provisioning Instance Identifier that identifies of search inquiry and the characteristic of the Provisioning Instance Identifier in these potential groupings.Be used for characteristic at other set of the potential grouping of the Provisioning Instance Identifier that the IF-THEN logic rules collection that this classification and regression tree is scored can be applied to have identified in response to other search inquiry then and the Provisioning Instance Identifier in these other potential grouping.Whether use these logical conditions can according to the likelihood score that the Provisioning Instance Identifier in these other potential grouping is belonged to associated packets to the Provisioning Instance Identifier score in these other potential grouping, belong to associated packets and to they classification about instance, perhaps this two have concurrently.
In some are realized, can the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping be scored through the group in identification point-edge graph.Group is by to adjacent vertex collection or in other words be the induced subgraph as complete graph.The size of group is the number on the summit in this group.In the background of point-edge graph 2800 (Figure 28), summit 2815,2830 forms following complete bipartite graph (perhaps " two fens groups "), in summit 2830, also finds each Provisioning Instance Identifier in the summit 2815 in the figure.The overlapping high relatively value of this high level (that is, value is six) representative by weights 2890.Summit 2815,2825 has overlapping and shared only three the composition Provisioning Instance Identifier of middle degree.The overlapping intermediate value of degree (that is, value is three) representative in this by weights 2885.Summit 2820,2830 is not overlapping fully, and this zero lap is by the null value representative of weights 2899.
The sign of group and overlapping can being used between the summit to scoring by the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the potential grouping of these summit representatives.For example; In agglomerate and/or have the overlapping Provisioning Instance Identifier of high level and can be regarded as more having attribute by the search inquiry appointment, and in little group and/or have the overlapping Provisioning Instance Identifier of low degree and can be regarded as unlikely having attribute by the search inquiry appointment.In some were realized, the size of group can be than the overlapping degree weighting more in the littler group when score.For example, summit 2815,2825,2830 forms following the limit on three summits, and it is three limit that this limit has minimum weights, and summit 2815,2830 forms following the limit on two summits, and it is six limit that this limit has minimum weights.Can get compiling of the bigger following independent source of three summits group conduct, this independent source confirms that three common example identifiers have the attribute by the search inquiry appointment probably.In some are realized, can send the expression of the set of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of scoring then to client (the for example client 1915 in the system 1900 (Figure 19)).
Figure 29 is the process flow diagram of the process 2900 that is used for Provisioning Instance Identifier is reset scores.Process 2900 can come the computing machine of combine digital data processing operation to carry out through carrying out one or more set of machine-readable instructions by one or more.For example, process 2900 can be carried out by the search engine in the system 1900 (Figure 19) 1905.Can handle operation with other numerical data and separate or combine implementation 2900.For example, can for example combine with the activity of process 2500 afterwards perhaps for example to combine implementation 2900 with the activity of process 2600 afterwards in step 2615 (Figure 26) in step 2510 (Figure 25).
The system of implementation 2900 receives the compiling of Provisioning Instance Identifier (step 2905) of the descriptor of describing search inquiry and score.Can have by the likelihood score of the attribute of the search inquiry appointment that receives according to Provisioning Instance Identifier they are scored.
The displacement (step 2910) of the text of the search inquiry of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of the text matches of the search inquiry that the system of implementation 2900 can remove and receive or reception.For example, if search inquiry inquiry " US President " then can be removed such as Provisioning Instance Identifier such as " president ", " US Presidents " from the set of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of score.In some are realized, can remove other Provisioning Instance Identifier (such as common saying) from the set of the Provisioning Instance Identifier of score.
The system of implementation 2900 can change the mark (step 2915) of the relevant or similar Provisioning Instance Identifier in the set of Provisioning Instance Identifier of score.Example relevant or similar Provisioning Instance Identifier comprises following Provisioning Instance Identifier; This Provisioning Instance Identifier use come from different spellings speech (for example; Defense/defence, behavior/behaviour), as the speech of the different transliteration of alien word (for example; Tsar/czar/csar), identify same instance as the speech (Robert Kennedy/Bobby Kennedy/R.F.Kennedy) of abb. or little speech and as the speech (for example, George Washington/George Washington's biography) of the substring of another Provisioning Instance Identifier.In some were realized, similar or related example identifier can be combined into the single instance identifier.
The system of implementation 2900 also can come across frequency in the electronic document that the destructuring electronic document compiles to the mark weighting (step 2920) of Provisioning Instance Identifier according to Provisioning Instance Identifier.For example, when the grouping of electronic document is indexed, can confirm to come across the occurrence number of the different terms (comprising the Provisioning Instance Identifier term) in the electronic document.Then the value that can be for example multiply by the inverse that is approximately occurrence number through the mark that will be used for the different instances identifier is come this mark of convergent-divergent.Thereby the mark that often comes across the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the electronic document can minimizing for the mark that only seldom comes across the Provisioning Instance Identifier in the electronic document.
In some were realized, other activity can be used for instance compiled and reset scores.For example, in some are realized, can from compile, will come along and remove, thereby on effect, their mark will be reduced to zero with the Provisioning Instance Identifier of fixed black list coupling.Blacklist can comprise that indivedual Provisioning Instance Identifier or identifier/search inquiry are right.
In some are realized, can change the mark of Provisioning Instance Identifier, with the likelihood score of reflection identifier list levies in kind example kind.In some are realized, can confirm the likelihood score of identifier list levies in kind example kind according to the search query log of submitting to by different human users.For example; In response to the user (for example at the search inquiry of the instance that utilizes a sign score; Search inquiry " car ") inquires and utilize one to use search inquiry that this identifier identifies kind (for example; Search inquiry " car type " and " car tabulation ") switch between searching for, can reduce the mark of this Provisioning Instance Identifier.In another example; In response to the user (for example at the search inquiry of the instance that utilizes a sign score; Search inquiry " car ") inquires and utilize the identifier of the more specifically instance in this kind (for example to search for; Search inquiry in kind " car " " general sharp this (prius) ") switches between, can increase the mark of Provisioning Instance Identifier more specifically.
In some are realized, can transmit the expression of the set of the Provisioning Instance Identifier that resets scores to client (for example, the client 1915 in the system 1900 (Figure 19)).
Fig. 3-Fig. 5 presents 300,400,500 example to the structuring that the user presents the grouping of relevant Provisioning Instance Identifier.Structuring presents 300,400,500 and can be for example presents to the user in 1925 by client 1915 appearing on display screen 1920 (Figure 19).Structuring appear 300,400,500 use spatial placement and location to information to identify instance grouping share one or more predicable.
