- Communications unit 210 allows cloud computing service 202 to communicate with other devices, such as client computer 216 and other client computers.
- Data store 212 is used to store files accessible by a user on client computer 216 . Users log on to the cloud computing service using a username and password, and cloud computing service 202 provides a user interface for the display of files through the web browsers executing on the client computers. Data store 212 may also store a number of applications that are made available to users for installation.
- Data store 212 may also store metadata regarding files and users, and may store tables, matrices, files and other data structures based on the file and user metadata.
- the data structures may be used by cloud computing service 202 to create a scored list of applications for use in making application recommendations to users. These data structures may include user application signatures and a user similarity matrix, which are discussed further herein.
- the data structures may be updated or recalculated on a periodic basis by a data process scheduler executed by CPU 204 .
- File and user metadata may be changed by recent user actions, so data structures based on the metadata are recalculated to account for those recent actions.

- magnetic disks e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks
- a cloud computing service has a large base of users and available applications, and is capable of collecting aggregate data concerning the installation and usage of applications by users. This data is statistically significant and may be harnessed to generate application recommendations for a particular user.
- One type of information that a cloud computing service may use to recommend applications is the application usage behavior of each user. Each user uses a number of applications to open files stored on the cloud computing service.
- the cloud computing service may store application usage history for each user. Some users tend to be similar to other users in the applications that they use.
- the cloud computing service is able to determine application usage similarities between users and then recommend applications to a user that similar users have also used.
- the cloud computing service stores metadata information about each user of the cloud computing service and each file stored on the cloud computing service.
- the cloud computing service stores application usage history data which counts how many times a user has used a specific application to open a specific file.
- FIG. 3 shows an example of application usage history data.
- the application usage history data is stored in the metadata of each file and are arranged on a per user basis.
- table 302 stores the application usage table for User 1 and File 1. That is, table 302 stores how many times User 1 has used each application to open File 1. Every time User 1 uses an application to open File 1, the cloud computing service increments the appropriate entry in table 302 by one.
- table 302 shows that User 1 has used App A to open File 1 1,000 times, has used App B to open File 1 500 times, has used App D to open File 1 3,000 times, and has never used App C to open File 1.
- Tables 302 , 304 , and 306 are the application usage history data for File 1 for User 1, User 2, and User 3 respectively, while tables 308 , 310 , and 312 are the application usage history data for File 2 for User 1, User 2, and User 3 respectively.
- the applications in the application usage history data may be denoted by an application ID.
- the application usage history tables may not record information about non-usage of applications, i.e. only non-zero entries appear in the tables.
- the cloud computing service periodically updates the application usage history data to account for recent user activity.
- the application usage history data may be used to create an application signature for each user, which represents the application usage behavior of each user across all files accessible to the user.
- FIG. 4 shows examples of application signatures 402 , 404 , and 406 for User 1, User 2, and User 3 respectively, where the application signatures are based on the application usage history data found in FIG. 3 .
- Each application signature is a table of application IDs and a corresponding usage total.
- the usage total is a function of the number of times the user has used the application to open files stored on the cloud computing service.
- the usage total may be the sum of the number of times the user has used the application to open each file accessible to the user. For example, table 302 in FIG.
- the application signatures for each user may be used to compare the similarity between pairs of users with regard to application usage behavior. All possible pairs of users may be compared and a similarity value assigned to each pair of users.
- the cloud computing service creates and stores a pairwise user similarity matrix to hold the similarity values between pairs of users of the cloud computing service.
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a user similarity matrix 500 based on the application signatures shown in FIG. 4 .
- the rows and columns of similarity matrix 500 both represent all the users of the cloud computing service, and may be indexed by user ID.
- Similarity matrix 500 is shown in FIG. 5 as an upper triangular matrix because the matrix is symmetric, i.e. entries appearing below the matrix diagonal also appear above the matrix diagonal. Similarity matrix 500 may also be constructed as a lower triangular matrix, or may be a complete square matrix.
- the cloud computing service periodically updates user similarity matrix 500 to account for up-to-date application signatures for each user based on recent user activity.
- the similarity values of the cells in user similarity matrix 500 are a measure of the similarity of application usage between the user represented by the row and the user represented by the column.
- the similarity value of each cell may range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents no similarity between users and 1 represents complete similarity between users.
- the entries in the diagonal of similarity matrix 500 are 1 because the user of the row and column are the same.
- the similarity value is calculated from the application signatures of two users.
- the application signatures may be considered vectors, where each application is considered a dimension and the usage total for that application is the magnitude of that dimension. There are a number of ways to quantify the similarity between vectors. One such method is called cosine similarity.
- application signature 402 for User 1 may be expressed as vector (1600, 900, 0, 6000) and application signature 404 for User 2 may be expressed as vector (3000, 1100, 5000, 0).
- the cosine similarity value cos( ⁇ ) between these two vectors is 0.155, shown in similarity matrix 500 .
- Other methods for calculating the similarity value may also be used to construct user similarity matrix 500 , such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.
- the application signatures and the user similarity matrix may be used to generate a score for each available application provided by the cloud computing service.
- a scored list of applications is used to recommend applications to a user. The score is based on differences between the application signature of the user and each other user, weighted by the similarity value of the user with each other user.
- a flow chart for calculating the scored list of applications for a target user is shown below:
- FIGS. 6 and 7 An example of constructing a scored list of applications for User 3 is shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 , given the application signatures shown in FIG. 4 and the user similarity matrix shown in FIG. 5 .
- the similarity values between User 3 and each of User 1 and User 2 are retrieved from similarity matrix 500 , which are 0.04 and 0.89 respectively.
- the difference between the application signature of User 3 and each of User 1 and User 2 are determined.
- the difference between application signatures may be calculated by treating each application signature as a vector and subtracting the vectors. This is illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- the application signature of User 1 is (1600, 900, 0, 6000)
- the application signature of User 2 is (3000, 1100, 5000, 0)
- the application signature of User 3 is (0, 1300, 4000, 0).
- Table 602 is the application signature of User 3 subtracted from the application signature of User 1, which gives the vector (1600, ⁇ 400, ⁇ 4000, 6000).
- table 604 is the application signature of User 3 subtracted from the application signature of User 2, which gives the vector (3000, ⁇ 200, 1000, 0).
- a score is calculated for each application with a usage total of zero in the application signature of User 3.
- a usage total of zero indicates User 3 has never used the application. If the usage total of an application is non-zero, then User 3 has already used the application and so should not be recommended that application again.
- User 3's application signature 406 in FIG. 4 indicates that User 3 has used App B and App C but not App A or App D, so scores are calculated for App A and App D.
- the score may be calculated as the weighted average of the usage total differentials of the applications in tables 602 and 604 , weighted by the similarity value between the users of the respective tables, and then divided by the sum of the similarity values.
- the score for an application X that has a usage total of zero in the user's application signature may be expressed as: (SV 1,k (UT 1 ⁇ UT k )+SV 2,k (UT 2 ⁇ UT k )+ . . . +SV N,k (UT N ⁇ UT k ))/(SV 1,k +SV 2,k + . . .
- N is the number of users of the cloud computing service, where n ranges from 1 to N and excludes the k-th user, UT n is the usage total of the first application for the n-th user, and SV n,k is the similarity value between the n-th user and the k-th user.
- the scored list of applications may be stored as a table with the application IDs of each application not already used by the user, and its corresponding score. The list may be unsorted or may be sorted based on score, application ID, or some other sort basis.
- the scores may be normalized.
- the cloud computing service has a scorer unit that utilizes the application signature and the user similarity matrix to create a scored list of applications for a user, where the score is a function of the usage totals for the application in the application signatures for each user and each other user's similarity value to the user. This list may be used by the cloud computing service to recommend one or more applications to a user.
- FIG. 8 shows an example flow chart 800 of a scorer unit operated by the cloud computing service.
- the scorer unit is part of the cloud computing service and executes flow chart 800 each time a request is received to score applications based on the application usage characteristics of the user body.
- the scorer unit is initiated when an application scoring request is received, shown at 802 .
- the scoring request may be triggered by a user action on the cloud computing user interface. For example, the scoring request may be initiated when a user logs into the cloud computing service or when the user navigates to an application selection or application browsing screen. These actions provide opportunities for the cloud computing service to display recommended applications to a user.
- the scorer unit initiates a user-based scoring methodology, shown at 804 .
- Two inputs are used to implement file type scoring: the application signatures 806 for each user of the cloud computing service and user similarity matrix 808 .
- the application signatures 806 for each user store usage totals that measure how many times the user has used an application to open files accessible to the user. This information is obtained from the file metadata of each file stored on the cloud computing service, which stores application usage history data on a per user basis.
- User similarity matrix 808 stores similarity values for each pair of users of the cloud computing service, where the similarity value measures the similarity between the two users' application signatures.
- the application signatures may be considered a vector and cosine similarity is used to generate the similarity value between two vectors.
- the cloud computing service creates, stores and periodically updates the application signatures 806 for each user and the user similarity matrix 808 .
- the scorer unit constructs a scored list of applications using application signatures 806 for each user and user similarity matrix 808 .
- the scored list of applications does not include scores for applications that the user has already installed.
- the score is a function of the usage totals for the application in the application signatures for each user and each user's similarity value to the target user. For example, one formula for calculating the score of an application X for a given user k is: (SV 1,k (UT 1 ⁇ UT k )+SV 2,k (UT 2 ⁇ UT k )+ . . . +SV N,k (UT N ⁇ UT k ))/(SV 1,k +SV 2,k + . . .
- the scored list of applications is then a table of application IDs and the score for each application.
- the scored list of applications is the output of the scorer unit, shown at 810 .
- the scored list of applications may be sorted by score, by application ID, or by any other sorting basis, or may be unsorted.
- the score of each application may be normalized.
- the cloud computing service may use the outputted list to generate application recommendations for the user, or may combine the output of the scorer unit with other scoring methodologies to generate a composite scored list, which is then used to generate application recommendations for the user.
- Method 900 illustrated in FIG. 9 shows a method for providing a scored list of applications for use in recommending applications to a user, which includes storing an application signature for each user of a cloud computing service, where the application signature for a first user stores a usage total for the first user for each application in a set of available applications provided by the cloud computing service.
- the method further includes storing a user similarity matrix across all users of the cloud computing service, where a first similarity value in the user similarity matrix measures the similarity between the first user's application signature and a second user's application signature.
- the method further includes receiving at the cloud computing service a request to provide a scored list of applications for the first user, constructing the scored list of applications from the set of available applications, where a score of each application is a function of the usage totals for the application in the application signatures for each user and each user's similarity value to the first user, and outputting the scored list of applications.
- Method 900 may be performed on one or more servers that provide a cloud computing service, such as cloud computing service 102 in FIG. 1 or cloud computing service 202 in FIG. 2 .
- a scorer unit within the cloud computing service such as shown in FIG. 8 , may perform all or a portion of method 900 .
- Method 900 begins when the cloud computing service creates and stores an application signature for each user of the cloud computing service, shown at 902 .
- the application signature of a user stores usage totals for each application in a set of available applications provided by the cloud computing service.
- the usage total represents the number of times the user has used the application to open files stored on the cloud computing service.
- the usage total is obtained from the file metadata of each file.
- the file metadata contains application usage history data, which stores the number of times each application has been used to open the file, on a per user basis.
- the usage total for a given application and a given user may be the sum of the number of times the user has used the application to open each file stored on the cloud computing service, as obtained from the application usage history data of each file.
- the application signature for a user may be a table that stores the application ID of each application and its corresponding usage total.
- the application signatures may be updated or recalculated on a periodic basis to account for recent user activity.
- the cloud computing service creates and stores a user similarity matrix, shown at 904 .
- the user similarity matrix stores similarity values for each pair of users of the cloud computing service.
- the similarity values measure the similarity between the application signatures of pairs of users.
- the user similarity matrix has rows and columns corresponding to each user of the cloud computing service.
- the similarity value of a cell of the matrix is the similarity between the application signature of the row user and the application signature of the column user.
- cosine similarity The application signatures may be treated as vectors.
- the cloud computing service calculates the similarity value for each pairwise combination of users and stores the values in the user similarity matrix.
- the user similarity matrix may be updated or recalculated on a periodic basis to account for recent user activity.
- the cloud computing service receives a request to provide a scored list of applications to a user, shown at 906 .
- the scored list of applications may be used to generate a set of recommended applications to show the user.
- the request may be triggered by certain user actions on the user interface provided by the cloud computing service. For example, the request may be triggered when the user logs into the cloud computing service on the user's client computer, or when the user navigates to an application selection or application browsing page on the user interface.
- the request may include an instruction to use a user-based scoring method, or the default scoring method may be set to user-based scoring.
- the cloud computing service constructs a scored list of applications, shown at 908 .
- the score of each application is a function of the usage totals for the application in the application signatures for each user and each user's similarity value to the target user. For example, one formula for calculating the score of an application X for a given user k is: (SV 1,k (UT 1 ⁇ UT k )+SV 2,k (UT 2 ⁇ UT k )+ . . . +SV N,k (UT N ⁇ UT k ))/(SV 1,k +SV 2,k + . . .
- the scored list of applications may be a table with the application ID of each application and the corresponding score.
- the scored list of applications may be normalized, and may be unsorted or sorted by score, application ID, or some other sorting basis.

- 1. For each of the N-1 other users of the cloud computing service (the “loop user”):
- a. Look up the similarity value between the loop user and the target user from the user similarity matrix.
- b. Look up the application signatures for the loop user and the target user.
- c. Subtract the application signature of the target user from the loop user, where the usage total of each application in the target user application signature is subtracted from the corresponding usage total of the application in the loop user application signature.
- 2. For each application where the target user's application signature usage total for that application is zero:
- d. Compute the weighted average of the (N-1) application signature differences, where the weights come from the similarity values between the target user and each of the (N-1) other users.
- e. Store the weighted average as the score for the application.
- 1. For each of the N-1 other users of the cloud computing service (the “loop user”):
(SV1,k(UT1−UTk)+SV2,k(UT2−UTk)+ . . . +SVN,k(UTN−UTk))/(SV1,k+SV2,k+ . . . SVN,k),
where N is the number of users of the cloud computing service, where n ranges from 1 to N and excludes the k-th user, UTn is the usage total of the first application for the n-th user, and SVn,k is the similarity value between the n-th user and the k-th user. However, other methods for calculating a score using the application signatures and user similarity matrix may be used. The scored list of applications may be stored as a table with the application IDs of each application not already used by the user, and its corresponding score. The list may be unsorted or may be sorted based on score, application ID, or some other sort basis. The scores may be normalized.
(SV1,k(UT1−UTk)+SV2,k(UT2−UTk)+ . . . +SVN,k(UTN−UTk))/(SV1,k+SV2,k+ . . . SVN,k),
where N is the number of users of the cloud computing service, where n ranges from 1 to N and excludes the k-th user, UTn is the usage total of the first application for the n-th user, and SVn,k is the similarity value between the n-th user and the k-th user. The scored list of applications is then a table of application IDs and the score for each application. The scored list of applications is the output of the scorer unit, shown at 810. The scored list of applications may be sorted by score, by application ID, or by any other sorting basis, or may be unsorted. The score of each application may be normalized. The cloud computing service may use the outputted list to generate application recommendations for the user, or may combine the output of the scorer unit with other scoring methodologies to generate a composite scored list, which is then used to generate application recommendations for the user.
(SV1,k(UT1−UTk)+SV2,k(UT2−UTk)+ . . . +SVN,k(UTN−UTk))/(SV1,k+SV2,k+ . . . SVN,k),
where N is the number of users of the cloud computing service, where n ranges from 1 to N and excludes the k-th user, UTn is the usage total of the first application for the n-th user, and SVn,k is the similarity value between the n-th user and the k-th user. There may be other ways to calculate the score using the usage totals of the application and the user similarity matrix. The scored list of applications may be a table with the application ID of each application and the corresponding score. The scored list of applications may be normalized, and may be unsorted or sorted by score, application ID, or some other sorting basis. The scored list of applications is then outputted, shown at 910. The outputted list, either alone or combined with other scoring methods, may be used by the cloud computing service to recommend one or more applications to the user. In this manner, a cloud computing service provides a scored list of applications for use in recommending applications to a user.
