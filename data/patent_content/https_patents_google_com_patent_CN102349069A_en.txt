The hierarchical data extraction apparatus
In some embodiments, hierarchical data can be relevant with the form of catalogue of the website that is associated with resource.In some embodiments, one or more levels of the resource in the website that hierarchical data can be illustrated in resource is associated are sorted out.
Hierarchical data extraction apparatus 132 can use a plurality of processes to confirm the hierarchical structure that is associated with resource.Process can relate to be assessed and analyzes with from resource extraction station dot structure resource.Process can include but not limited to analyze the map of website that the link structure that is associated with resource, parsing and resource associated navigation menu, assessment be associated with resource and analyze and the user behavior relevant with the resource associated navigation.Process may further include analyzes the classified information that web-based management person that the classification tree be associated with resource and word and analysis be associated with resource or user provide.
In some embodiments, hierarchical data extraction apparatus 132 can scan resource for the crumbs data.Hierarchical data extraction apparatus 132 can use crumbs to confirm the hierarchical structure of website.For example, crumbs can be the visual representations that draws the hyperlink of the initial or inlet point of getting back to the website that comprises this webpage from the webpage that the user just checks.Character or graphic element can be separated the visual representation of hyperlink.Crumbs can provide from current resource upward in the website not so not deeply or the not backward chaining of so concrete resource, possibly finish in the initial of website or inlet point place.Do as a wholely, crumbs can be the forms with " depth map " of the current resource relevant with the hierarchical structure of website.The user can pursue the footprint of crumbs, upwards guides to resource so not dark gradually in the hierarchical tree of website with the current resource that they are just checked from them, finishes in the initial of website or inlet point Energy Resources Service.In some embodiments, the resource top that can stride resource is presented at crumbs under any title block or the title.Specific character (for example, greater-than sign "＞") can be used as the level separator.Crumbs can transmit about website level or they to the user who checks resource and take the information in the path of the current resource that they just check through website arrival.
In some embodiments, crumbs can represent that the user takes to arrive the path of current resource in the website.These crumbs can be called as the path crumbs, and are dynamic.In some embodiments, how navigating based on the user arrives resource through the resource on the website, and this resource can have different crumbs.For example; User on shopping website can navigate to the webpage that comprises the in men's style footwear of selected a pair of through the homepage from the website; It can select to buy the in men's style footwear of this pair of just selling by crumbs HOME (homepage)＞SHOES (footwear)＞MEN (man style)＞Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers (Smith & Jones SJ200 sport footwear) expression.In another example, the user can use different paths to arrive same webpage (for example, HOME＞SALES (sale)＞SHOES＞Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers) through the website level and select the in men's style footwear of identical a pair of.
In some embodiments, crumbs can be represented the position of resource in the website level.These crumbs can be called as the position crumbs, and are static.The position crumbs needn't illustrate the user and take the route that arrives resource through the website, but to the user illustrate they in the level of website where.For example; User on shopping website can navigate to the webpage that comprises the in men's style footwear of selected a pair of through the homepage from the website; It can be represented by crumbs HOME＞SHOES＞MEN＞Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers, select to buy the in men's style footwear of this pair of just selling.In another example, the user can travel through different paths and select the in men's style footwear of identical a pair of through the website level.User's shopping website that can navigate, initial at the HOME webpage, select the SALES webpage then, then select the SHOES webpage to arrive same webpage (Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers).Yet the crumbs that are associated with this webpage can be static (for example, HOME＞SALES＞SHOES＞Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers).
In some embodiments, webpage can be sorted in the bibliographic structure of website more than in the classification.For example, the webpage that Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers is shown can be positioned at HOME＞SHOES＞MEN place in the level of website, and also can in the level of website, be positioned at HOME＞SALES＞SHOES place.
In some embodiments, each crumbs can be a hyperlink of pointing to the resource in the website.The user can be through activating the hyperlink be associated with the crumbs previous resource in the level of navigating back.
In some embodiments, the hierarchical structure of resource can be parallel with the form of catalogue of the website that is associated.In some embodiments, the hierarchical structure of resource can comprise the one or more levels classification of resource on the website that is associated.As in the above example, shopping website will be classified into two classifications at the webpage of the Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers in the level of shopping website.For example, crumbs: HOME＞SHOES＞MEN can represent a classification, and crumbs: HOME＞SALES＞SHOES can represent another classification.
The Search Results augmentor
In some embodiments, Search Results 128 can comprise the text representation of the hierarchical tree that is associated with resource.For example, the hierarchical tree that on shopping website, comprises the webpage of in men's style footwear can be similar to crumbs (for example, www.shoeshoppingexample.com＞SHOES＞MEN).In some embodiments, Search Results 128 can comprise the diagrammatic representation of the hierarchical tree of resource, between separator (for example, arrow), uses graphical symbol to represent each position in the hierarchical tree.For example,
Can be used for representing the position (HOME＞SHOES＞MEN, wherein HOME be www.shoeshoppingexample.com) of Smith and Jones SJ200 sneakers webpage in the shopping website level.
In some embodiments; The expression of the hierarchical structure of resource can be noninteractive; Wherein the expression of each in the text of hierarchical structure and/or diagrammatic representation and structure element (for example; Crumbs or symbol) user is provided information; But do not allow user and (for example, website) basic structural element to carry out any mutual.
In some embodiments, the user can carry out with the expression of the hierarchical structure that is associated with resource alternately.For example, each element in the aforesaid crumbs type structure can represent to point to the hyperlink of the specific resources that is associated with the website, and it allows navigation when user and crumbs mutual (for example, clicking).In another example, aforesaid graphical symbol can be interactively, and can mutual at user and graphical symbol (for example, clicking) time, impels interactive menu structure (for example, the webpage on the website) to become visible.
