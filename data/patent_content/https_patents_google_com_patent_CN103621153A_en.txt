Description
Technical field
The disclosure relates in general to radio communication, and more particularly, relates in Wireless Telecom Equipment, managing transmitting power and transmitting for multigroup collection.
Background technology
For example, in component carrier and utilize carrier aggregation (, continuous carrier polymerization in the band of two or more carrier waves) in 3GPP LTE Rel-10 up link, specified the multigroup collection transmission based on OFDM, comprise physical uplink link sharing channel (PUSCH)+PUSCH, PUSCH+ physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) and SRS+SRS transmission simultaneously, wherein, can transmit by the single power amplifier (PA) in subscriber equipment (UE).In multigroup collection situation, meeting needs that in band outer (comprising stray radiation) and band, radiation requires, that the maximum power reduction (MPR) of up link (UL) transmitting power is become is essential.Recently, RAN4 admits MPR mask (mask) equation adopting in (endorse) TR36.807, wherein, mask is described to the piecewise linear curve as the function of allotment ratio, and it equals difference troop Resource Block (RB) allocated size of (cluster) and the summation of the ratio of the total UL bandwidth (BW) representing with the number of RB.
The framework for RAN4 proposing produces some problems.Between any two are trooped, exist high-powerly when unbalanced, resource is distributed and may be subject to (OOB/IB) radiation in outer/band or be subject to about having the restriction of the error vector magnitude of trooping (EVM) of lower transmitting power.Current solution in TR36.807 does not address this problem.For there is the unbalanced while PUSCH+PUCCH transmission of power spectral density (PSD) between PUSCH and PUCCH transmitting power, current TR36.807 planning probably allows high a lot of MPR than necessary MPR, and it will cause some losses of time good UE realization and UL spectrum efficiency.And, allotment ratio (A) but for the piecewise linear MPR equation that is independent of other parameters such as edge ratio (E), gap ratio (G), cause the oversize of MPR, it causes the problems referred to above again.
Observe out in addition, there is the unbalanced PUSCH+PUCCH of power and cause the lower requirement of keeping out of the way allowing than TR36.807 piecewise linearity mask to be kept out of the way.As a result, if utilized than existence poor efficiency in must keeping out of the way the UE realizations of keeping out of the way, UL spectrum efficiency is adversely affected more.Conventionally, use oversize (than being required to meet the more unfavorable of demand) that only piecewise linear function of a parameter (as in TR36.807) may cause the MPR of permission.For example, the Fig. 4 from [1] finds out, allotment ratio equals 0.1, according to the piecewise linearity parametrization of the MPR of single parameter A, causes MPR=6dB.

In LTE, the PUSCH transmitting power in UE subframe n is set to by following equation determined:
Wherein, P
pUSCH(n) be the PUSCH transmitting power in uplink sub-frames n, P
cMAX(n) be configured maximum transmission power, M
pUSCH(n) be the bandwidth of the PUSCH resource assignation in subframe n, P

tF(i) be that the power of the transformat of the uplink shared channel (UL-SCH) about being configured by higher level is controlled delta function, and f (i) be when power, control accumulate while being implemented for subframe n, when the power entry being reset due to accumulation while causing subframe n to be accidentally i subframe.
In above equation, i is that accumulation controls from transmitting power the number that (TPC) orders the subframe of the power excursion of deriving.Therefore, i=n – n

f(i)=f(i-1)+δ

Wherein, δ

Similarly, for the power of other physical uplink link channels transmission such as PUCCH, SRS, demodulated reference signal (DM-RS) etc., controlling can be by formulism, and similar equation can be write and transmits for PUCCH, SRS and DM-RS.
Between trooping, exist high-powerly when unbalanced, the MPR parametrization in TR36.807 causes the inconsistent application of keeping out of the way.Trooping can be at same component carrier (CC) (for example, one or more troop and with PUCCH corresponding one troop (there is a RB) corresponding with PUSCH) in or at a plurality of component carriers (for example, have carrying about the uplink control information of a CC or the PUSCH of UCIPUCCH and about in the PUSCH of identical and/or different CC may each component carrier of one in a PUSCH troop, transmit corresponding one with SRS in each component carrier (SRS+SRS) and troop) in.Power or PSD are unbalanced can be that the different resource allocated size of for example trooping for difference, different capacity are controlled target or the result of the antenna port of movable different numbers on difference is trooped.For example, consider to have allotment ratio a
1, a

3three situations of trooping (and as control the definite transmit power level p of equation by each power

Consider the example of two continuous UL carrier waves of polymerization, wherein PUSCH+PUCCH on a carrier wave and PUSCH on another carrier wave.Suppose, #1a troops
1=0.5 (PUSCH on carrier wave # 1,25 PRB divide be used in 10MHz), #2a troops
2=0.02 (PUCCH is on carrier wave # 1, and 1 PRB is for 10MHz), and the #3a that troops
3=0.1 (PUSCH is on carrier wave # 2, and 5 PRB are for 10MHz), obtains A=a
1+ a
2+ a
3=0.62.According to TR36.807, allow MPR=3.3dB.Under the limited case of minimum emissive power that is lowered to approaching-44dBm for 1 the power of trooping, although first to troop be movable, UE overall transmission power major part is included in troop # 2 and the #3 that troops.Under these circumstances, due to phase noise, IQ is unbalanced and the non-linear IB causing of PA and OOB signal are arranged by troop # 2 and the #3 that troops.From IB/OOB radiation viewpoint, its just look like UE only two troop on transmitting, thereby and desired MPR should be conventionally less.In the situation that only trooping #2 and trooping #3 activity, new total allocation ratio is A '=a2+a3=0.12, and TR36.807 equation allows MPR=6.1dB (>3.3dB), this can not be the correct order of only launching troop # 2 and the necessary power reduction of the #3 that troops limit.
Unbalanced LO and the frequency mixer (gain and phase place in IQ modulator are unbalanced) of deriving from of IQ.This causes image problem with DC skew (LO leakage) and PA together with non-linear.The expectation transmission that 10 PRB in the top edge of the BW of polymerization distribute causes the image on the downside of the BW of about 25dB in PSD.The in the situation that of single PA framework, if second troops, drop on the RB with first doubling of the image of trooping, IB image may cause the EVM increasing in the transmission of multigroup collection, again, the unbalanced UE of causing of any power between trooping can not meet and can be applied to the signal transmission quality requirement that each is trooped.Straightforward procedure can be to relax transmitting EVM to require (for BPSK/QPSK, be 17.5%, and be 12.5% for 16QAM), from UL demodulation viewpoint, its can or unacceptable.Alternatively, meet EVM require to make emitter assemblies (such as, PA, modulator, frequency mixer etc.) in more strict linear requirement necessitate, this has increased UE cost and/or current drain.This requires the linearity that causes reflector more by EVM and less by ACLR (adjacent channel leakage ratio rate) or OOB radiation requirement driving (drive).
A solution of the problems referred to above is to add through-put power size to MPR parametrization: MPR=f (A, E, B, G, W, { p
1, p
2..., p
n), wherein, { p
1, p
2..., p
nn through-put power of trooping of expression or the PSD that troops (that is, j the PSD trooping, PSD
j=p
j/ M
j, wherein, M
jthe number of the RB during j troops).Then, the expansion of power division can limit by the following provisions in specification: only have when the difference between minimum and maximum value meets as follows and above prescribe a time limit, just can apply the piecewise linearity MPR parametrization in TR36.807:
L
spread:=max{p
1, p
2..., p
n}-min{p
1, p
2..., p
n<=L
max-min(such as, L
max-minmake 10log10 (L
max-min) <=15dB).
Alternatively, different piecewise linearity masks can be applied to L
spreaddifferent range.For example,, if 0<=L
spread<=first threshold (for example, f1 (A) can be the identical piecewise linear function with appointment in TR36.807), MPR=f1 (A).If first threshold <L
spread<=Second Threshold (for example, f2 (A) is the 2nd MPR border), MPR=f2 (A); And for L
spread> Second Threshold, does not specify MPR requirement.If f2 (A) allows than larger the keeping out of the way of keeping out of the way being allowed by f1 (A), UE can solve high-power unbalancedly, and keep about having the transmission signal quality of trooping of lower transmitting power by reducing simply about having the through-put power of trooping of maximum transmission power.UE utilizes determined transmitting power to launch on trooping.
The alternative solution of problem is described in conjunction with the processing 330 shown in Fig. 3.310, Wireless Telecom Equipment (for example, DFT-S-OFDM UE) is identified at least two through-put powers of trooping, and wherein, each is trooped and comprises at least one Physical Resource Block (RB).In one embodiment, each is clustered on different carrier, and in another embodiment, all being clustered on common carrier.In LTE Rel-10 realizes, at least two in trooping one can be transmitted for PUCCH, and at least two another in trooping transmit for PUSCH.Alternatively, troop and all for PUSCH, transmit at least two.Alternatively, troop and all for SRS, transmit at least two.In other are realized, troop and can, for the transmission except PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS, such as demodulated reference signal (DM-RS), transmit.Trooping at least two can be on identical or different carrier wave, no matter be for PUCCH and PUSCH transmission, only PUSCH transmission, SRS and SRS transmit or certain or some other transmission.
In Fig. 3,320, Wireless Telecom Equipment determines that to be identified for the characteristic of at least two through-put powers of trooping poor.Through-put power characteristic can be that any other of total transmitting power, power spectral density (PSD) or through-put power can measurement aspect.330, if the poor power expansion threshold value that surpasses of characteristic, the transmitting power that at least one is trooped is distributed in Wireless Telecom Equipment change.Conventionally, distributing to each power of trooping is the function of the path loss between Wireless Telecom Equipment and serving BS.
In one case, if the difference of power characteristic surpasses threshold value, the transmitting power that at least one is trooped is distributed in Wireless Telecom Equipment reduction.Distributing at least one transmitting power of trooping can be lowered, and obeys following expression:
Wherein
In another case, if the difference of power characteristic surpasses threshold value, the transmitting power that at least one is trooped is distributed in wireless communication system increase.Distributing at least one transmitting power of trooping can increase, and obeys following formula:
Wherein,
it is the linear value of distributing to the power of j PUSCH channel in subframe i;
In LTE Rel-10, according to standard TS 36.213 versions a.1.0, PUSCH through-put power can be with respect to
Weight w
c(i) at this, be the function of subframe index i.Standard is allowed for the w of special services community
c(i) value is zero.But, there is non-zero scale factor w
c(i) all Serving cells have same zoom factor w
c(i)=w (i).
In with upper inequality,
If UE has band relevant for the PUSCH transmission of the UCI of community j with without the PUSCH that remains the UCI in community, and total transmitting power of UE surpasses
Wherein,
for the PUSCH transmitting power with UCI community, and w
c(i) be for the Serving cell without UCI
Consider the simple scenario of PUSCH+PUCCH.If found
For PUSCH (non-UCI)+PUSCH (non-UCI) with without PUCCH, the transmitting power that convergent-divergent is trooped about two PUSCH again, makes the PSD between trooping poor lower than threshold value P
spread,
Wherein,
Thereby, utilize solution B, if the power between trooping/PSD is the poor threshold value P that is greater than
spread, allow UE zoom power again, so that the difference power between trooping is lower than threshold value P
spread.Due to priority, cause not changing with the PUCCH of UCI and the power of PUSCH.If can not meet difference power condition, UE can be zero by the power setting of some PUSCH without UCI.
Observe out in addition, in the middle of trooping, there is the unbalanced PUSCH+PUCCH of power and cause the lower requirement of keeping out of the way allowing than the TR36.807 piecewise linearity mask by proposed to be kept out of the way.As a result, if utilized than existence poor efficiency in must keeping out of the way the UE realization of more keeping out of the way, up link spectrum efficiency is adversely affected.
The solution of problem 3
A solution of above problem 3 is described in conjunction with the processing 400 shown in Fig. 4.410, Wireless Telecom Equipment (for example, DFT-S-OFDM UE) is identified for the poor of at least two power characteristics of trooping, and wherein, each is trooped and comprises at least one Physical Resource Block (RB).Power characteristic can be that any other of total transmitting power, power spectral density (PSD) or through-put power can measurement aspect.
In one embodiment, each is clustered on different carrier, and in another embodiment, all trooping all on common carrier.In LTE Rel-10 realizes, at least two in trooping one are for PUCCH transmission, and at least two another in trooping transmit for PUSCH.Alternatively, troop and all for PUSCH, transmit at least two.Alternatively, troop and all for SRS, transmit at least two.In other are realized, troop and can, for the transmission except PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS, such as demodulated reference signal (DM-RS), transmit.Trooping at least two can be on identical or different carrier wave, no matter for PUCCH with PUSCH transmission, only PUSCH transmission, SRS and SRS transmit or certain or some other transmission.
In Fig. 4,420, Wireless Telecom Equipment determines that by the maximum power that depends on power attributes, reducing the power that (MPR) limit defines reduces, and wherein, power attributes is poor at least two power characteristics of trooping.In one embodiment, MPR limit is based on piecewise linear function.Such function is based on for being proposed for recently the MPR formula of UE multigroup collection transmission of the band intercarrier polymerization (TR36.307) of RAN4 described below.
For PUSCH+PUCCH, conventionally with the higher power emission PUCCH that troops of the PUSCH than probably needing the MPR less than the MPR by 36.307 formula appointments, troop.MPR mask can be modified the situation for PUSCH+PUCCH:
MPR=7.2-α
1(ΔPSD)，0<A≤0.05
=8-α
2(ΔPSD)-16A，0.05<A≤0.25
=4.83-α
3(ΔPSD)-3.33A，0.25<A≤0.4
=3.83-α
4(ΔPSD)-0.83A,0.4<A≤1
Wherein, α
j> 0, and Δ PSD=PUSCH and the PUCCH poor maximum of PSD of trooping.If Δ PSD=0, this formula becomes identical with TR36.807 formula.
IB/OOB radiation level be probably described to more exactly about troop rather than about PSD (due to about signal the dependence from the IB/OOB of convolution component) the function of difference of through-put power.If this situation, replacement scheme is that MPR mask is expressed as to the poor function of absolute transmission power:
MPR=7.2-α
1ΔP,0<A≤0.05
=8-α
2ΔP-16A，0.05<A≤0.25
=4.83-α
3ΔP-3.33A,0.25<A≤0.4
=3.83-α
4ΔP-0.83A,0.4<A≤1
Wherein, α
j> 0, and Δ P is any two poor maximums of through-put power between trooping.Again for equal power situation, Δ P=0, and we give TR36.807 formula for change.
More generally, MPR=g (Δ P, A) can be for summarizing this dependence.Accurate relation between MPR and Δ PSD or Δ P is not also established.But by Taylor series approximation, MPR can be expressed as the linear or even piecewise linear function of Δ PSD or Δ P.Higher order polynomial item (for example, secondary equation or three equatioies) can be for improvement of fitting precision.
In one embodiment, based on following equation, calculate MPR limit:
MPR=α

In Fig. 4,430, Wireless Telecom Equipment reduces and determines P based on power
cMAX.P
cMAXcan be for determining the one or more power measurement by Wireless Telecom Equipment or serving BS or both uses.Can reduce definite exemplary power tolerance from power and include but not limited to up link (UL) transmitting power and power headroom (PH).Wireless Telecom Equipment reduces some these and other power measurement of determining to serving BS report from power conventionally.For example, LTE UE reports the power headroom in power headroom reporting (PHR) (PHR) to service eNB.
Embodiment 3; Problem 4
Conventionally, only use the piecewise linear function of a parameter (as in TR36.807) may cause allowing that MPR's is oversize.For example, according to Fig. 5, for the total allocation ratio that equals 0.1, according to the piecewise linearity parametrization of the MPR of single parameter A, cause MPR=6dB.But clearly, MPR=6dB is the upper limit, and there are a large amount of multigroup collection combinations that do not require that 6dB keeps out of the way.In Fig. 4, illustrate the MPR mask of TR36.807, can find out, the MPR of permission can surpass that desired to keep out of the way 7dB so much, and for little distribution, the MPR of permission surpasses the desired 2-3dB that keeps out of the way conventionally.The MPR that permission is larger than necessary MPR may cause the inferior realization of keeping out of the way greatly of applying goodly, thereby reduces UL spectrum efficiency.Fig. 5 illustrates and requires better rule for little distribution (that is, A<0.5).

In one embodiment, at least two characteristics of trooping are selected from and comprise following group: at least two sizes of trooping; At least two spectrum distances between trooping from; At least two outermosts of trooping are trooped to the distance at the edge of the carrier wave of trooping for each outermost; Full span at least two frequency domains of trooping; The poor absolute value of size between the trooping of the leftmost edge of configured UL bandwidth and rightmost edges place; Or poor at least two power characteristics of trooping.In another embodiment, the first attribute and the second attribute include one or more following characteristics: at least two sizes of trooping; At least two spectrum distances between trooping from; The distance of trooping between the edge of the carrier wave of trooping at least two; Full span at least two frequency domains of trooping; The size of trooping and having between the trooping of minimal size with largest amount is poor; Be used for the poor of at least two power characteristics of trooping.
In Fig. 6,620, Wireless Telecom Equipment is defined as the first power reduction value the function of the first attribute, and 630, equipment is defined as the second power reduction value the function of the second attribute.640, Wireless Telecom Equipment is worth and determines that maximum power reduces (MPR) limit based on the first power reduction value and the second power reduction.In one embodiment, make MPR limit equal the junior in the first power reduction value and the second power reduction value definite the comprising of MPR limit.In Fig. 6,650, Wireless Telecom Equipment determines that the power being defined by MPR limit reduces.
