Definitions
- the invention pertains generally to methods for digital data compression.
- the invention relates to fast optimal interpolation methods for sound, image and video data compression.
- Image and sound may in general be transmitted, stored and displayed using multi-dimensional arrays of digital data, most often pertaining to sound (time domain), still images (2-dimensional spatial domain) or video (3-dimensional space-time domain).
- Digital representations of images which in general include sound and image sequences, require substantial amounts of digital storage capacity or large transmission bandwidths.
- the goal of digital image coding is primarily to reduce this data volume, while at the same time retaining a faithful duplicate of the original image. Compression methods for image data are based on redundancies in data and on the non-linearities of human perception (e.g., vision and hearing).
- still images spatial correlation is usually exploited, while for video, correlation in time and space are utilized. Because of its practical significance, digital image coding is an active area of research and development both academically and in industry.

- decimation or subsampling can be performed at the outset, reducing the number of samples in subsequent processing.
- the data should be filtered in conjunction with subsampling to reduce aliasing upon reconstruction.
- This decimation filtering is low pass in nature. It reduces the potential aliasing effect associated with resampling, but it also reduces the resolution of the original image.
- these compressed data are interpolated by a corresponding inverse process to form the final image, for example, by a 1st-order bi-linear interpolation. Combining the effect of low pass filtering, decimation and interpolation, the resolution of the resulting image is reduced.
- a way of retaining the initial resolution is to add back the difference, or residue, to the reconstructed image; however, the residue derived by simply subtracting the reconstructed image from the original is generally quite large, hence limiting the resulting data compression.
- One objective of the present invention is to provide an optimal filter for decimation/interpolation of digital data which produces a minimal amount of residual error when comparing the reconstructed data to the original data set.
- Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple, efficient method for substantially minimizing the residual image associated with a digital data subsampling process.
- one aspect of the present invention comprises a method of compressing and reconstructing digital data which includes applying spline filters to the original digital data to generate compressed digital data.
- An optimizing process utilizes a predetermined error criterion to generate substantially optimal compressed digital data.
- a preferred error criterion is, for example, a least-mean-squares constraint.
- the method further entails interpolating the substantially optimal compressed digital data to generate a reconstructed representation of the original digital data.
- an optimal method for compressing digital data comprises applying spline filters to the digital data to generate compressed digital data.
- the compressed digital data is optimized by applying a predetermined error criterion to generate substantially optimal compressed digital data.
- a predetermined error criterion preferably incorporates the influence of the spline filter on the original digital data.
- a method of approximating an array of digital data comprises periodically subsampling the array of digital data using a set of sampled continuous functions.
- the subsampling process generates an approximation of the original digital data comprising a weighted combination of the sampled continuous functions.
- the weighted combination of sampled continuous functions is optimized by a predetermined error criterion, preferably a least-mean-squares criterion.
- a further aspect of the present invention comprises a method of optimizing an N-dimensional array of periodically subsampled digital data.
- the method comprises estimating a correlation tensor which characterizes a subsampling process, and estimating the inverse of the correlation tensor.
- the periodically subsampled N-dimensional array of digital data is optimized by a convolution process involving the estimated inverse of the correlation tensor.

- a novel optimal decimation/interpolation method is disclosed for multi-dimensional image data coding.
- the principle of operation derives from a least-mean-square error (LMS)-error spline approach, which is extendable to N dimensions.
- LMS least-mean-square error
- One- and two-dimensional image data compression utilizing linear and planar splines, respectively, are shown to have compact, closed-form optimal solutions for convenient, effective compression.
- the computational efficiency of this new method is of special interest, because the compression/reconstruction algorithms proposed herein involve only the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and inverse FFT types of processors or other high-speed direct convolution algorithms.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- inverse FFT inverse FFT types of processors or other high-speed direct convolution algorithms.
- the compression and reconstruction from the compressed image can be extremely fast and realized in existing hardware and software. Even with this high computational efficiency, good image quality is obtained upon reconstruction.
- An important and practical consequence of the disclosed method is the convenience and versatility with
- the basic process of digital image coding entails transforming a source image X into a "compressed" image Y such that the signal energy of Y is concentrated into fewer elements than the signal energy of X, with some provisions regarding error.
- G and G' are not necessarily processes of mutual inversion, and the processes may not conserve the full information content of image data X. Consequently, X' will, in general, differ from X, and information is lost through the coding/reconstruction process.
- X and X' are sufficiently close, so that the residue ⁇ X 1012 is small and may be transmitted, stored along with the compressed data Y', or discarded.
- a decimating or subsampling process may be performed to reduce the number of samples.
- Decimation is commonly characterized by a reduction factor ⁇ (tau), which indicates a measure of image data elements to compressed data elements.
- ⁇ ⁇
- image data X must be filtered in conjunction with decimation to avoid aliasing.
- a low-pass input filter may take the form of a pointwise convolution of image data X with a suitable convolution filter 1014, preferably implemented using a matrix filter kernel.
- a decimation process 1016 then produces compressed data Y', which is substantially free of aliasing prior to subsequent process steps.
- the convolution or decimation filter 1014 attenuates aliasing effects, it does so by reducing the number of bits required to represent the signal. It is "low-pass" in nature, reducing the information content of the reconstructed image X'. Consequently, the residue ⁇ X 1012 will be larger, and in part, will offset the compression attained through decimation.
- the present invention disclosed herein solves this problem by providing a method of optimizing the compressed data such that the mean-square-residue ⁇ X 2 >is minimized, where " ⁇ >" shall herein denote an averaging process.
- compressed data Y' generated in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 2, is further processed by an optimization process 1018.
- the disclosed method of filter optimization "matches" the filter response to the image data, thereby minimizing the residue. Since the decimation filter 1014 is low-pass in nature, the optimization process 1018, in part, compensates by effectively acting as a "self-tuned" high-pass filter.
- the input decimation filter 1014 of FIG. 3 may be regarded as a projection of an image data vector X onto a set of basis functions that constitute shifted, but overlapping, spline functions ⁇ k (X) ⁇ such that ##EQU1## where X' is the reconstructed image vector and X k is the decomposition weight.
- the image data vector X is thus approximated by an array of preferably computationally simple, continuous functions, such as lines or planes, allowing also an efficient reconstruction of the original image.
- the basis functions need not be orthogonal and are preferably chosen to overlap in order to provide a continuous approximation to image data, thereby rendering a non-diagonal basis correlation matrix:
- the decomposition on projection of X onto components of S' is not unique and may be accomplished in a number of ways.
- a preferable criterion set forth in the present description is a least-mean-square (LMS) error, which minimizes the overall difference between the source image X and the reconstructed image X'.
- LMS least-mean-square
- the residual image ⁇ X can be thought of as a minimal vector in the sense that it is the shortest possible vector connecting X to X'.
- ⁇ X might, for instance, be orthogonal to the subspace S', as shown in FIG. 4.
- the projection of image vector X onto S' is approximated by an expression of the form: ##EQU2##
- the optimal weights X k are determined by the inverse operation A -1 :
- the inverse operation A -1 is equivalent to a so-called inverse eigenfilter when taken over to the conjugate image domain.
- DFT is the familiar discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
- ⁇ m are the eigenvalues of A.
- the equivalent optimization block 1018 shown in FIG. 5, comprises three steps: (1) a discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) 1020; (2) inverse eigenfiltering 1022; and (3) an inverse discrete Fourier transformation (DFT -1 ) 1024.
- DFT discrete Fourier transformation
- DFT -1 inverse discrete Fourier transformation
- Section II where also the presently contemplated preferred embodiments are derived as closed form solutions for a one-dimensional linear spline basis and two-dimensional planar spline bases.
- Section III provides an operational description for the preferred method of compression and reconstruction utilizing the optimal procedure disclosed in Section II.
- Section IV discloses results of a reduction to practice of the preferred embodiments applied to one- and two-dimensional images.
- Section V discloses a preferred method of the filter optimizing process implemented in the image domain.
- bi-linear spline functions are combined to approximate the image data with a resultant linear interpolation, as shown in FIG. 6.
- the resultant closed-form approximating and optimizing process has a significant advantage in computational simplicity and speed.
- One object of the present embodiment is to approximate X(t) by the n-point sum: ##EQU6## in a least-mean-squares fashion where X 0 , . . . ,X n-1 are n reconstruction weights. Observe that the two-point sum in the interval 0 ⁇ t ⁇ is: ##EQU7## Hence, S(t) 1030 in Equation 4 represents a linear interpolation of the original waveform X(t) 1002, as shown in FIG. 6.
- Equation 12 The Y j 's in Equation 12 represent the compressed data to be transmitted or stored. Note that this encoding scheme involves n correlation operations on only ⁇ -1 points.
- Equation 9 Since F(t) is assumed to be periodic with period n ⁇ , the matrix form of A jk in Equation 9 can be reduced by substitution Equation 3 into Equation 9 to obtain: ##EQU14## By Equation 13, A jk can be expressed also in circulant form in the following manner:
- periodic boundary conditions imposed on the data lie outside the window of observation and may be defined in a variety of ways. Nevertheless, periodic boundary conditions serve to simplify the process implementation by insuring that the correlation matrix A jk ! has a calculable inverse. Thus, the optimization process involves an inversion of A jk ! of which the periodic boundary conditions and consequent circulant character play a preferred role. It is also recognized that for certain spline functions, symmetry rendered in the correlation matrix allows inversion in the absence of periodic image boundary conditions.
- X(t 1 ,t 2 ) is a doubly periodic array of image data (e.g., still image) of periods n 1 ⁇ and n 2 ⁇ , with respect to the integer variables t 1 and t 2 where ⁇ is a multiple of both t 1 and t 2 .
- the actual image 1002 to be compressed can be viewed as being repeated periodically throughout the plane as shown in the FIG. 7.
- Each subimage of the extended picture is separated by a border 1032 (or gutter) of zero intensity of width ⁇ . This border is one of several possible preferred "boundary conditions" to achieve a doubly-periodic image.
- the tensor transform in Equation 21 is treated in a similar fashion to obtain ##EQU21##
- ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ depend on ⁇ , and the shape and orientation of the hexagonal tent with respect to the image domain, where for example m 1 and m 2 represent row and column indices.
- m 1 and m 2 represent row and column indices.
- a j1j2k1k2 can be expressed in circulant form by the following expression:
- the objective is to apply the above-disclosed LMS error linear spline interpolation techniques to image sequence coding, it is advantageous to utilize the tensor formalism during the course of the analysis in order to readily solve the linear systems in equations 8 and 20.
- the tensor summation convention is used in the analysis for one and two dimensions. It will be appreciated that such convention may readily apply to the general case of N dimensions.
- a rs is a linear transformation
- Y r ,X s are 1st-order tensors.
- a linear transformation of a second order tensor is written as:
- ⁇ lj is the Kronecker delta function and * represents complex conjugation.
- DFT denotes the discrete Fourier Transform
- DFT -1 denotes its inverse discrete Fourier Transform
- a linear transformation of a 1st-order tensor can be represented by a matrix.
- a rs in matrix form. If A rs is a circulant transformation, then A is also a circulant matrix. From matrix theory it is known that every circulant matrix is "similar" to a DFT matrix. If Q denotes the DFT matrix of dimension (n ⁇ n), and Q t the complex conjugate of the DFT matrix, and ⁇ is defined to be the eigenmatrix of A, then:
- the following table exemplifies the relevant parameters for implementing the hexagonal tent functions:
- FIG. 10 A block diagram of the compression/reconstruction scheme is shown in FIG. 10.
- the signal source 1002 which can have dimension up to N, is first passed through a low-pass filter (LPF).
- LPF low-pass filter
- This low-pass filter is implemented by convolving (in a process block 1014) a chosen spline filter 1013 with the input source 1002.
- the normalized frequency response 1046 of a one-dimensional linear spline is shown in FIG. 11.
- a subsampling procedure is used to reduce the signal size 1016 by a factor ⁇ .
- the information contained in the subsampled source is not optimized in the least-mean-square sense. Thus, an optimization procedure is needed to obtain the best reconstruction weights.
- the optimization process can be divided into three consecutive parts.
- a DFT 1020 maps the non-optimized weights into the image conjugate domain.
- an inverse eigenfilter process 1022 optimizes the compressed data.
- the frequency response plots for some typical eigenfilters and inverse eigenfilters are shown in FIGS. 12 and 13.
- a DFT -1 process block 1024 maps its input back to the original image domain.
- reconstruction can proceed. The reconstruction can be viewed as oversampling followed by a reconstruction low-pass filter.
- the embodiment of the optimized spline filter described above may employ a DFT and DFT -1 type transform processes.
- DFT digital image processing
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- FFT -1 processes, which substantially reduce computation overhead associated with conjugate transform operations.
- such an improvement is given by the ratio of computation steps required to transform a set of N elements: ##EQU32## which improves with the size of the image.
- the coding method is specified in the following steps:
- ⁇ an integer
- the compression ratio is ⁇ 2 for two-dimensional images.
- Equation 23 is applied to find Y j1 ,j2 which is the compressed data to be transmitted or stored: ##EQU33## B.
- step 1 The results of step 1 are divided by the eigenvalues ⁇ (l,m) set forth below.
- the eigenvalues ⁇ (l,m) are found by extending Equation 48 to the two-dimensional case to obtain:
- ⁇ 1 is the n 1 -th root of unity and ⁇ 2 is the n 2 -th root of unity.
- step 3 The FFT of the results from step 2 is then taken. After computing the FFT, X k .sbsb.1 k .sbsb.2 (the optimized weights) are obtained.
- the recovered or reconstructed image is: ##EQU34## 5.
- the residue is computed and retained with the optimized weights:
- the optimizing procedure outlined above appears to be associated with an image reconstruction process, it may be implemented at any stage between the aforementioned compression and reconstruction. It is preferable to implement the optimizing process immediately after the initial compression so as to minimize the residual image.
- the preferred order has an advantage with regard to storage, transmission and the incorporation of subsequent image processes.
- ⁇ (i,j) can be considered as an estimation of the frequency response of the combined decimation and interpolation filters.
- the optimization process H(i,j) attempts to "undo" what is done in the combined decimation/interpolation process. Thus, H(i,j) tends to restore the original signal bandwidth.
- a first test is a cosine signal which is useful for observing the relationship between the standard error, the size of ⁇ and the signal frequency.
- the standard error is defined herein to be the square root of the average error: ##EQU38##
- a second one-dimensional signal is taken from one line of a grey-scale still image, which is considered to be realistic data for practical image compression.
- FIG. 14 shows the plots of standard error versus frequency of the cosine signal for different degrees of decimation ⁇ 1056.
- the general trend is that as the input signal frequency becomes higher, the standard error increases. In the low frequency range, smaller values of ⁇ yield a better performance.
- the linear spline and the cosine signal at discrete grid points can match perfectly so that the standard error is substantially equal to 0.
- FIG. 15b presents the error plot 1062 for this particular test example. It will be appreciated that the non-linear error accumulation versus decimation parameter ⁇ may be exploited to minimize the combination of optimized weights and image residue.
- the reconstructed image 1066, 1072 is substantially similar to the original.
- substantially complete reconstruction is achieved by retaining the minimized residue ⁇ X and adding it back to the approximated image.
- FIG. 18 shows the error plots as functions of ⁇ for both images.
- Video compression is a major component of high-definition television (HDTV).
- HDTV high-definition television
- video compression is formulated as an equivalent three-dimensional approximation problem, and is amenable to the technique of optimum linear or more generally by hyperplanar spline interpolation.
- the main advantages of this approach are seen in its fast speed in coding/reconstruction, its suitability in a VLSI hardware implementation, and a variable compression ratio.
- a principal advantage of the present invention is the versatility with which it is incorporated into other compression systems.
- the invention can serve as a "frontend" compression platform from which other signal processes are applied.
- the invention can be applied iteratively, in multiple dimensions and in either the image or image conjugate domain.
- the optimizing method can for example apply to a compressed image and further applied to a corresponding compressed residual image. Due to the inherent low-pass filtering nature of the interpolation process, some edges and other high-frequency features may not be preserved in the reconstructed images, but which are retained through the residue. To address this problem, the following procedures are set forth:
- FIG. 20 illustrates such an adaptive scheme.
- the whole image can be divided into subimages of smaller size 1084. Since different subimages have different local features and statistics, different compression schemes can be applied to these different subimages.
- An error criterion is evaluated in a process step 1086. If the error is below a certain threshold determined in a process step 1088, a higher compression ratio is chosen for that subimage. If the error goes above this threshold, then a lower compression ratio is chosen in a step 1092 for that subimage.
- Both multi-kernel functions 1090 and multi-local-compression ratios provide good adaptive modification.
- Subband coding techniques have been widely used in digital speech coding. Recently, subband coding is also applied to digital image data compression.
- the basic approach of subband coding is to split the signal into a set of frequency bands, and then to compress each subband with an efficient compression algorithm which matches the statistics of that band.
- the subband coding techniques divide the whole frequency band into smaller frequency subbands. Then, when these subbands are demodulated into the baseband, the resulting equivalent bandwidths are greatly reduced. Since the subbands have only low frequency components, one can use the above described, linear or planar spline, data compression technique for coding these data.
- a 16-band filter compression system is shown in FIG. 21, and the corresponding reconstruction system in FIG. 22. There are, of course, many ways to implement this filter bank, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, a common method is to exploit the Quadrature Mirror Filter structure.
- the embodiments described earlier utilize a spline filter optimization process in the image conjugate domain using an FFT processor or equivalent thereof.
- the present invention also provides an equivalent image domain implementation of a spline filter optimization process which presents distinct advantages with regard to speed, memory and process application.
- the optimization process may be completely carried over to an image domain implementation knowing only the form of the input spline filter function.
- the transform processes can be performed in advance to generate the image domain equivalent of the inverse eigenfilter.
- the image domain spline optimizer ⁇ operates on compressed image data Y' generated by a first convolution process 1014 followed by a decimation process 1016, as previously described.
- the tensor transformation A (as shown for example in Equation 25 above) is supplied to an FFT type processor 1032, which computes the transformation eigenvalues ⁇ .
- the tensor of eigenvalues is then inverted at process block 1034, followed by FFT -1 process block 1036, generating the image domain tensor ⁇ .
- the tensor ⁇ is supplied to a second convolution process 1038, whereupon ⁇ is convolved with the non-optimized compressed image data Y' to yield optimized compressed image data Y".
- ⁇ should be of sufficient size for adequate approximation of: ##EQU40##
- ⁇ should be small enough to be computationally tractable for the online convolution process 1038. It has been found that two-dimensional image compression using the preferred hexagonal tent spline is adequately optimized by a 5 ⁇ 5 matrix, and preferably a 7 ⁇ 7 matrix, for example, with the following form: ##EQU41## Additionally, to reduce computational overhead, the smallest elements (i.e., the elements near the perimeter) such as f, g, and h may be set to zero with little noticeable effect in the reconstruction.
