Definitions
- the invention disclosed herein generally relates to internet-based services, and it more particularly relates to providing internet-based services according to a potential geographic location of a user.
- the Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks serving billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of different networks of local and global scope (e.g., including private, public, academic, business, and government networks), which are linked by a broad array of electronic networking technologies including wired (e.g., copper cable, fiber optic, etc.) and wireless (e.g., radio-frequency, optical, etc.) technologies, using the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP).
- TCP/IP Internet Protocol Suite
- Data transmitted (e.g., carried) over the Internet relates to a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents (e.g., web pages) of the World Wide Web (WWW).
- Services available on the Internet (or connected to the Internet) to provide or process information are referred to herein as “internet-based services,” and human beings interacting with or otherwise using internet-based services are referred to herein as “users.”
- internet-based services may relate to the physical world of users, including, for example, internet-search services (e.g., provided by search engines), social-networking services (e.g., provided by social networks), electronic-commerce services (e.g., provided by online retailers), publishing services (e.g., provided by online publishers), electronic mail services, and so on.
- internet-search services e.g., provided by search engines
- social-networking services e.g., provided by social networks
- electronic-commerce services e.g., provided by online retailers
- publishing services e.g., provided by online publishers
- electronic mail services e.g., electronic mail services, and so on.
- internet-search services may relate to the physical world of users, for example, is that users may intend to interact with resources in the physical world relating to the results of internet search (e.g., a user may desire to visit restaurants that appear in the search results for an internet search directed to “restaurants”).
- Some internet-based services provided with specific relevance to a geographic location can be said to be “targeted” on a particular geographic location (a “targeted geographic location”).
- a targeted geographic location that is the likely geographic location of a user.
- providers of internet-based services can be informed of the geographic location of a user by receiving an unambiguous indication of the user's geographic location.
- a subscriber to an internet-based service can create a profile for the internet-based service, which can specify the user's geographic location in various degrees of detail (e.g., time zone, country, state/province, county, city, postal code, dialing code, etc.).
- a subscriber to an internet-based service may create a profile indicating that the subscriber is in Palo Alto, Calif.; and the internet-based service provider deliver advertisements to the subscriber targeting the Palo Alto, Calif. market.
- Many providers of internet-based services do not or cannot always receive such an unambiguous indication of the user's geographic location. As a result, internet-based services may be not targeted, or internet-based services may be mistakenly targeted.
- So-called geolocation services are known to estimate or ascertain one or more geographic location of a computer device (e.g., a time zone, country, state/province, county, city, postal code, dialing code, etc.).
- So-called IP-geolocation services are known to do the same based on an internet address (e.g., an IP address) of the computing device. For example, a user accessing the internet from a computer on a university computer network in Palo Alto, Calif.
- IP address relating to the geographic locations “Palo Alto” [city] or “94305” [postal code]; and search services targeted on either of those geographic locations may to yield search results related to (e.g., located in or near) the city of Palo Alto or, more particularly, the postal code 94305.
- IP-geolocation services can relate to more than one geographic location, some of which may be geographically remote (e.g., San Francisco, Calif. and Los Angeles, Calif.) or geographically broad (e.g., California).
- Conventional geolocation services relating an internet address to more than one geographic location can provide confidence levels associated therewith.
- IP-geolocation services may return a plurality of “candidate geographic locations,” and a confidence level for each, e.g., a plurality of candidate geographic location confidence levels or, simply, “candidate confidence levels.”
- candidate confidence levels can reflect probability values that a user (who is associated with an internet address) is physically located in or near a particular candidate geographic location.
- a candidate confidence level for a particular candidate geographic location can reflect a relative probability that the user is physically located in or near the particular candidate geographic location, over all other candidate geographic locations of the plurality of candidate geographic locations.
- internet-based services have been targeted on a candidate geographic location that is most likely (e.g., according to a relative probability) to be that which the user is located in or near (“probabilistic locality”).
- a probabilistic locality may be disadvantageously remote (e.g., in distance, time, cost, etc.) from the actual positional location of the user.
- a probabilistic locality may have a disadvantageously coarse resolution (e.g., at the state or country level rather than the city level), including geographic locations that are physically remote from the positional location of the user.
- Such disadvantages may be acute, for example, when several candidate geographic locations having lower candidate confidence levels are physically proximate (e.g., Palo Alto, Calif. at %30 and Mountain View, Calif.
- a more remote candidate geographic location has a higher candidate confidence level (e.g., San Francisco, Calif. at %40). For example, if the positional location of the user is at or near Palo Alto or Mountain View (which are more proximate to each other than either is to San Francisco), internet-based services targeted on either Palo Alto or Mountain view may be more useful to the user than internet-based services targeted on San Francisco.
- Palo Alto or Mountain View which are more proximate to each other than either is to San Francisco
- internet-based services targeted on either Palo Alto or Mountain view may be more useful to the user than internet-based services targeted on San Francisco.
- internet-based services can be enhanced by targeting a geographic location that is most likely to be useful to the user (which can be referred to as the “utility” of the targeted geographic location).
- utility can be estimated to decrease according to an increase in distance between the targeted geographic location and the positional location of the user. That is, in the above example, search results targeted on geographic locations that are more remote from the positional location of the user may be less useful (i.e., producing a lower utility for the targeted location) than search results targeted on a geographic location that is more proximate to the positional location of the user.
- factors other than remoteness can affect the utility of a targeted geographic location, such as factors relating to the positional location of a user, factors relating to a targeted geographic location, or factors relating to both the positional location of the user and the targeted geographic location.
- each of the candidate geographic locations can serve as a proxy for a probabilistic positional location of the user according to the corresponding candidate confidence level (“a probabilistic user location”). Therefore, a probabilistic utility score can be determined for a particular geographic location with respect to the user being assumed to be at one of the probabilistic user locations. Also, therefore, an aggregate probabilistic utility score can be determined for a particular geographic location with respect to all of the probabilistic user locations (e.g., recognizing that the user is probabilistically located among the probabilistic user locations according to the candidate confidence levels).
- Embodiments of the present invention include systems, methods, and computer readable media to identify a targeted geographic location according to the aggregate probabilistic utility score for the targeted geographic location.
- the targeted geographic location can be used, for example, for targeting internet-based services.
- Internet-based services can include, for example, internes search services, internet advertisement presentation services, e-commerce services, internet usage logging and reporting services, social networking services, electronic media publishing services, etc.
- Targeting internet search services, for example, on a targeted geographic location can include obtaining or providing search results most relevant to the targeted geographic location.
- Targeting internet advertisement presentation services on a targeted geographic location can include, for example, obtaining or presenting advertisements most relevant to the targeted geographic location.
- the targeted geographic location can be selected from the plurality of candidate geographic locations. Such embodiments may provide for the calculation of an aggregate probabilistic utility score for each of the plurality of candidate geographic locations based upon a plurality of individual probabilistic utility scores for each respective candidate geographic location (e.g., as a hypothetical targeted geographic location). In further embodiments, the targeted geographic location can be selected from any geographic location, including non-candidate geographic locations. Such embodiments may provide for the calculation of an aggregate probabilistic utility score for that geographic location based upon a plurality of individual probabilistic utility scores for that geographic location.
- An individual probabilistic utility score for any geographic location also corresponds to a probabilistic user location (e.g., any of the candidate geographic locations).
- a probabilistic user location e.g., any of the candidate geographic locations.
- one individual probabilistic utility score for a hypothetical targeted geographic location “A” can correspond to the probabilistic user location “B”; and another individual probabilistic utility score for the targeted geographic location “A” can correspond to the probabilistic user location “C.”
- an individual probabilistic utility score for a hypothetical targeted geographic location “A” can correspond to the probabilistic user location “A”—which reflects that a targeted geographic location and a probabilistic user location, in some circumstances, can be the same geographic location.
- determining the individual probabilistic utility score for a geographic location includes factoring in the candidate confidence level for the corresponding probabilistic user location. In some embodiments, determining the individual probabilistic utility score for a geographic location includes factoring in one or more utility factors for the geographic location. In some embodiments, a utility factor for the geographic location can also correspond to the probabilistic user location.
- a route between or among geographic locations can provide a framework for measuring remoteness, e.g., according to burdens that may be encountered in travelling along a route.
- a utility factor corresponding to a probabilistic user location can be related to parameters indicative of a route between the targeted geographic location and a probabilistic user location. Such parameters can include any parameter being indicative of a burden associated with travel on the route between the targeted geographic location and the probabilistic user location (a “route-burden parameter”).
- the route-burden parameter can be indicative of a driving distance, a transit distance, a walking distance, a driving time, a transit time, a walking time, a driving cost, a transit cost, a walking cost, etc.
- route-burden parameters include, for example, traffic conditions, weather conditions, transit timetables, and taxi fares.
- a utility factor as specifically described above e.g., a route-utility factor
- a route-utility factor can be determined responsive to a route-burden parameter as is described further herein.
- a route-utility factor for example, may reflect that the utility of targeting internet-based services tends to decrease as the burdens of transportation between the probabilistic user location and the targeted geographic location increases.
- utility factors unrelated to remoteness can be provided.
- a utility factor unrelated to remoteness but corresponding to a probabilistic user location can be related to parameters indicative of the relative favorability of comparable qualities of both the targeted geographic location and the probabilistic user location (a “trip-utility parameter”).
- Such parameters can include, for example, data indicative of: a nation, a language, demographics, historical patterns of activity between or among geographic locations, attractions, activities or amenities, editorial content, etc.
- a utility factor as specifically described above e.g., a trip-utility factor
- a trip-utility factor for example, may reflect that the utility of targeting internet-based services tends to increase when certain qualities of the targeted geographic location are favorable (i.e., just as favorable or more favorable) with respect to comparable qualities of the probabilistic user location.
- embodiments may include a system to provide internet-based services targeted on a targeted geographic location based on usefulness, to a user probabilistically located among any of a plurality of candidate geographic locations, of the internet-based services being targeted on the targeted geographic location.
- embodiments of systems may include one or more processors.
- Embodiments of systems may also include one or more input/output unit being configured to be in communication with a first server and a second server.
- the first server may relate one or more IP addresses to one or more candidate geographic locations, and the second server may process internet-based services targeted on a geographic location.
- an input/output unit may be configured to transmit data to and receive data from each of the first server and the second server.
- Embodiments of systems may further include, for example, non-transitory computer-readable storage media having stored thereon a set of executable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, causes the system to perform various operations.
- Some embodiments may include an instruction that, when executed, causes the system to obtain, from the first server, a plurality of candidate geographic locations associated with a client IP address and a plurality of candidate confidence levels.

- each of the route-utility factors can be determined responsive to an inverse relationship with one or more parameters indicative of a burden associated with travel along a route between the respective candidate geographic location and the probabilistic client geographic location.
- some embodiments may include an instruction that, when executed, causes the system to determine a plurality of probabilistic utility scores for each respective candidate geographic location of the plurality of candidate geographic locations.

- Embodiments of the present invention include systems, methods, and computer readable media to identify a targeted geographic location according to the aggregate probabilistic utility score for the targeted geographic location.
- the targeted geographic location can be used, for example, for targeting internet-based services.
- An example of the calculation of an aggregate probabilistic utility score for each of the plurality of geographic locations based upon a plurality of individual probabilistic utility scores for each geographic location can, perhaps, best be shown with reference to FIG. 1 . Any particular individual probabilistic utility score for any geographic location corresponds to a respective probabilistic user location.
- the probabilistic user location can be, for example, any of the candidate geographic locations.
- an individual probabilistic utility score for any geographic location m that corresponds to any probabilistic user location n can be represented as an individual probabilistic utility score for (m,n), and the pair (m,n) represents m being the hypothetical targeted geographic location and n being the corresponding probabilistic user location.
- determining an individual probabilistic utility score for any (m, n) includes factoring in the candidate confidence level for n and one or more utility factors for (m, n) or for m.
- an example of a route-burden parameter represents spatial distance between geographic locations, such that there is provided a distance parameter for any (m, n).
- An illustration of the relation between individual probabilistic utility scores and the distance parameter can be shown with reference to the utility-distance graph ( 100 ).
- the utility-distance graph ( 100 ) represents individual probabilistic utility scores (as well as the aggregate probabilistic utility score) along the y-axis and distance in kilometers along the x-axis.
- the illustration provided in the utility-distance graph ( 100 ) is simplified because it represents distance in one dimension only (i.e., straight-line distance).
- the relative position of various geographic locations in FIG. 1A is represented on the X-axis in kilometer distance units.
- examples of candidate geographic locations are shown at each of the 100 km mark (candidate geographic location “A”), the 120 km mark (candidate geographic location “B”), the 140 km mark (candidate geographic location “C”), and the 200 km mark (candidate geographic location “D”).
- candidate geographic location A corresponds to a %17.5 candidate confidence level
- candidate geographic location B corresponds to a %27.5 candidate confidence level
- candidate geographic location C corresponds to a %20 candidate confidence level
- candidate geographic location D corresponds to a %35 candidate confidence level.
- Probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) are provided to show individual probabilistic utility scores corresponding to respective candidate geographic locations. Each of the probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) represents a relation between distance and probabilistic utility for different geographic locations m positioned along the X-axis. Each probabilistic utility curve ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) corresponds to a different probabilistic user location n being selected from ⁇ A, B, C, D ⁇ .
- Each of the probabilistic utility curves reflects the corresponding candidate confidence level for the respective probabilistic user location, as evidenced by the value of the peaks of the probabilistic utility curves, e.g., peak ( 141 ) represents candidate confidence level 0.20 for candidate geographic location C.
- probabilistic utility curve ( 120 ) shows continuous individual probabilistic utility scores for any (m, A).
- probabilistic utility curve ( 130 ) shows continuous individual probabilistic utility scores for any (m, B).
- probabilistic utility curve ( 140 ) shows continuous individual probabilistic utility scores for any (m, C).
- probabilistic utility curve ( 150 ) shows continuous individual probabilistic utility scores for any (m, D).
- Each of the probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) therefore provides an individual probabilistic utility score for any geographic location m along the x-axis as a function of distance from a respective probabilistic user location n.
- each of the probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) can represent an inverse relation between distance for any (m, n) and the individual probabilistic utility score for any m.
- each of the probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) represents an exponential decay of individual probabilistic utility score along the x-axis as a function of distance for any (m, n).
- the exponential decay can be a function of a utility-decay factor.
- distance the relationship between the route-burden parameter in the example provided by FIG. 1A (distance) is shown as being exponentially related to utility, various embodiments may include various types of inverse relationships, including for example, a linear relationship.
- the individual probabilistic utility score for any (m, ⁇ A,B,C,D ⁇ ) can be shown with reference to the y-axis values for respective probabilistic utility curve (e.g., 120, 130, 140, and 150) at any point m on the x-axis.
- respective probabilistic utility curve e.g., 120, 130, 140, and 150
- the intersection of line ( 117 ) with probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , 150 ) represents the individual probabilistic utility score for (B, ⁇ A,B,C,D ⁇ ).
- the probabilistic utility for any m may differ depending on which of n (i.e., which of ⁇ A,B,C,D ⁇ ) considered (i.e., depending on the distance for (m, n)).
- the individual probabilistic utility score for (B, A) is 0.088 according to probabilistic utility curve ( 120 ).
- the individual probabilistic utility score for (B, B) is 0.275 according to probabilistic utility curve ( 130 ).
- the individual probabilistic utility score for (B, C) is 0.100 according to probabilistic utility curve ( 140 ).
- the individual probabilistic utility score for (B, D) is 0.0022 according to probabilistic utility curve ( 150 ).
- the plurality of probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 ) can be summed to determine an aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ).
- the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) provides an aggregate probabilistic utility score for any geographic location m positioned along the x-axis. Because the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) represents the sum of the probabilistic utility curves ( 120 , 130 , 140 , 150 ), the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) therefore provides an aggregate probabilistic utility score for all geographic locations m a function of distance from each of the probabilistic user locations, e.g., distances for (m, ⁇ A,B,C,D ⁇ ).
- the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) for any m represents the aggregate probabilistic utility score, to a user probabilistically located at any of the plurality of probabilistic user locations ⁇ A,B,C,D ⁇ .
- the aggregate probabilistic utility curve can be used, for example, to select a targeted geographic location (i.e., any point m along the x-axis) based on the aggregate probabilistic utility score (i.e., a point along the y-axis) for that targeted geographic location.
- the geographic location having the greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score can be selected.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B provide examples of relative probabilistic locality from the prior art.
- the bars represent the candidate confidence levels, i.e., the probability that any of the candidate geographic locations (i.e., the position along the x-axis) are the probabilistic user location.
- FIG. 2A represents the existence of multiple probabilistic user locations at each of the 100 km mark, the 120 km mark, the 140 km mark, and the 200 km mark.
- probabilistic user location “A” is at the 100 km mark and corresponds to a %17.5 candidate confidence level
- probabilistic user location “B” is at the 120 km mark and corresponds to a %27.5 candidate confidence level
- probabilistic user location “C” is at the 140 km mark and corresponds to a %20 candidate confidence level
- probabilistic user location “D” is at the 200 km mark and corresponds to a %35 candidate confidence level.
- the slices 211 A, 211 B, 211 C, 211 D
- FIGS. 1A and 2A it can be shown that the geographic location having the greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score is not necessarily the same as the candidate geographic location having the greatest relative probabilistic locality.
- FIG. 2A shows that the candidate geographic location having the greatest relative probabilistic locality is the candidate geographic location “D” ( 210 D) at position “200 km,” having a candidate confidence level of 35%.
- FIG. 1A shows that the geographic location having the greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score is the candidate geographic location “B” ( 112 ) at position “120 km” having aggregate probabilistic utility score of 0.484.
- an aggregate probabilistic utility score for any candidate geographic location can be higher than the candidate confidence level for the same candidate geographic location (or, perhaps, for other candidate confidence levels) because the aggregate probabilistic utility score for any geographic location factors in individual probabilistic utility scores for corresponding to each of the plurality of candidate geographic locations, whereas the candidate confidence levels are limited in scope to only the corresponding candidate geographic location.
- discrete aggregate probabilistic utility scores can be determined even for non-candidate geographic locations (e.g., including geographic locations near or surrounding candidate geographic locations), which allows even non-candidate geographic locations to be selected as targeted geographic locations, in certain circumstances.
- the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) the only the peaks ( 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 ) correspond to the candidate geographic locations “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D”—all other points along the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) provide discrete data points for non-candidate geographic locations.
- candidate confidence levels lack information relating discretely to non-candidate geographic locations (see FIG. 2A ).
- Non-candidate geographic locations may be advantageous, for example, to the extent that some non-candidate geographic locations can have a higher aggregate probabilistic utility score than even the second-greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score for a candidate geographic location.
- the portion of the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) surrounding the highest peak ( 112 ) there is a range ( 118 ) of geographic locations having an aggregate probabilistic utility score greater than the second-highest peak ( 113 ).
- This portion of the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) represents non-candidate geographic locations that have greater aggregate probabilistic utility scores than even candidate geographic location “C”, which has the second greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score (0.425).
- the second greatest aggregate probabilistic utility score among the candidate geographic locations can be used to define a “floor” ( 115 ) thereby used to define a peak area ( 116 ) under the aggregate probabilistic utility curve ( 110 ) and to define a corresponding peak range ( 118 ).
- a floor 115
- a peak area 116
- a corresponding peak range 118
- FIG. 1A representing distance in only one dimension, is provided for ease of explanation, and those having skill in the art will appreciate applications including relative positions of various geographic locations in a coordinate space analogous to portions of the surface of the earth, including, for example, a longitude axis and a latitude axis.
- a more complex relation between probabilistic utility scores and route-burden parameters in multiple dimensions can be shown with reference to utility-distance graph ( 100 B) set forth in FIG. 1B .
- the utility-distance graph ( 100 B) represents individual probabilistic utility score along the z-axis and distance in kilometers along both the x-axis and the y-axis.
