Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries based on user activity and multimedia content.
- Social networks are becoming an increasingly popular way for people to stay connected. This increasing popularity of social networks has given rise to many social network services that have developed various ways users of the social network can communicate and share information. Users within a social network can send each other messages, monitor other users' activities on a daily basis and share personal information, including personal photographs and videos. Social networking services have provided a great forum for users to remain in close contact despite geographic distance or uncoordinated schedules. Further, the development of other online services that enable the general sharing of information has also increased. The ability for users to share information with others, and view information about others is available in many different venues.
- Users of social networks also participate in many activities or online activities, such as watching videos, posting pictures, posting notification of current user information or activity, or sharing location whereabouts. Within such venues of these social networks, users are able determine what information they chose to share and how and to whom that information is shared. Typically, the information may be shared on a social network portal of a user as the user decides to share the information, but the shared information is typically not organized in a meaningful or interesting way.
- the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries using digitally recorded information and other information. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries using multimedia content and user activity information.
- the user activity information may include activity information of a user's online activity. Once enough data or activity information is received, the data is analyzed and segmented to determine and create an activity summary or a story. Content is selected. The selection of the content includes selection of content items, such as multimedia items, e.g. pictures and videos. Secondary information, such as user activity information or location information is analyzed. A story is generated based on the received user activity information.
- the method includes enriching the content with additional information about the content. In another implementation, the method further includes assigning a title to the story.
- the method may further include categorizing the user activity information, generating an activity summary, wherein the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information, and sending the activity summary for display.
- the method may further include grouping the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities.
- the method may also include determining the beginning of a grouping.
- the method may also include ranking the grouped user activity information according to relevance to the user and/or user's contacts. Further the method may include determining when the group is complete.
- the method may also include associating a verb identifier with a user activity and categorizing the user activity information according to the verb identifier.
- a computer program product comprises a non-transitory computer readable medium encoding instructions that, in response to execution by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform operations comprising receiving user activity information, categorizing the user activity information, generating an activity summary, wherein the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information and sending the activity summary for display.
- the user activity information includes activity information of a user's online activity.
- the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform grouping categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities. In some implementations, the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform ranking the grouped user activity information according to relevance to the user and/or user's contacts. The instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform determining when the group is complete. The instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform associating a verb identifier with a user activity and categorizing the user activity information according to the verb identifier. In some implementations, the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform allowing the user to share the generating activity summary with other users. In some implementations the activity summary includes more than one type of user activity.
- a system for generating activity summaries for users is also disclosed.
- User activity information is received by a user activity information receiver module.
- the user activity information includes activity information of a user's online activity.
- the user activity information is then categorized by a categorization module, which in some implementations, also groups the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information.
- the categorized user activity information is ranked according to relevance to the user by the ranking module or according to relevance to the user's contacts by the categorization module.
- An output generation module 316 determines when the groupings are complete.
- Activity summaries are then generated by the output generation module 316.
- the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information.
- the activity summary is sent for display on a user device of a user.
- the categorization module further associates a verb identifier with a user activity, and categorizes the user activity information according to the verb identifier.
- the activity summary generation module allows the user to share the generating activity summary with other users.
- Activity summaries may be generated that summarize user activity information, or digitally recorded information, or inferred activity.
- activity information may be anything that is digitally record or inferred and authorized by the user to analyze and share. Such information may be based on a user's life and based on their digital footprints, for example, location tracks, search history, web history, check-ins, posts created, documents created, web pages bookmarked, keep reminders made, photos and videos taken (and all their metadata like time of day and geocode), etc.
- content such as multimedia (photos, videos) that contain information to provide an inference of time of day or landmarks or specific places (when geocode is missing).
- activity summaries may be generated that summarize the user's real-world activity.
- a mobile application is implemented on a mobile device that is carried by the user, and that application has access to the phone's location, then activity can be directly inferred.
- These summaries may organize the user's activity, including online activity and group them into interesting stories that convey the user's experiences, which may be helpful in conveying interesting life experiences.

- An activity summary may be a visual representation of a story.
- an activity summary may be a collection of content, e.g., pictures, videos, text, specifically selected and organized to tell a story. Such a collection of content may be supplemented with additional information to further enhance and enrich the story.
- an activity summary may be generated based on user activity information and content generated from a single user activity.
- an activity summary may be generated based on user activity information and content generated from a grouping of multiple user activities. Examples of such user activity include interactions with content, e.g., watching videos, posting pictures, posting notification of current user information or activity, sharing location whereabouts, or other activity performed online.
- two or more activities can be categorized and grouped according to one or more commonalities. For example, videos a user watched can be grouped together.
- activities associated with a particular even a user has attended or trip the user has taken e.g., pictures taken on the trip, locations identified, or restaurants visited during the trip) may be grouped together.
- An activity summary may also be generated based on user activity information and/or content generated from multiple users. In this manner, content from a second user may be used to tell the story of a first user. For example, shared photos of an event from multiple users may be used to generate an activity summary.
- the system may suggest that the user share the generated activity summary with one or more persons or groups. This beneficially allows a user to display certain activity information in a way that is more interesting for the user's contacts to view.
- Some implementations also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.

- social networking activities of the user e.g., reading social networking content, liking social networking content
- the activity summary generation module 220 is also configured to communicate with storage device 214 and the data store 110 to send user activity information for storage and retrieval. In some implementations, the activity summary generation module 220 is also configured to communicate with the application server 107 to receive user activity on third party applications. [0070] The user data receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module
- the 220 is software and / or routines for receiving a user activity information from a user device 115 and user activity information stored on storage device 214 or data storage 110.
- the user data receiver module 302 may also receive user activity information from application servers 107 and application services 109.
- the user activity information may be any information associated with the activities of the user when the user is interacting with the application server 107 or application services 109.
- the user activity information may be information associated with audio (for example, songs) that that user 125 has listened to, pictures that the user has uploaded to the network server 101, videos that the user has watched, text posts that the user has input into the network server 101, and other information associated with the activity of the user 125.
- user activity information may be information received from the application server 107 or application service 109 related to user activity on the application server 107 or application service 109. For example, if the application server 107 hosts a website that allows users to listen to music or watch videos, the user activity information regarding songs listened to or videos watch on the application server 107may be sent to and received by the user data receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module 220.
- the user activity information is software and / or routines for categorizing the received user activity information.
- the user activity information may be categorized or indexed according to various categories or criteria.
- the user activity information may be categorized according to a user identifier, a verb identifier associated with the user activity, a target associated with the user activity and a source.
- a user identifier can be an anonymized identifier that uniquely identifies a particular user 125 of the system 100.
- the verb identifier associated with the user activity may be predefined according to the particular user activity.
- a particular website or a particular application service 109 or application server 107 provides the user with the ability to perform more than one activity on that website, service or server, there may be more than one verb identifier associated with that website, service or server, and each verb identifier may be associated with a certain user activity.
- a verb identifier associated with that website and activity may be "watch” or “watched” and the corresponding activity of watching videos that occurs on that website would be associated with “watched.”
- the website may be associated with various user activities and therefore various corresponding verb identifiers.
- the target associated with the user activity identifies an item (such as a video in the previous example) that was a target of the user's activity.
- the target may include a title and a Uniform Resource Locator (ULR) where the target can be found.
- the user activity information from multiple servers 107 may have the same associated verb.
- user activity information from multiple application services 109 may have the same associated verb.
- the categorization module 304 may also group the categorized user activity. For example, the categorization module 304 may aggregate the categorized based on the type of activity.
- the categorization module 304 may also group the categorized user activity based on other criteria and these categorized groups may include different types of user activity or content.
- the categorization module 304 may also group the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information. By grouping the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information, the categorization module 304 helps to organize the user activity or online activity into interesting stories or comprehensive summaries of these activities. This categorized and organized user activity represents experiences and may be helpful in conveying the user's life experiences when the experiences relate to a common theme.
- the categorization module 304 may group the user activity information based on relatedness (similar topic, similar content, etc.) of the user activity. Commonalities may include a location common to the user activity. Commonalities may also include an interest or topic common to the user activity. Groups of user activity created by the categorization module may therefore include different types of user activity. For example, the
- categorization module 304 may categorize and group together the user activity that the user performed while the user was in Japan.
- the categorized and grouped user activity which eventually becomes output or is displayed as the activity summary, may include activity and content such as the pictures the user posted of the user's trip to Japan, the places that the user visited while in Japan, and the items the user purchased online while the user was in Japan.
- the grouping and categorization performed by the categorization module 304 may be based on session determination and whether the user activity falls within a particular session.
- the categorization module 304 may also determine sessions of user activity.
- the categorization module 304 may determine sessions of user activity based on the time the user activity was performed. The time may be based on a certain time frame, for example, every six hours, or based on certain times of the day, for example, from 9:00AM to 5:00PM.
- the categorization module 304 may determine sessions of user activity based on when the user signs off and/or signs in.
- the sign-on or sign- in may be associated with activity on the application server 107 or application service 109.
- the session may also be based on other factors, e.g., relatedness of the user activities. For example, relatively continuous user activities that are related to a particular topic or particular type of content can indicate a session.
- the ranking module 306 of the activity summary generation module 220 may be software and / or routines for ranking the categorized user activity information.
- the categorized user activity information may be ranked 406 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306.
- the categorized user activity information may be ranked 406 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306.
- the content selection module 308 of the activity summary generation module 220 may receive user activity information from the user data receiver module 302 as well as multimedia data and secondary data, such as location information or time information and determine which of that content to include in the activity summary.
- the content selection may be based on a ranking of the content, the quality of the content or other aspects of the content that would render the content valuable for selection to be included in the activity summary.
- the segmentation module 310 of the activity summary generation module 220 may be software and / or routines for analyzing the received user activity and content, including received content, such as multimedia or other data or information and determining how the received content relates to each other.
- the segmentation module 310 of the activity summary generation module 220 may receive user activity information from the user data receiver module 302.
- the segmentation module 310 of the activity summary generation module 220 may receive selected content from the content selection module 308 of the activity summary generation module 220.
- the segmentation module 310 may determine commonalities between the content and segment the content based on the commonalities. For example, in some implementations, the segmentation module 310 may determine that the receive content includes pictures that were taken in the same location and segment and group the content (pictures) based on that commonality.
- the enrichment module 312 of the activity summary generation module 220 may be software and / or routines for adding additional information to the selected content and multimedia.
- content recognition is performed on the multimedia. Based on the recognized content and additional search of a database may be performed to obtain additional information about the recognized content. The additional information may be added to the content to further enhance its informational quality. For example, a recognition of a media item may be performed and a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge may be found.
- the enrichment module 312 may search a database of information and find additional information about the Golden Gate Bridge, for example, how long it is. The enrichment module 312 may then add that information in the form of text to the selected media as part of the activity summary.
- the enrichment module 312 communicates with the content selection module 308 to add the information to the selected content.
- the enrichment module 312 also determines other information from metadata that may be associated with the content and add additional information based on the metadata.
- the enrichment module 312 of the activity summary generation module 220 may look at location information and determine a specific named location associated with the determined location. For example, the enrichment module 312 may determine that the content received, for example, pictures taken were taken at a specific shopping center and specifically at a certain store. The enrichment module 312 may then use that information and add a map location of the store to the activity summary to enhance the content.
- the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may be software and / or routines for determining and assigning a title to the selected content of the activity summary. In some implementations, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may analyze the content of the activity summary to determine words and/or phrases to best summarize the content of the activity summary. In some
- the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 determines a time frame for when the activity has taken place and determines a general description to describe that time frame. For example, if the activity took place from Friday at 6:00pm and ended on Sunday at 12:00pm, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may assign a title "The Weekend" to the activity summary. In another implementation, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 determines the general location of the activity summary. For example, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may assign a title "San Francisco" to the activity summary if it determines that the activity happened mostly in San Francisco.
- the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may use both the determined location and the time frame to determine and assign a title. For example, if the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 determines that the activity occurred from Friday at 6:00pm and ended on Sunday at 12:00pm and took place generally in San Francisco, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may assign the title "Weekend in San Francisco" to the activity summary. [0081] In yet other implementations, the titling module 314 of the activity summary generation module 220 may recognize that the time and/or content described in the story closely matches an event described on the user's calendar (e.g. "Tom's birthday party") or an event the user was invited to and may determine and assign a title also based on the calendar item or event.
- an event described on the user's calendar e.g. "Tom's birthday party
- the titling module 314 may generate titles in a language-agnostic way so that the title can be translated into whatever language the recipient of the story speaks.
- a template may be generated that may be: "Time: [weekend], locations: [San Francisco, Napa],” and based on the generated template, the initial title may be translated and re-assigned to a more naturally- sounding title in whatever language the user normally speaks.
- the title may be based on the aggregated activity information, for example, based on videos the user watched or music the user listened to.
- the titling module 314 may determine and assign a title "New music you listened to last month" or "Top artists you listened to last week” based on aggregated activity information.
- the output generation module 316 receives information from the categorization module 304 and the ranking module 306 and generates activity summaries based on the categorized user activity information.
- the user may share the generated activity summary with other users, for example, by posting the activity summary on the user's social network portal.
- the post may be a public post where other users can view the activity summary.
- the post may also be a private post where selected users may view the activity summary.
- an example method 400 for generating activity summaries for a user 125 of the system 100 will be described.
- the method 400 is performed by the components of the network server 101, and specifically, by the components of the activity summary generation module 220.
- the method 400 begins when user activity information is received 402 by the user activity information receiver module 302.
- the user activity information is then categorized 404 by the categorization module 304.
- the categorized user activity information is ranked 406 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 406 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306.
- Activity summaries are then generated 408 by the output generation module 316 of the activity summary generation module 220.
- the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information.
- the activity summary is sent 410 for display on a user device 1 15 of a user 125.
- the user may share the generated activity summary with other users, for example, by posting the activity summary on the user's social network portal.
- the post may be a public post where other users can view the activity summary.
- the post may also be a private post where selected users may view the activity summary.
- the method 500 is performed by the components of the network server 101, and specifically, by the components of the activity summary generation module 220.
- the method 500 begins when user activity information is received 502 by the user activity information receiver module 302.

- the activity information may also include the user's location information (or location information of the user's device), the user's calendar information, or information related to events that the user will be attending or has attended, or other information related to the user's activity.
- the application server 107 hosts a website that allows users to listen to music or watch videos
- the user activity information regarding songs listened to or videos watch on the application server 107 may be sent to and received by the user data receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module 220.
- a user's search history may also serve as a source for activity information.
- the user activity information is then categorized 504 by the categorization module 304.
- the user activity information may be categorized according to a user identifier, a verb identifier associated with the user activity, a target associated with the user activity and a source.
- a user identifier can be an anonymized identifier that uniquely identifies a particular user 125 of the system 100.
- the verb identifier associated with the user activity may be predefined according to the particular user activity.
- a particular website or a particular application service 109 or application server 107 provides the user with the ability to perform more than one activity on that website, service or server, there may be more than one verb identifier associated with that website, service or server, and each verb identifier may be associated with a certain user activity.
- the user activity information may also be categorized according to [0087]
- the categorization module 304 also groups 506 the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information. By grouping the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information, the categorization module 304 helps to organize the user activity or online activity into interesting stories or comprehensive summaries of these activities.
- the categorization module 304 may group the user activity information.
- the user activity information may be grouped 506 based on relatedness (similar topic, similar content, etc.) of the user activity. Commonalities may include a location common to the user activity. Commonalities may also include an interest or topic common to the user activity. Groups of user activity created by the categorization module may therefore include different types of user activity. For example, the categorization module 304 may categorize and group together the user activity according to activity that the user performed online while the user was in Japan.
- categorized and grouped user activity which eventually becomes output or displayed as the activity summary, may include activity and content such as the pictures the user posted of the user's trip to Japan, the places that the user visited while in Japan, and the items the user purchased online while the user was in Japan.
- the categorization module 304 also groups 506 the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information to determine the beginning of a specific group in order to create a story from that grouping.
- a change in a user's location signals the beginning of a story.
- new photos signal the beginning of a story.
- a change in the user's location from their usual location signals the beginning of a story.
- the user's usual location may be a specifically identified location (for example, a defined home location, or an identified work location).
- the user's usual location may be inferred from the user's location history, or from previously geo-tagged photos (e.g. where the user tends to spend most of his or her time).
- the categorized user activity information is ranked 508 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 508 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306.
- the output generation module 316 determines 510 when the groupings are complete. Certain signals or activity information are monitored and analyzed to determine the completion of a grouping or ending of a story. Specifically, certain signals such as photos, location, calendar, events and other user's information (which is linked to the first user) serve as sources for activity information and indications of the completion of a grouping or ending of a story. In one implementation, a user's search history may also serve as a source for activity information. In one implementation, a change in a user's location signals the ending of a story. In one implementation, a time limit may signal the ending of a story.
