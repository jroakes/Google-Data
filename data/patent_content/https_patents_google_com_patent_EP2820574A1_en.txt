Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to information retrieval.
- Information retrieval systems such as Internet search engines, help users by
- a search engine locates and stores the location of documents in a searchable index used to facilitate fast information retrieval.
- the search engine may use a variety of statistical measures to determine the relevance of the resources in the index to the user's query to identify and provide search results.
- Formulating a search query that accurately represents the user's information need can be challenging. For example, a user may be unfamiliar with search query constructs, keywords and/or syntax that may be useful in obtaining search results relevant to the user's information need. In such a case, the user may submit a search query that includes query terms that are general or ambiguous to yield relevant search results. That is, the search engine may identify a number of resources which match terms in the user's query, but which are unrelated to the actual information need of the user. In such a case, the user may have to enter a number of different queries concerning the same information request before reaching resources that are of interest to the user.
- a method in one implementation, includes identifying a partial query entered into a search field.
- the method further includes providing for display a query completion template for a category of information associated with one or more terms within the partial query.
- the query completion template includes an interactive field that is user editable.
- the method further includes identifying user interaction with the interactive field.
- the method further includes updating the display of the query completion template to include the results of the user interaction within the interactive field of the query completion template.
- the method further includes identifying user selection of the updated query completion template.
- the method further includes transmitting the updated display of the query completion template as a search query in response to the user selection.
- the category of information can be one or more of language translation, stock price information, map information, navigational information, news information, weather information, travel information, or dictionary definitions.
- the query completion template can further include one or more query terms within a non-editable field.
- the method can further include identifying a set of query suggestions for the partial query.
- the set of query suggestions can then be modified to include the query completion template.
- Providing the query completion template for display can include providing for display the modified set of query suggestions.
- This method can further include maintaining a database of query completion
- Each query completion template in the database can be associated with a list of terms corresponding to a category of information.
- the method may further include identifying query terms within the set of query suggestions.
- the method may further include selecting the query completion template for display from the database of query completion templates based on one or more of the query terms within the set of query suggestions appearing within the list of terms associated with the selected query completion template.
- the interactive field can be a text entry box. Identifying user interaction with the interactive field can include identifying user entry of a sequence of characters within the text entry box, the sequence of characters representing the one or more updated query terms within the interactive field.
- the interactive field can be selectable to cause display of the one or more query terms.
- User interaction with the interactive field can then be identified by identifying user selection of the interactive field, and identifying the selection of one or more displayed query terms.
- Updating the display of the query completion template may comprise providing for display the selected one or more query terms within the interactive field in response to the user selection.
- Providing for display the query completion template can include providing for display text indicating the category of information.

- Technology described herein provides an interactive query completion template that serves as a basis for creating a search query that can be used to obtain search results relevant to the information need of the user.
- the query completion template enables the quick and convenient creation of meaningful search queries by users that may otherwise be unfamiliar with the search query constructs, operators, terms and syntax that may be helpful in obtaining search results containing the information they seek.
- the technology described herein includes providing an interactive query
- the query completion template for display as a user is typing a query.
- the query completion template has a query format that can be useful in efficiently searching for content within a category of information associated with one or more terms within the user's partial query.
- the query format defines the number, type and ordering of terms within a search query that is constructed using the query completion template.
- a query completion template thus represents a generalization of search queries representing searchable information within a corresponding category of information.
- a query completion template includes at least one interactive field that is user- editable to enable the user to directly enter one or more query terms that represent the information the user is seeking. Prior to editing, the interactive field thus acts as a placeholder, so that the user can quickly and conveniently create a search query having the particular query format defined by the query completion template. After being edited, the user can then submit the edited query completion template as a search query to a search engine, so that useful search results can be obtained.
- the interactive field may be for example a text entry box that allows the user to type or otherwise directly enter characters within the text entry box.
- a query completion template for use in searching for the definition of a phrase may include a text entry box that allows the user to enter the phrase.
- a query completion template for use in tracking shipment of a package may include a text entry box that allows the user to enter a tracking number of the package.
- a query completion template for use in obtaining weather information may include a text entry box that allows the user to enter a city name and/or a zip code.
- the interactive field may alternatively be a selection box that allows the user to select from among terms that may be particularly relevant or useful when searching for content within the category of information.
- a query completion template for use in searching for flight information may include a selection box that allows the user to select from among a variety of possible airport codes.
- a query completion template for use in searching for a translation of a phrase into another language may include a selection box that allows the user to select from among a variety of possible languages.
- a query completion template may also include one or more non-editable fields.
- a non-editable field can include one or more additional query terms that assist the user in obtaining search results relevant to the information of interest to the user.
- the query completion template may include the additional term "define" within a non-editable field, so that search results relevant to the definition of words (e.g. online dictionary web pages) are identified and returned by the search engine.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment for providing an interactive query completion template that can be used to search for content within a category of information.

- the client computing device 110 executes an application, such as a web browser 120, which provides a search field that allows the user to formulate search queries and submit them to the search engine 150.
- the client computing device 110 may be for example a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, or any other type of computing device.
- the search engine 150 receives a submitted query from the client computing
- the search engine 150 identifies content in the content database 160 which matches the query, and responds by generating search results which are transmitted to the client computing device 110 in a form that can be presented to the user. For example, in response to a query from the client computing device 110, the search engine 150 may transmit a search results web page to be displayed in the web browser 120 executing on the client computing device 110.
- search assistance engine 180 executing on the client computing device 110 also transmits partial queries being formulated by the user to a search assistance engine 180.
- the search assistance engine 180 may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software running on hardware.
- a "partial query” is a query formulated by a user prior to an indication by the user that the query is complete.
- a user may indicate completion of the query by entering a carriage return or equivalent character.
- the user may indicate completion of the query by selecting a search button in a user interface presented to the user during entry of the query.
- the user may indicate completion of the query by saying a command in a speech interface or pausing more than a predetermined period of time.
- the application provides each character of a partial query as it is typed or otherwise entered by the user. In other implementations, the application provides multiple characters at a time following a pause between character entries.
- the search assistance engine 180 provides an interactive query completion template having a query format useful in searching within a category of information associated with one or more terms within the partial query.
- the search assistance engine 180 maintains a template database 185 of interactive query completion templates that correspond to different searchable categories of information.
- the template database 185 may include an interactive query completion template that can be used to create a search query and efficiently search for airport flight information of interest to the user.
- the template database 185 may include an interactive query completion template that can be used to search for unit conversion information, an interactive query completion template that can be used to search for the definition of a word or phrase, and an interactive query completion template that can be used to search for the translation of a term into another language.
- Other examples of interactive query completion templates include those that can be used to search for definitions, stocks, package tracking, weather, time zone information, medical definitions, time, unit conversions, etc.
- a given interactive query completion template within the template database 185 has a query format that defines the number, type and ordering of terms within a search query formed using the given interactive query completion template. As described below, the given query completion template is used as the basis for creating a search query that represents a request for content within the corresponding category of information.
- Each query completion template in the template database 185 includes at least one interactive field that allows the user to directly enter one or more query terms that represent the information the user is seeking.
- the interactive field thus acts as a placeholder, so that the user can quickly and conveniently create a search query having the format defined by the query completion template.
- the search assistance engine 180 selects one or more interactive query completion templates within the template database 185.
- the selected interactive query completion template is for a category of information associated with one or more terms within the partial query.
- the search assistance engine 180 may for example maintain a list of terms
- Terms in a given list may include terms that are particularly relevant or frequently used when searching for content within the corresponding category of information.
- the list of terms associated with an interactive query completion template for use in searching for airport flight information may include keywords such as "flights", as well as airport names, airline names, flight numbers, etc..
- the search assistance engine 180 can then match terms within the partial query to the lists of terms to select one or more appropriate interactive query completion templates for the partial query.
- lists of terms may be generated and maintained by the search assistance engine 180 using a variety of different techniques.
- the lists of terms may be created manually.
- other or additional techniques may be used to create the lists.
- the terms that have been manually included in a given list of terms serve as a starting point, or seed, for use in automatically identifying additional terms to include within the given list.
- These additional terms may for example be terms that have similar meanings to the manually included terms, such as synonyms of the manually included terms.
- these additional terms may have a high number of search results that overlap with the search results of one or more manually included terms.
- the search assistance engine 180 selects an interactive query completion template by comparing the lists of terms to those within query suggestions provided by a suggestion engine 170. In such a case, the search assistance engine 180 forwards the partial query to the suggestion engine 170.
- the suggestion engine 170 includes memory for storage of data and software applications, a processor for accessing data and executing applications, and components that facilitate communication over communication network 140.
- the suggestion engine 170 provides a set of query suggestions for the partial query to the search assistance engine 180.
- These query suggestions may for example be past queries submitted by prior users. These query suggestions represent search queries that the user may want to submit instead of the partial query actually being typed.
- the suggestion engine 170 may use conventional or other techniques to determine which query suggestions to include the set for the partial query. For example, the suggestion engine 170 may use prefix based matching. The suggestion engine 170 may also use other techniques to determine the query suggestions to include in the set.
- the search assistance engine 180 can then compare the terms within the query suggestions provided by the suggestion engine 170 to the lists of terms associated with the interactive query completion templates.
- the search assistance engine 180 can then match terms within the query suggestions to the list of terms to select one or more interactive query completion template that are associated with lists that include one or more terms appearing within the query suggestions.
- the search assistance engine 180 then provides the selected interactive query
- the selected interactive query completion template may for example be displayed within a cascaded drop down menu of the search field of an application, such as the web browser 120, executing on the client computing device 110 as the user is typing the query in the search field.
- the selected interactive query completion template may for example be displayed within a web page displayed in the web browser 120 or other application as the user is typing the query.
- the interactive query completion templates may for example be implemented in JavaScript or other suitable programming language that provides the interactive functionality described herein.
- the search assistance engine 180 may also provide the set of query suggestions for display along with the interactive query completion template. In such a case, the search assistance engine 180 can then modify the set of query suggestions by adding the selected interactive query completion template to the set. The search assistance engine 180 can then provide the modified set for display to the user of the client computing device 110. Alternatively, the search assistance engine 180 may provide the selected interactive query completion template to the suggestion engine 170. In such a case, the suggestion engine 170 may modify the set of query suggestions and provide the modified set for display to the user.
- the techniques for adding the selected interactive query completion template to the set of query suggestions can vary from implementation to implementation.
- the selected interactive query completion templates may be added to the beginning, before the query suggestions.
- the interactive query completion templates may be added to the end, after the query suggestions in the set.
- other techniques may be used to add the interactive query completion templates to the set.
- the interactive query completion template may be added between query suggestions in the set.
- the user of the client device 110 can then interact with the displayed query
- completion template to create a search query by performing various actions that correspond to entry of one or more query terms within at least one interactive field of the query completion template.
- the user may for example interact with the interactive query completion template using a keyboard, a pointing device such as a mouse, a touchscreen incorporated into the display of the client device 110, or any other user input device of the client device 110.
- the search assistance engine 180 can then update the display of the interactive query completion template to include the entered one or more terms within the interactive field.
- the application displaying the query completion template may directly update the query completion template, without requiring further communication with the search assistance engine 180 to update the display.
- the user can then select it for submission as a search query to the search engine 150.
- the user may for example select the updated display of the interactive query completion template by clicking on it.
- the search query is then transmitted to the search engine 150.
- the search engine 150 may transmit a search results web page to be displayed in the web browser 120 executing on the client computing device 110.
- the search results web page may include a search result specific to the category of information. This search result may for example appear at the top of the search results web page (sometimes referred to as a "one -box" user interface), separate from other search results.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart illustrating an example process for providing an interactive query completion template that can be used to search for content within a category of information. Some implementations may perform the steps in different orders and/or perform different or additional steps than the ones illustrated in FIG. 2.
