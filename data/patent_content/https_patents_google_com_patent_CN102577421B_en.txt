Embodiment
The problem produced from ever-increasing feasibility and the use of social TV service is once program editing is set up bookmark, then it is no longer under the control of content owner, and therefore when there is no the agreement of content owner and mandate editing may freely be disseminated.Due to the sub-fraction setting up the editing of bookmark only can represent whole program, thus can be considered to single editing freely disseminate the warrant distributing (distribution) that deleteriously can not affect complete programs.In fact, content owner can regard disseminating of such editing as advertisement, and it can increase the demand of the authoritative copy (copy) for complete programs.But the imaginabale user of being can set up bookmark for a series of editings of the entirety representing program, its demand that will reduce for the authoritative copy of program, thus the potential income reducing content owner.And because various other reasons, content owner may not wish freely to disseminate the short editing of even its program.Such as, content owner may wish disseminating of the editing strictly controlling to disclose the beat all final result of program.
As described in detail later, foregoing problems overcomes by adopting digital copyright management (DRM) scheme, and wherein editing is encrypted makes them only can be authorized to user or device decrypts.Can prevent the unauthorized of editing from using and distributing like this.
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of an example of operating environment, and wherein social TV service can be provided to the subscriber be associated with the client device of such as Set Top Box 12 and 22.Client device is by one or more network and some network element communication.Such as, front end 10 is communicated with 22 with client device 12 by broadband access network 15.Front end 10 is that Virtual network operator transmits programme content and the facility providing other to serve by network from it.Broadband access network 15 and front end 10 are typically provided by MSO (Multi-Service Operator).Broadband access network 15 can be cable data network, such as complete coaxial or hybrid fiber/coaxial (HFC) network.Certainly, also other broadband access networks can be adopted, such as xDSL (such as, ADSL, ADLS2, ADSL2+, VDSL and VDSL2) and satellite system.Broadband access network 15 alternately comprises in some implementations, such as, can use such as cable data network, PON etc. that IP grouping is directly delivered to the packet switching network of Set Top Box 12 and 22.
As shown in fig. 1, front end 10 can comprise the network DVR18 storing content, for subsequently content being sent to Set Top Box in response to user's request.Network DVR18 to subscriber provide typically when subscriber adopts local DVR can function.Content can be provided to network DVR from any available content source comprising such as content source 30.
Client device 12 is communicated with social TV service device 20 by public or private packet switching network 50 with 22.For illustrative purposes, packet switching network 50 is described to according to the operation of Internet protocol collection, and therefore conveniently, sometimes will be called as the Internet here.Those skilled in that art are by understanding and understand, although broadband access network 15 and packet switching network 50 are described to physically distinct network in FIG, these networks can go up share framework and other resources on the whole or partly in some cases.Namely, the description of Fig. 1 middle width strip access network 15 and packet switching network 50 can be counted as distinct network in logic, instead of physically distinct network.Such as, hfc plant can be used for supporting sending of IP grouping, and network 15 and 50 can be identical in this case.Similarly, in IPTV realizes, network 15 and 50 can be identical.Conversely, each in some implementations in network 15 and 50 all can comprise multiple distinct network not having mutually physical connection.
Social TV service device 20 or other network elements are used to create when the request of user, storage and maintenance bookmark.Server 20 is also issued bookmark and is made them be available for other authorized users.In some implementations, social TV service device 20 can be associated with the MSO or other webserver providers by broadband access network 15 program and other guide being delivered to user.Social TV service device 20 can be arranged in front end 10 in this case.The layout of such realization will be shown about Fig. 6 discussion below.But in other realize, social TV service device 20 can be operated, as the service such as based on cloud by the third party by packet switching network 50 bookmark being delivered to authorized user.
The fragment of the program that the bookmark identification user issued by social TV service device 20 has been received from front end 10 or other guide or editing.Fig. 2 shows an example of such bookmark.As shown, bookmark comprises and has determined to set up the editing of bookmark or the thumbnail rest image of fragment from user.Bookmark also can comprise the metadata related to by setting up the editing of bookmark.Such metadata can comprise such as permission user and use the word of preassignment or free form or state the editing title and description and label that characterize the content of editing.Bookmark also comprises the privacy class of being specified by user.In this example, privacy class is instructed to " public ", and it is meant to bookmark for anyone of authorized access social TV service is available.In other examples privacy class can by the restrict access of bookmark to the individual specified or the group of individual of specifying in buddy list etc.
Bookmark also comprises the network address, such as URL(uniform resource locator) (URL), can be found in this URL place editing.Bookmark can comprise the hyperlink that embedded in the network address in some implementations.Hyperlink will guide user or navigate to the position of editing.Such as, thumbnail image can be used as the anchor (anchor) of hyperlink, and when making as user's " click " or otherwise activate anchor, user will be navigated editing.In example in FIG, editing resides on network DVR18, and therefore user is navigate to the network address of network DVR18 by hyperlink.Bookmark also indicates time started and the end time of editing.These times can use any appropriate timestamp to specify, the start frame of such as editing and end frame.The time started of editing and end time input derivation from the user received when bookmark is created.
As previously mentioned, digital copyright management (DRM) scheme is provided for and uses together with social TV service, and the editing making to set up bookmark is encrypted to prevent their unauthorized from using and distributing.DRM scheme can adopt encryption and decryption key, and it is the parameter used by algorithms for encryption and decryption respectively.During encryption and decryption, dispose incorrect key produce different results.Although DRM scheme can adopt public (namely, asymmetrical) secret key cipher art (cryptography) or secret are (namely, symmetrical) secret key cipher art time, but for illustrative purposes, DRM scheme will be described to the secret key cipher art adopting secret or symmetry here.DRM system is practicable access of being specified by content owner or service provider or Copy Protection rule also; such as (1) is read-only; forbid copy; (2) copy in limited time; (3) unconfined copy; (4) the list copy heavily do not distributed further, etc.
Refer again to Fig. 1, Key Management server (KMS) 60 is used the third party as trusting, and the third party of this trust required to wish that viewing sets up the user of the editing of bookmark to prove his or her identity before providing the access to appropriate decruption key.Once the document of title of KMS60 authenticated user and/or authentication of users, KMS60 just retrieves appropriate key from cipher key storage device (KSD) 65 and is delivered to the client device of user.In the example of fig. 1, KMS60 can be associated with social TV service provider and/or by the Internet Service Provider (such as, MSO) that program and other guide to be delivered to user by broadband access network 15.KMS60 can with social TV service device 20 in same place or not in same place, as long as it can communicate with social TV service device 20.In realization in FIG, KMS60 is located away from social TV service device 20 and is communicated with by packet switching network 50.If KMS60 is associated with Internet Service Provider, then it can be arranged in front end 10.
Those being associated with social TV service provider at KMS60 realize, and social TV service provider can represent content owner, assuming that the editing of bookmark is set up in the access of (presumably) authorized user.Similarly, those being associated with Internet Service Provider at KMS60 realize, and network provider can represent content owner, assuming that the editing of bookmark is set up in authorized user access.Because content can be encrypted on network DVR18, so the encryption function be associated with DVR also must communicate with cipher key storage device 65 or KMS60 to obtain symmetrical encryption key.Be stored in network DVR (pre-encrypt) in content or can encryption be performed when it is streamed to Set Top Box 12 or 22 (real-time encrypted).
Fig. 3 is diagram when first user creates the message flow chart that bookmark and the second user watch the message transmitted between various network nodes shown in FIG when first user has set up the editing of bookmark.In figures 1 and 3, and in figure below, identical element is by the instruction of identical Reference numeral.Client device 12 and 22 will be called as Set Top Box in these examples.Certainly, any one or two in client device 12 and 22 can be any other suitable equipment, such as PC, PDA, or mobile device, such as mobile phone.
As message 1 place indicate, the Set Top Box 12 of first user or other client devices are from front end 10 program receiving content.In addition, programme content is just being recorded and is being stored on network DVR18.When the positive view content of first user is (or along with (namely it received from the content source 30 in front end 10, real-time or live viewing) or along with (namely it be played on network DVR18, time shift)) and determine to be interested fragment or editing when setting up bookmark at 2 places, user's input has arrived the initial instruction of editing.Such as, user can press the button on remote control unit or keyboard or button of clicking the mouse.In response to user's input, Set Top Box 12 marks the time started of editing.If the time started defines according to start frame, then start frame is by present frame shown typically or nearest I frame.At the end of editing, user's input has arrived the instruction of the ending of editing.In response to user's input, Set Top Box 12 marks the end time of editing.If the end time is also define according to end frame, then end frame is by the present frame that showing typically or nearest I frame.After defining editing in like fashion, first user can add metadata, such as editing title and description.Alternatively, or add to it, once it receives bookmark, then social TV service device 20 adds metadata by access external data storehouse, such as electronic program guides (EPG), such as.Once user completes bookmark, then bookmark is uploaded to the social TV service device 20 at 3 places.The bookmark with unique identifier preserved by social TV service device 20.Bookmark also identifiable design creates the user of bookmark.
As message 4 place indicate, be recorded along with it and preserve, with any together with its right to use associated, programme content is encrypted by network DVR18.Key symmetrical during content-encrypt process is used.When it is stored on network DVR18, programme content is assigned with unique identifier.The network DVR18 be associated with front end 10 at 5 places or other network elements key request is concluded the business (transaction) be sent to cipher key storage device 65.Key request transaction comprises the unique identifier of content and symmetrical key, and can limiting content can by any content access rules of mode used.Such as, a content access rules can prevent authorized user editing be burnt to DVD or otherwise further editing be distributed to its other party.The time that another content access rules can specify symmetrical key to expire, make to set up the editing of bookmark not watched again.Alternatively, cipher key storage device 65 can content creating encryption key and/or content access rules.DRM system is used the object for determining these details of concluding the business.In a specific implementation, proprietary DRM system can be used, Internet protocol copyright management (IPRM) system that such as can obtain from Motorola.Alternatively, the other standards of suitably configuration or amendment or proprietary DRM system can be used.
At this moment in processes, the establishment of bookmark completes.Social TV service device 20 finding, the second user of bookmark following mode can access editing.
Message 6, second user continued in Fig. 3 identifies the editing of the social TV service device 20 that he or she wants to watch being set up bookmark via Set Top Box 22.Usual second user has acquired the access of bookmark with order to social TV service registration.By the address name of s/he that is associated with social TV service and password to identify user.Alternatively, DRM identity can be used for the user recognizing social TV service.Once the second user has acquired the access of server 20, then he or she can access those bookmarks having and be identified as public level of security or those bookmarks comprising the second user at the Distribution List of their authorized user.Identify expect set up the editing of bookmark after, user send viewing editing request.
In response to the request of the second user, at 7 places, social TV service device 20 sends the necessary metadata of location required for editing.Typically, this is by the identifier of the editing that comprises the network address that editing is positioned at and distributed by network DVR18 when stored clips.At 8 places, the Set Top Box 22 of the second user contacts KMS60 (packet switching network typically via shown in Fig. 1) and identifies its editing wishing access.KMS60 verifies the second user authorized access editing.Such as, KMS60 can verify that the second user subscribes social TV service.Once the document of title of the second user is verified, then can retrieves symmetrical key and the content access rules associated from cipher key storage device 65 at 9 place KMS60, and they are delivered to the Set Top Box 22 of the second user.In some cases, KMS60 and Set Top Box 22 can perform more complicated authentication processing according to any one in various different IKMP.Such as, perfect Kerberos agreement can be adopted in some implementations, wherein between KMS60 and the Set Top Box 22 of the second user, exchange ticket (ticket).If adopt Kerberos, then another entity being called as KDC (KDC) can be used for supply and certification.KDC logically, and may physically, is divided into certificate server and (ticket-granting) server authorized by ticket.KDC can be independent server or can be common trustship with KSD65.In other realize, adoptable and also use another IKMP of ticket instead of Kerberos agreement to be illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 7,243, in 366, its by reference entirety be herein incorporated.In this implementation, KDC can with KSD65 be common trustship or its can be deployed as independently server.
Next, the network element that Set Top Box 22 is positioned at the editing expected sets up communication session, and it is network DVR18 in this case, and starts the content flow of encryption to deliver to Set Top Box 22 at 10 place's network elements.Set Top Box 22 is loaded with the key of the symmetry that it receives from KMS60 to its decryption engine.Set Top Box 22 also configures its output equipment according to protection level, and protection level is that any Copy Protection rule that the content access rules by receiving together with the key of symmetry is included together is specified.Finally, Set Top Box 22 is deciphered editing it can be watched by the second user.
As previously mentioned, KMS60 can be associated with the MSO or other Internet service providers by broadband access network 15 program and other guide being delivered to user in some cases.In such cases, KMS60 can be merged in front end 10.And KMS60 even can be incorporated directly in network DVR18.When the latter, the second Set Top Box 22 can navigate directly to network DVR18 with the editing obtaining encryption and the key deciphered needed for editing.In addition, if KMS60 is physically merged in network DVR, then by secure key storage function and network DVR18 direct correlation can be removed secure key storage equipment.
Above-mentioned realization allly all sets up the editing of bookmark to be stored on network DVR18.But in some cases, the user that editing can be created editing is stored in the local storage medium be associated with the client device of user.Such as, if client device is Set Top Box, then Set Top Box can be equipped with DVR, and editing can be stored on this DVR.DVR can be the hard disk of Set Top Box inside or be attached to the external hard disc of Set Top Box.In this case, it will be illustrated about Fig. 4, wish that the second user watching editing will navigate to the Set Top Box storing this editing.
With reference to figure 4, respectively at 1,2 and 3 places, first user, from front end 10 program receiving Set Top Box 12, creates the bookmark of specific clips in program and on social TV service device, preserves bookmark with the aforesaid way about Fig. 3.As at 4 places indicate, Set Top Box 23 is recorded program on its local DVR also.The program of record uses the local encryption key generated encrypted.Encryption key and the content access rules associated are sent to KMS60 replys a transaction part as 5 place's key request and key.In 6 place KMS60 storage encryption key and content access rules in cipher key storage device KSD65.
At this moment in processes, the establishment of bookmark completes.Find that the second user of the bookmark on social TV service device 20 following mode can access editing, it is similar to about the process described in Fig. 3.Particularly, at 7 places, the second user identifies the editing of the social TV service device 20 that he or she is ready to watch being set up bookmark via Set Top Box 22.Identify expect set up the editing of bookmark after, user send viewing editing request.
In response to the request of the second user, at 8 places, social TV service device 20 sends the necessary metadata of location needed for editing.Metadata comprises the network address of Set Top Box 12 in this case, and it is the place that editing is positioned at.At 9 places, the Set Top Box 22 of the second user contacts KMS60 (packet switching network 50 typically via shown in Fig. 1) and identifies its editing wishing access.KMS60 verifies the document of title of the second user in above-mentioned mode.At 10 places, after the document of title of the second user has been verified, KMS60 can retrieve symmetrical encryption key and the content access rules associated from cipher key storage device 65, and they is delivered to the Set Top Box 22 of the second user.
Next, the equipment that Set Top Box 22 is positioned at the editing expected sets up communication session, and it is Set Top Box 12 in this case, and starts the content flow of encryption to deliver to Set Top Box 22 in 11 place's Set Top Box 12.Again be loaded with the key of the symmetry that it receives from KMS60 in step 10 place to its decryption engine in 12 place's Set Top Box 22.Set Top Box 22 also configures its output equipment according to protection level, and protection level is that any Copy Protection rule that the content access rules by having received together with the key of symmetry is included together is specified.Finally, Set Top Box 22 is deciphered editing it can be watched by the second user.
In some implementations, the DRM scheme of employing can utilize the connecting system of having ready conditions often used in broadband access network with the access of restriction to broadcast program.Because such program is broadcasted, so it is transmitted once for the reception of all legitimate receipt devices.But, be with good conditionsi to the access of data, depend on whether be such as concrete receiver pay subscription expense.Being by enciphered message under control of an authorization key (encryption occurs in the conveyer resided in front end usually) to the conditional access of content and the content of encryption be sent to receiver to realize like this.And the necessary decruption key of deciphering of content is encrypted by oneself and is sent to receiver.Usually, use symmetrical encryption technology, wherein encryption and decryption key is identical.Only having the right to enjoy those receivers substantial can use the first decipher by decryption key decryption.Then recipient can use the second decipher for decryption content under control of an authorization key to carry out decryption content.
Conditional access is provided by conditional access (CA) system, it is as coupling set--a part is integrated into wired system front end (in wired broadcast system) and encrypts quality contents, and other parts provide deciphering and are built in the Set Top Box be arranged in the family of user.Several CA system is used in wired industrial, comprise by NDS that (Newport is than strange, California), those systems of providing of Motorola's (continue nurse fort, Illinois) and science Atlanta (Atlanta, Georgia).
Share the editing of setting up bookmark in order to two users use by their MSO or the local condition visitation system of other broadband service providers employing, two users must subscribe program, and editing obtains from this program.Such as, if editing is that when obtaining from HBO, needs are subscribed HBO by two users.And two users also need to use total condition visitation system to make them can the necessary same key of access decryption content and other information.Typically this will be if two users have the situation of total service provider.
In typical condition visitation system, before being sent to subscriber, the programme content comprising such as video, audio frequency and data package is encrypted.Perform encryption processing under the control of the control character CW generated by control character maker in a per se known way.Control character CW is the key of the encryption that encryption and decryption content all requires.The access criteria that control word is served with identification is incorporated in right (entitlement) control message (ECM) together with the condition required by access services.Such as, access criteria can appointed area restriction in broadcast.Be called that the message of the further type of entitlement management message (EMM) is also generated, it carries the details of subscriber and his or her reservation.When the program of ECM message and encryption or program set are associated and carry the message of deciphering required by those programs, EMM message is exclusively used in the group of personal user or user and the message of carry information, and information determines whether those users suitably have the necessity can watching program and subscribe necessary.
The program of encryption, together with ECM with EMM message, be usually re-used together with representing other broadcasting streams of other programs, the reservation formed together from special services provider encapsulates (package).This encapsulation is sent to subscriber by broadcast access network.Once arriving at received at set-top box, demultiplexed ECM and the EMM message associated with it with the program extracting requirement of received data.ECM and the EMM message extracted is sent to the key management unit being arranged in Set Top Box.Key management unit use ECM and EMM message determines whether subscriber has the right to watch broadcast, and if having, then decryption control words CW, it is imported into decipher to recover the program stream of original coding (such as, MPEG) together with the broadcasting stream of encryption.The stream of then encoding is passed to set-top decoder, and it produces the output signal comprising audio frequency, video and data package, for showing on the display device.
Control word typically comprises one group of random digit of the key being used as encryption.Control word can be changed by predetermined space randomly.Therefore, the signal of Continuous Flow with enabling decryption of encrypted of ECM message is required.The frequency that usual EMM message is updated is less than ECM message.The adoptable form of ECM and EMM message is defined in international standard ISOIEC13818-1.
Fig. 5 be diagram when first user create bookmark and the second user watch first user set up the editing of bookmark and the DRM scheme adopted is condition visitation system time shown in FIG various network nodes between the message flow chart of message that transmits.
With reference to figure 5, respectively at 1,2 and 3 places, first user, from front end 10 program receiving Set Top Box 12, creates the bookmark of specific clips in program and on social TV service device 20, preserves bookmark with the aforesaid way about Fig. 3.As at 4 places indicate, Set Top Box is recorded program on network DVR18 also.To be used in ECM message can key encrypt the program received by Set Top Box 12 and network DVR18.The content of network DVR18 recording of encrypted and the ECM message multiplexing with the content of encryption.Typically when Set Top Box is authorized to special services or afterwards, receive EMM message termly.
Second user finds bookmark on social TV service device 20 as mentioned above and uses Set Top Box 22 to ask editing at 5 places.In response to the request of the second user, server 20 can be checked to understand fully the whether authorized viewing editing of the second user alternatively.Namely, server 20 is checked to understand fully whether the second user subscribes program alternatively, and editing obtains from this program.If the second user does not have booking service to receive editing, then whether social TV service device 20 he or she can be wanted to subscribe 6a place inquiry second user alternatively.If so, then the authorization center (DAC) 72 requiring 6b place appropriate is that the second user sets up reservation by social TV service device in a usual manner.If the uncommitted reception editing of the second user and refusal subscribe chance, then social TV service device 20 refuse the second user to the access of editing and process stop.
On the other hand, if the second user is authorized to receive editing or subscribe necessary service in real time with authorized reception editing, then at 7 places, server 20 sends the necessary metadata of location needed for editing.In this case, the network address of meta-data pack includes network DVR, it is the place at editing place.The Set Top Box 22 related network DVR18 (broadband access network 15 typically via shown in Fig. 1) of the second user and identify its editing wishing access.At 8 places, network DVR18 starts the Set Top Box 22 assembled stream being delivered to the second user.This stream comprises necessary ECM message.If Set Top Box 22 is authorized for service, set up the editing of bookmark to be derived from this service, then it has received corresponding EMM.If its be not that service subscriber, then its can or first booking service or its can receive temporary Authorization.In both of these case, the EMM of correspondence is sent to Set Top Box 22 by DAC72.Finally, Set Top Box 22 receives this stream and uses the key be included together with ECM message in an encrypted form to be deciphered.EMM is used to decipher the key in ECM.
As previously mentioned, in some implementations, broadband access network 15 can comprise the packet switching network that such as cable data network, PON etc. can be used to divide into groups IP to be directly delivered to Set Top Box.Connect by Internet the programme content received via Internet protocol and can be generally referred to herein as IPTV.IPTV has become the common general character of system, and wherein TV and/or vision signal are distributed to subscriber by using the broadband connection of Internet protocol.Usually, IPTV system utilize the digital broadcast signal that sent by broadband connection mode and with the Set Top Box of the software programming that can process subscriber requests via the television access media resource being connected to Set Top Box.Decoder processes in Set Top Box is decoded the IP vision signal that receives and convert them to standard television signal for showing of task on TV.When adopting IP collection, on the udp port set up in advance, content is transmitted usually used as MPEG stream of packets, and MPEG grouping is encapsulated in UDP/IP data message.Also other tunnelings can be adopted, such as HTTP or RTP.
In IPTV, front end 10 is facilities that Virtual network operator provides other to serve from its broadcast/multi broadcast/clean culture programme content and by broadband access network 15.Front end 10 can comprise streaming server, for the programme content that broadcast/multi broadcast/clean culture is encoded by real-time encoder.Multicast delivery is applicable to widely disseminating of multimedia (video, audio frequency, data) content especially.On the other hand, when streaming server to be used to the service delivering of such as video request program (VOD) to individual subscriber, unicast delivery is suitable.When adopting IPTV, setting up the editing of bookmark to can be used as clean culture mpeg transport stream and being delivered, being similar to sending of VOD program.Receive the mode that the Set Top Box of editing can be above-mentioned and retrieve appropriate decruption key from KMS and cipher key storage device.
In some cases, receive in IPTV system and set up the subscriber device of the editing of bookmark not to be Set Top Box etc., but mobile device, such as mobile phone.Such mobile device typically receives transport stream according to real-time protocol (RTP) (RTP) instead of MPEG host-host protocol.Therefore, if the streaming server be such as associated with front end generates such as the video flowing of H.264 form, then it is encapsulated in mpeg 2 transport stream, then mpeg 2 transport stream is split into its single component by needing and is reconstructed they to be encapsulated in independent RTP transport stream.For completing this, RTP gateway can be used and be transformed to appropriate RTP transmission grouping the MPEG-2 provided by streaming server in front end to be transmitted grouping.During this step, original contents can be also that low resolution is more suitable for portable set to make it by transcoding.
As above about as described in Fig. 1, in some implementations, social TV service device 20 can be associated with MSO or other service providers.In this case, social TV service device 20 can be arranged in front end 10 easily, thus consolidates the function as charging and subscriber authorisation, such as.An example of such front end is illustrated in figure 6.
Front end 10 shown in Fig. 6 comprises broadcast content source 210, and it can comprise, by way of example, and satellite receiver, from broadcasting (off-air) receiver and/or content storage apparatus, such as server.Use such as ip multicast addressing that program is delivered to one or more encryption equipment 225 from content source 210.Then the encrypted device 225 of content is encrypted and is sent to the broadband access network 15 shown in Fig. 1.Typically, the current through-rate clamp (rateclamp) 220 of single-definition (SD) channel is by speed clamp to 3.75Mbps, and high definition channel current through-rate clamp 220 is clamped between about 12Mbps and 15Mbps by speed.Encryption equipment 225 content that enciphered digital is encoded under the control of condition visitation system (CAS) 250 usually, it operates together with charge system 225.CAS250 provides control extension provision parameter, and such as cryptographic keys is to support content-encrypt.Front end 110 also comprises other typical front end assemblies and services, such as: ad insertion module 260, for being inserted in content by advertisement before being delivered to encryption equipment 225; Subscriber management system (SMS) 215 system, for coordinating content sending to subscriber; Cable modem termination system (CMTS) and band (OOB) system 264 and LAN262 outward, for being placed in the data of communication mutually by various assembly.
Front end 110 also can comprise other assemblies various for providing Additional Services, and such as video request program (VOD) server 230 and network DVR240, such as, it operates under the control of SMS215.VOD service device 230 programs stored or other guide, for based on on-demand distribution to subscriber.As above marking, network DVR240 can store the content (comprise, in some cases, set up the video clipping of bookmark) that can be sent to Set Top Box in response to user's request subsequently.Other user's input requests are also served by network DVR240, comprise, such as, in direction, (such as, point out) and (such as, look back) in inverse direction the request that acclerating section object is play.Content can be provided to network DVR240 from any available content source, comprises such as content source 210.
Front end 110 also comprises social TV service device 216, all social TV service devices 20 as shown in Figure 1.Social TV service device 216 be used create in above-mentioned mode, storage and maintenance bookmark.Social TV service device 216 can adopt CAS250 to prevent the video clipping setting up bookmark from being accessed by unauthorized user as DRM scheme.Alternatively, or extraly, front end 110 also can comprise KMS280 and KSD285, for providing the object of DRM.KMS280 and KSD285 can correspond respectively to KMS60 and KSD65 shown in Fig. 1.Also will appreciate that the front-end configuration described in Fig. 6 is high level, conceptual framework, and also can adopt other front end structures.
Fig. 7 illustrates an example of the logical architecture of Set Top Box, all Set Top Box as shown in Figure 1.Set-top terminal and open cable application platform (OCAP) hardware and software environmental compatible in this example.OCAP specification is middleware software layer specification, it is intended to enable the developer of interactive television services and application design such product and they will successfully be operated in any cable television system, selects independent of machine top or television receiver hardware or operating system software.As is well known, middleware generally includes one or more software layer, its be placed on application program and the network equipment lower or physical layer " between ".Middleware is write usually, for the specific requirement of the operator of computer system, with by proprietary software that the operator of computer system buys.The central role of middleware is isolated application program and particular details of apparatus.By using middleware, application programming person does not need to know the thing about real network details, because they can depend on middleware solve the complexity of docking with network.Certainly, Set Top Box is not limited to the software/hardware framework of OCAP compatibility.In other cases, such as, Set Top Box can be compatible with MHEG, DASE or MHP (MHP) middleware.Alternatively, Set Top Box can based on proprietary framework.
With reference to figure 7, such as, the top of OCAP software " storehouse " comprises supervision application 300, electronic program guides (EPG) 302, sets up bookmark application 304 and can be deployed in any other application 306 in particular network, such as video-on-demand applications.Set up bookmark to apply 304 and provide user interface to above-mentioned social TV service.These application are running in the top of the software layer being called " enforcement engine " 312 and use known OCAPAPI308 to dock with enforcement engine.But client device also can comprise some software application or do not run in enforcement engine run directly in " the local application " 318 on the top of the operating system/middleware 314 of client device.Local application is typically write, for the particular hardware configuration 316 of such as Set Top Box.The example of such this locality application can comprise that the management of front panel function, Long-distance Control are mutual, game etc.
Fig. 8 is the flow chart of an example of the method 800 that the user of the Set Top Box illustrated for watching the video clipping setting up bookmark adopts.The method starts by setting up over the broadband network to communicate with first network element (such as, server) in step 810, and at least one bookmark resides on this first network element.Bookmark comprises the metadata of the network address of setting up the video clipping of bookmark and appointment to set up the video clipping of bookmark to be positioned at identifying video frequency program.Next, in step 820 place, once user's request, received by broadband network by Set Top Box with the metadata of specifying bookmark to be associated.In step 830, then Set Top Box uses the specified network address of the video clipping of bookmark of setting up provided in metadata to set up with the specified second network element setting up the video clipping of bookmark to be positioned to communicate.Second network element can be, such as, and the equipment Set Top Box of DVR, network DVR or can the equipment of other networking any of store video editing.In step 840, Set Top Box receives the video clipping setting up bookmark from second network element.The video clipping setting up bookmark is encrypted according to digital rights management scheme.Set up the video clipping of bookmark decrypted in step 850 and played up in step 860.
Above-mentioned process is implemented in general, multiplex or application specific processor.Such processor by perform compilation, compiling or the instruction of machine level to perform process.Those instructions can be write in accordance with description here by those of ordinary skill in the art and be transmitted on a computer-readable medium.Also source code or any other known computer design aids can be used to create instruction.Computer-readable medium can be can carry those instructions any physical medium and comprise CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic or other CDs, tape and silicon memory (such as, detachable, non-removable, volatibility or non-volatile).
Although various embodiment is here illustrated particularly and describes, will appreciate that, when not departing from spirit of the present invention and expected range, amendment of the present invention and distortion are contained by above instruction and within the scope of the appended claims.
