- the present disclosure is generally directed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission and processing over disparate computing resources. It is challenging for disparate computing resources to efficiently process, and consistently and accurately provide audio-based content items in a voice-based computing environment. For example, the disparate computing resources may not have access to the same voice models, or may have access to out of date or unsynchronized voice models that can make it challenging to accurately and consistently provide the audio-based content item. Further, the computing resources may perform redundant processing to select content items that can be reused, thereby reducing processor utilization and wasting processing resources and electrical power.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure are generally directed to a data processing system that modifies computing program output via a network.
- the data processing system can receive a request for content that is to be provided via a computing program comprising a chatbot.
- a chatbot, or artificial conversational entity can refer to a computer program that conducts a conversation via auditory, visual, or textual techniques.
- the present solution can reduce resource consumption, processor utilization, battery consumption, bandwidth utilization, size of an audio file, or amount of time consumed by a speaker by parsing voice-based instructions from an end user, selecting or reusing a parameterized content item, and routing the parameterized content item with a dialog data structure.
- the present solution can provide automated native content items for chatbots through dynamic digital product placement.
- the solution can provide a configuration of an application programming interface that allows for the chatbot to initiate or request a content selection process, as well as insert the selected content item in a dialog data structure.
- the chatbot can be a recipe chatbot.
- the recipe chatbot can provide a list of ingredients, for example, in the native voice.
- the present solution can identify placeholder in the ingredient list, select a content item via a content selection process for the placeholder, and provide the content item for insertion in the placeholder.
- the content selection process an occur in real-time, for example after the chatbot has launched or been executed and prior to playing the portion of the dialog data structure having the placeholder.
- the system can perform the content selection process in close proximity to when the placeholder would be rendered.
- the application programming interface can use a parametrically driven text to speech technique to provide content items using a native voice.
- the present solution can merge, resume, or re-establish sessions in order to reduce data processing.
- the technology can determine that a session is to be resumed, and use a content item selected in a previous session for provision in a second dialog data structure after a break in the session.
- the recipe chatbot can provide the list of ingredients and insert a brand name for an ingredient that is selected via a content selection process.
- the system can then detect a break in the session.
- the system can detect the break based on, for example, the user going to the store to purchase the ingredients.
- the recipe chatbot can re-establish the session and use the previously selected brand name as opposed to a different brand name for the same ingredients.
- the system is more efficient because the system avoids performing the significant processing associated with performing a content selection process.
- the system can resume sessions with the same chatbot, or straddle a session across multiple chatbots.
- the system can aggregate data among multiple chatbots or interface between multiple chatbots in order to reduce processor utilization by avoiding or reducing the amount of redundant processing.
- the recipe chatbot can identify a brand name soda.
- a computing device can invoke a movie chatbot.
- the movie chatbot can poll or query the recipe chatbot for the brand name of the soda, and the movie chatbot, using the same native voice, or a different native voice as compared to the recipe chatbot, can insert the same brand name of the soda.
- the system can validate a chatbot platform using a validation technique.
- the data processing system can provide a content item to a third-party chatbot server with instructions to forward the content item to the chatbot for insertion in a dialog data structure.

- the index value generated for reuse of content items across multiple chatbots can be generated using a hash of an identifier of the first placeholder field and the identifier of the computing device, where the identifier of the first placeholder field can include a keyword or topic of the placeholder field.
- the content item can be associated with multiple index values if there are multiple keywords for the placeholder field in which the content item is populated.
- the reuse of the content item can cross-over to multiple chatbots to provide further optimizations or reductions in computation or energy resource utilization.
- the second dialog data structure identified by the second chatbot may not include a second placeholder field, in which case the data processing system 102 can, via placeholder generation component 116 , insert the second placeholder field at a position in the second dialog data structure, and populate the second placeholder field with the reused content item.
- the data processing system 102 can determine that metadata or keywords associated with the second dialog data structure correspond to keywords associated with the content item, and determine, based on this relevancy or match, to insert a second placeholder and populate the second placeholder with the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can determine to insert the placeholder based on determining that a previously selected content item is relevant or corresponds to the second dialog data structure (e.g., based on one or more keyword matches, such as a broad, phrase or exact match).
- the second chatbot can identify the second dialog data structure based on the previously selected content item.
- the data processing system 102 can select a second dialog data structure having a grammar and syntax that allows for the insertion of a second placeholder field having the content item.
- the candidate second dialog data structures can include placeholder fields at different positions, and the data processing system 102 can select a second dialog data structure based on a parameter associated with the content item provided with the first dialog data structure identified via the first chatbot.
- the content item may indicate a position requirement in a dialog data structure such as: beginning portion, within first three words of sentence, within last three words of sentence, within middle 3 words, adjacent to and preceding a noun, or not adjust to or proceeding a proper noun, adjective or verb.
- the data processing system 102 can accordingly select a second dialog data structure that satisfies criteria of the content item in order to reuse the content item.
- the second chatbot can identify multiple structures or configurations for the second dialog data structure, or multiple candidate second dialog data structures, and the data processing system 102 can select the second dialog data structure based on the content item.
- the first and second chatbots can have the same or different acoustic fingerprint or voice. Since the content item can be configured for a parametrically driven text to speech technique, or otherwise converted to voice, the first and second chatbot can assign native voice parameters to the content item for provision with the respective dialog data structures. Thus, the content item can be presented in a first voice to match the voice of the first dialog data structure identified by the first chatbot, and later played in a different voice that matches the voice of the second dialog data structure identified by the second chatbot. The content item can appear to be in the native voice of the corresponding chatbot or dialog data structure.
- the data processing system 102 can reuse the content item with multiple chatbots in a same session, across multiple sessions, or after resuming a session break. For example, the data processing system 102 can identify the session break based on temporal or location thresholds, and determine to resume the session based on a subsequently received digital file (e.g., matching keywords, topic, or category), and then reuse the content item.
- the second chatbot can query the first chatbot to identify the content item used by the first chatbot, which can be stored in chatbot data data structure 132 or on third-party chatbot platform 146 .
- the data processing system 102 can include a validation component 122 designed, constructed and operational to validate a third-party chatbot platform using a validation technique. Validation can refer to determining whether the content item selected by the data processing system 102 for inclusion with the dialog data structure was indeed the content item that the third-party chatbot platform 146 provided to the chatbot.
- the data processing system 102 can perform validation to determine whether the third-party chatbot platform 146 accurately and reliably forwarded the selected content item to the chatbot.
- the third-party chatbot platform 146 may contain errors, bugs, faults, or other technical problems that result in an incorrect content item being forwarded to the chatbot.
- the data processing system 102 can determine to disable the provision of content items or otherwise alert the third-party chatbot platform 146 or chatbot provider device 108 or content provider device 106 .
- the data processing system 102 can provide a content item to a third-party chatbot server with instructions to forward the content item to the chatbot for insertion in a dialog data structure.
- the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the validation component 122 ) can then ping the chatbot for the content item, and compare the response from the chatbot with the content item that was initially provided to the third-party chatbot platform to determine whether they match, or if the third-party chatbot platform modified the content item.
- the validation component 122 can ping the chatbot for the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can ping the chatbot or computing device 104 executing the chatbot, or third-party chatbot platform 146 .
- the data processing system 102 can ping the chatbot provider device 108 , which may store information related to the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can ping the content provider device 106 for network activity associated with presentation of the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can ping the chatbot based on a time interval.
- the time interval can include a time interval subsequent to provision of the content item, or be based on a timing function.
- the timing function can produce a random time interval within a range, such as 5 minutes after transmission of the content item, 10 minutes after transmission of the content item, 30 minutes after transmission of the content item, 5 seconds after transmission of the content item, between 10 seconds and 5 minutes of transmission of the content item, between 1 minute and 30 minutes of transmission of the content item, or other range.
- a timing function that can be random or pseudo random (e.g., determined using a random number generator)
- the data processing system 102 can mitigate fraud or malicious acts of the third-party chatbot platform.
- the data processing system 102 can receive, from the chatbot, an indication of the content item responsive to the ping.
- the indication can include an identifier of the content item.
- the indication can include information about how the content item was presented, such as an identifier of the chatbot, placeholder field, keywords, timestamp, or computing device 104 .
- the data processing system 102 can compare the received indication with information associated with the content item provided by the data processing system 102 . For example, the data processing system 102 can compare a first timestamp at which the data processing system 102 transmitted the content item to the third-party chatbot platform with a second timestamp at which the chatbot inserted or presented the content item.
- the data processing system can set a validation parameter based on a difference between the first timestamp and the second timestamp. For example, if the time difference is greater than 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes or more, then the data processing system 102 can determine that the delay is an indication of a technical problem (e.g., high network latency, high processor latency, or issues with the platform code or chatbot program). The data processing system 102 can set a validation parameter based on a comparison of the identifier of the content item provided to the third-party chatbot platform 146 , and the indication of the content item received from the chatbot.
- a technical problem e.g., high network latency, high processor latency, or issues with the platform code or chatbot program.
- the data processing system 102 can set a validation parameter based on the comparison of the received indication of the content item with the identifier of the content item selected by the data processing system 102 . If the data processing system 102 determines, based on the comparison, that the content items do not match (e.g., chatbot did not receive the same content item selected by the data processing system 102 for the chatbot), the data processing system 102 can set the validation parameter to indicate invalidity (e.g., 0, N, or other alphanumeric value or symbol that indicates invalidity, fraud or malicious activity). If the data processing system 102 determines that the content items match, then the data processing system 102 can set the validation parameter to indicate that the third-party chatbot platform 146 is valid.
- invalidity e.g., 0, N, or other alphanumeric value or symbol that indicates invalidity, fraud or malicious activity
- the data processing system 102 can set the validation parameter based on a statistical analysis of multiple pings to one or more chatbots provided by the third-party chatbot platform 146 . For example, if greater than a threshold percentage (e.g., 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or more) of pings results in determining a mismatch between the content item provided by the data processing system 102 and the content item forwarded to the third-party chatbot platform 146 , then the data processing system 102 can flag or set the validation parameter as invalid for the third-party chatbot platform 146 .
- a threshold percentage e.g. 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or more
- the data processing system 102 can disable the provision of content items to chatbots provided by the third-party chatbot platform 146 responsive to the validation parameter being invalid. For example, the data processing system 102 can ignore or disregard requests for content from the third-party chatbot platform 146 , thereby reducing computational resource utilization by not wasting processor and memory utilization by performing a content selection process for a third-party chatbot platform 146 that may be a malicious actor or otherwise have technical problems that result in the presentation of an incorrect content item or delayed presentation of the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can receive indications of interactions with the content item.
- the interaction with the content item can occur via an interface or component of the computing device 104 .
- the data processing system 102 can record, store or otherwise monitor and track the interactions with the content item, and information about or associated with the interaction.
- the data processing system 102 can further record, store or otherwise tag the interaction as being valid based on application of the validation technique to the third-party chatbot platform 146 . For example, if the data processing system 102 determines that the content item selected and provided by the data processing system to the third-party chatbot platform 146 matches the content item presented by the chatbot, the data processing system 102 can record a subsequent interaction with the content item via the computing device 104 as being a valid interaction.
- the data processing system 102 can mark or flag the interaction as invalid.
- the data processing system 102 can generate and transmit an alert to a content provider device 106 responsive to detecting the invalid interaction.
- the content provider device 106 can correspond to the provider of the content item selected by the data processing system 102 , which can be different form the provider of the content item that was actually provided to and presented by the chatbot.
- the data processing system 102 can encrypt the content item prior to transmitting the content item to the third-party chatbot platform 146 .
- the chatbot can include the key to decrypt the content item prior to presenting the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can securely transmit the content item without the content item being manipulated by an intermediary device.
- the encryption technique can include a hash function.
- the encryption technique can include hashing the content item with salts. Salts can refer to data (e.g., random data or predetermined data that is not known to the third-party chatbot platform 146 ) that can be used as an additional input to a function that hashes the content item.
- the data processing system 102 can store the content item encrypted with a hash function and salts.
- the data processing system 102 can provide the encrypted content item to the third-party chatbot platform 146 for forwarding to the chatbot.
- the chatbot can be configured with a decryption technique to decrypt the content item encrypted with the hash function and salts such that the content item can be recovered and presented.
- the third-party chatbot platform 146 may not have access to the encryption function, hash function, or salts, a fraudulent or incorrect content item provided by the third-party chatbot platform 146 to the chatbot would not be properly decrypted and presented by the chatbot.
- the encryption technique can be used to prevent the fraudulent or inaccurate presentation of content items by the chatbot.
