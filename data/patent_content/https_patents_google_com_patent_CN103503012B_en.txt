Embodiment
It is described herein for the use to social networks (for example, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, YOUTUBE, LINKEDIN etc.)
Family provides the technology of advertisement (for example, text based e-advertising, electric video advertisement, interactive electronic game etc.), method, is
System and computer program product.Specifically, can the user based on social networks by select advertisement probability provide a user
Advertisement.Can be based on the much information (base of advertizing, advertisement and user in such as social networks obtained from social networks
In the movable degree of correlation of the user on social networks and/or advertisement with that the social network page (example of advertisement will be presented thereon
Such as, the user profiles page, colony's page etc.) the degree of correlation) determine select probability.
Various computer systems use select probability, such as clicking rate (ratio of user " click " advertisement) is with determination
Which (which) advertisement will be selected for given user.For example, in response to search inquiry, search engine computer system can be based on
Advertisement is presented to user in the probability of selection advertisement by user.The probability of such selection can be based on advertisement with being looked into response to search
Ask the degree of correlation of the result of page searching presented to user.Selected as comparison determination that can be based on search inquiry and advertisement
Probability.If for example, user submits the search inquiry for " running shoes ", the advertised to specific running shoes brand can be determined
One advertisement has the bigger association probability being easily selected by a user of the second advertisement than being related to camera.It can be based on such as by search inquiry
The such select probability of interest acquisition to running shoes that " running shoes " are indicated, that user expresses.
Multiple technologies (such as auction) can for based on select probability be user select advertisement.For example, in example auction
In, advertiser's submission of quotation, these quotations indicate that advertiser is ready the number that their advertisement is paid is presented to user
Volume., can when advertising opportunity becomes available (for example, the webpage of supply request, the webpage has the retaining space for advertisement)
To determine select probability for advertisement.The select probability of determination can indicate if in particular advertisement chance present (for example, with
The specific webpage presentation of social networks) then user will select the probability of advertisement for advertisement.For giving advertising opportunity, it may be determined that
Select probability and for advertisement quotation to advertisement give a mark and rank.Advertisement can be given a mark with various ways.For example, can lead to
Cross and be multiplied by the select probability for being used for advertisement (being used to give advertising opportunity) to give a mark to advertisement for the quotation of advertisement.Can be by
Advertisement is ranked according to the fraction of determination, and (wherein x is advertisement available room (slot) for the advertisement that x is ranked before can selecting
Number) for present.For the advertisement of each selection, the minimum number that correspondence advertiser pays can be in selection
The fraction for the advertisement ranked below advertisement removes the select probability of the advertisement for selection.
For example, corresponding selection probability c can be based on1-nWith advertiser's quotation b1-nFor advertisement a1-nIt is determined that point of seniority among brothers and sisters
Number s1-n(wherein s1It is the fraction and s of highest seniority among brothers and sistersnIt is the fraction of minimum seniority among brothers and sisters).For example, fraction can be ranked, so that
Obtain c1*b1(s1)≥c2*b2(s2)≥...cn*bn(sn).Can will be that advertisement is presented in advertisement available room by advertiser
a1And number (the p paid1) it is defined as p1=s2/c1.Using this auction technology, advertiser is based on the selection for advertisement
Probability pays less when the advertisement with bigger select probability is presented, and the select probability is point for determining payment amount
It is female.This auction technology provides excitation higher quality to be presented and more relevant advertisement to advertiser, and these advertisements will have
Bigger select probability and advertiser is allowed to spend less when being presented to user therewith.
When advertisement is presented for particular advertisement chance, the accurate select probability determined for advertisement is especially when in social network
Network presents possible difficult during advertisement in setting.It is described herein for more accurately determining for user's presentation to social networks
Technology, method, system and the computer program product of the select probability of advertisement.Can based on it is relevant with social networks it is a variety of because
Element (such as user on social networks propagating advertisement, advertisement and check advertisement user the degree of correlation and/or advertisement with will be at it
On provide a user (for example, display) advertisement the page (for example, profile page of another user) the degree of correlation) determine to social activity
The select probability for the advertisement that the user of network is presented.
Advertizing is related to of the following action of the first user based on social networks from the first user to social networks
Two user's propagating advertisements, the action indicates interest of first user to advertisement.Such action of first user can be on wide
The propagation of announcement is explicitly and/or implicitly.For example, it is possible to use optional user interface (UI) element (for example, button, link etc.)
It is presented advertisement, user can select these UI elements with to the other users of social networks explicitly propagating advertisement.Can to
Propagating user has acquaintance relation (for example, friend relation, colleague, kinsfolk, the good friend of good friend, checking mutual profile
User etc.) other users propagating advertisement.To user presentation interface is propagated his/her acquaintance can be indicated (for example, good
Friend, colleague, classmate, the good friend of good friend) in should be transmitted one or more acquaintance of advertisement.
In another example, can be based on the interacting of user and advertisement (for example, selection is linked, broadcast with what advertisement was presented
Put be embedded in advertisement video, with the game interaction that provides with advertisement etc.) implicitly propagating advertisement.With as advertisement
Interaction can be interesting to advertisement with instruction user, and advertisement can be made to be propagated to acquaintance of the user on social networks.Society
Network system is handed over to seek the permission of user implicitly to propagate their ad interest to other users.
The advertisement propagated can be presented to user with following information, the message identification is from the use of its propagating advertisement
Family.If, can be as following message be to his/her good friend for example, the first user is to his/her good friend's propagating advertisement
Advertisement is presented, the message indicates that the first user is interesting to advertisement and/or likes advertisement.
In another example of advertizing, social networking system can provide a user polymer grade information with advertisement.
Such polymer grade information can include a variety of details interacted of the acquaintance on user and advertisement, such as like, mark,
Propagate or comment on the name and/or number of the acquaintance of advertisement.For example, can with indicate the first user selection and/or
Like the total information of the good friend of advertisement and with the information for identifying most recent good friend that is chosen and/or liking advertisement
Advertisement is presented to the first user of social networks.
As described further below, various technologies can be at least being determined for advertisement based on advertizing
Select probability.
Fig. 1 is concept map, and the concept map is shown for providing showing for advertisement to the user of social networks based on select probability
Example ad server system 100.Specifically, the various aspects determination that ad server system 100 can be based on social networks
Select probability, these aspect can it is whether more with instruction user or it is less may select advertisement, such as advertizing, user
Interest and/or will with its present advertisement the page content.
The concept map described in Fig. 1 also includes social network server system 102, the social network server system 102
It is arranged to ask the advertisement that will be presented with social network content from ad server system 100.Fig. 1, which also describes, to be shown
Example client computing device, the client computing device is arranged to ask the society from social network server system 102
Hand over Web content (for example, the profile page of user on social networks).
Ad server system 100, social network server system 102 and client computing device 104 can be individually
A variety of computing devices (such as laptop computer, desktop computer, mobile phone, smart phone, computer server system or
Person its any combinations) in any computing device.Ad server system 100, social network server system 102 and client
Computing device 104 can pass through a variety of communication channels (such as internet, LAN (LAN), wide area network (WAN), Virtual Private Network
(VPN), wireless network (for example, wifi, cellular phone network, 3G/4G data networks etc.) or its any combinations) in it is any
Communication channel communicates.
As step A (106) in this example describes, client computing device 104 is to social network server system
System 102 provides the request of the profile page for user U8.In the example present, client computing device 104 and user U1
(108) associate.Client computing device 104 can previously received electronic document (for example, webpage) and/or application (for example,
Independent social networking application etc.), user U1 passes through the electronic document and/or application generation request.For example, being calculated using client
Equipment 104, user U1 can previously have requested that social networks webpage (for example, HTML (HTML) document,
FLASH documents etc.), the social networks is by the trustship of social network server system 102 and includes optional link, the optional link
Point to the profile page of the good friend for U1 on social networks.In response to user U1 select request webpage in user U8
Corresponding link, client computing device 104 can be such that request is transmitted to social network server system 102.
In response to receiving request, social network server system 102 can start to serve request.Serve such ask
Asking can include fetching with the information for asking to associate (for example, fetching user U8 and having indicated to go out in his/her profile page
Existing Wen Wenben words and/or image) and/or format data for being presented to user U1 (for example, generation includes the letter fetched
The html document of breath).Such as by step B (108) Suo Shi, the request of social network server system 102 comes from ad server system
100 one or more advertisement by the profile page offer with the user U8 such as asked by client computing device 104.
The information that social network server system 102 can include with request on user U1 and/or user U8 (and/or makes this
The information of sample can be accessed by ad server system 100), such as it is related to user U1 and/or U8 on social graph 110
Partial information, the social network profile information (for example, interest, colony's subordinate relation etc.) for user U1 and/or U8 and/or
Information (for example, content that profile page is checked, comments on, liked etc.) on user U1 and/or U8 social networking activities.
The social networks of user can be rendered as to the figure of user's (node) as illustrated as social graph 210,
These users's (node) are connected with each other by acquaintance relation (side).Acquaintance relation can be explicit among the user of social networks
Relation.For example, it can be explicit that the good friend of the mutual agreement among two users, which indicates,.Acquaintance relation can also be implicit
's.Even if for example, user U1 and U7 do not have explicit friend relation, if user's U1 visitor U7 profile page, user
U1 is interacted via the interface (for example, chatroom, mail exchange etc.) on social networks with user U7 and/or user U1 and U7 is common
Shared good friend's (for example, they have explicit friend relation with user U3, U6 and U8), then acquaintance relation still can be implicitly
It is present between them.
There are multiple users in social networks, when wherein these users have interconnection acquaintance relation, gained social graph (example
Such as, social graph 110) may size it is very big.The part related to user of social networks can include connecting with the direct of user
Connect and the threshold distance (for example, good friend of good friend etc.) of user in the graphic in connection.The relevant portion of social networks
Following spirte can also be included, user is the part of the spirte.Spirte can be the following part of social networks figure,
The part includes the colony of following user, these users mutually have many acquaintance relations but with the user beyond colony
Hardly there is acquaintance relation.
Asked in response to being received from social network server system 102, ad server system 100 is such as by step C (112)
It is shown to perform auction to select one or more advertisement that provided to user U1 with U8 profile page.Can be based on use
The determination of selection advertisement is general when advertisement will be presented with user U8 profile page in the quotation of display advertisement and user U1
Rate performs such act --- and it is similar to auction technology discussed above.Example ad quotation is presented in table 114, the table is retouched
Paint the quotation $ 1.00 for being respectively used to advertisement A1-A3, $ 1.50 and $ 2.00.Table 114 also includes following information, and the information indicates wide
A1-A3 is accused to associate with topic music, physical culture and music respectively.The pass that these topics are offered as advertiser can be provided
Keyword and/or user interest.
Ad server system 100 can determine to be used for user U1 and advertisement based on the much information relevant with social networks
A1-A3 select probability.In the example of description, ad server system 100 uses advertizing information (table 116), social activity
Network subscriber information (table 118) and the information on social graph 110.Table 116 describes the user couple described in social graph 110
Advertisement A1-A3 example is propagated.For example, instruction user U3 and U8 the propagating advertisement A1 of table 116 and user's U7 propagating advertisements A2.With
Family U3, U7 and U8 can use any communications in a variety of communications (such as described above clearly and hidden
Formula advertizing) it have propagated advertisement A1 and A2.
Table 118 describes the example information of the user U1-U3 and U6-U8 on such as being provided in social graph 110.It is specific and
Speech, table 118 describes user U1-U3 and U6-U8 to physical culture and the simplification interest of music.Such interest can clearly be carried by user
For (for example, user delivers their interest on their profile page) and/or from user action (for example, to interesting
Comment that theme is discussed, check content with interest relationship etc.) implicitly obtain.
Influence of the user to social networks can be with action of the instruction user on social networks to other on social networks
The influential degree of behavior of user.For example, if influential user made comments in his/her profile, the comment
Certain movie " fine " and " must see " is indicated, then the good friend of influential user more likely can before go to the cinema.Can be with base
The influence of user is determined in activity level of the user on social networks and/or acquaintance relation.The activity level of user can be
Interaction (for example, the comment delivered, message for other users sending, the new good friend that makes friends with etc.) of the user on social networks
Measurement.
The influence of user can also be based on the acquaintance relation of user quantity and/or conspicuousness.Use with more good friends
Family can more have an impact than the user with less good friend.For example, can be true by the user with greater number of acquaintance relation
The user being set to than the acquaintance relation with lesser number more has an impact.The influence fraction of user can also the acquaintance based on user
The conspicuousness of relation.User with more notable acquaintance relation can have than with less notable acquaintance relation to social networks
The bigger influence of user.The conspicuousness of the acquaintance relation of user can influence level and/or phase based on the acquaintance of user
Whether knowledge relation connects the independent spirte of social networks.In some instances, the acquaintance of user and more influential user are closed
System can than with the acquaintance relation with less influential user significantly (for example, the influence of more influential user can be with
Make more influential customer impact further user and allow the subject content of influence to cross over social networks more wide-scale distribution).
In other examples, the acquaintance relation of user and less influential user can be than the acquaintance relations with more influential user more
Significantly (for example, more likely influenceing less influential user).
In the example of description, represent that user U1-U3 and U6-U8 influence are low for high, neutralization, wherein with " height " influence
User's ratio of level have " in " user of influence level more has an impact.
Ad server system 100 can be used to be used respectively from table 116 and 118 on advertizing and social networks
The information of family information and the other information do not described are to determine that user U1 will select advertisement A1-A3 probability.For example, advertisement clothes
Business device system 100 can determine user U1 than with not interesting topic U1 about and U1 acquaintance not yet propagate second
Advertisement more likely selects to be related to the interesting topics of U1 and the U1 influential acquaintance propagation for being interested on same topic
The first advertisement.
Ad server system 100 can use the other information including non-social network information to determine that user U1 will be selected
Select the probability of advertisement.For example, ad server system 100 can be based on the population for user U1 and/or for other users
(such as age, sex, occupation, income, education and/or geographical position determine the select probability for user U1 to information.
Exemplary step for carrying out the auction described in step C (112) includes step 120-126, and these steps are related to
And determine the select probability for user U1 and advertisement A1-A3, the select probability based on determination and quotation for advertisement to advertisement A1-A3
Give a mark and auction winner is selected based on fraction.
With reference to step 120, ad server system 100 based on user U1 such as in social network user information table 118
The interest of instruction determines U1 selection advertisements A1-A3 probability.As shown above, can be from a variety of source (profiles of such as user
The page, comment is delivered and/or the page is checked) in mark and/or infer user interest.More connect with advertisement A1-A3 subject content
The user interest of near-earth alignment can produce the more maximum probability selected by user U1.Further, since user interest can be with the time
Change, it is possible to consider the following time limit (timeframe) to determine select probability, user expresses emerging within the time limit
Interest.If for example, user is interesting to both physical culture and music, but user has recently generated and checked more more than music
The content on physical culture, then can determine user on the advertisement relevant with physical culture have the select probability bigger than music.
There is provided and the example of the user U1 select probability for advertisement A1-A3 is determined in table 128 based on step 120.
In this simplification example, advertisement is used for the interesting determination of music (music is advertisement A1 and A3 theme) based on user U1
A1-A3 select probability is more than the select probability for advertisement A2.In contrast, advertisement A2 is related to physical culture.For representing selection
Scope is from 1 to 10 in the example present for the value of probability, wherein 1 is minimum select probability and 10 be highest select probability.It is a variety of
Any value in value and value scope and value scope can be for representing select probability (for example, 0.0-1.0；-10-10；1-100；Deng
Deng).It is respectively 4,1 and 4 that table 128, which provides the example selection probability for advertisement A1-A3 produced from step 120,.
In step 122, ad server system 100 is based on the use such as asked by client computing device 108 and user U1
The select probability that the interest adjustment of family U8 profile page and/or user U8 is determined from step 120.In advertisement and user U8 letter
Similarity between the shelves page (example login page) and/or interest is bigger, and user U1 is bigger by the probability for selecting advertisement.With
The request of the family U1 profile page for U8 can be with instruction user U1 to the content that is included on U8 profile page and/or right
Interest on user U8 understands more interesting.So, in the subject content of advertisement and user U8 profile page and/or emerging
Bigger similarity degree between interest can will select the more maximum probability of advertisement with instruction user U1.
Table 130 provides example adjustment after applying step 122 to the select probability described in table 128.Assuming that user
U8 is also interesting to music and advertisement A1 and A3 is relevant with music, then the select probability for advertisement A1 and A3 can increase.
The increased quantity of select probability (can such as be associated according to many factors in the subject content of advertisement and with the login page of user
Content and/or interest between similarity degree and/or related content in the login page of user high-lighting (for example,
The content that the near top of login page is shown compares the content shown near bottom) and change.As shown in table 130, use
6 are increased in advertisement A1 and A3 select probability.
Step 124 is related to general for user U1 and advertisement A1-A3 selection to advertisement A1-A3 propagation adjustment based on user
Rate.As provided in table 116, advertisement A1 and A2 have been have propagated, but advertisement A3 is not yet transmitted.User U3 and U8
It has propagated advertisement A1, and user U7 propagating advertisement A2.User U3, U7 and U8 can use various propagation skills
Art (communications such as discussed above with respect to explicit and implicit propagation) have propagated advertisement A1 and A2.The advertisement of other users
The a variety of instructions for the probability that advertisement A1-A3 will be selected on user U1 can be provided by propagating (and without advertizing).For example, advertisement
Propagation can indicate that advertisement is that high-quality advertisement (for example, advertisement include attracting image) and/or its promotional user have emerging
The product and/or product offer (for example, advertisement is promoted to sell with promotion price) of interest.
Can be based on many factors (such as with the influence fraction of propagation user-association and/or in propagation user with being its choosing
The relationship type (for example, good friend, good friend of good friend etc.) selected between the user of advertisement is weighted to advertizing.As described above
Like that, influence fraction can represent influence level of the user to social networks.Propagation of the more influential user to advertisement can be with
Indicate that the user for checking advertisement has the select probability bigger than the propagation of less influential user.Similarly, with checking use
Family has the propagation closer to user's (for example, two users are the direct good friends of the frequent communication on social networks) of relation can be with
Indicate to check that another user is with checking that user has farther connection with the bigger select probability of the propagation than another user
(for example, checking that user checked the profile of another user once before one month).
For example, user U3, U7 and U8 are depicted as having have propagated advertisement in table 116.As shown in table 118, user
U3 has the high influence level on social networks, and user U7 has the low influence level on social networks, and user U8 has
On the middle influence level of social networks.User U3 and U8 are depicted in social graph 100 has direct acquaintance with user U1
Relation, and user U7 is depicted as having indirect acquaintance relation with U1., can be right based on these factors (except other factorses)
User U3 is more more to advertisement A1 propagation weighting than user U8 to advertisement A1 propagation, and latter can be propagated than user U7 pairs
Advertisement A2 propagation weighting is more.In polymerization, propagation of the user U3 and U8 to A1 can be carried based on user U7 to A2 propagation
For will select to indicate that bigger user U1 will select to indicate as advertisement A1 as advertisement A2 than U1.
Weighting is it is also contemplated that propagate whether user has an impact on the theme of advertisement.For example, influential on physical culture
First user and it can provide the propagation for being related to the advertisement of physical culture wide on being checked on the influential second user of music
The different instructions of the probability of user's selection of announcement.In such exemplary scene, the propagation of the first user can be used based on first
Family has an impact on the theme of advertisement more strongly to be indicated to check that user will select advertisement come the propagation than second user.For example, the
One user can deliver many contents (for example, fraction, team and team member's analysis) on physical culture.First user can be in society
Formation reputation is quite to be known enough to com in out of the rain on physical culture and his/her on the meaning relevant with physical culture among handing over the other users of network
Seeing can more likely be accepted (as showed by advertizing) than the other users without such reputation.
Can also according to can thereon present advertisement the page (for example, in this example for user U8 profile page,
Colony's page (propagates member, the page in the content (for example, comment) for showing propagation user's generation thereon that user is the colony
Face)) association user whether perform propagation to advertizing weight.For example, user U3 and U8 are depicted as having have propagated
Advertisement A1.When it is determined that user U1 will select advertisement that the profile page with user U8 is presented, propagation that can be to user U8
Propagation weighting than user U3 is more.
In some implementations, it is present in the user of propagating advertisement and advertising opportunity on the profile page for propagating user
When (for example, user U8 propagating advertisements A1 and advertisement are selected for presenting on user U8 profile page), advertisement is passed
Maximum quantity (for example, propagation of the user U8 to A1 can be weighted maximum quantity) can be weighted by broadcasting.Such weighting scheme
The following fact can be reflected：By the request of the profile page for propagating user, check that user has indicated that he/her is current right
Propagate user and/or following information interesting, propagate user and find that the information is important to being enough on his/her profile page
Including/allow the information.The interest to propagating user based on this performance, checks that user more likely can fill to propagating user
The interesting advertisement propagated is divided to be interested in.
Can also be (alone or with reference to one or more weighting scheme in weighting scheme discussed above) using not
The other weighting schemes for advertizing being described herein.
The example that table 132 provides the select probability to describing in table 130 after applying step 124 is adjusted.Based on
The various adjustment to select probability based on advertizing (and associated weight value for advertizing), table 132 shows to be used for
Propagation of the advertisement A1 select probability based on user U3 and U8 and increase, for A2 propagation of the select probability based on user U2 and
Increase, and be based on reducing without propagation for A3 select probability.As described in the example present, the choosing for A1
Select the probability increase quantity bigger than the select probability for being used for A2.This difference can be attributed to propagation more more than advertisement A2
Any weighted factor in A1 and/or various weighted factors discussed above is (for example, user U3 and U8 and U1 has directly acquaintance
Relation, and user U7 and U1 has indirect acquaintance relation).
Step 120-124 can be performed in any order or in any combinations.In addition to step 120-124 and/
Or step of replacing 120-124 can also carry out the additional step that does not describe to determine at given specific user (for example, user U1)
When select probability and advertising opportunity (for example, providing advertisement on user U8 profile page) for advertisement.
In step 126, ad server system 100 is based on the select probability of determination (as described in table 132) and (such as
Describe in table 114) association quotation to advertisement A1-A3 give a mark.Fraction can be used as the auction for advertising opportunity
Part and select advertisement on user U8 profile page to user U1 present.Such auction can be retouched with more than
The example auction technology stated is similar.As described in table 134, by the way that auction number is multiplied by into select probability to advertisement
A1-A3 gives a mark.Can based on obatained score to advertisement rank, and can according to the number of advertisement available chance select one or
The multiple auction winners of person.If for example, by as user U8 profile page is to user U1 two advertisements of presentation, can select
The advertisement of the first two seniority among brothers and sisters is selected to present.In this example, have largest score selection wide among advertisement A1-A3 based on A1
A1 is accused to present.
As showed as table 134, even if advertisement A1 has minimum association quotation among advertisement A1-A3, still select
It is selected to present to user U1.As described above, advertisement A1 based on it by association probability that user U1 is selected and
With highest seniority among brothers and sisters.Such ad selection techniques can provide excitation to generate following advertisement to advertiser, these advertisements
The bigger association probability being easily selected by a user will be generated.Advertiser can be by providing a user more in a kind of mode so done
High-quality and/or more relevant advertisement, these users transfer that more likely such as the interest to advertisement can be showed by advertizing.
As a result, such ad selection techniques can be beneficial to following user, by the way that higher quality and/or more relevant advertisement is presented
(for more more low quality and/or less relevant advertisements) can improve the social networks experience of these users.
In addition to improving the selected possibility of advertiser, they can also have bigger selection in their advertisement
Pay less when advertisement is presented to user during probability.For example, being the first dispensing advertisement using auction technology described above
(A1) number paid can be p1=s2/c1, wherein s2It is to be used to the second fraction for delivering advertisement (A3) remove for the first throwing
Put the select probability of advertisement.It is denominator to make for the select probability of winning advertisement client, and advertiser is in the selection for advertisement
Pay less when probability is bigger.In the example present, it is that the number that A1 is paid can be $ 0.67 (6 divided by 9), this last base
In the select probability (9) for A1 less than the quotation for A1.As described above, kinds of schemes may be used to determine
When advertiser is responsible for paying such number, such as the advertisement scheme paid by impression (pays number when advertisement is checked
Volume), the advertisement scheme that is paid per click (payment amount when advertisement is chosen) and/or the scheme that is paid by exchanging be (in advertisement
The payment amount when sale of product is completed).
As described above, can also in the advertisement propagated to other users presentation user at least part base
Paid in their propagation to the user of propagating advertisement.For example, user U3 and/or U8, which can be received to user U1, is presented advertisement
A part for the income ($ 0.67) generated in A1.Can with various ways (such as take in percentage (for example, 1%, 5%,
10%th, 25% etc.), fixed number (for example, 0.01,0.05,0.10 etc.) and/or action based on user make advertisement to
The number that conspicuousness (for example, advertisement would not be presented to user in the propagation of no user) when another user is presented is determined) determine
The number paid to such user.
Such as shown in step D (136), ad server system 100 can provide choosing to social network server system 102
The advertisement A1 (138) selected.Social network server system 102 can generate user U8 profile page (for example, collecting and collecting
The information that will be provided on user U8 profile page) and advertisement A1 can be added to the page (for example, adding generation to webpage
Code, the code makes advertisement A1 be retrieved and/or as profile page is shown).

In addition in step 312 processing request, social network server system 304 can be in response to calculating from client
Equipment 302 receives a request to ask the advertisement (ad) (step 314) from ad server system 306.
Ad server system 306 receives the request (step for sales promotion information from social network server system 304
316) and the association advertizing (step 318) of multiple advertisements and second user is identified.For example, referring to Fig. 1, Advertisement Server
System 306 can identify the advertisement A1-A3 described in table 114 and describe in table 116 on user U3, U7 and U8
The example information of the association advertizing of (example second user).The colony of second user can be limited on social networks and
One user has the second user of at least threshold value acquaintance relation (for example, friend relation).
The previous propagation of second user can include explicit advertizing and implicit advertizing, than wide as described above
Accuse and propagate.The previous advertisement of second user, which is propagated, can make advertisement with second user there is acquaintance to close to social networks
One or more other users of system are presented.For example, referring to Fig. 1, previous propagation of the user U3 to advertisement A1 can make
The advertisement other users that warp-wise has been described in social graph 100 (such as user U2) are propagated.Can be with following information
The advertisement of propagation is presented to other users, the second user of the message identification propagating advertisement.Extended on exemplified earlier, can be with
With following information (for example, near advertisement or on word) to U2 present advertisement A1, the information indicates wide
Accuse and propagated (for example, recommendation) by user U3.
It can be determined based on influence level of the second user to social networks for each second user in second user
One or more influence fraction (step 320).Multiple technologies (than technology as described above) can be used to determine influence
Fraction.For example, at least can determine to be used for based on activity level of each second user on social networks in second user
The influence fraction of second user.Influence fraction can include based on second user on advertisement subject content to social networks
The subject content influence fraction that influence level is determined.Can be based on the determination for performing the corresponding second user previously propagated
One or more influence fraction weights (step 322) to each previous propagate in previously propagation.For example, referring to Fig. 1, have
The previous propagation of the more influential user (for example, user U3) of bigger influence fraction can have than with smaller influence fraction
Less influential user (for example, user U8) the bigger determination of previous propagation weights.
Ad server system 306 can determine the first user to the subject contents of multiple advertisements one or more
One interest level (step 324).For example, referring to the step 120 described above with respect to Fig. 1, ad server system 100 is based on U1
User U1 selection advertisements A1-A3 probability is determined to the interest level of the determination of advertisement A1-A3 subject content.Can be based on
The content generated by the first user and the content associatedly checked by the first user on social networks or with social networks are closed
The subject content of connection determines the first interest level for the first user.
In some implementations, the request for advertisement of reception can include following information, and the information is indicated will be to
First user provides advertisement and is used as the part with the social network page of the 3rd user-association of social networks.For example, referring to Fig. 1
The example of middle description, being directed to from social network server system 102 indicates to the user U1 requests 108 that advertisement is presented will be with
And advertisement is presented for user U8 (user of example the 3rd) profile page.Such 3rd user can be determined to multiple advertisements
Subject content one or more second interest level (step 326)., can for example, referring to the step 122 described in Fig. 1
With based on the select probability determined with user U8 and/or his/her the profile page subject content associated for user U1.Can
