As described above, compared with submitting to the user only comprising content of text, the user comprising photo or video submits the stronger instruction usually providing interest to.Therefore, in some embodiments, content delivery adjustment System 110 can analyze the user's submission comprising photo at least in part, to determine how to regulate content delivery.The operation of content delivery adjustment and the object identification means 116 of content delivery adjustment System 110, subject identification device 118, geographic position identity device 120 and determining device 122 of trooping is described with reference to figure 2A, 2B and 2C.
With reference to figure 2A, it is the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure sent for Suitable content, and process 200 is analyzed and submitted to the user of network (202).Network can be the network comprising member community, and this member community is the suitable subset of the member of another network.Such as, network can be the member of the social networks represented by social networking system 108, and other network can be all users of the Internet.
In some embodiments, content delivery adjustment System 110 is coupled to social networking system 108 communicatedly.So, content delivery adjustment System 110 can receive user's submission or calling party is submitted to (such as, from user submit data thesaurus 124), and user can be analyzed and submit user's submission group such as with mark with general character to, such as example, common theme (what such as, user submitted to troops).Such as, user submits to can comprise photo, and as described below, content delivery adjustment System 110 can determine general character based on the theme of photo.
What content delivery adjustment System 110 can use the user of mark to submit to troop to determine or adjust which content should such as be sent to social network members by social networking system 108.Such as, trooping of mark can be included in five minutes that put up between window phase, relevant with city, the Oklahoma wind spout of Oklahoma 10,000 users and submit to.Based on troop interior user submit to submission rate (such as, the number that the user that section receives in preset time submits to), content delivery adjustment System 110 can be determined should be delivered to social network members by social networking system 108 about the news feed of wind spout.
In some embodiments, the analysis that user submits to comprises the process 202A-202D submitted to for each user.Process 200 identifying user submits the time (202A) occurred to.At some embodiments, content delivery adjustment System 110 can be submitted to the time (such as, as the metadata from photo is determined) of the photograph taking in the time or user being posted to social networking system 108 to carry out identifying user based on user and submit the time occurred to.Such as, content delivery adjustment System 110 can based on server or content delivery adjustment System 110 system clock at other calculation element effective wherein, by utilize user submit to be posted to social networking system 108 time " time mark " user submit to, come identifying user submit to occur time.In some embodiments, the user that content delivery adjustment System 110 is accessed from user submit data thesaurus 124 by social networking system 108 submits to, and mark from user submit to the metadata be associated, user submits time of generation to.
Process 200 identifies the one or more objects (202B) represented in the photo submitted to from user.But any visible or tangible element caught in object photo or represent or thing.Such as, object can be people, building, vehicle or weather events, here only for several example.In some embodiments, object identification means 116 can identify the object represented in the photo be included in user's submission.The object that object identification means 116 can use various technology to come in identification photograph, such as scale invariant feature conversion (SIFT), rim detection, point of interest detect, pixel matching and other image processing techniques be applicable to.Process 202B is described with further reference to Fig. 2 B, and it is the example photo 210 submitted to from user.
Photo 210 comprises the expression of fire truck 212 and traffic sign 216 in the foreground and the expression at background Bridge 214.So, submit in response to putting up the user comprising photo 210, fire truck 212 such as can be designated the first object and bridge 214 is designated the second object by object identification means 116.Such as, object identification means 116 can use pixel or characteristic matching process, by the pixel of the photo of the first fire truck 212 or feature (" pixel groups ") with from have known theme image corpus (such as, be stored in by the addressable view data thesaurus of object identification means 116) the photo of fire truck or the pixel of image or feature compare, fire truck 212 to be designated the object in photo 210.As used herein, the reference picture that can compare with the photo submitted to from user can be image or object or the image with known theme or object (multiple) characteristic or (multiple) feature.In some embodiments, if the number of the matched pixel between reference picture with the pixel groups from photo (such as, fire truck 212) or feature exceedes similarity threshold, then pixel groups can be designated object by object identification means 116.Such as, similarity threshold can be 90% coupling or 90% similarity of pixel, the threshold value cosine similarity value that feature based vector compares, or any other coupling or similarity.
Process 200 determines based on the one or more objects submitted to from user the theme (202C) that user submits at least partly.In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can determine based on the identification of object (such as, based on known image, shared object and the identifiable design concept that such as identifies) of the photo in submitting to from user the theme that user submits at least partly.Such as, subject identification device 118 can based on the mark of fire truck 212 as the object in photo 210, and the user determining to comprise photo 210 submits to comprise has the theme relevant with fire truck with fire.
Subject identification device 118 can determine the theme that user submits in many ways, the metadata of the image of the photo such as from submit to similar in appearance to user, from trustship similar in appearance to the webpage of the image of photo, from the search inquiry of the Search Results selected with reference to the image similar in appearance to photo, from the content of text be included in user's submission, or their some combinations.As described above, in some embodiments, object identification means 116 can based on the matching process (such as, pixel for pixel or feature are to the comparison process of feature) to reference picture, and the pixel groups of the photo in submitting to from user is designated object.In this embodiment, be stored in each reference picture in reference image data thesaurus and be associated (such as, the metadata of each reference picture comprise reference picture keyword) by one or more keyword.
Subject identification device 118 can from the meta-data extraction keyword of reference picture of pixel groups being matched with (or being defined as similar) photo, and the theme that user submits to be appointed as in the keyword of reference picture that the user of Self Matching submits in the future.Such as, if the reference picture being matched with fire truck 212 is associated with keyword " fire ", then subject identification device 118 can determine that the user comprising photo 210 submits the theme with fire to.It is similar or identical with reference picture (such as, crosscorrelation, scale invariant feature are changed, the classification in same subject field) that other technology except images match process can be used for the object identity in photo.How object no matter in photo is mated or is defined as similar with reference picture (" reference picture mated "), and subject identification device 118 can determine based on the keyword be associated with the reference picture of coupling the theme that user submits to.
In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can use the reference picture of coupling to carry out query search system 112, and then determine or (multiple) keyword (such as, from indexes cached 114) on accessed web page, the reference picture of this webpage trustship coupling.These Web Page Key Words can be appointed as the theme that corresponding user submits to by subject identification device 118.This Web Page Key Words can be the exercise question of corresponding webpage, the title on corresponding webpage, the annotation of the reference picture that corresponding webpage mates or explanation etc.
In some embodiments, indexes cached 114 is the reference pictures store Web Page Key Words of trustship on webpage.So, subject identification device 118 can based on the request of specific matching reference picture or the related web page keyword of accessing from indexes cached 114 or search system 112.Such as, subject identification device 118 can use the coupling reference picture of fire truck 212 to ask the Web Page Key Words of one or more webpages of the coupling reference picture from trustship fire truck 212 from search system 112, and the one or more keywords in these Web Page Key Words is appointed as the theme of user's submission.As described below, specify or determine that the particular keywords of the theme that user submits to can based on keyword in webpage or term frequencies.
In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can carry out communicating with search system 112 and provide coupling reference picture to search system 112.Subsequently, search system 112 can provide Query Result be its by the one or more search inquiries selected, its reference picture mated with reference to (such as, comprise be linked to), or more generally, be matched with the object in the photo of the reference picture of coupling or pixel groups.
(multiple) word of the theme that subject identification device 118 can use the one or more words (such as, appearing at the search terms in the maximum number of the search inquiry returned) from the search inquiry returned to submit to as the user being appointed as correspondence.Such as, subject identification device 118 can provide the reference picture of the coupling of fire truck 212 (photo of such as, identical with model with the manufacturer of fire truck 212 fire truck) to search system 112.Then, search system 112 can resolve the search query log of the data storing search inquiry in the past, and resolve the click logs storing the data that Search Results is in the past selected, inquire about with identification search, with reference to fire truck 212 coupling reference picture which response Search Results selected, or be provided to fire truck 212 coupling reference picture link which response Search Results selected.Search system 112 can return these search inquiries to subject identification device 118.
Subject identification device 118 can select one or more word from the search inquiry returned, to be appointed as the theme of the user's submission comprising relevant picture.Such as, if the search inquiry returned is " fire plant ", " fire ", " fire truck " and " how forest fire starts ", then subject identification device 118 can select the maximum number appearing at the search inquiry returned search query word-" fire ".But other system of selection can be used equally, in all search inquiries returned not being grammer or preposition article, such as select the word with maximum useful frequency.
In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can based on be included in there is content of text user submit in content of text determine the theme that user submits to.More particularly, subject identification device 118 can be analyzed the content of text (such as, by word frequency distribution, clause identification, mark/annotation, information extraction and/or other data mining technology) be included in user's submission and determine the theme that user submits to.Such as, if the content of text be included in user's submission with photo 210 is " my sky, fire truck! ", then " fire truck " or " fire " can be appointed as the theme of user's submission by subject identification device 118 based on the analysis of content of text.
In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can analyze content of text that multiple user submits to (such as, in the special time period of such as at least ten minutes or be derived from identical geographic area puts up) with the determination of the theme promoting user to submit to.By analyzing the content of text that multiple user submits to before determining the theme that in these specific users submission, any one user submits to, subject identification device 118 can submit middle common point or semantic trend to, to promote the determination of the theme that some or all of user submits to by identifying user.Such as, be posted if submitted to period five minute period 100 users, and 85 users submit to and comprise word " fire " or " fire truck ", so subject identification device 118 high confidence standard can determine that the user's submission comprising word " fire " or " fire truck " has the theme relevant with fire.
With analyze compared with unique user submits to isolator, by analyzing the group that user submits to, subject identification device 118 can have (multiple) theme determining that user submits to more high confidence level.Such as, if the content of text that first user is submitted to is " big fire seen by the balcony in my Neng Congwo hotel; it has the mirable appearance of water in passing " and be combined with the photo of fire, so because content of text also comprises mentioning hotel, may be difficult to determine that user submits to is mainly for fire.But, if multiple other user submission is submitted in two minutes that put up at first user be posted, and it is all clearly relevant with fire, then submit to by analyzing all these users, because other users all submit to also relevant with fire, subject identification device 118 can more be determined high confidence level (such as, determining between Huo He hotel), and first user is submitted to main relevant with fire.
More generally, subject identification device 118 can analyze relevant user's submission group (such as, in time, geographical source, by have that concomitant user puts up etc.).If be determined to have common theme for the threshold level submitted in group, then subject identification device 118 can use common theme as input to promote to have unrecognizable, multiple or not know in the group of theme the determination of theme of any user's submission of (or relevant).
In some embodiments, subject identification device 118 can use any above-mentioned technology or their combination in any to determine the theme that user submits to.
The content that process 200 is submitted to based on user at least partly determines the geographic position (202D) that the theme submitted to user is associated.In some embodiments, geographic position identity device 120 can based on user submit to content (such as user submit to photo in object, submit with user the metadata be associated to, or both) determine geographic position.Such as, geographic position identity device 120 can cooperate with object and subject identification device 116,118, as the object (or the positional information provided) of terrestrial reference in identification photograph, and determines geographic position based on the position of terrestrial reference.Therefore, such as, bridge 214 in photo 210 can be designated the Gold Gate Bridge in the San Francisco near California by geographic position identity device 120, and the geographic position that the theme determining thus to submit to corresponding user (such as, fire) is associated is or close to San Francisco in California.
As described above, in some embodiments, geographic position identity device 120 can submit to the metadata be associated to determine geographic position based on user.Such as, metadata can be the EXIF data of the photo of specifying picture-taking location.The geographic position that user submits to can be defined as identical with the position of specifying in EXIF data by geographic position identity device 120.
In some embodiments, geographic position identity device 120 can determine geographic position based on the positional information of user's submission itself.Such as, user submits to can be had the position (such as, as determined by the GPS of subscriber equipment 106) of putting up the subscriber equipment 106 that user submits to by GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION.Geographic position identity device 120 can use this geographical labels information to determine geographic position.Such as, geographic position identity device 120 can by identical with the position of specifying in the geographical labels information that the geographic position that the theme that corresponding user submits to is associated is defined as with user submits to.
In some embodiments, geographic position identity device 120 can determine geographic position based on the IP address of putting up the subscriber equipment 106 that user submits to.Such as, geographic position identity device 120 can access the positional information of putting up the IP address of the subscriber equipment 106 that user submits to of searching data repository from IP address/location, and is defined as in geographic position identical with the address that the IP address of the subscriber equipment 106 puted up is associated.Geographic position identity device 120 can use any one technology as described above or its combination to determine geographic position.
As described above, process 200 is analyzed user and is submitted the time of putting up user's submission with portion identification to, and the geographic position determined the theme that user submits to and be associated with this theme.If the frequency that the user with similar topic and geographic position submits to increases along with the given time interval, then some critical events be associated with this theme and geographic position are probably there are.So, wish to social networks member the information relevant with this event is provided.Being identified at of this event is hereafter described.
Process 200 determines troop (204) that user submits to.At least partly submit the time of generation to based on user, the theme that user submits to, the geographic position be associated with the theme that user submits to or they some combine, each user's submission in particular cluster is submitted to similar to other user each during this is trooped.Therefore, to troop the group that can be and submit to at least one relevant user in time, theme or geographic position.Such as, troop and can be made up of user's submission with same or analogous theme and the geographic position of putting up in window for specific three minutes.
Such as, if the theme that user submits to is classified with same vertical/subject categories, if or user submit to comprise identical or relevant (such as, semantic relevant) content of text is (such as, keyword) or picture material is (such as, as determined by image matching technology), then user submits to and can be determined to have similar or relevant theme.Such as, relative to each other submit in special time period if user submits to or submit in the special time period relative to the time in certain day or sky, then user's submission can be confirmed as similar or relevant in time.Such as, if user submits at specific geographical area place or submitted in this region, or comprise the content that is associated with this specific geographical area (such as, user submit to be submitted to by the user in California or user submit to comprise the photo of Gold Gate Bridge), then user submits that can be defined in geographic position similar or relevant to.In some embodiments, what determining device of trooping 122 can determine that user submits to troops.
Determining device of trooping 122 can determine based on such as various technology (such as k mean cluster, hierarchical clustering or the cluster based on intensity) intensity of trooping.The determination of trooping is described with reference to figure 2C, and it is that user submits the exemplary plot 280 of trooping to.Figure 28 0 comprises numeric identifier 281, and the specific user that each identifier list is shown in the reception of period specific time period (such as one hour) submits to.Figure 28 0 represents two-dimensional space, and wherein y-axis represents the geographic position of the theme that user submits to and x-axis represents the theme that user submits to.In the three dimensional representation that user submits to, z-axis will represent the time of such as putting up user and submitting to.
With reference to figure 280, determining device of trooping 122 is determined or identifies three that such as user submits to troop: troop 282, troop 284 and troop 286.Due to the user in trooping submit to pay close attention to relatively little region (theme with geographic position in), the user trooped in 282 submits at theme (such as, fire) and geographic position (such as, San Francisco) two aspects all similar.That is, the change in the theme that the middle user that troops crossing over x and y-axis submits to and geographic position is in some particular ranges that definition is trooped.
Similarly, the user trooped in 284 submit to theme (such as, world cup finals) and geographic position (such as, Chicago) two aspects all similar.But, because corresponding event can be the characteristic that geography can not determine or disperse, therefore troop and also can form by only submitting to user relevant theme.Such as, the user trooped in 286 submit to be local position distribution (such as, dissimilar), but theme aspect is similar, as the little change in theme (such as, indicated by large change (such as, across y-axis on a large scale) across x-axis among a small circle) and in geographic position.There is similar topic but troop this example that the user of local position distribution submits to is because the presidential user that the date for the election is transnational submits to.
In some embodiments, determining device of trooping 122 can identify have multiple associated user submit to troop (such as, be correlated with in theme, time, geographic position or its any combined aspects), it has the multiple associated users exceeding the threshold value of trooping of trooping that this associated user submits to and submits to.Threshold value of trooping can be the threshold measurement that user submits to, and it needs to be submitted to exceed to form by associated user to troop.Threshold value of trooping can be the number submitted to based on such as associated user or in specific interval, put up the number or quantity (such as, user's submission rate) that user submits to.Such as, for the particular cluster had containing the theme relevant with the fire in San Francisco, threshold value of trooping is that 200 relevant users per hour submit to.So, in response to determining that at least two hundred this users that existence hours interim puts up submit to, determining device of trooping 122 can by about San Francisco fire user submit to group to be designated to troop.
It is that the relevant user of interested theme submits the possibility being confirmed as trooping to that level and the value of threshold value of trooping can be configured to reduce with the social network members only for fraction, or minimizing and the social network members only for fraction are that the relevant user of interested theme submits to and is used to determine that the amount of perhaps this content in which should be delivered to the possibility of the member of such as social networks.As described below, because the content distributed across social networks can be selected based on the particular group of trooping or trooping determined, may not be the good candidate of distribution for the interested theme of fraction social network members.Therefore, threshold value of trooping can be set to reduce the user trooped based on limited quantity and submit possibility of trooping that is identified or that determine to by determining device of trooping 122 or social networks keeper.Which accordingly reduces and the possibility this user of general social networks audient being submitted to relevant distribution of content.
As described above, Figure 28 0 submits to based on the user received during special time period.Determining device of trooping 122 can change trooping of user's submission and cross over it by the time window determined.In some embodiments, determining device of trooping 122 can change time window based on the type of theme.Such as, some themes and (such as, the emergency that is associated in relative brief time period event, such as building fire or earthquake), and other theme is associated (such as, season events gradually, such as autumn leaves scenery) with in relative long-time section event.
Therefore, for the theme be associated with in short time period event, wish that the intensity (such as, the submission number of each unit interval) that the associated user puted up submits to is relatively high.Therefore for this theme, miss the possibility of this event/user's submission group for minimizing determining device 122 of trooping, in some embodiments, determining device of trooping 122 can be submitted to the user of this cluster by frequency interval dissecting needle.And compared with searching troop at small frequency interval, this frequency needs to consume more multi-system resource.
Equally, for the theme be associated with in long-time section event, wish the intensity that the intensity that the associated user puted up submits to is submitted to lower than the user relevant with in short time period event.Therefore, to make trouble part for this comparatively long hair, in some embodiments, compared with the frequency of trooping submitted at short time period event associated subscriber, determining device of trooping 122 can be submitted to the user trooped that more low-frequency compartment analysis is corresponding.Like this compared with the frequency interval of trooping submitted at short time period event associated subscriber, reduce the burden to system resource.
Consider that in some embodiments, determining device of trooping 122 can arrange based on the strength level of hope threshold value of trooping for submitting strength level to the above-described relative user that relevant theme occurs in short or long-time section.The strength level of wishing such as is measured based on history.So, the strength level of the threshold value of trooping of trooping that the user relevant with in short time period event can submit to by determining device of trooping 122 is set to the strength level higher than the threshold value of trooping of trooping submitted to the user relevant in long-time section event.Such as, owing to considering that the gradient fallen leaves in any one geographic area change and the different time of event of falling leaves in the autumn of different geographic regions, the user with event related subject of falling leaves with autumn submits to and may be posted in relative low strength level, therefore, with for expecting compared with the threshold value of trooping of trooping that the event associated user that the user of high intensity level submits to submits in short time short interior generation, determining device of trooping 122 threshold value of this being trooped is arranged on reduced levels.
In some embodiments, the history that determining device of trooping 122 also can be submitted to based on the user with this particular topic changes the frequency of trooping of searching user's submission with particular topic.Such as, determining device of trooping 122 may have access to past user submit data storehouse and determines when identified particular cluster is in the past.Therefore, if trooped, determining device 122 identifies trooping of falling leaves in autumn of being associated with October last year, determining device of so trooping 122 can start to search with the frequency of the frequency being greater than June (such as, consider trooped October last year before mark) trooping of submitting to the user that is associated of falling leaves autumn this October.
Consider that trooping of determining may be the good instruction of interest of social network members collection, as described below, determining device of trooping 122 trooping of determining can be used to adjust or chosen content to be distributed to social network members across social networks.
