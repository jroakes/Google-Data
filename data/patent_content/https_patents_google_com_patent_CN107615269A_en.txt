In the set of another embodiment, some or all initial models are built from publisher's metadata.At one
In this embodiment, training set includes including identifying all personages as depicted, author, artist, panel and dialogue gas
The digital figure novel of publisher's metadata of some features of the expection reading order of bubble etc..Therefore, training module 410 can be with
From publisher's metadata structure model, the model can apply to not include identification such as by scanning the generation of printed pattern novel
Those features feature interested publisher's metadata digital figure novel.
Training module 410 builds initial model from a series of figures and pairing metadata.In certain embodiments, model is
The artificial neural network being made up of the set of node in one or more layers.Each node is configured to predict that given feature whether there is
In input picture, the node in every layer is corresponding with the abstraction level lower than the node in preceding layer.For example, in first layer
Node can determine whether input picture is corresponding with one or two pages, and the node in the second layer can be identified in every page
Panel, and the node in third layer can identify the conversation bubble in each panel.Similarly, the first node layer can be true
Determine the presence of personage, the second node layer can determine the identity of personage, and third layer node can determine that the personage's is specific
Age (for example, before or after event especially important in personage's story of a play or opera).In one embodiment, publisher's metadata
It is additionally operable to build model.For example, specific heroic presence causes the deadly enemy that there is more likely to be hero, without being that typically in not
With the small different negative roles that see of being right of figure of publisher.In other embodiments, it is all using other types of model
Such as, graphical model.It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that it can be built from a series of images and pairing metadata to predict
The other types of model of the feature of other images.
In one embodiment, training module 410 builds initial model using two benches process.In the first phase,
By (for example, the 100) region for identifying the fixed qty for being used as the candidate for including feature interested in image
Neutral net transmits input picture.It is pre- by the prediction and this of the identity that generates feature interested in second stage
The correct nervus opticus network for corresponding to probability is surveyed to transmit identified region.Then training module 410 is calculated prediction
Feature set is converted into the cost of the feature set of mankind's identification of input picture.
For more new model, training module 410 is based on the conversion cost calculated, to apply back-propagation algorithm.The calculation
Method propagates cost information and adjusts node weights to reduce with the feature to identified input image not by neutral net
To attempt associated cost.For example, if the feature that the mankind provide were present in image including particular persons, and nerve net
Network predicts the personage be present with 80% firmly believe, then difference (or mistake) is 20%.In one embodiment, training module
410 application gradient descent methods apply to the weight of each node iteratively to adjust so that cost minimization.A small amount of adjustment section
The weight of point, and the reduction (or growth) of conversion cost caused by use is used for gradient (that is, the cost for calculating cost function
The ratio changed relative to the weight of node).Then training module 410 further adjusts upward node in the side of gradient instruction
Weighting, until find local minimum (by the cost function in gradient change direction flex point indicate) untill.In other words, adjust
Whole node weights so that the change study generation of neutral net over time is more accurately predicted.
It is not the one of training set that machine learning model is applied to from figure novel corpus 110 by prediction module 420
Partial unbred image.Machine learning model generates the prediction for the feature that unbred image includes.At one
In embodiment, unbred image is converted into numerical value mapping.Numerical value mapping includes a series of integer values, this series of whole
The characteristic of each expression image in numerical value.For example, the integer in mapping may represent that the advantage of different colours, color are being hung down
The average frequency that is changed in straight or horizontal direction, mean flow rate etc..In another embodiment, mapping includes representing continuous
The actual value of amount, such as, the coordinate of the object in image, probability etc..Those skilled in the art is it is recognized that can be by image
It is converted into the various modes of numerical value mapping.
In one embodiment, numerical value mapping is fed as input to neutral net by prediction module 420.Opened from first layer
Begin, node receives input data based on input picture (for example, part of numerical value mapping or numerical value mapping).Each node
Analyze the input data that it receives and determine whether its feature detected there may be present in input picture.It is determined that
In the presence of feature, node starts.The node of startup changes input data based on the node weights of startup, and by the defeated of modification
Enter data to send to one or more node in next layer of neutral net.If starting the end node in neutral net,
Then neutral net exports the prediction that feature corresponding with the end node is present in input picture.In one embodiment, it is based on
