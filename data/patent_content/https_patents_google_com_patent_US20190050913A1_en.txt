Also, the following detailed description does not limit the concepts discussed. Instead, the scope of the concepts discussed herein is defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
- In one embodiment of the present invention, a
campaign server 102 provides for a one-stop, easy-to-use interface for advertisers to create content item campaigns that will help promote and monetize their goods and services. The content items may be ads, and the content item campaigns may be ad campaigns. - Users, such as advertisers, may utilize the
campaign server 102 to automatically create ad campaigns for their goods and services.Campaign server 102 may automatically manage various aspects of creating and managing an ad campaign, such as generating the ad creative, determining the appropriate ad distribution parameters, determining the hardware and software platforms required of the devices that are served ads, etc. - In order to present a concrete example of automatic ad campaign creation, techniques are described in the present specification for automatically creating an ad campaign for mobile applications. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the techniques presented in this specification are applicable to create ad campaigns for any kind of good or service.
- In some embodiments, any item that is available in an electronic marketplace may be the basis for creating an ad campaign. The item may be any type of item, including electronic books, music, cars, software, or any goods or services. The item may be intangible, i.e. services or the type that may be sent over the Internet, such as software, music, or electronic books. The item may also be tangible, such as books, music, and cars. The creation of ad campaigns as described in this specification is not limited to any particular type of item.
- The
campaign server 102 may automatically harvest product data from online sellers of mobile applications in order to create the ad creatives and set the ad campaign parameters. The campaign server may automatically determine and populate ad campaign parameters using the harvested application data.Campaign server 102 may automatically determine the appropriate ad distribution parameters. The ad distribution parameters set the parameters for distribution of the ad. The parameters may include the country, the geography, the language, and other factors affecting how the ad is distributed. - For example,
campaign server 102 may automatically determine, as an aggregate trend, which applications have been previously purchased from an electronic marketplace. Distribution parameters may be determined based on aggregate data that indicates that application X also purchased when application Y is purchased.Campaign server 102 may also automatically determine, in the aggregate, which applications are being downloaded and used, and set the distribution parameters based on such aggregate data. Even though the information being collected is aggregated and does not contain a user ID or other means for identifying particular users, individual users may also opt out of having their purchase information included in the aggregate information. - Also, certain geographic areas may also be selected for ad serving based on the languages of the product that is available for sale in the electronic marketplace. For example, if the product is available for sale in the electronic marketplace in the Spanish language, then the problem might be advertised in Mexico or other Latin American markets. Certain hardware and/or software operational requirements may also be selected as a distribution parameter. For example, if the product requires version 1.2.2 of an operating system, then the product might be advertised to devices with version 1.2.2 of the operating system installed. As another example, if the product requires a machine with a particular central processing unit (CPU), then only devices with that CPU may receive the advertisement. Other ad campaign parameters may also be set by
campaign server 102 and are discussed further in the present specification -
Campaign server 102 may also automatically generate and update ad creatives for the advertising campaigns.Campaign server 102 may pull ratings, price, description, icon, and other data regarding applications automatically from a source of application data. The pulled data may be used in the generation of the ad creative. Changes to the application data at the source of the harvested data may triggercampaign server 102 to automatically update the generated ad creatives. -
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an automaticad campaign system 100, according to an embodiment. As illustrated inFIG. 1 , the automaticad campaign system 100 may include acampaign server 102 with user interface logic 104 andcampaign generator 106. The user interface logic 104 of thecampaign server 102 sends data for a user interface display to aclient 108.Client 108 may be any device, including mobile devices, desktop computers, or any other computing device. Users, such as advertisers, may interact withcampaign server 102 throughclient 108. -
Campaign generator 106 may interact with any combination ofadvertising network server 110,AppSeller module 112,AppSales service 114,Superstore instance 116, servingreach module 118, andstats module 120 in order to automatically create ad campaigns based on harvested data. - The campaign server may obtain item data through
AppSeller module 112 and/orAppSales service 114. The harvested information may also include current sales data such as prices, ratings, descriptions, icons, and other data of applications. - The harvested data may be used to define ad distribution parameters. In some embodiments, the harvested information utilized for automatically creating an ad campaign may also include aggregate application data. Users may opt out of sending their application data for determining ad distribution parameters. Data such as the type of mobile applications that are downloaded the most may be harvested to better define the most appropriate ad distribution parameters.
- Item data, such as aggregated purchasing information of the applications may be obtained through an application programming interface compiled and integrated into a module such as
AppSeller module 112. The data may be used for automatically creating the ad campaign. In some embodiments, theAppSeller module 112 may be an integrated part ofcampaign server 102 that allowscampaign server 102 to access the item data from an online application seller. - In another embodiment, campaign server may also optionally access
AppSales service 114 alone or in conjunction withAppSeller module 112.AppSales service 114 may be another example source providing application data that may be used for automatically creating ad campaigns.AppSales service 114 may provide a stream or feed of application data regarding the prices, ratings, descriptions, icons, language, device hardware and software requirements, and other data of applications to thecampaign server 102. - In some embodiments,
campaign server 102 may send a HTTP request toAppSales service 114 for product data and receive information about that product. The data received may include, for example, item name (such as application name for mobile applications), publisher name, image URLs, icon URLs, description, version, size, supported devices, genre, etc.App server 102 may utilize the data in order to generate ad creatives for the ad campaign. In some embodiments,AppSales service 114 may also provide aggregated purchasing information. -
Advertising network server 110 may be a server managing a network that distributes ads to websites and applications, and may allow developers to monetize their mobile applications and websites by displaying paid ads within the applications and websites. - The
campaign server 102 may also utilizestats module 120 to retrieve statistics. In one embodiment, a data retrieval interface may be used by thecampaign server 102 to retrieve ad campaign statistics fromstats module 120. The statistical information may include, for example, an aggregate number of impressions and an aggregate number of click-throughs. In one embodiment, an extractor module (not depicted) that is part ofstats module 120 may be responsible for extracting aggregate data from impression and click logs, and storing the data in a statistics table. Thecampaign server 102 may use the data retrieval interface to query data from the statistics table to communicate statistical information to the client. - In some embodiments, the data retrieval interface may allow for queries by ad ID, by application ID, by publisher ID, etc. The statistical information reflects counts of impressions and click-throughs in the aggregate, and do not reflect such data for individual users. In addition, users may opt out of participating in the collection of aggregate statistics such as the impressions and click-throughs.
- In some embodiments,
stats module 120 may access impression logs and click logs, and process the logs according to different schedules. Impression logs may be stored with a server that serves advertisements. Since click logs may be stored on a different server, such as an advertising server that tracks click-throughs, there may be a time delay between processing impression logs and click logs. In one embodiment, the extractors may be set to avoid processing any log entries with timestamps within a threshold number of hours in order to minimize artificial fluctuations in statistics reported to users. For example, by delaying the processing of log entries, the computed click-through rate may be a more accurate representation of the ratio of impressions to clicks. - In some embodiments, a serving
reach module 118 estimates an approximate number of impressions that will be served for an ad. The computation for the estimate may be based on the desired ad serving user characteristics, the hardware and software requirements of devices that will be served ads, and other criteria for selecting users and their devices for serving ads. In some embodiments, servingreach module 118 also suggests ways to improve the serving of ads that are more appropriate and interesting to users. For example, based on analysis of the harvested data, servingreach module 118 may determine that a certain age group favors strategy games, and suggest to an advertiser that such an age group be utilized as ad distribution parameters for strategy games. - In some embodiments,
Superstore instance 116 stores data regarding, ads and ad groups, and other information.Campaign server 102 may store and access ads fromSuperstore instance 116. The ads stored in Superstore instance 16 may be used in creating ad campaigns and sent to an ads server for serving to users. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an overview of the process of campaign creation, according to an embodiment. In step 202,campaign server 102 logs in and authenticates user. The user may login with a social networking ID. In some embodiments, thecampaign server 102 may have an interface through a website. In one embodiment, to promote mobile applications, the user may conveniently log into thecampaign server 102 through menu options such as “Campaigns” and then “App Promotion” through theadvertising network server 110. Yet other methods of logging and authenticating the user into thecampaign server 102 are possible and embodiments of the invention are not limited to the disclosed methods. - In
step 204,campaign server 102 receives a request to create an ad campaign. The request may come from the user operating the client. For example, the user may be a mobile application developer that wishes to market an application. - In
step 206,campaign server 102 retrieves information about the application. In one embodiment,campaign server 102 may subscribe to a feed throughAppSales service 114 in order to obtain information about the application. For example,campaign server 102 may send a request for application data toAppSales service 114 and receive information regarding the application, as described in the present specification. In another embodiment,campaign server 102 may utilizeAppSeller module 112 in order to obtain information regarding the application, as described in the present specification. - In
step 208,campaign server 102 uses the retrieved information to create the ad campaign. For example,campaign server 102 may use information about the application in order to determine the language, the desired characteristics of users that are served ads, the required hardware and software platforms, internationalization and localization adaptations, and other parameters for building an ad campaign. Each of the ad campaign creation parameters are discussed in detail elsewhere in the present specification. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating details for creating an ad campaign, according to an embodiment. The steps ofFIG. 3 may be performed bycampaign server 102. - In
step 302,campaign server 102 retrieves application information for creating the ad campaign. Data may be retrieved from theAppSales service 114 and/orAppSales service 114, and/or other applications or websites that operate as electronic marketplaces, in order to create the ad campaign. In one embodiment, thecampaign server 102 sends an application ID to anAppSales service 114, and receives a stream or feed of data throughAppSales service 114 for the application.AppSales service 114 may be a streaming service that communicates with an online store where users can download and purchase applications. Data such as the names, icons, prices of applications, and other data regarding applications may be obtained fromAppSales service 114 through the data feed. Such data may be used for automatically creating the ad campaigns. - In some embodiments, the
campaign server 102 obtains application information including ratings, descriptions, icons, and other data for applications through an application programming interface compiled into a module, such asAppSeller module 112. Different embodiments may use various combinations ofAppSeller module 112 and/or a feed throughAppSales service 114 in order to obtain data regarding applications.Campaign server 102 may also retrieve data from an application developer's homepage or a company webpage in order to build ads. - In
step 304,campaign server 102 generates the ad creative. In some embodiments, an ad can be created without a prior ad campaign setup or even without user registration. A user may create an ad first, and view preliminary results prior to starting the automatic ad campaign process. In some embodiments, ad creation may be integrated into theAppSales service 114 or a web browser. Users may operate a control on the module or browser in order to automatically create an ad and view the ad. To generate the ad creative,campaign server 102 obtains data regarding the application. -
Campaign server 102 may obtain, from any online source of applications, data such as an icon, the name of the company, the price, and other data, to produce an ad message such as “Download the Math app”. The ratings and reviews of the application, title, category, and an additional description may also be retrieved. The ad may be automatically designed specifically for the application. The ratings, price, name of company, icon, data for writing the ad message, and the description may all be retrieved through, for example,AppSeller module 112 orAppSales service 114. The ratings may be, for example, ratings provided by customers of the electronic marketplace or other users who have used the application and provided ratings based on their experience with the application. The reviews may also be descriptions of experiences with the application written by customers or other users. The ratings and reviews may be stored in the electronic marketplace and retrieved from the electronic marketplace for producing the ad creative. The ratings, reviews, and other retrieved data may be displayed with or on top of the ad creative. The ad creative may also include any other information retrieved through an API or feed or some other method from an electronic marketplace. - In some embodiments, the ad creative may be updated on a regular schedule in order to show up-to-date ads. The ads may be updated automatically without requiring any action from advertisers. The ads may contain free form text fields where advertisers can provide a customized message. Some of the data displayed on the ad creative that may be updated automatically include the ratings, reviews, price, and other data retrieved from sources of application data. The data for the automatic updates may be obtained by, for example, crawling webpages with descriptions of the application, or by subscribing to a feed of information from
AppSales service 114, or usingAppSeller module 112. - In
step 306,campaign server 102 determines the ad campaign parameters. In one embodiment, the campaign carrier chooses the default settings for the ad campaign parameters. Some of the default settings include device characteristics such as the appropriate hardware platforms, operating systems versions, and installed applications. Other default settings for the ad campaign parameters include application categories, and the countries and regions where the ad will be displayed. Some of the default settings may be determined based on data retrieved from theAppSales service 114. For example, information regarding the devices and operating system versions upon which the application will run on may be obtained from theAppSales service 114. For example, the determination of the countries and regions may be derived from the languages in which the application is available in theAppSales service 114. Thecampaign server 102 may also determine the language in which to display the ads by examining language data from theAppSales service 114. - The
campaign server 102 may also set the default settings for geographical locations where ads will be served. By examining the geographic locations where the application is currently available through theAppSales service 114 module, the server may select similar geographic locations for the advertising. - Further, campaign server may also determine that users in certain geographical regions tend to use more applications. For example, users in Silicon Valley may tend to use more mobile applications related to learning about computers, and campaign server may serve a greater percentage of ads for such applications to Silicon Valley users.
- In one embodiment, the
campaign server 102 may also choose default settings for the type of applications that the ads are displayed with. For example, thecampaign server 102 may serve ads to a device only when the ads are displayed on paid applications.Campaign server 102 may also serve ads to a device only when the ads are displayed on free applications. Users that have paid for applications in the past may be more likely to purchase another application. The cost (free or otherwise) of the application may be determined from theAppSales service 114. Thecampaign server 102 may serve ads only on applications with less than a predetermined number of users. The number of users may be determined by examining download statistics from theAppSales service 114. The application developer may also change the default settings as desired. - In one embodiment, the campaign server may also allow for automatic ad campaign creation based on buying patterns of aggregated users. Aggregated download history and buying pattern information may be mined from information stored with the AppSales service
- Users may choose to opt out of allowing their device's past purchase information to be used for collecting this aggregated information. Other additional application purchase history information may also be mined from the
AppSales service 114. For example, aggregated buying pattern information may show that people who liked product X also tend to like product Y and this buying pattern information may be used to define distribution parameters. - In one embodiment, the
campaign server 102 may compute an estimate of the number of users that may view the ad. The computation may be based on an analysis of statistical data such as the number of qualifying devices, the number of devices in certain regions or countries, the number of users, and other aggregated statistical data regarding users and devices. Thecampaign server 102 may also compute the number of expected users or impressions served for the lifetime of the ad campaign. - In one embodiment,
campaign server 102 may also include an ad planning module (not depicted) that plans for serving ads based on geographical data. For example, if the advertisements are served with a popular game, and most purchasers of the game are located in Mexico, then the ad planning module may favor Mexico for serving the ads, and the ads may be mostly served in Mexico. Thus, ad distribution parameters based on geography and other factors may be computed using a specialized ad planning module. - In some embodiments,
campaign server 102 performs localization adaptations.Campaign server 102 may adapt the ads for the particular locality in which the ad will be served. Ad viewers in each locality may see the ad creative displayed according to their local customs.Campaign server 102 may make changes for local adaptations such as text translation, data formatting, number/currency formatting, and bi-directional text display.Campaign server 102 may determine that most of the purchases are from a particular country and adapt the ad creative for that country.Campaign server 102 may then include the country in the ad campaign. - Different countries may have different currencies and different number formatting conventions. For example, in Asia, a date may be written in day/month/year format. However, in Western countries, the date may be written in month/day/year format. The campaign server automatically manages the different formats of dates, tailoring the forming of the dates to the particular locality. The price of the application as depicted in the produced ad creative may be automatically converted to a different currency. The ad viewer may see the price of the application with the advertising according to their local currency. The currency symbol may also be replaced in the ad creative. For example, the symbol for the Japanese currency may replace the symbol for the dollar when the ad creative is shown in in Japan. In some countries, the text may be written from left to right (e.g. English), or from top to bottom (e.g. Japanese or Chinese). The campaign server may also manage the advertisements that the text is written in according to the customs of the locality in which the advertisement is served. Some languages, such as Chinese, may also be bi-directional, and can be written from left to right or right to left. Campaign server may also manage the display of text in the advertisements served to localities that use such languages.
- Since the advertisements may be served to many different countries, and to different users that use different languages, an interface may be provided for advertisers to optionally define translatable messages. The messages may be translated for the different languages in which ads may be presented. For example, the advertising text may be translated to Spanish in order to display the ad to ad viewers in Spanish. The reviews shown in the ad creative may be translated to Spanish in order to display the ad creative in Spanish.
- In some embodiments, the
campaign server 102 may choose which wireless carriers are favored for serving ads. Thecampaign server 102 may analyze the aggregate data that is harvested.
