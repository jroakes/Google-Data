Definitions
- voice recognition system that converts voice signals to a textual message at a higher degree of accuracy than provided by prior art voice recognition systems. It would be desirable for the voice recognition system to convert voice signals that originate from either speaker-dependent or speaker-independent voice signals. In addition, it would be desirable that the voice recognition system be adapted to operate in a radio communication system that translates caller initiated voice messages to textual messages, and that transmits the textual messages to one or more selective call radios.
- FIGS. 7-10 show graphs representative of the transformations made to voice signals generated by a caller according to the present invention.
- FIGS. 2 and 3 are electrical block diagrams of the fixed portion 102 of the radio communication system according to the present invention.
- the electrical block diagram of the fixed portion 102 includes the elements of the controller 112 and the base stations 116.
- the controller 112 comprises a conventional processing system 210 for controlling operation of the base stations 116, a caller interface circuit 218, and a transmitter interface 204 for communicating messages to the base stations 116.
- the caller interface circuit 218 is utilized for receiving messages from the PSTN 110 or, alternatively, for receiving messages from a direct telephone connection 103.
- the processing system 210 includes conventional hardware such as a computer system 212 (with built-in random access memory-RAM) and mass media 214 (e.g., a conventional hard disk) to perform the programmed operations of the controller 112.
- the word “is” may be decomposed into two phoneme sounds: "ih” and "z.” Since individuals of differing cultures may speak with differing dialects, the word “is” may have more than one set of phoneme models to represent mismatched populations. For example, there may be individuals who end the word “is” with a "s" sound, i.e., "ih” and "s.”
- the conversion of voice into a textual message is accomplished by comparing the spectral envelope features of the spectral data for each of the plurality of bands and the degree of voiceness for each of the plurality of bands with a library of speaker-independent phoneme models. From this comparison, a list of likely phonemes are identified, which are then compared to a dictionary of words (from, e.g., the English language) and their corresponding phonemes to derive a textual equivalent of speech from the processed voice signal of the caller.
- a dictionary of words from, e.g., the English language
- the foregoing method and apparatus for sampling voice signals and for converting them to textual messages is substantially, advantageous over prior art systems.
- prior art systems have a limited success rate of converting voice messages to textual messages due to an emphasis put on deriving textual messages based on the energy level of the analyzed speech signal.
- the present invention takes advantage of analyzing the texture of the speech spectrum (described above as the degree of voiceness) along with the energy level of the speech signal.
- the present invention provides a higher degree of accuracy for converting speaker-dependent and speaker-independent voice signals to a textual message.
