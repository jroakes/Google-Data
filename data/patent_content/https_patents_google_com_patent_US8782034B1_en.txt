- map services have been available for many years, offering functionality including displaying graphical maps (whether image-, line-, or vector-based maps), locating locations by address, and providing travel directions (often illustrated on the above graphical maps).
- Some map services also maintain a database of points of interest (such as restaurants, stores, and tourist destinations), their respective locations, and other information regarding these points of interest. Searches may be run against this database to identify particular points of interest for a user. For example, a user of a map service may submit a text-based search query for “that restaurant, el cerrito, ca”, resulting in a list of restaurants serving Thai food in or about El Cerrito, Calif., which may also be listed in shown on a graphical map display.
- map services have also made use of recommender systems, either instead of or in conjunction with a conventional index-based search engine (e.g., by performing ranking of search results).
- recommender systems A popular technique for recommender systems is known as collaborative filtering. An underlying assumption in conventional collaborative filtering systems is that users who have agreed in the past will tend to agree in the future. Collaborative filtering techniques rely upon “interest information” (sometimes referred to as “taste information” or “ratings information”) collected from a plurality of users regarding a plurality of items, such as points of interest.
- user-based collaborative filtering users or groups of users similar to a particular user of interest are identified, and the interest information collected by these users or groups of users are used to predict which items are of interest for the particular user of interest.
- item-based collaborative filtering the similarity of items is determined identified based on the interest information, and is used to suggest items for a particular user of interest.
- Many other forms and variations of collaborative filtering are known to those skilled in the art.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to a machine-implemented method for recommending a point of interest that includes obtaining interest information for a plurality of users, the interest information including information indicating an interest of each user for a plurality of points of interest, and the plurality of users including a first user.
- a plurality of attributes for constraining a search of the plurality of points of interest is obtained, a point of interest, from among the plurality of points of interest that satisfy the attributes, that has the least similarity to the interest information for the first user is identified, and information about the identified point of interest is provided for display to the first user.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to a machine-implemented method for recommending a point of interest that includes obtaining interest information for a first plurality of users, the interest information indicating an interest of each user for a plurality of points of interest, and the plurality of users including a first user, obtaining a plurality of attributes for constraining a search of the plurality of points of interest, identifying a second plurality of users included in the first plurality of users that have respective interest information with the least similarity to the interest information for the first user, identifying a point of interest, from among the plurality of points of interest that satisfy the attributes, that is most popular with the second plurality of users, and providing information about the identified point of interest for display to the first user.
- the disclosed subject matter further relates to a system for recommending a location, the system including one or more processors and a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by the processors, cause the processors to perform operations including obtaining interest information for a plurality of users, the interest information including information indicating an interest of each user for a plurality of points of interest, and the plurality of users including a first user, obtaining a plurality of attributes for constraining a search of the plurality of points of interest, identifying a point of interest, from among the plurality of points of interest that satisfy the attributes, that has the least similarity to the interest information for the first user, and providing information about the identified point of interest for display to the first user.

- FIG. 2A illustrates a user-based process 200 by which recommended points of interest are identified.
- FIG. 2B illustrates an item-based process 250 by which recommended points of interest are identified.
- FIG. 3 conceptually illustrates an electronic system 300 with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary architecture diagram for the disclosed techniques for recommending points of interest for a user 105 .
- User 105 accesses map service 110 via a network connection, such as, but not limited to, the Internet or a mobile data network.
- User 105 may interact with map service 110 via a computing device, such as, but not limited to, a desktop computer, laptop or tablet computer, or a programmable telephone device.
- the computing device may provide an interface with map service 110 via a program such as, but not limited to, a web browser or dedicated map software program.
- User 105 may also access search engine 115 via the network connection for performing search queries against indexed content, such as webpages available via the Internet.
- Interest information database 120 accumulates interest information not only for user 105 , but a plurality of users who make use of map service 110 , search engine 115 , and/or other online services.
- the interest information may be explicitly or implicitly provided by user 105 .
- An example of explicit interest information is a rating score or a “thumbs up”/“thumbs down” indication provided by user 105 .
- An example of implicit interest information is a record of a number of times that user 105 has reviewed detailed information for a point of interest via map service 110 .
- Interest information expresses not only items of interest to user 105 , and potentially the degree of interest, but also may indicate items that user 105 dislikes (which generally is expressly indicated by users).
- listings or presentations of detailed information for points of interest via map service 110 may include a mechanism by which user 105 may indicate a simple indication of like or dislike of a particular point of interest.
- interest information a point of interest may also be obtained based on the use of search engine 115 , where it is determined that particular activity by user 105 , such as search queries or use of search results, corresponds to the point of interest.
- Interest information for items other than points of interest may also be obtained via search engine 115 as well.
- such interest information may be used in order to more effectively classify the similarity of users' overall interests.
- Each user u i has a list of items I ui for which interest information has been obtained.
- Collaborative filtering algorithms typically represent the entire m ⁇ n user/item data as an interest information matrix A, in which each entry a ij represents the interest information of the i-th user on the j-th item.
- the interest information database usually is sparsely populated.
- an individual point of interest, or other items tracked by interest information database 120 may have multiple pieces of associated interest information.
- user 105 may rate a restaurant with respect to multiple characteristics, including, for example, quality of food, quality of service, and atmosphere.
- interest information database 120 may record that user 105 viewed detailed information about a particular point of interest, and additionally record a rating score for the same point of interest, if provided by user 105 .
- Interest information stored in interest information database 120 may be considered private by user 105 .
- such records or information are anonymized and not connected with actual user identities.
- users may opt out of the collection of such data; however, this may prevent identification of points of interest dissimilar to the interests of user 105 , as they are not recorded.
- user 105 may review collected data and remove or modify particular data.
- security procedures such as limiting access to stored information to specified accounts, may be used to restrict access to such information to authorized users or systems.
- Recommender system 125 identifies points of interest for user 105 based on the interest information recorded in interest information database 120 .
- recommender system 125 will recommend points of interest based on the interest information of users or groups of users most similar to user 105 , or based on interest information for points of interest most similar to those previously of interest to user 105 .
- recommender system 125 is further configured to render recommendations based instead on users or items that are determined to be the most dissimilar from the interest information recorded for user 105 .
- FIG. 2A illustrates a user-based process 200 by which recommended points of interest are identified.
- the term “user-based” indicates that the collaborative filtering technique employed by recommender 125 will rely upon determining a degree of similarity between user 105 and other users or groups of users, based on the interest information recorded in interest information database 120 for the users or groups of users. There are many techniques known in the art for determining an index of similarity between users based on their interest data.
- One example is by representing the interest data for each user as a vector, and calculating the cosine angle between the vectors.
- the similarity of these two users, or s ij is calculated as follows:
- Another pair of example indices views user interest information as sets of items collected by each user.
- ⁇ i represents the set of objects collected by user i
- k i
- the cosine similarity is calculated as follows:
- Another index, related to equation (2), is known as the common neighbors index, in which two users are considered to be more similar of they have collected more common items.
- the common neighbors index is calculated as follows:
- dissimilarity d ij ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ ⁇ j ⁇ ( 4 ) Also, dissimilarity d ij can be calculated as the number of different objects that two users have collected:
- Another technique useful for identifying groups of similar users relies upon locality sensitive hashing techniques, that have the desirable property that two data elements have the same hash value with a certain probability that is directly proportional to the similarly between the two data elements.
- hashing users may be grouped into clusters, Then, the similarity of user 105 may be calculated against the clusters of users to determine a degree of similarity between user 105 and each cluster of users.
- clustering reduces the amount of computation required to find similar or dissimilar users for a particular user 105 , at the expense of granularity in identifying such users.
- items of interest data may be excluded from the interest data. For example, if a recommendation for a restaurant is sought, the interest information used to calculate user similarity may be limited to interest information pertaining to points of interest which are restaurants or interest information pertaining to food interests, to provide a more focused assessment of similarity.
- interest information database 120 obtains and stores interest information for user 105 and other users regarding points of interest. As discussed previously, this interest information may be obtained from map service 110 , search engine 115 , or other online services. The collection of this interest information occurs over time, and before the search corresponding to step 210 begins. The obtained interest information is subject to privacy protections, as discussed previously.
- recommendation system 125 obtains attributes to constrain a search for points of interest tracked by interest information database 120 .
- attributes such as cities or other geographical areas to which a search should be limited
- a ceiling on an expected price of a meal may be used to filter out points of interest that do not satisfy the obtained constraints, either before or after performing collaborative filtering, based on related information included in interest information database 120 or available through, for example, map service 110 .
- a plurality of dissimilar users are identified based on the interest information recorded for user 105 .
- Many indexing formulas are known in the art for determining a degree of similarity between users, including the examples discussed above (e.g., cosine angle, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and locality sensitive hashing).
- the disclosed subject matter instead identifies the users or clusters of users with the lowest degree of similarity with user 105 , or, in other words, the users or clusters of users that are most dissimilar to user 105 .
- the interest information obtained from users dissimilar to user 105 should be useful in identifying points of interest that are different from the established interests of user 105 as indicated by the interest information recorded in interest information database 120 .
- interest information database 120 It is common for little or no interest information to be obtained and stored by interest information database 120 for some portion of the users tracked via interest information database 120 . Accordingly, such users, or clusters including such users, are likely to be designated as dissimilar from user 105 . However, as little or no useful interest information is provided by these users, they may be excluded from consideration while performing collaborative filtering, and/or removed from any results of collaborative filtering, so that higher-quality interest information from more active users is used instead.
- One example of a technique for filtering such users is to exclude users with less than a predetermined amount or quality of interest information recorded in interest information database.
- step 220 a point of interest which is the most popular with the dissimilar users identified in step 215 among points of interest satisfying the attributes obtained in step 210 is identified, although multiple points of interest may be identified.
- a score is calculated for each of the ⁇ points of interest not collected by user 105 with reference to the interest information recorded for the t number of users identified in step 215 in a manner similar to the following equation:
- d ij 1 t ⁇ d ij ⁇ a j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( 8 )
- similarity index s ij is used instead of dissimilarity d ij
- the similarity values may be normalized to ensure d ij has a value between 0 and 1.
- process 200 is that the most popular points of interest for the users most dissimilar to user 105 are identified, thereby providing novel, and hopefully interesting, points of interest that fall outside of the interest information recorded for user 105 .
- FIG. 2B illustrates an item-based process 250 by which recommended points of interest are identified.
- the term “item-based” indicates that the collaborative filtering technique employed by recommender 125 will rely upon determining a degree of similarity between pairs of items, which is used to identify items similar to those previously collected by user 105 , as indicated by the interest information stored in interest information database 120 .
- computing the similarity of a pair of items i and j begins with identifying the set U of users for which interest information is recorded for both items i and j.
- Many techniques are known in the art for calculating the similarity of the items based on the interest information recorded for the users in U. For example, the cosine angle technique shown in equation (1) above serves as a suitable similarity index.
- a similarity index referred to as correlation-based similarity, which calculates the similarity s ij as follows:
- s ij ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , i - a _ i ) ⁇ ( a u , j - a _ j ) ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , i - a _ i ) 2 ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , j - a _ j ) 2 ( 10 )
- a u,i denotes the interest information of user u on item i
- ⁇ i is the average value of the interest information of the i-th item.
- a similarity index referred to as adjusted cosine similarity, which calculates the similarity s ij as follows:
- s ij ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , i - a _ u ) ⁇ ( a u , j - a _ u ) ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , i - a _ u ) 2 ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ U ⁇ ( a u , j - a _ u ) 2 ( 11 )
- a u,i denotes the interest information of user u on item i
- ⁇ u is the average value of the interest information for the u-th user.
- interest information database 120 obtains and stores interest information for user 105 and other users regarding points of interest. As discussed previously, this interest information may be obtained from map service 110 , search engine 115 , or other online services. The collection of this interest information occurs over time, and before the search corresponding to step 260 begins. The obtained interest information is subject to privacy protections, as discussed previously.
- recommendation system 125 obtains attributes constraining a search for points of interest tracked by interest information database 120 .
- attributes constraining a search for points of interest tracked by interest information database 120 For example, although user 105 may be interested in a new and different dining experience, there may be geographical constraints (such as cities or other geographical areas to which a search should be limited), a ceiling on an expected price of a meal, and minimum levels of food quality and service that the user wishes to ensure are observed. These constraints may be used to filter out points of interest that do not satisfy the obtained constraints, either before or after performing collaborative filtering, based on related information included in interest information database 120 or available through, for example, map service 110 .
- recommendation system 125 identifies a point of interest that satisfies the attributes obtained in step 260 and that are most dissimilar to the interest information recorded for user 105 , although multiple points of interest may be identified. For each point of interest i not collected by user 105 , its similarity is calculated against each point of interest collected by user 105 . The calculated similarities are used to identify set J of the k collected points of interest which are least similar (e.g., most dissimilar) to uncollected point of interest i. From this, a value for point of interest i is calculated as follows:
- a u,j is the value of the interest information for user 105 for the j-th item in the set J of most dissimilar points of interest.
- dissimilarity d ij can be derived from a similarity s ij .
- au,j may be excluded and/or the interest information from other users may be used for ranking the dissimilar points of interest.
- the uncollected points of interest are ranked according to their respective scores p u,i and presented in rank order to user 105 via map service 110 .

- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used
- the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device).
- client device e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device.
- Data generated at the client device e.g., a result of the user interaction
- any specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed is an illustration of exemplary approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged, or that all illustrated steps be performed. Some of the steps may be performed simultaneously. For example, in certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components illustrated above should not be understood as requiring such separation, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- a phrase such as an “aspect” does not imply that such aspect is essential to the subject technology or that such aspect applies to all configurations of the subject technology.
- a disclosure relating to an aspect may apply to all configurations, or one or more configurations.
- a phrase such as an aspect may refer to one or more aspects and vice versa.
- a phrase such as a “configuration” does not imply that such configuration is essential to the subject technology or that such configuration applies to all configurations of the subject technology.

Abstract
Description
In the second pair of indices, the Jaccard similarity is calculated as follows:
Also, dissimilarity dij can be calculated as the number of different objects that two users have collected:
Each of these may be normalized as follows:
Where similarity index sij is used instead of dissimilarity dij, dij can be substituted with, for example, the following:
d ij=1+min(s i1 , s i2 , . . . , s it)−s ij (9)
With this, the lower the value of sij, the closer the value dij will be to 1. Optionally, the similarity values may be normalized to ensure dij has a value between 0 and 1.
Where au,i denotes the interest information of user u on item i, and āi is the average value of the interest information of the i-th item.
Where au,i denotes the interest information of user u on item i, and āu is the average value of the interest information for the u-th user.
Where au,j is the value of the interest information for
