Video summarization
As described above, it is described herein the technology for summarizing media.Being had according to typical viewer to the segment of media more (has
Mostly not) interested, exemplary realize grades to the segment of media.
In the technology for summarizing media, beholder when analysis beholder watches and listens to media interacts to identify and see
The person of seeing is considered most interesting media fragment.These interactions include participating in and interacting with multiple beholders of media, and
Below with reference to described for the realization of video media.Although reference video media describe to summarize the reality of the technology of media
It is existing, but these technologies can apply to audio media files, such as music, podcast, audio books etc.；Multimedia presentation etc..
With viewing video clipping, the spectators of video clipping usually decline.Only most interested video clipping is cut in video
The beholder number identical with beginning is kept at the end of volume.With video clipping is played, spectators decline the mode occurred to a certain degree
How interesting upper instruction video clipping have.
In one implementation, three beholders groups are utilized for summarizing the technology of media, the beholder group's of even now
Member can be overlapped.The referred to here as first set of group A or grading person is the sight scored with some interest score value video segment
The person of seeing or sequencing level compare.In more conventional realization, this will be relatively small group, such as hundreds of beholders.
Second set-referred to here as group B or interaction beholder 1- is the beholder with the video interactive in training set.
During one is realized, which can be relatively large, such as 1,000,000,000 beholders.
3rd set-referred to here as group C or interaction beholder 2- is the beholder with giving " new " video interactive.One
In a realization, the group energy is relatively larger than grading person group but is relatively shorter than beholder 1 crowd interested, for example, hundreds of beholders to it is several with
Between the beholder of hundred billion meters.
Interact from the beholder of the grading of grading person's set-group A-and set-group B of interaction beholder 1-train mould
Type.It interacts compared with the beholder of model and group C, scores the segment of new video.
In one implementation, video clipping is divided into segment (or screenshotss), not necessarily equal length.Based on when viewing segment
When the interest level that shows, score the segment of video clipping.Interest level can be determined in various ways.For example, grading person
Directly input their interest level.Grading person can provide " interest level " of each segment or provide comparison measuring, such as " piece
Section 1 " is more interesting than " segment 2 ".Can be in Chechik, Sharma, Shalit, Bengio, " Large Scale Online
Learning of Image Similarity Through Ranking",11 Journal of Machine Learning
Research 1 109 (in March, 2010) see how based on counterpart's judgement come training pattern example (with based on people's ordinal number
Scoring is opposite).
The interaction from interaction beholder group 1 and interaction beholder group 2 can be determined in various ways.It is seen for example, can utilize
The person's of seeing repeated fragment reduces broadcasting speed, segment during increasing broadcasting speed, segment during skipping segment, pause segment, segment
Period increases volume etc. during reducing volume, segment.Moreover, comment of the beholder to video can be utilized, such as work as beholder
When comment refers to the particular moment in video.The link for the specified point being directed toward in video can be utilized.
To recognize according to the one or more realizations described in the disclosure, beholder can select to exit offer information,
Such as personal information, demographic information, location information, specific information, sensitive information etc..In addition, one described herein
Or multiple realizations can provide the data for gathering, receiving or transmitting for anonymity.
For some realizations, scoring is binary so that segment is marked as less interesting or interesting.Some realize with
Higher granularity grade scores to video segment.It can be scored for example, realizing by beholder's interest Integer n segment, wherein, 0≤n
≤ N, and wherein N represents highest beholder's interest level.
When segment starts, spectators are normalized.For example, when segment starts, spectators is made to be normalized to 1.For some
It realizes, if normalized spectators fall under a certain threshold value T during segment is played, wherein, 0<T<1, then it can be by piece segment mark
It is denoted as less interesting.Otherwise, it is interesting by the fragment label.When spectators are less than threshold value T, fragment length can be adjusted.It can calculate
Calibration threshold value inhibits the minimum length of spectators afterwards, such as implements maximum length, or both.
Other realize the time-derivative that spectators are measured when playing segment.The increase instruction spectators of the size of the time-derivative
Rapid decrease, it is less interesting that signal informs that the segment is regarded as.If the time of the spectators of any time point leads during broadcasting
Several sizes is bigger than a certain specified threshold, and fragment label can be less interesting by realization.The reduction of the size of the time-derivative
Indicate the quick increase of spectators, signal, which is informed, thinks that the segment is very interesting.If the spectators' of any time point during playing
The size of time-derivative is smaller than a certain specified threshold, which can be very interesting by realization.
It is not some binary realizations for score level, threshold value set { T can be introduced0T1…TN, wherein, T0<T1
<…<TNAnd wherein, if the maximum of the size of time-derivative spectators falls in interval [T during segment is playednTn+1] in,
It is scored by beholder's interest Integer n segment, wherein, for convenience, Tn+1It is considered as infinity.
For some video clippings, interesting segment can be after a series of less interesting segments.Preceding several less interesting
After segment, spectators may drastically decline, but there may be many more interesting segments in video clipping.It is big bright due to spectators
It is aobvious to reduce, it is statistically not notable in time measurement spectators later.Therefore, when spectators are relatively low, such as due in the early time not
Too interesting segment, the system can use the measurement for capturing the interesting segment in video, such as by normalizing to relatively low spectators' grade
Or using the heavier measurement of the width of the weighting depth ratio interaction of interaction.
For example, energy measuring signal informs that the beholder mutual with video clipping more deep friendship interacts.Whether example includes beholder
Shared, hair is taken segment to comment on, chat, is annotated, playback action is converted to from searching action, goes to full frame, increase volume,
From full frame diminution or the action of reduction volume.Example below can represent less interesting segment, and the example of front can be with table
It is shown with interesting segment.
Regression analysis and (smooth) action of other kinds of filtering can be performed in some measurement quality as described above.
Regression analysis refers to for the statistical technique of the relation between predictor.The various examples of regression analysis include linear regression mould
Type, simple linear regression, logistic regression, nonlinear regression, non parametric regression, robust regression and successive Regression.
For example, the time that time instance can be taken as one second and can be measured at each time instance spectators leads
Number.The result is that the time series of spectators' measurement (in this case, measurement is time-derivative).This time series is properly termed as
Beholder schemes.Filtering can be applied to these original measurements of time-derivative, and smooth time series or beholder is caused to scheme.It is existing
Wherein previously described measurement of the time-derivative compared with threshold value can be applied to smoothingtime derivative.Similar comment
Suitable for other measurement amounts.
Above-mentioned measurement can be grouped together to form characteristic vector so that associated with each segment is its component
For the characteristic vector of the value of such as measured measurement.Characteristic vector is the n n dimensional vector ns for the numerical characteristics for representing some object.It can be with
Training returns filter or grader in a large amount of segments and beholder.
For example, can by one or more beholders to segment scoring come it is determined that beholder associated with the segment
Interest-degree and can be segment determine 0 to 10 integer score value.In addition or alternatively, ordinal number can also be utilized to score
Relative scores beyond (a should obtain score value 7) (a is more than b).Then, big beholder group can watch the segment so that obtain
Obtain measured feature vector set.Given beholder is applied to the score value of the segment, can be by such as regression analysis or classification
Multiple statistical techniques are applied to measurement feature vector set, so that training returns filter or grader.
Recurrence filter or grader are the examples of model.In general, model is considered as independent variable (measured spectators
Measurement) with the mapping of dependent variable (the interest score value of segment).It can select the model in addition to filter or grader is returned.
Once it is determined that returning filter or grader, when video mandatory system receives video clipping, filter is returned
Or grader can be on video clipping so that can summarize (editor) video clipping.For example, it can edit 0 to 10
Score value scale on have less than 5 score value all segments, in order to provide shorter, more interesting video clipping.To file mesh
, original video clips can be preserved or it is made to can be used for the complete viewing of beholder.The compiled version of more than one can be made
This, what option is thus provided for beholder can watch.
Fig. 6 is the flow chart for the operation for summarizing the media mandatory system 501 in media according to the diagram of a realization.Other
The step of realization performs Fig. 6 with different order.In addition, other realize include from step described herein it is different and/or in addition
Step.
When receiving video (602), to ranking person's display of video clips (604).Ranking person can be according to the segment to typical case
Beholder have it is how interesting come to segment ranking (606).When beholder watches segment, the measurement of the interaction of beholder is obtained
(608), as described above.Create feature vector set (610).Preference pattern such as returns filter or grader (612).It uses
The ranking provided by beholder training pattern (614) on feature vector set.Other segments for forming video clipping are repeated should
Process and correspondingly update the model.Different video type can be based on, further division training.For example, can to movement and
