Fig. 1 is the block diagram with the video trusteeship service 100 of the video commending system 102 based on video co-occurrence.A plurality of user/beholders use client 110A-N that video is sent to video trusteeship service 100 to carry out trustship, and receive and comprise the various services of video in being recommended in from video trusteeship service 100.Video trusteeship service 100 is communicated by letter with one or more client 110A-N via network 130.Video trusteeship service 100 also can provide video recommendation service with video commending system 102, and described video is recommended to return to client 110A-N.
Turn to the indivedual entities shown in Fig. 1, the service that user uses video trusteeship service 100 to provide by each client 110.For instance, one or more videos recommendations that user comes uploaded videos or video group, watches video and receive the video for just watching by client 110.Client 110 can be the computer installation (for example personal computer (for example, desk-top computer, notebook, laptop computer)) of any type and the device (for example mobile phone or personal digital assistant) with the ability of record video content.Client 110 comprises that processor, the display device output terminal of display device (or to), client 110 store user's data used when executing the task into local storage (for example hard disk drive or flash memory devices) wherein and conventionally for be coupled to the network interface of video trusteeship service 100 via network 130.
Client 110 also has video player 120 for displaying video stream (for example,, from the Flash of Adobe system house
tMplayer, or proprietary a player).Video player 120 can be independently application program or is the plug-in unit of Another Application program (for example web browser).For example, in the situation that client 110 is fexible unit (desk-top computer, mobile phone), player 120 is embodied as the software of being carried out by computing machine conventionally.For example, in the situation that client 110 is special purpose device (dedicated video player), the combination of player 120 available hardware or hardware and software is implemented.With regard to embodiments of the invention, all these embodiments are all equivalent in function.
Network 130 makes can communicate by letter between client 110 and video trusteeship service 100.In one embodiment, network 130 is the Internet, and use to allow standardization connected network communication technology that client 110 communicates by letter with video trusteeship service 100 and agreement (present known or develop subsequently).In another embodiment, network 130 is system for cloud computing and one or more assemblies of comprising video trusteeship service 100.
Video trusteeship service 100 comprises video commending system 102, video server 104 and video co-occurrence database 106.Other embodiment of video trusteeship service 100 can comprise other and/or different computer modules.Video server 104 storages for example, by user or the video being created by other sources and video play lists (video of, being recommended by video commending system 102).Video co-occurrence database 106 storage and the video co-occurrence statistics that is stored in video in video server 104 and video play lists and is associated.Video commending system 102 comprises video co-occurrence module 200, video ranking module 300, video recommending module 400 and video recommendation update module 500.The video of video commending system 102 analyzing stored in video server 104 is to produce video co-occurrence statistics and to recommend video for user-selected video to user by video co-occurrence statistics.In one embodiment, video commending system 102 off-line (that is, not in real time) produce for the video of target video and recommend.Other embodiment of video commending system 102 can produce in real time video recommendation and/or produce in real time video with the video recommending data that off-line produces and recommend.
The video that uploads to video trusteeship service 100 can be grouped in a plurality of list of videos, and each list of videos has the order of one group of video and described video playback.In one embodiment, user in list of videos, and uploads to video Entrust Server 100 by described list of videos by video packets.List of videos by user grouping is known as user's playlist.For instance, a user is grouped into list of videos by 20 home videos and specifies the order of described video playback.In another embodiment, the entity of video trusteeship service 100 (for example, video commending system 102) by a plurality of video packets in list of videos.List of videos by 102 groupings of video commending system is known as " system plays list ".For instance, video commending system 102 will for example, from certain artistical a plurality of video packets (, playlist of the music video of Lady Gaga) in list of videos.It is that user video playlist or system video playlist all have one group of video for list of videos, and this group video is play by the order of describing in the metadata being associated with described list of videos.The metadata of list of videos also can comprise other information, for example the uplink time of sign, video source, video tab and the video of the video number in described list, video.
The video co-occurrence data description of the video in list of videos described video be grouped into the frequency in the same video list that is stored in video server 104 and other list of videos together with other videos.The first video is grouped into frequency in one or more list of videos and has indicated and watch the user of the first video to watch the possibility grade of the second video together with the second video.Two videos that are grouped together on video play lists are also known as " co-occurrence video ".
Consider the example shown in Fig. 3, (that is, V1) at the first video play lists, (that is, L1) upper, described the first video play lists comprises video V1, V2 and V3 to video 1.Also at another video play lists, (that is, L2) upper, this another video play lists comprises video V1, V2, V4 and V5 to V1.(that is, co-occurrence) twice together with the video co-occurrence data indications V1 of video V1 is grouped into V2, with V3 once, with V4 once and with V5 once.The video co-occurrence data indication being associated with V1 watches the user of V1 compared with watching video V3, V4 or V5 more may watch V2.
Except video play lists, the video co-occurrence data of video also can be based on other media channels.For instance, can be on same subscriber channel, blog post or webpage displaying video.For the media channel beyond video play lists, video commending system 102 can be applied same or similar treatment step and recommend to produce video.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of the video co-occurrence module 200 of the video commending system 102 based on video co-occurrence shown in Fig. 1.In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, video co-occurrence module 200 comprises analysis module 210 and co-occurrence statistics module 220.Analysis module 210 receives the video play lists that is stored in video server 104, metadata that extraction is associated with described video play lists and makes each video and another video on video play lists paired on same playlist.Analysis module 210 for every two videos on video play lists produce video to and process similarly all video play lists that receive.
Use the example in Fig. 3, analysis module 210 receives three video play lists: L1, L2 and L3.Playlist L1 has three video V1, V2 and V3, and the video in playlist L1 is play by the order of V1, V2 and V3.Playlist L2 has four video V1, V2, V4 and the V5 that the order by V1, V2, V4 and V5 is play.Playlist L3 has two video V2 and V4, and V2 play before V4.The metadata that analysis module 210 extractions are associated with each video play lists L1, L2 and L3 is to identify the video in each playlist and to make each video and other videos in described playlist paired on same playlist.For instance, for the V1 on video play lists L1, analysis module 210 produces six videos pair: (V1, V2), (V1, V3), (V2, V3), (V2, V1), (V3, V2) and (V3, V1).In one embodiment, the video in 210 pairs of video play lists of analysis module is used and arranges to produce video pair.Analysis module 210 is removed the video pair repeating.If two videos are to containing same video, a video is to being regarded as the right repetition of another video originally so.For instance, video is the repetition basis of video to (V2, V3) to (V3, V2).Analysis module produces three unique videos pair for video play lists L1 after analyzing: (V1, V2), (V1, V3) and (V2, V3).
Similarly, the video pair that analysis module 210 produces for video play lists L2 and L3.For instance, six videos pair that analysis module 210 produces for L2: (V1, V2), (V1, V4), (V1, V5), (V2, V4), (V2, V5) and (V4, V5), and produce a video pair for L3: (V2, V4).Analysis module 210 by the video of analyzed video play lists to sending co-occurrence statistics module 220 to be further processed.
Each video that co-occurrence statistics module 220 is analyzed for analysis module 210 produces video co-occurrence data.In one embodiment, the co-occurrence statistics of video is that described video is grouped into the frequency on one or more video play lists together with another video.Use the example in Fig. 3, the co-occurrence statistics of video V1 comprise V1 and video V2 on video play lists L1, L2 and L3 as the right number of times of video (, 2), V1 and video V3 are as the right number of times of video (, 1), V1 and video V4 are as the right number of times of video (, 1) and V1 and video V5 on video play lists L1, L2 and L3 as the right number of times of video (that is, 1).Co-occurrence statistics module 220 can be expressed as the video co-occurrence statistics of analyzed video the right matrix of video (that is, as shown in Figure 3 element 320).Co-occurrence statistics module 220 is stored in the video co-occurrence statistics of analyzed video in video co-occurrence database 106.
Co-occurrence statistics module 220 can be each video of analyzing by analysis module 210 and produces auxiliary video co-occurrence data.In one embodiment, auxiliary video co-occurrence data are point (hops) number that jumps between two videos by one or more other video links.Apart from the less video jumping a little of target video, than wide video, more another video and the target video of large " jumping a little " number are more closely related.
Take video V3 in Fig. 3 for example, video V3 is only included in video play lists L1, and V3 and video V5 not together with on any video play lists.Yet V3 and V1 are (that is, L1) upper, and V1 and V5 are at same playlist (that is, L2) at same playlist.Via video V1, V3 is connected with V5, and " jumping a little " between V3 and V5 number is 2 (for example, V3 → V1 → V5).Auxiliary video co-occurrence data (number for example " jumps a little ") can be used for the video relevant with target video to carry out rank by video ranking module 300.For instance, for two videos on two different video playlists being carried out to rank for target video, at a video, be that 1 far away and another video of jumping is a little 2 and jumps a little far away in the situation that, the rank of the video of 300 pairs of video ranking module away from jumping a little from 1 of target video is higher than another video away from jumping a little from 2 of target videos.
The video that 300 pairs of the video ranking module of the video commending system 102 in Fig. 1 are stored in video server 104 carries out rank.For electing each video of recommending for video in the video from video server 104, video ranking module 300 is considered as the selected video for recommending target video and selects one or more other associated videos from video server 104.Video can be in every way, and for example the uplink time of video content, video source, video and being grouped into together with other videos on one or more video play lists, relevant to another video.
In one embodiment, the video co-occurrence statistics of video ranking module 300 based on being associated with video carried out rank to the video being stored in video server 104.The co-occurrence video of video commending system 102 select target videos.Co-occurrence video for being grouped on video play lists video at least one times together with target video.Video commending system 102 based on target video and selected with selecting the video co-occurrence statistics that video is associated to carry out rank to selected co-occurrence video.Each video has expression and watches the user of target video to watch the rank score of metering of the possibility of described video after sequence.At real-time video, share in environment, the video that user is just playing becomes target video.
Take the video V1 in Fig. 3 to give an example, video ranking module 300 selects V1 to identify as target video and the video co-occurrence statistics based on being associated with V1 the video being associated with V1: video V2, V3, V4 and V5, this is because video V2, V3, V4 and each in V5 have been grouped in video play lists L1, L2 and L3 at least one times together with V1.Frequency together with video ranking module 300 is grouped into V1 based on associated video V2, V3, V4 and V5 is to these videos further sort (sort).Result as sequence, video ranking module 300 couples of video V2, V3, V4 and V5 have carried out rank, wherein because video co-occurrence statistics instruction video V1 that V1 is associated with V2 be grouped into V2 together with twice, so the rank of video V2 is higher than video V3, V4 and V5.
At the video in video server 104, carry out in rank process, other embodiment of video ranking module 300 consider one or more other factors.For instance, video ranking module 300 can be considered the distance of the video in video play lists and/or the order that the distance between two videos on playlist depends on described two video playback.For instance, the video play lists L2 in Fig. 3 has four video V1, V2, V4 and V5.Distance between V1 and V2 is that the distance between 1, V1 and V4 is 2, and the distance between V1 and V5 is 3.In one embodiment, video ranking module 300 is assigned to and at a distance of the rank of more short-range video, obtains proportion by subtraction and target video with target video apart the video of longer distance is high.Video ranking module 300 also can make for the video being associated with target video is carried out to rank together with the range information of the video co-occurrence statistics being associated with target video and target video.For instance, together with although video V1 has been grouped into video V3 (in video play lists L1) (in video play lists L2) once once and together with being grouped into video V5, but the distance between V1 and V3 is 2, and distance between V1 and V5 is 3.The rank that video ranking module 300 is assigned to video V3 obtains the height of proportion by subtraction video V5.
The uplink time that spendable another factor of video ranking module 300 is the video that is associated with target video.User more likely watches the video of roughly uploading at same time together.Video ranking module 300 can be extracted video uplink time and sort based on the video uplink time pair video being associated with target video from target video.For instance, the video V1 in Fig. 3 and video V3 are grouped into together and in video play lists L1 and together with video V4, are grouped into the frequency identical (that is, 1) in video play lists L2.With regard to V1, if the video uplink time of V3 than the uplink time of V2 the uplink time closer to V1, video ranking module 300 comes V3 before V4 so.
Video ranking module 300 can be further considered other factors, the video quality of each video being for example associated with target video and the pouplarity of video.For instance, the video about " national geography " of professional person's production has than the high rank score of similar video of amateur's production.The video that thousands of users share has the rank score higher than the video of sharing in a small set of friend.In order to consider for the video being associated with target video being carried out to a plurality of factors of rank, video ranking module 300 can be assigned to each rank factor the total rank score of each video that weight and calculating is associated with target video.The weight that is assigned to each rank factor is configurable design alternative, such as the user profile of the user channel based in description video sharing environment, consumer taste etc.
In another embodiment, 300 pairs of video play lists self of video ranking module carry out rank.The rank score of each the indivedual videos of video ranking module 300 based in video play lists and produce the rank score of described video play lists.Video ranking module 300 can be further considered the characteristic being associated with video play lists, the number of times that for example founder's of video play lists reputation, the user channel that has to the founder of video play lists are submitted to.Video ranking module 300 is with regard to the rank of the rank and video play lists self of the video in video play lists and communicate by letter with video recommending module 400.
Video in the video recommending module 400 receiver, video playlists of the video commending system 102 in Fig. 1 and the rank of video play lists self and be that each video on video play lists produces video and recommends.In one embodiment, one group of video that the rank of video recommending module 400 generations based on video sorts is recommended as the video for target video.Take the video V1 in Fig. 3 to give an example, video recommending module 400 produces one group of video: V2, V3, V4 and V5 and recommends as video, and wherein V2 is as the video of being recommended most in video recommended candidate person V2, V3, V4 and V5.
Video recommending module 400 can improve the rank of the indivedual videos in video play lists by the rank of the video play lists that contains described video.For instance, than the video having on the video play lists of lower rank score, the rank with the video on the video play lists of high playlist rank score improves in proportion.Video recommending module 400 can the rank score based on video play lists be applied to proportionality factor zero and between the rank of the video on video play lists.
Fig. 3 is the example of the operation of the video recommendation based on video co-occurrence.Video co-occurrence module 200 receives three video play lists 310.Video play lists L1, L2 and L3 can be produced and upload to video sharing service 100 or for example, be produced by the entity (, video commending system 102) of video sharing service 100 by user.Video play lists L1 has three video V1, V2 and V3, and video play lists L2 has four video V1, V2, V4 and V4, and video play lists L3 has two video V2 and V4.Video co-occurrence module 220 is analyzed as mentioned above described video and is made described video paired in video play lists.Result from video co-occurrence module 220 is the right frequency of video in the right matrix of video 320 and video play lists L1, L2 and L3.Each video has the video co-occurrence statistics being associated from described analysis.
Video ranking module 300 from video co-occurrence module 200 receiver, videos to described video being carried out to rank with frequency data and the video co-occurrence statistics based on being associated with described video.Video ranking module 300 also as mentioned above the video co-occurrence statistics of the video based on containing in video play lists described video play lists is carried out to rank.Video ranking module 300 can be based on containing indivedual videos the rank of video play lists improve the rank of described video.Video ranking module 300 communicates by letter further to process video co-occurrence statistics with video recommending module 400.
The rank of video recommending module 400 based on video and one or more other factors are (for example, the distance of video, the uplink time of video) produce recommendation for each video on video play lists L1, L2 and L3 (for example, the video in Fig. 3 recommends 330).In one embodiment, each video has one or more other videos relevant with it, and video is based on recommending with described video and described video the video co-occurrence statistics being associated with the relation between its video recommendation.
