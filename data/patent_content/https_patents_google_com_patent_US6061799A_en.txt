Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to data processing systems, and more specifically, to a data processing system requiring password authentication to access.
- client processes are coupled, typically through a network configuration, to one or more server processes.
- the server processes may comprise a dedicated process which performs a specific service such as providing access to a database or a network.
- a client process wishing to access a server process must comply with an authentication protocol before access is granted.
- Many authentication protocols are based on passwords or password-derived information. Problems arise, however, when a client process modifies or changes its password, a server process does not yet have knowledge of a changed password. As a result, access to the server process may be denied until the server is updated with the information related to the password. In a multiple server environment, multiple denials as well as multiple updating procedures may result. Such a result is undesirable for a number of reasons.
- a user selects a password which is then used to generate a binary value, i.e., a key.
- a binary value i.e., a key.
- the key traditionally does not change. Instead, the new password is used to encrypt the key which is then stored within a client identification file. If an imposture obtains both the identification file and the user password, subsequent of changing of passwords will not prevent the impostor from impersonating the user.
- the invention provides a portable medium useful of authenticating to a computer system.
- the medium interfaces with the computer system and contains thereon data associated both with a current password and noncurrent user passwords.
- Authorization data associated with the client process and previously stored on the computer system is compared with the data stored on the medium.

- the computer system comprises logic responsive to one of the plurality of key identifiers for allowing access by the identified client process, if one of the plurality of key identifiers corresponds to authentication data associated with the client process.
- a method for generating portable authentication medium for use with a computer system comprises the steps of providing a medium capable of storing data thereon, generating a first key at least partially derived from a first password, storing the first key on the medium, generating a second key at least partially derived from a second password, storing the second key on the medium, designating one of the first and second keys as a current key, and storing on the medium data identifying the client process associated with the passwords.
- the method further comprises the steps of generating first and second key identifiers at least partially derived from the first and second digital keys, respectively, and storing the first and second key identifiers on the medium.
- the method further comprises the step of designating one of the first and second key identifiers as a current key identifier.
- a computer program product for use with a computer system comprises a computer useable medium having stored thereon a client identifier identifying a client process, a plurality of keys, one of the keys designated as a current key associated with a current password, and computer program code.
- the computer program code comprises program code, responsive to an authorization challenge from a computer process, for supplying one of the plurality of keys stored on the medium to the computer process, the key corresponding to the authorization data with which the computer process presented the authorization challenge, and, program code for supplying to the computer process a key identifier associated with the current digital key, if the computer process presented authentication data corresponding to other than the current key.
- an apparatus for use with a computer system comprises a medium having stored thereon a client identifier, a plurality of passwords, one of the passwords designated as a current password, and a secret parameter uniquely identifying the client process.
- a computer system used in combination with the apparatus comprises authorization logic responsive to one of the plurality of passwords and the secret parameter for allowing access by the identified client process.
- the authorization logic further comprises key generation logic responsive to one of the passwords and the secret parameter and configured to generate authentication data at least partially derived from the password.

- an identification (ID) file 300 comprises a secret parameter 302, a current password 304, one or more noncurrent passwords 306, and one or more keys 308, each key associated with one of the passwords.
- ID file 300 may further include a domain list 310 and client identifier 312, as explained hereinafter.
- ID file 300 is created when a user is registered with a system and is updated as necessary.
- client file 300 may be implemented as an object, with secret parameter 302, passwords 304 and 306, keys 308 and domain list 310 as attributes to the client file object.
- passwords 304 and 306 are illustrated as being part of client ID file 300.
- passwords 304 and 306 do not have to be stored as part of the client ID file 300, as illustrated hereinafter with reference to FIG. 6A, as long as the authentication information derived from or associated with a password, e.g., keys 308, are contained within client ID file 300.
- Secret parameter 302 may be implemented using a high quality secret number.
- secret parameter 302 is implemented with a private encryption key comprising several long integer numbers.
- One type of encryption key suitable for use as secret parameter 302 is a RSA private encryption key, adhering to the RSA data encryption standard, and which is assigned to a user at the time ID file 300 is generated. Algorithms for generating such encryption keys are known in the art and will not be described herein.
- Current password 304 as well as noncurrent passwords 306 may be implemented as user-definable data such as alphanumeric character strings, or with predefined digital data such as a personal identification number (PIN), similar to that used with credit cards, phone cards, bank cards, etc.
- Noncurrent passwords 306 may have the same format and data type as current password 304, and typically comprise passwords which have expired, been modified by the user, or, even future passwords which are intended to be used at a point in the future.
- keys 308 may comprise a password itself, a one-way hash of a password, a public key corresponding to a private key derived from data including the password, a one-way hash of a public key corresponding to a private key derived from data including the password, a sequence number identifying password, a randomly-generated number, or other data associated with a client process.
- the key identifier may refer to any information which upon presentation to the client process enables the client process to determine if the appropriate key is contained within ID file 300 or medium 600 and 620, as explained hereinafter.
- key 308 is generated by a process illustrated conceptually in FIGS. 3B and 4.
- secret parameter 302 and one of the passwords, illustrated here as current password 304 are combined, e.g., concatenated, together and supplied to a pseudo-random number generator 320.
- the data output generated by pseudo-random number generator 320 serves as a key 308.
- a pseudo-random number generator will produce the same output data for the same given input data each time. Conversely, a completely random number generator will produce, theoretically, a different data output for the same input data every time.
- key 308 comprises aw digital value representing cryptographic key, such as a secret key, or a public/private key combination.
- a secret key is typically a digital value which can be used in both encrypt and decrypt data.
- the public key is used to encrypt data while the private key, typically known only to the user, is used to decrypt such public key encryptions.
- key 308 is illustrated as a public/private key encryption key combination comprising a private key component 308A and a public key component 308B portions of which are stored in ID file 300.
- pseudo-random number generator 320 may be implemented with RC4 Symmetric Stream Cipher product, commercially available from RSA Data Security, Inc., Redwood City, Calif. As a result, generator 320 will output a RSA private/public key encryption combination the private key portion of which may be used as private key component 308A and the public key portion of which may be used as public key component 308B. It will be obvious to those reasonably skilled in the arts that other types of encryption generation techniques may be utilized to encrypt key 308, such as Digital Signature Standard (DSS), ELGamal, or other encryption technology. In addition, other pseudo-random number generator algorithms such as those compliant with the X.9 banking standard may be used for generator 320.
- DSS Digital Signature Standard
- ELGamal ELGamal
- a public key identifier 308C e.g. a hash or message digest
- public key component 308B By supplying the public key component as the input to process logic 325, the output of which serves as the public key identifier 308C.
- Public key identifier 308C is stored along with public key component 308A, public key component 308B, and its appropriate password in ID file 300.

- the structured function of hashing as well as message digest algorithm suitable for use with process logic 325 are known within the arts and will not be described here and after.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the method steps used in generating the key 308, as previously described.
- a determination is made as to whether or not the current password 304 has been modified, as indicated by decisional step 400. If the previous current password has been modified, secret parameter 302 is combined with the new password data which then serves as the current password 304, as illustrated by process 402. In the illustrative embodiment, secret parameter 302 is concatenated with current password 304. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that other combinations of parameter 302 and password 304 may be utilized as the input data for the pseudo-random number generator 320, e.g., a check sum of both the parameters or the result of a logical exclusive-OR operation of both parameters.
- the data resulting from the combination of secret parameter 302 and current password 304 is supplied to a pseudo-random number generator, as illustrated by procedural step 404.
- the resultant output data of the pseudo-random number generator 320 represents a key associated with the current password.
- the key 308 may comprise a public/private key combination in accordance with RSA encryption technology.
- a hash or message digest, or a secure check sum of the message digest of the public key component 308B is generated using techniques known in the art, as illustrated by procedural step 406.
- the private key component 308A, public key component 308B and public key identifier 308C are associated with the password from which they were derived, as illustrated by procedural step 408.
- Such association may occur by storing the values for parameters 308A-C in the same data structure as the password from which they were derived or by using matching tab bits.
- the method illustrated in FIG. 4 is utilized each time the current password 304 is modified or when an initial password is defined or received. From the above disclosure it will be appreciated that the invention contemplates an ID file 300 which includes a key 308 associated with not only the current password 304 but one or more noncurrent passwords 306, as illustrated.
- Client identifier 312 may be implemented similar to client identifier 602 as explained hereinafter.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a process of password authentication in accordance with the present invention.
- client process 210 attempts access to secure server process 216.
- client process 210 forwards an identifier of the client process, such as the user name, to server process 216.
- process 216 Upon receipt of the user name, process 216 will search its accompanying database 216A, utilizing the user name as an index to locate the corresponding public key identifier. If found, server process 216 then transmits to client process 210 the public key identifier, e.g. a hash of the public key associated with client process 210, and a randomly generated number to identify the transmission.
- the public key identifier e.g. a hash of the public key associated with client process 210
- Client process 210 receives the public key identifier, as illustrated by procedural step 502, and compares the public key identifier with public key identifiers 308C in ID file 300, as illustrated by procedural step 504. If the public key identifier received from process 216 does not match any of the public key identifiers 308C stored within ID file 300, the attempt to access server process 216 fails and the authentication process terminates, as illustrated in FIG. 5. Alternatively, if a match does occur, as illustrated by decisional block 506, client process 210 transmits the public key component 308B corresponding to the public key identifier 308C which matched the public key identifier received from server process 216, as illustrated by procedural step 508.
- server process 216 Upon receiving the public key component 308B from client process 210, server process 216 will generate a hash of the public key component and compare such hash with the public key identifier previously transmitted to client process 210. If a match occurs, the client process is authenticated.
- Client process 210 next determines whether the public key component 308B forwarded to server process 216 was associated with the current password 304, as illustrated by decisional block 510. If so, client process 210 takes no further action since server process 216 has the most current public key identifier associated with the client process. Alternatively, if the public key component 308B forwarded to server process 216 was not associated with current password 304, client process 210 will then transmit, preferably in a seamless manner, to server process 216, the public key identifier 308C associated with current password 304, as illustrated by procedural block 512. Thereafter, the process ends since secure server process 216 will again have the public key identifier associated with the then current password for client process 210.
- client process 210 will have an initial password or authentication information immediately upon registration with the computer system, and, that server process 216, as well as the other servers within the same domain, similarly receive authentication data sufficient to execute an authentication protocol in which the client process proves knowledge of its authentication information.
- server process 216 may be performed by a system administrator which assigns, by default, an initial password or authentication information to the client process 210 and posts the complementary authentication information to server process 216 or another server within the same domain so that the server will receive information sufficient to allow the client process to prove knowledge of the password.
- server process 216 may share such information with server processes 218 and 220 over the network.
- servers 216, 218 and 220 each maintain a directory service database 216A, 218A, and 220A, respectively, as illustrated in FIG. 2, which may be updated copies of the same database or different pieces of a distributed database, or even a hybrid combination thereof.
- servers are organized into logical groups or "domains" which have or share a common directory services database.
- a secure server process for example server process 216
- Server process 218 copies the new key identifier value to its master replica of the directory service database and ultimately distributes the information to the other servers in the domain during the normal process in which the directory service database in updated.
- a time gap may exist from the time in which a new password-derived key identifier is supplied to one server process in the domain until the other server processes in the domain are similarly updated.
- ID file 300 may include a domain list 310 indicating the domains to which its current key identifier has been presented. Assuming that server processes 216, 218, and 220 are in the same domain and that processes 216 and 220 replicate to process 218, if client process 210 has already provided server process 216 with its current public key identifier, client process 210 may optionally not provide server process 220 with its public key identifier, since server process 220 will eventually be updated by server process 218. Before providing the current key identifier to a server process to which it is authenticating, client process 210 checks domain list 310 to determine if any server from the same domain has already received such information, if so step 512 may be skipped for efficiency. Otherwise client process 210 records in domain list 310 the domain of the server to which it just authenticated.
- FIGS. 6A and 6B a portable medium containing a subset of the data contained in the client ID file 300 is illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B.
- FIG. 6A illustrates a computer usable media 600 having stored thereon a client identifier 602, a current key 604, and one or more current noncurrent keys 606.
- a key identifier 608 is associated with each key.
- medium 600 may be implemented with any portable storage medium capable of both storing data thereon and interfacing with a computer system.
- medium 600 may comprise a CD ROM, a magnetic diskette, a card similar to a bank or credit card having the data stored on a magnetic strip thereof, a PCMCIA card adhering to the PCMCIA Standard, a SMART card adhering to the ISO SMART card standard, a smart disk, a dongel, rings or keys having memory integrated thereon, or any other magnetic, semiconductor, optical or other memory technology in which data is capable of being stored.
- Client identifier 602 may comprise any data useful in identifying client process, such as a user name, or client identification number, in binary, alpha numeric or other data format.
- Current key 604 and noncurrent key 606 may be implemented similar to keys 308 as previously described with reference to FIG. 3A.
- key identifiers 608 are similar to key identifier 308C.
- Current key 604 and noncurrent key 606 is similar to keys 308 of FIG. 3.
- the method for generating keys 604 and 606 are similar to that described with reference to FIGS. 3B and 4, as previously described. In the illustrative embodiment, this process occurs through functionality embodied on a computer system which is capable of writing data to medium 600.
- server processes 216, 218, or 220 of FIG. 2 may serve as a computer system suitable for use with medium 600.
- each of the server processes of FIG. 2 may be implemented using a CD ROM drive 146 and diskette drive 141 for receiving CD ROM 147 and magnetic 142, respectively.
- computer system 100 may be configured to include peripheral interfaces for PCMCIA cards, magnetic card readers, or other peripheral devices.
- server process 216 uses the client identifier information as an index into a database 216A which contains authentication data corresponding multiple client process, as illustrated by procedural step 704.
- server process 216 successively reads key identifiers 608 from medium 600 and compares them to the authorization data associated with the client process, as illustrated by procedural step 706.
- server process 216 determines whether the matched key identifier 608 is the current key identifier, as illustrated by decisional step 712. If so, the process ends. Otherwise, server process 216 reads the current key identifier into database 216A, as illustrated by procedure 712, after which, the process terminates.
- the server process may read instead of the key identifier 608, the actual keys 604 or 606 and, utilizing process logic similar to process logic 325 of FIG. 3B, generate a key identifier 608 within the server process which may then be compared with the authentication data of database 216A.
- FIG. 6B An alternative embodiment of medium 600 is illustrated in FIG. 6B.
- a medium 620 implemented similar to medium 600, has stored thereon a client identifier 622, a current password 624, and one or more noncurrent passwords 626.
- medium 620 has stored thereon a secret parameter 628, similar to secret parameter 302 of ID file 300.
- Current password 622 may be implemented similar to current password 304 of ID file 300 while noncurrent password 626 may be implemented to similar to noncurrent passwords 306 of ID file 300.
- Client identifier 622 is similar to client identifier 602 of FIG. 6A.
- the functionality for receiving secret parameter 628 and passwords 624 and 626 may be embodied on a computer system such as process 210 of FIG. 2 which is capable of writing such data to medium 620.
- medium 620 The interaction of medium 620 with a computer system is similar to that previously described above with reference to medium 600, however, server process 216 performs the key generation process, described with reference to FIG. 3B and FIG. 4 to determine whether or not the authorization data is stored in database 216A is associated with the current password or any of the noncurrent passwords. If so, the client process identified by medium 620 is allowed access to the secure server process 216 and the server process may seamlessly update itself with the current data from medium 620.
- server process 216 uses medium 620 to detect the presence of medium 620, as illustrated by decisional step 800.
- server process 216 reads client identifier 622 from medium 620 as illustrated by procedural step 802, and uses the client identifier information as an index into database 216A which contains authentication data corresponding to multiple client processes, as illustrated by procedural step 804.
- server process 216 reads secret parameter 628 from medium 620, as illustrated by procedural step 806.
- server process 216 reads one of the passwords 624 or 626, as illustrated by procedural step 808, and, utilizes secret parameter 628 and the read password 624 or 626 to generate authentication data, i.e., a key or key identifier, as illustrated by procedural step 810.
- authentication data i.e., a key or key identifier
- such a generation process may be that as described with reference to FIG. 3B and the process illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 4.
- the secret parameter and password are used to seed a pseudo-random number generator, similar to generator 320 of FIG. 3B, which generates a key which itself may serve as an authentication data or may be further processed through logic, similar to logic 325 of FIG. 3B, to generate a key identifier.
- the generated key is compared with the authentication data from database 216A, as illustrated by procedural step 812. If a match occurs, as illustrated by decisional step 814, access to server process 216 is allowed, as illustrated by procedural step 816. If no match occurs, the process ends. It will be obvious to those reasonably skilled in the arts that the process for generating keys from the passwords contained on medium 620 and comparing such key to the authentication data may occur in a successive, iterative manner until a match occurs or all keys for all of the password data contained on medium 620 have been generated and compared to the authentication data in database 216A. Next, server process 216 determines whether the key which matched the authentication data in database 216 was associated with the current password, as illustrated by decisional step 818.
- server process 216 reads the current password 624 from medium 620 and generates, using the previously-described method, the key or other authentication data associated with the current password and stored such authentication data in database 216A, as illustrated by procedural step 820, after which the process terminates.
- a software implementation of the invention may comprise a series of computer instructions either fixed on a tangible medium, such as a computer readable media, e.g. diskette 142, CD-ROM 147, ROM 115, or fixed disk 152 of FIG. 1A, or transmittable to a computer system, via a modem or other interface device, such as communications adapter 190 connected to the network 195 over a medium 191.
- Medium 191 can be either a tangible medium, including but not limited to optical or analog communications lines, or may be implemented with wireless techniques, including but not limited to microwave, infrared or other transmission techniques.
- the series of computer instructions embodies all or part of the functionality previously described herein with respect to the invention.
- Such computer instructions can be written in a number of programming languages for use with many computer architectures or operating systems. Further, such instructions may be stored using any memory technology, present or future, including, but not limited to, semiconductor, magnetic, optical or other memory devices, or transmitted using any communications technology, present or future, including but not limited to optical, infrared, microwave, or other transmission technologies. It is contemplated that such a computer program product may be distributed as a removable media with accompanying printed or electronic documentation, e.g., shrink wrapped software, preloaded with a computer system, e.g., on system ROM or fixed disk, or distributed from a server or electronic bulletin board over a network, e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web.
- a removable media with accompanying printed or electronic documentation, e.g., shrink wrapped software, preloaded with a computer system, e.g., on system ROM or fixed disk, or distributed from a server or electronic bulletin board over a network, e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web.
