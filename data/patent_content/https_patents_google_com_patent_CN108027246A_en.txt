Description
Technical field
This disclosure relates to interactive digital map, and more particularly, to the offline map in managing customer end equipment
Data.
Background technology
Background technology description provided in this article is used for the purpose for typically exhibiting the context for the disclosure.In the background
In degree described in technology segment, the work of the inventor nominated at present and can not submit when limit in other ways
Each side for the description of the prior art both ambiguously or had not impliedly been recognized for the prior art for the disclosure.
There is provided interactive digital map, display drives the software for guiding and supporting various geographical functions (" geographic application ")
Using can be operated on various user equipmenies, including desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet PC, intelligence electricity
Words, auto-navigation system.In some cases, user equipment has substantially permanent network connection (such as digital subscriber line
(DSL) or cable internet connects).In other cases, user equipment is attempted via the ripple being subjected in interruption, service quality
The radio communication channel of dynamic, high price (for example, wandering fee) etc. accesses the webserver.
Therefore, geographic application cannot always access the webserver and carry out service users request.Although moreover, user equipment
Operating system can be readily recognized on some in the problem of wireless connectivity, such as when user equipment is in offline mode
When or when wireless service provider specifies the second generation (2G) ability rather than the third generation (3G) connectivity or higher, Qi Talian
Connect sex chromosome mosaicism to be more difficult to detect and can be unexpected, such as when router or data server seem available but are the failure to
When responding, or when user asks the numerical map in region when she leaves hot spot).As another example, when not having
When network connection can use, user can drive via her smart phone request before she rolls away from from underground garage and guide, and
And smart phone obtains network connectivity soon after user starts to drive.
The content of the invention
When the network connection of acceptable quality is available, the geographic application that is operated in user equipment such as smart phone
From the remote server retrieval map datum in on-line mode and various types of geographical spatial datas, and also by some maps
Data and geographical spatial data storage more refer to provide navigation when user equipment operates in off-line mode in a device
Draw, geographic search result, geographical suggest etc..Therefore geographic application supports some geographical functions in the two patterns.In order to make
Conversion between limited off-line data and more robust online data seem it is seamless, when user equipment in on-line model with from
When being changed between ray mode, geographic application is in view of the arrival time of such as online data and available offline circuit and arrival
The poor factor of quality between online data dynamically merges offline and online data.Further, in view of arrival time, matter
Amount and possibly other factors, geographic application dynamically determines when off-line data should be displayed to use in some scenes
Family, when just requested instruction should be displayed to user online and when online data should be displayed to user.
When providing suggestion on potentially relevant search result, such as when the complete search terms of user's key input section or
During location name, geographic application can be in view of how the current location of user equipment can be accurately determined to determine suggestion offline
The difference in quality between suggesting online with (actual or potential).For example, when the current location of user equipment is relatively smart
When true, geographic application can show offline suggestion immediately, but when the current location of user equipment is less accurate, geographic application
It can first attempt to obtain online suggestion, equipment timer, and only display is suggested offline when a timer expires.Further
Ground, geographic application can be with view of the available quantity suggested offline determine whether show immediately suggests offline (for example, single
Offline suggestion can be associated with higher dependent probability).If geographic application receives one or more online suggestions and works as
Geographic application receive it is one or more online when suggesting, if online data is different and/or more offline than what is be currently shown
Data are more robust, and geographic application can provide the control for offline suggestion to be upgraded to the new such as button suggested online
Part.Further, when user is asked to big classification (for example, " gas (gas) ", " French restaurants (France's meal
Shop) ") suggestion when, geographic application can be automatically set limitation and wait the longer time-out suggested online.
When user asks navigation directions, in some cases, geographic application can use off-line data (" offline to guide "
Limit one or more " offline routes ") be immediately generated navigation way and the results are shown in numerical map (for example, or by
Walk instruction set) on.If geographic application then receives navigation data from navigation server, (" online to guide " limits one or more
A " online route "), then geographic application can provide renewal with minimum failure mode via user interface, such as by providing use
The UI controls guided online are checked in alternately route.Guided when the online guide that geographic application determines to recommend is limited with offline
During identical route, traffic data can be merged into the presentation guided offline by geographic application.When geographic application determines to recommend
When guiding online from guiding different offline, after one during user selects online route, geographic application can keep from
Circuit line is as the alternative for cancelling selection, even if offline route does not correspond to any one in online route.
Geographic application can also store on businessman, point of interest and other places for being presented in off-line mode can
With the subset of information.For example, geographic application can store the telephone number of businessman, business hours, the quantity of the grading received
With average, the address in some scale, and editor summarizes (for example, less 40 characters statement) when applicable.If ground
Ought to be with online data then be received, then geographic application can utilize additional data to increase corresponding list, it can include
Longer summary, comment text, site information, street image, photo etc..Further, when geographic application is generated through not having
During the offline route in the region of available potentially relevant offline geographical spatial data, geographic application can generate appropriate notice with
Just the chance that therefore given user plans.For example, geographic application can indicate that geographic application will not if user's deviation route
Alternative and/or return route can be generated, or geographic application will not be able to provide the information on the businessman along the route.
During the navigation along offline route, geographic application can notify user to approach in some within the threshold range in region not to be had
The region of offline geographical spatial data.Instruction can also include region instruction how long.Further, geographic application can to
Suggest that user may want to be added to the classification in the place of navigation way before up to the region of no off-line data.It is for example, geographical
Exist using user automatically can be provided before the region for the suggestion that wherein geographic application will not be able to progress the type is reached
The suggestion stopped at gas station.

The offline map datum stored using the passing travelling from him between Philadelphia and New York generates offline navigation directions.Be likely to from
Line map datum is enough to generate geometric optics or close to optimal route；However, John can not have accurate traffic number
According to or to route good time Estimate.Therefore, geographic application can continue to attempt to reach online navigation server.
When John starts to follow offline route, smart phone finds available wireless network and geography at some point
Reach online navigation server application success.Received in geographic application and limit the online of one or more online navigation ways
After navigation data, geographic application by online navigation data with generate the offline navigation data that offline route uses compare so as to
Identify the floor level of the interruption of user.Especially, geographic application can generate difference measurement, and when difference measurement is in threshold
Value/desired value/in the range of when, geographic application updates offline route to reflect new information using traffic information.For example, John is present
May be it can be seen that 20 mile of highway be blocked in front of his current location.
Referring to figs. 2 and 3 the sample screen shot of A-G, for using online navigation data and offline navigation data with one
As non-demolition mode provide a user the exemplary method 100 of navigation way.For example, method 100 can be implemented in the ground of Fig. 1
Ought to be with 14.More generally, however, method 100 can be implemented as can perform the one of any suitable equipment or equipment group
The instruction set of a or multiple processors.
At block 102, the request for navigating the user to specified destination is received.As illustrated in figure 3 a, for example, with
Family can click on the button for driving guide for asking the position to being selected on map and using place indicator mark.
At block 104, determine whether network connection currently can use, and if it does, then flow goes to block 106.Otherwise, flow is straight
Ground connection goes to block 112.
As indicated above, in some cases, it is actual it is disabled in the case of, the network coverage may seem pair
Portable user can use.At block 106, instruction is shown in line navigation data and is just retrieved.Illustrate this in fig. 2b
The example at the interface of sample.Timer can also start at block 106 to determine whether flow should be transformed into block 108 or 112.When
When offline navigation data is available, the timer that starts at block 106 can be relatively short, and such as some milliseconds are (and even,
In some embodiments it is possible to it is set to zero).If it is determined that can use before the timer expires without the network coverage, then flow
Journey goes to block 112.
Otherwise, timer expires at block 108, and first whether the geographic application for performing method 100 can determine user
Preceding designated any route options, such as " no tolls (there is no pass cost) ".Then, at block 110, using offline
Navigation data generates offline route.However, at this time, it can show that geographic application will attempt the instruction of also retrieval online data.
Fig. 3 C illustrate the exemplary screen of the offline route presented together with the designator for continuing retrieval of online data.Further, energy
It is enough to start timer at block 110 to ensure that it is too long that user is not to wait for online navigation data.The timer can be configured to example
Expire such as within some seconds.
If timer expires before online data is received, flow goes to block 112, wherein, offline route together with
Selectable option for resubmiting the request to online navigation directions is shown.Illustrated in Fig. 3 D corresponding to block 112
Exemplary screen.Otherwise, if online data is received before the timer expires, flow goes to block 114.
At block 114, determine whether be sufficiently close in offline route online.For this purpose, geographic application 14 can incite somebody to action
Each in offline route and online route is expressed as along the set for corresponding to the path point that route is separated with specific interval, and
Determine the quantity of different path points between online navigation directions and the set of offline navigation directions.For example, geographic application 14
It can determine that offline navigation directions have and 9 co-route points of set of online navigation directions and 2 different path points.
In some embodiments, if user by following the guide by steering to start to navigate, can abandon the path point passed through, so
And the path point of arrival can be weighted more heavily.For example, if offline navigation directions have the set with online navigation directions
Common 5 path points and different 5 path points, but user is by 2 in different path points, and common
2 in path point are in close proximity to user, then digital navigation module 44 can determine online navigation directions and offline navigation
Poor measurement between guide is small.
If route be insufficient to it is similar, at block 118, the designator of the new available online route of generation, together with for
Activation such as the control of the display of illustrated online route in fig. 3e.By this way, do not losing undesirably offline
In the case of route, user can be switched to typically more preferable online route when convenient.At block 116, if route is sufficient
It is enough similar, then the available traffic information in online route and the other online datas lost from offline route can be merged into
Offline route.
Such as illustrated in Fig. 3 F, in addition to main route, geographic application can show one or several alternative roads
Line.Even if the quality of offline route is not sufficiently high for alternative list, can also be in by previously presented offline route
It is now one in alternative option.By this way, geographic application ensures the bumpless transfer between on-line mode and off-line mode.
In order to further clear, Fig. 3 G illustrate geographic application and can click in response to user or select in other ways
The screen selected the offline navigation way for example provided in the screen of Fig. 3 D and generated.Geographic application can continue in this case
The instruction that off-line data will generate route is presented.The remainder of screen is by the navigation way on numerical map in this example
More detailed overlapping occupancy.
If route options are successfully determined at block 108, and if geographic application cannot fully accommodate these
Route options, then can generate appropriate warning.For example, geographic application can indicate that offline route may include pass cost.
