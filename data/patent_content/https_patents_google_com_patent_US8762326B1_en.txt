- topic retriever 500 may query topic database 410 , to retrieve a list of current popular topics.
- the popular topics may be ranked by a generic, non-personalized, score based, for example, on popularity, spike, and/or geographic region.
- User profile retriever 510 may retrieve a user profile for a user associated with a request from client 210 from user profile database 430 .
- the user profile may be identified, for example, based on a name of the user, a user login name, a specific identification string, an IP address, a browser cookie, etc. associated with the user request, or based on a suitably anonymyzed version of any of the foregoing, such as a hash value of a user name.
- user profiles may be obtained for both users with user accounts (e.g., associated with a provider of search engine 225 ) and/or users without user accounts (e.g., users that are not personally identifiable).
- the user profile may be computed offline (e.g., prior to a query from the user) using user profiler 440 .
- at least part of the user profile can also be computed/updated in real time (e.g., during the processing time for responding to the user request).
- Topic profile generator 520 may generate a topic profile for each popular topic in the list of popular topics retrieved by topic retriever 500 .
- a topic profile may include categories, subcategories, and/or other component fields that may be associated with a particular topic and that may potentially correspond to component fields of a user profile.
- the topic profile may include a similar format to the user profile format to facilitate comparisons.
- a topic profile may include a bag of words, keywords, topic clusters, and/or categories.
- Topic profile generator 520 may profile the current popular topics in order to calculate a personalization score using the user profile.
- a topic profile for each popular topic may be computed, in response to the user's request, based on the subject matter of the popular topic itself and any available metadata about the popular topic, using a text categorization system.
- topic profile generator 520 may use an additional cache component so that previously computed topic profiles can be directly retrieved from a data cache, such as a memory, thereby reducing the processing time needed to respond to a user request.
- Boost factor calculator 530 may generate a personalization score for each popular topic in the list of popular topics retrieved by topic retriever 500 .
- the personalization score may be used as a boost factor to alter the generic score for each topic in the list of popular topics retrieved from topic database 410 .
- boost factor calculator 530 may use to generate the personalization score.
- boost factor calculator 530 may use a similarity detection technique to generate the personalization score.
- both the user profile and the topic profile can be represented as a vector whose components indicate the user's interest in particular categories of subject matter or the topic's relevance to those categories of subject matter.
- the user's profile can have 4 components representing the user's relative interest in learning about topics pertaining to politics, literature, science and sports.
- fewer, more, or different categories of subject matter can be used to define the user and topic profiles.
- a user's interest in a particular category of subject matter can be expressed on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 represents no interest and 1 represents the most interest.
- a user's profile can be represented by the User_Profile vector (1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0), while the topic profile for a particular topic can be represented by the Topic_Profile vector (0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2).
- the transformation function may be a deterministic mathematical function to be applied to the similarity score, so that the output can be scaled to a range meaningful for re-ranking the generic popular topics list.
- the similarity function be the set intersection function (e.g., intersect(User_Profile, Topic_Profile)), and let the transformation function be ln(similarity score+1).
- boost factor calculator 530 may identify a word overlap between trending queries and a user's search history to determine a boost factor.
- boost factor calculator 530 may also account for negative interests of a user (e.g., as included in user profile database 430 ), such that a boost factor could include negative values.
- boost factor calculator 530 may use a different technique, or a combination of techniques, to identify a personalization score for each topic in the list of popular topics retrieved by topic retriever 500 .
- Boost factor calculator 530 may determine a boost factor for each popular topic in response to a user request (e.g., during processing time for responding to the user request). Alternatively, boost factor calculator 530 may determine boost factors offline for each popular topic and one or more user profiles in advance of a request.
- Ranking modifier 540 may assign a new ranking score, based on the boost factor, to each topic from the generic popular topic list and re-rank the topics to provide a personalized popular topic list. For example, each time boost factor calculator 530 calculates a boost factor for a topic, ranking modifier 540 may generate a personalized ranking score by combining the generic ranking score and the boost factor for the topic. In one implementation, once ranking modifier 540 has finished computing personalized ranking scores for all topics from the list of popular topics, ranking modifier 540 may sort all of the topics according to the personalized ranking scores to provide a personalized list of popular topics for the user. In another implementation, ranking modifier 540 may fluidly adjust the rank of each topic as each of the new ranking scores is calculated.
- Personal list generator 550 may identify particular topics to present to a user based on the personalized list of popular topics for the user. In one implementation, personal list generator 550 may choose a particular number (e.g., 5 or 10) of the highest ranked topics to present to the user. Alternatively, or additionally, personal list generator 550 may select topics having a new personalized ranking score (e.g., determined by ranking modifier 540 ) that achieves a minimum threshold score. For example, personal list generator 550 may be limited to a list of ten topics for the personalized list of popular topics, but may select fewer than ten topics if there are not ten topics with new personalized ranking scores that achieved a minimum threshold score. The minimum threshold score can be tailored to a particular user and stored as user profile data.
- topic ranker 450 may include fewer functional components, different functional components, additional functional components, or differently functional arranged components than depicted in FIG. 5 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of topic ranker 450 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of topic ranker 450 .

- the personalization score may be used as a boost factor to alter the generic score for each topic (or set of topics) in the list of popular topics retrieved from topic database 410 .
- Boost factor calculator 530 may use various techniques to calculate the boost factor, including, for example, a similarity detection technique.
- Process 600 may include assigning a new ranking score to the topic based on the generic ranking score and the one or more boost factors (block 660 ) and determining if more topics are available to be scored (block 670 ). If more topics are available to be scored (block 670 —YES), process 600 may return to block 640 to identify a profile for the next topic from the popular topic list. If no more topics are available to be scored (block 670 —NO), the list of popular topics may be ordered according to the new ranking scores (block 680 ). For example, as described above in connection with FIG. 5 , ranking modifier 540 may assign a new ranking score, based on the boost factor, to each topic from the generic popular topic list and re-rank the topics to provide a personalized popular topic list.
- ranking modifier 540 may associate the boost factor with the corresponding generic ranking score for that topic. Ranking modifier 540 may then calculate a personalized ranking score from the generic ranking score and the one or more boost factors for the topic. In one implementation, once ranking modifier 540 has finished computing new (e.g., personalized) ranking scores for all topics from the list of popular topics, ranking modifier 540 may sort all of the topics according to the adjusted ranking scores to provide a personalized list of popular topics for the user.

Abstract
Description
boost_factor=1+transformation(similarity(User_Profile,Topic_Profile)),
where the similarity function can be any vector similarity function, such as the cosine similarity function, Jaccard similarity function, or simply the intersection size of two vectors (e.g., the number of intersecting elements or non-zero components the two vectors have in common), which output a non-negative score. The transformation function may be a deterministic mathematical function to be applied to the similarity score, so that the output can be scaled to a range meaningful for re-ranking the generic popular topics list. For illustration, let the similarity function be the set intersection function (e.g., intersect(User_Profile, Topic_Profile)), and let the transformation function be ln(similarity score+1). The boost factor for the aforementioned example would be 1+ln(2+1)=1+1.10=2.10.
