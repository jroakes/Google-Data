Fig. 4 represents the logical flow chart 400 by the antenna beam forming step of carrying out according to the emission communication equipment (for example the base station 101) of the embodiment of the invention.This flow process begins 401 when each emission information of a plurality of received communication equipment (being subscriber unit 105-107) is given emission communication equipment (being base station 101), the base station receives 402 information about the propagation channel between this subscriber unit and each antenna oscillator 121,122 from each subscriber unit, and will carry out auto-correlation with the ambient interferences of coming sub-district (promptly from sub-district 112 and 113) outside 101 Serving cells of free serving BS from the ambient interferences of AWGN.Alternatively, when each sub-district comprises a plurality of sector, ambient interferences can comprise from the sub-district 111 except the interference of the sector of subscriber unit sector of living in.
Subscriber unit 105-107 is by with the known version relevant propagation channel measured subscriber unit and oscillator between of array oscillator 121,122 received signals with this signal.For example, base station 101 can be by pilot code of this oscillator emission, Yu Ding pilot walsh code for example, or distribute to this oscillator and the known pilot frequency code element sequence of subscriber unit.When subscriber unit receives institute when transmitting, subscriber unit is relevant with known pilot sign indicating number or code element with received signal.According to relatively, subscriber unit is determined the distortion that caused by channel in this signal.
How many auto-correlations of measuring ambient interferences can be more difficult.In one embodiment of the invention, the signal that receives from base station 101 (all channels) by demodulation of subscriber unit 105-107 and from arriving signal, deduct demodulation after signal measure the auto-correlation of ambient interferences.The signal that produces includes only ambient interferences, and the auto-correlation of this signal is by can easily obtaining this signal is relevant with self.In another embodiment of the present invention, subscriber unit can by base station 101 periodically its short time interval that transmits of blanking measure auto-correlation.Transmit pent this of short duration during, received signal only comprises ambient interferences.Still by with the relevant interference auto-correlation of measuring of signal with self.
In another embodiment of the present invention, subscriber unit 105-107 can measure the auto-correlation of ambient interferences by the correlation (by this signal is relevant with self) of measuring the received signal of launching base station 101.This correlation be signal correlation function and interference correlation function and.The subscriber unit send channel diffuses information and the received signal relevance function is given base station 101.Base station 101 is according to the propagation channel and (for example pilot signal) both understandings that transmit are calculated the signal correlation of observing in the user place that transmits.Deduct from the relevance function of received signal by the correlation that transmits that will calculate then and obtain interference correlation.
Utilization is to the understanding of the interference environment at the propagation channel between each of each and a plurality of subscriber unit 105-107 of a plurality of array oscillators 121,122 and each subscriber unit place, signal to noise ratio (snr) on each subscriber unit is determined for any power division and base station weight coefficient collection in base station 101 (the preferably processor 206 of base station), as below will be in greater detail.Combined optimization 404 weight coefficients are come by selecting weight coefficient in base station 101, and this weight coefficient produces the maximum of combined optimization SNR expression formula, as in greater detail following.When base station 101 transmitted subscriber unit to this base station services, processor 206 passed to suitable weight coefficient the weighter 322,324 of 405 base stations 101 subsequently.Each weighter 322,324 uses the weight coefficient that passes to weighter by processor 206 to modulate the signals of 406 emissions on respective antenna array oscillator 121,122 then, and this signal finishes 408 by corresponding array oscillator emission 407 and flow chart then.
Preferably, the load (that is number of users in the sub-district) of its respective cell 111 or subscriber unit 105 residing sectors are alternatively known in base station 101.For example, the data-rate requirements of supposing each subscriber unit 105-107 is known, as digital coding and decoding scheme.Utilize these information, the SNR demand of each subscriber unit 105-107 is known.In the case, base station 101 at first determines whether to exist the feasible program for the combined optimization of optimal antenna array 120 weight coefficients.In other words, base station 101 determines whether that at first any power and weight assignment will satisfy all users' SNR demand.When having a feasible program, the scheme of base station gross power minimum can be selected to make in base station 101.The interference power minimum that this makes neighbor cell 112,113 to a certain extent or alternatively produces in the adjacent sectors.When not having feasible program for specified load, the power and the weight assignment of base station satisfiable load percentage maximum can be selected to make in base station 101.
In another embodiment of the present invention, " independent optimization " embodiment can use to be similar to allow various users are optimized weight coefficient independently.Substitute combined optimization 404 weight coefficients, the approximation of combined optimization SNR expression formula is determined in base station 101 uses approximate 409.Should approximately allow base station 101 to be independent of the weight coefficient that other subscriber unit 410 is optimized corresponding to each subscriber unit according to the approximation of combined optimization SNR expression formula.This approximation method has the advantage (although the computation burden that is positioned on each subscriber unit 105-107 may increase a little) that reduces base station 101 computation burden.This approximation method also has an advantage, and promptly the weight coefficient independent optimization of being utilized by base station 101 needs link bandwidth still less to come transmission channel and interfere information to give the base station usually.If at subscriber unit calculating optimum weight coefficient, only weight coefficient need be transferred to the base station.

Utilize above-mentioned hypothesis, the signal to noise ratio of TxAA is provided by following formula

In a word, the maximum weight coefficient optimization of actual SNR expression formula (formula 1) of the forward link (base station to subscriber unit) of the serving BS (being base station 101) that comprises a plurality of element antenna arrays by determining to make base station and subscriber unit is applied to the base station is served the weight coefficient of the emission of each subscriber unit 105-107.This expression formula is represented to depend on I by the observed interference of each subscriber unit 105-107

Because its complexity, the combined optimization of weight coefficient may limit application., can define the principle of optimality that allows independent optimization of user rather than combined optimization.For example, the weight coefficient of more approaching the best can be by calculating in the average interference covariance matrix substitution SNR expression formula.Because the average interference covariance matrix does not depend on user's emission ratio, each user can be independent of other user and be optimized.Because this method is considered self-interference, it obtains the weighting than more approaching the best of current method of transmitting antenna array weighting.
