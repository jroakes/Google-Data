- trending system 220 may use the date and/or time to obtain the configuration parameters from a data structure, such as data structure 300 .
- trending system 220 may identify default configuration parameters. For example, when the request is not associated with information that allows for a set of configuration parameters to be identified, trending system 220 may identify a default set of configuration parameters. The default set of configuration parameters may identify one or more of the configuration parameters discussed above.
- Process 600 may further include obtaining trending information based on the configuration parameters (block 625 ).
- trending system 220 may use the configuration parameters to obtain trending information.
- the trending information may include items, such as search-related items, video-related items, image-related items, news-related items, and/or other types of items.
- Trending system 220 may use the configuration parameters to identify items. For example, when the configuration parameters include information identifying one or more categories of information, trending system 220 may obtain items in the identified one or more categories. When the configuration information includes one or more keywords, trending system 220 may use the one or more keywords to obtain items. For example, trending system 220 may compare the one or more keywords to entries in an index of trending information to identify items relating to the one or more keywords. When the configuration parameters include information identifying an amount of variance that is to be used in identifying items to provide via the trending user interface, trending system 220 may use the identified amount of variance to identify the items.

- the social score of an item may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the friend activity data, such as whether the social contacts have recommended the item to others.
- trending system 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a combination of the score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, trending system 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. In some implementations, trending system 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a weighted combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, trending system 220 may assign a weight value to the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score.
- the weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary.
- Trending system 220 may combine the weighted score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score.
- the total score, for an item, may reflect a measure of quality of the item.

Abstract
Description
- Many techniques are available to users today to find information on the World Wide Web (“web”). For example, users often use browsers and/or search engines to find information of interest. The information of interest may include documents that are currently popular among a group of users, such as videos that are currently popular from a video provisioning service.
- According to some possible implementations, a method includes providing, by one or more processors of a device and via a user interface, information identifying two or more of trending search-related information, trending video-related information, trending image-related information, or trending news-related information, where the trending search-related information includes information identifying searches that are currently popular through a search-related service, the trending video-related information includes information identifying videos that are currently popular through a video-related service, the trending image-related information includes information identifying images that are currently popular through an image-related service, and the trending news-related information includes information identifying news items that are currently popular through a news-related service. The two or more of the trending search-related information, the trending video-related information, the trending image-related information, or the trending news-related information are visually presented as graphical items that are visually distinguished on the user interface, where each graphical item, of the graphical items, is visually identified as relating to the trending search-related information, the trending video-related information, the trending image-related information, or the trending news-related information. The user interface presents multiple graphical items simultaneously. The method further includes detecting, by the one or more processors and over a time period, user interaction with one or more graphical items, of the multiple graphical items presented on the user interface, where the user interaction includes one or more of selection of a graphical item on the user interface, or removal of a graphical item from the user interface.

- Systems and/or methods, as described herein, may provide a user interface that presents different categories of trending information. The trending information may include, for example, trending search queries, trending images, trending videos, trending news documents, and/or other categories of information that may currently be popular among a group of users. The user interface may present the trending information as images that allow the user to quickly review and identify trending information of interest across all the different categories of trending information. Moreover, the user may interact with the user interface to alter the trending information that is provided. For example, the user may provide a topic and the trending information may be adjusted based on the topic. In addition, the user's interaction with the user interface, such as selecting or removing trending information, may cause the trending information that is presented via the user interface to change.
- Trending information is to be broadly interpreted as information that is currently popular among a group of users. For example, trending search-related information may include information identifying searches that are currently popular through a search-related service. Trending video-related information may include information identifying videos that are currently popular through a video-related service. Trending image-related information may include information identifying images that are currently popular through an image-related service. Trending news-related information may include information identifying news topics that are currently popular through a news-related service. A trending user interface may broadly be interpreted as a user interface that provides trending information.
- A document, as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news article, a blog, a discussion group forum, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript.
- In situations in which systems and/or methods, as described herein, collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), or to control whether and/or how to receive content that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before the data is stored and/or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected and used.
- While the following description focuses on providing different categories of trending information, systems and methods, as described herein, are not so limited. For example, in some implementations, systems and methods, as described herein, may provide different categories of information that relate to a particular topic, such as a search query, a document, etc.
-
FIGS. 1A-1C are diagrams illustrating anoverview 100 of an example implementation described herein. With reference toFIG. 1A , assume a user, of a user device, is interested in obtaining trending information. To obtain the trending information, assume that the user selects a TRENDING INFORMATION element on a search interface. In response, the user device may send a request, to a trending system, for the trending information. The trending system may obtain the trending information and provide the trending information, to the user device, for display to the user. The trending information may include different categories of information, such as trending search-related information, trending video-related information, trending image-related information, and/or trending news-related information. - With reference to
FIG. 1B , the user device may display the trending information in a trending user interface. In some implementations, the trending information may be displayed as a group of images, where each image is visually identified as relating to the trending search-related information, the trending video-related information, the trending image-related information, or the trending news-related information. In this way, the user may easily identify information of interest. When the user identifies an item of interest, the user may simply select the item to obtain additional information. For example and as shown inFIG. 1B , the user has selected a particular video item. Based on the selection, the user device may obtain the video and present the video to the user, as shown inFIG. 1C . Thus, the user device may present the trending information, to the user, in a visually appealing manner, which allows the user easily identify and obtain information of interest. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample environment 200 in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.Environment 200 may include a group ofuser devices 210, atrending system 220, multiple servers 230-1 through 230-N (where N>1) (referred to collectively as “servers 230” and, at times, individually, as “server 230”), and anetwork 240. -
User device 210 may include a device, or a collection of devices, that is capable of presenting trending information. Examples ofuser device 210 may include a smart phone, a personal digital assistant, a laptop, a tablet computer, a personal computer, and/or another type of device with the ability to present tending information. In some implementations,user device 210 may include a browser via which a trending user interface may be presented on a display associated withuser device 210. -
Trending system 220 may include a server device or a collection of server devices which may be co-located or remotely located.Trending system 220 may identify a number of different types of trending information, such as trending searches, trending videos, trending images, trending news documents, and/or other types of trending information.Trending system 220 may provide, to a trending user interface ofuser device 210, different types of trending information. In addition, trendingsystem 220 may provide one or more user interfaces, touser device 210, to allow a user, ofuser device 210, to configure the trending user interface. -
Server 230 may include a server device or a collection of server devices that may be co-located or remotely located. Any two or more ofservers 230 may be implemented within a single, common server device or a single, common collection of server devices.Servers 230 may store trending information. For example, one ofservers 230 may store search queries that have been provided to a search-related service and a quantity of times that the search queries have been provided. Another one ofservers 230 may store information identifying videos and a quantity of times that the videos have been accessed. Still another one ofservers 230 store information identifying images and a quantity of times the images have been accessed. Another one ofservers 230 may store information identifying news documents and a quantity of times the news documents have been accessed. -
Network 240 may include any type of network, such as, for example, a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”) or a cellular network, an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of these or other types of networks.User device 210, trendingsystem 220, andservers 230 may connect to network 240 via wired and/or wireless connections. In other words, any one ofuser device 210, trendingsystem 220, and/orservers 230 may connect to network 240 via a wired connection, a wireless connection, or a combination of a wired connection and a wireless connection. - Although
FIG. 2 shows example components ofenvironment 200, in some implementations,environment 200 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, or differently arranged components than those depicted inFIG. 2 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components ofenvironment 200 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components ofenvironment 200. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of anexample data structure 300 that may store configuration parameters that may be used to configure a trending user interface. In some implementations,data structure 300 may be associated withuser device 210. In some implementations,data structure 300 may be associated with another device, such astrending system 220. - As illustrated,
data structure 300 may maintain a group of entries in the following example fields: a time period (PD)field 310, acategory field 320, akeyword field 330, aspeed field 340, a number (NO.)field 350, asize field 360, avariance field 370, and alocation field 380. In some implementations,data structure 300 may be associated with a particular user. In some implementations,data structure 300 may be associated with a particular user device of a particular user. Thus, assuming that the user has a smartphone and a tablet computer,data structure 300 may store information relating to a first manner in which the trending user interface is to be presented on the user's smartphone and a second, different manner in which the trending user interface is to be presented on the user's tablet computer. -
Time period field 310 may store information identifying a time period for which a particular set of configuration parameters are to be used. The time period may include, for example, a date, a date range, one or more days of a week, a time range, and/or some other quantity of time. In some implementations, the time period may be user-specified. In some implementations, if no time period is provided intime period field 310, the same configuration parameters may be used in all situations. -
Category field 320 may store information identifying one or more categories of information. Example categories may include a search-related category, a video-related category, an image-related category, a news-related category, and/or other types of categories. The search-related category may specify that trending search-related items (e.g., currently popular search queries) are to be provided to the user interface. The video-related category may specify that trending video-related items (e.g., currently popular videos) are to be provided to the user interface. The image-related category may specify that trending image-related items (e.g., currently popular images) are to be provided to the user interface. The news-related category may specify that trending news-related items (e.g., currently popular news documents) are to be provided to the user interface. In some implementations, all available categories may be considered when no category is specified incategory field 320. In some implementations, the category or categories identified incategory field 320 may be user-specified. -
Keyword field 330 may store one or more keywords that may be used to identify items to be provided in a user interface. In those instances when one or more categories are identified incategory field 320, the keyword(s), identified inkeyword field 330, may be used to obtain items in the identified one or more categories. By way of example, assume thatcategory field 320 stores information identifying video-related information andkeyword field 330 stores the keyword “football.” In this example, trending videos relating to football may be provided to the user interface. In those situations where no category is identified incategory field 320, the keyword(s), identified inkeyword field 330, may be used to obtain items in all available categories. In some implementations, the keyword(s) may be user-specified. -
Speed field 340 may store information indicating a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface before being removed. In some implementations, the speed may be specified, for example, as slow, medium, or fast. In some implementations, the speed may be specified using a value, from a range of permissible values. Other ways of specifying a speed may alternatively be used. In some implementations, the speed, specified inspeed field 340, may, for example, correspond to a minimum speed, an average speed, or a maximum speed. In some implementations, the speed may be user-specified. -
Number field 350 may store information indicating the quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface. For example, a set of configuration parameters may specify that 15 items are to be simultaneously provided. In some implementations, the quantity of simultaneous items to be provided on the trending user interface may be user-specified. In some implementations, a default quantity of simultaneous items may be provided to the trending user interface when no quantity of simultaneous items is specified by the user. -
Size field 360 may store information indicating a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed on the trending user interface. In some implementations, the size may be specified, for example, as small, medium, or large. In some implementations, the size may be specified using a value, from a range of permissible values. Other ways of specifying a size may alternatively be used. In some implementations, the size, specified insize field 360, may, for example, correspond to a minimum size, an average size, or a maximum size. In some implementations, the size may be user-specified. -
Variance field 370 may store information indicating an amount of variance that is to be used to identify items to be provided on the trending user interface. For example, when a keyword is specified inkeyword field 330,variance field 370 may specify how closely items should relate to the specified keyword. When no keyword is specified inkeyword field 330,variance field 370 may specify, for example, how wide a variety of trending information is to be provided to the trending user interface. In some implementations, the variance may be specified, for example, as small, medium, or large. In some implementations, the variance may be specified using a value, from a range of permissible values. Other ways of specifying a variance may alternatively be used. In some implementations, the variance may be user-specified. -
Location field 380 may store information identifying a location, on a display ofuser device 210, at which the trending user interface is to be presented. Example locations may include a sidebar, a footer bar, a header bar, or another location. Other example locations may include presenting the trending user interface as a screensaver or a desktop wallpaper. In some implementations, the location may be specified on a per device or per application basis. For example,location field 380 may store first information, identifying a first location for the trending user interface, whenuser device 210 corresponds to a first type of device (e.g., a tablet computer) and second information, identifying a second, different location for the trending interface, whenuser device 210 corresponds to a second, different type of device (e.g., a personal computer or laptop). Similarly,location field 380 may store first information, identifying a first location for the trending user interface, whenuser device 210 is executing a first application and second information, identifying a second, different location for the trending interface, whenuser device 210 is executing a second, different application.Location field 380 may also store information indicating whether or not the trending user interface is to be persistently presented at the specified location. In some implementations, the location may be user-specified. - As one example of a set of configuration parameters for a trending user interface, as illustrated in
FIG. 3 , a user specified that during the weekends, items are to be captured from all of the available categories, the items are to move across the trending user interface at a medium speed, 15 items are to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, the items are to be graphically displayed in a small size, and that a large amount of variance is to be used in identifying the items. Moreover, the user has specified that the trending user interface is to be presented as a sidebar. As another example, the user has specified that during weekdays, between the hours of 5 AM and 9 AM, news-related items and search-related items are to be identified based on the keywords “stock,” “football,” and “basketball,” the identified items are to move across the trending user interface at a slow speed, 16 items are to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, the items are to be graphically displayed in a medium size, and that a medium amount of variance is to be used in identifying the items. As one additional example, the user has specified that during weekdays, between the hours of 7 PM and 12 AM, news-related items, search-related items, and video-related items are to be identified, the identified items are to move across the trending user interface at a slow speed, 10 items are to be simultaneously provided the trending user interface, the items are to be graphically displayed in a large size, and that a large amount of variance is to be used in identifying the items. - Although
FIG. 3 shows example fields ofdata structure 300, in some implementations,data structure 300 may include additional fields, different fields, or fewer fields than those depicted inFIG. 3 . For example,data structure 300 may also store information identifying a language in which the trending information is to be provided on the trending user interface. Moreover,data structure 300 may also store information identifying a position, on the trending user interface, at which higher quality items are to be placed. For example, the configuration parameter may specify that higher quality items are to be located in the middle of the trending user interface and lower quality items are to be located above and below the higher quality items. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for setting configuration parameters for a trending user interface. In some implementations,process 400 may be performed by trendingsystem 220. In some implementations, some or all of the blocks described below may be performed by a different device or group of devices, including or excludingtrending system 220. -
Process 400 may include receiving configuration parameters and information identifying the user (block 410). For example, trendingsystem 220 may receive one or more configuration parameters from a user. The configuration parameters may include parameters relating to identifying items that are to be provided on the trending user interface and/or a manner in which the items are to be provided (e.g., the speed at which the items are to move across the trending user interface, a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided, a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed, a variance with which the items are to be identified, a position, on the trending user interface, at which higher quality items are to be provided, and/or other parameters relating to the manner in which the items are to be provided). - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may provide a user interface to user device 210 (e.g., to a browser of user device 210) to allow the user to specify the one or more configuration parameters. In some implementations,user device 210 may download an application associated with obtaining trending information. In these implementations,user device 210 may provide the user interface via the application. In any event, the user may specify the one or more configuration parameters, via the user interface, and may cause the one or more configuration parameters to be sent to trendingsystem 220. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may receive one or more configuration parameters, fromuser device 210, based on the user interacting with the trending user interface. For example, trendingsystem 220 may receive one or more positive signals, fromuser device 210, based on the user selecting an item on the trending user interface, saving an item from trending user interface for later review, obtaining additional items relating to an item, or otherwise expressing an interest in an item. The positive signals may include information identifying the category with which the selected item is related, one or more keywords associated with the selected item, etc. Additionally, or alternatively, trendingsystem 220 may receive one or more negative signals, fromuser device 210, based on the user discarding an item from the trending user interface or otherwise expressing a disinterest in an item. The negative signals may include information identifying the category with which the discarded item is related, one or more keywords associated with the discarded item, etc. -
Trending system 220 may also receive information identifying the user and/oruser device 210. For example, trendingsystem 220 may provide a user interface touser device 210 to allow the user to specify the identification information. In some implementations, trendingsystem 220 may receive the identification information via a log in process. In those implementations whereuser device 210 downloads an application associated with obtaining trending information,user device 210 may transmit the identification information using the application. -
Process 400 may include associating the configuration parameters with the information identifying the user (block 420). For example, trendingsystem 220 may store the configuration parameters in a data structure, such asdata structure 300.Trending system 220 may associate the data structure (or that portion of the data structure that stores the configuration parameters) with the information identifying the user and/oruser device 210. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may determine whether a time period specified in the received set of configuration parameters conflicts (e.g., matches or overlaps) with an already stored time period associated with a different set of configuration parameters. If the new time period conflicts with an already stored time period, trendingsystem 220 may request that the user provide a priority to the two sets of configuration parameters. - While
FIG. 4 showsprocess 400 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations,process 400 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel. -
FIG. 5 is anexample user interface 500 that may be used in connection with the process described above with respect toFIG. 4 . With respect toFIG. 5 , assume that a user has requested to configure a set of configuration parameters for the trending user interface. In response to the request,user device 210 may provide auser interface 500 that allows the user to enter a set of configuration parameters. As illustrated inFIG. 5 ,user interface 500 may allow the user to specify any or all of the following example parameters: one or more time periods, one or more categories, one or more keywords, a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface, a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed on the trending user interface, a quantity of variance that is to be used in identifying items to provide via the trending user interface, and a location at which the trending user interface is to be provided. In example 500, the user has specified that during weekends, items are to be provided based on all the available categories. The user has further specified that the items are to move across the trending user interface at a medium speed and that the items are to be graphically displayed in a small size. Moreover, the user specified that a large amount of variance is to be used in identifying the items that are provided via the trending user interface. By selecting the STORE button onuser interface 500,user device 210 may cause the received set of configuration parameters to be transmitted to trendingsystem 220.Trending system 220 may receive the set of configuration parameters and store the set of configuration parameters in, for example, a data structure, such asdata structure 300. Additionally, or alternatively,user device 210 may store the set of configuration parameters in a local memory. - Although
FIG. 5 shows example fields ofuser interface 500, in some implementations,user interface 500 may include additional fields, different fields, fewer fields, or differently arranged fields than those depicted inFIG. 5 . -
FIGS. 6A and 6B are a flowchart of anexample process 600 for providing trending information. WhileFIG. 6 showsprocess 600 as including a particular sequence of blocks being performed byuser device 210 and trendingsystem 220, in some implementations, some of the blocks ofprocess 600 may be performed by a different device or group of devices, including or excludinguser device 210 and trendingsystem 220. -
Process 600 may include detecting a trigger (block 605,FIG. 6A ). For example,user device 210 may detect a trigger that signals a request for a trending user interface. In some implementations,user device 210 may generate the trigger based on a user action. For example,user device 210 may generate the trigger based on detecting a user's selection of an element that is displayed byuser device 210. The element may include, for example, a button, a link, a menu item, an icon, etc. In some implementations, the element may be located on a search interface, such as a search engine home page. In some implementations, the element may be located on a document that provides search results. In some implementations, the element may be associated with an application that provides trending information. In these implementations, the element may be located on a desktop ofuser device 210 or in a list of applications available touser device 210. The element may be located in other areas of a document, desktop, menu, etc. - In some implementations,
user device 210 or trendingsystem 220 may alter the appearance of the element, such as in those situations where an event occurred that causes a particular topic or topics to show a strong upward trend in popularity. As an example, if a particular tragedy occurs, topics relating to the tragedy may suddenly become particularly popular. In these implementations,user device 210 or trendingsystem 220 may alter the appearance of the element. For example,user device 210 or trendingsystem 220 may alter the color, size, or shape of the element or may cause the element to flash. Other ways of alerting the user of particular topic or topics showing a strong upward trend in popularity may alternatively be used. In any event,user device 210 may generate a trigger based on detecting selection of the element. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may generate the trigger based on receiving a particular command from the user. For example, the launching of the trending user interface may be associated with a particular audible and/or textual command. Whenuser device 210 receives the particular command,user device 210 may generate the trigger. In some implementations,user device 210 may generate the trigger based on detecting a particular gesture being made on a display ofuser device 210. The gesture may include a touch, swipe, and/or another motion on the display ofuser device 210. In some implementations, the gesture may include swiping a currently displayed document to the left. Whenuser device 210 detects the particular gesture,user device 210 may generate the trigger. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may generate the trigger without user interaction. For example, in a situation where the trending user interface is provided as a screensaver or as desktop wallpaper,user device 210 may generate the trigger without user interaction. Instead,user device 210 may generate the trigger based onuser device 210 being powered up,user device 210 entering a power savings mode, and/or in response to another event. -
Process 600 may further include sending a request for trending information (block 610). For example,user device 210 may send a request for trending information to trendingsystem 220. In some implementations, the request may include information identifying the user. In some implementations, the request may include one or more configuration parameters relating to items to be provided and/or relating to a manner in which the items are to be provided on the trending user interface. -
Process 600 may include receiving the request for trending information (block 615,FIG. 6B ). For example, trendingsystem 220 may receive the request for trending information fromuser device 210. -
Process 600 may include identifying configuration parameters (block 620). For example, trendingsystem 220 may identify configuration parameters that indicate the trending information to provide, touser device 210, and/or the manner in which the trending information is to be provided touser device 210. Example configuration parameters may include one or more categories of information (e.g., a search-related category, a video-related category, an image-related category, a news-related category, and/or other types of categories) that are to be provided touser device 210, one or more keywords that are to be used to obtain trending information, a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface, a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed on the trending user interface, a quantity of variance that is to be used in identifying items to provide via the trending user interface, and a location, on a display ofuser device 210, at which the trending user interface is to be provided. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may identify the configuration parameters based on information in the request. For example, trendingsystem 220 may parse the request to identify information identifying the user and may use the information identifying the user to identify configuration parameters that are associated with the user (e.g., from a data structure, such as data structure 300). In some implementations, the request may include one or more configuration parameters. For example, the request may include information identifying one or more categories of information (e.g., a search-related category, a video-related category, an image-related category, a news-related category, and/or other types of categories) that are to be provided touser device 210, one or more keywords that are to be used, by trendingsystem 220, to obtain trending information, information identifying a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface, information identifying a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, information identifying a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed on the trending user interface, information identifying a quantity of variance that is to be used in identifying items to provide via the trending user interface, and information identifying a location at which the trending user interface is to be provided. In these implementations, trendingsystem 220 may parse the request to identify the configuration parameters. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may obtain a date and/or time associated with the request. The date and/or time may correspond to a date/time that the request was sent or received.Trending system 220 may use the date and/or time to identify configuration parameters. For example, trendingsystem 220 may use the date and/or time to obtain the configuration parameters from a data structure, such asdata structure 300. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may identify default configuration parameters. For example, when the request is not associated with information that allows for a set of configuration parameters to be identified, trendingsystem 220 may identify a default set of configuration parameters. The default set of configuration parameters may identify one or more of the configuration parameters discussed above. -
Process 600 may further include obtaining trending information based on the configuration parameters (block 625). For example, trendingsystem 220 may use the configuration parameters to obtain trending information. In some implementations, the trending information may include items, such as search-related items, video-related items, image-related items, news-related items, and/or other types of items. -
Trending system 220 may use the configuration parameters to identify items. For example, when the configuration parameters include information identifying one or more categories of information,trending system 220 may obtain items in the identified one or more categories. When the configuration information includes one or more keywords, trendingsystem 220 may use the one or more keywords to obtain items. For example, trendingsystem 220 may compare the one or more keywords to entries in an index of trending information to identify items relating to the one or more keywords. When the configuration parameters include information identifying an amount of variance that is to be used in identifying items to provide via the trending user interface, trendingsystem 220 may use the identified amount of variance to identify the items. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may generate a score for each item based on the configuration parameters and use the scores to determine which items are to be provided touser device 210. In some implementations, trendingsystem 220 may modify the score, of an item, based on one or more factors. For example, trendingsystem 220 may modify the score, of an item, based on a popularity score of the item. In some implementations, the popularity score of an item may be generated based on user behavior data associated with the item, such as how many users expressed disinterest in the item by, for example, removing the item from a trending user interface and/or how many users expressed interest in the item by, for example, selecting the item when the item is provided on a trending user interface. In some implementations, the popularity score of an item may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user behavior data, such as an age of the item, a prior ranking or score of the item, or the like. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may modify the score, of an item, based on a personalization score of the item. In some implementations, the personalization score of an item may be generated based on user activity data, associated with a user of aparticular user device 210, with regard to the item, such as whether the user has expressed disinterest in the item by, for example, removing the item from the trending user interface and/or whether the user expressed interest in the item by, for example, selecting the item when the item was presented on the trending user interface. In some implementations, the personalization score of an item may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user activity data, such as whether the user has recommended the item to one of the user's social contacts. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may modify the score, of an item, based on a social score of the item. In some implementations, the social score of an item may be generated based on friend activity data, associated with social contacts of the user of aparticular user device 210, with regard to the item. The user's social contacts may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of friend activity data, associated with an item, include whether the user's social contacts have expressed disinterest in the item by, for example, removing the item from a trending user interface and/or whether the user's social contacts expressed interest in the item by, for example, selecting the item on a trending user interface that was presented to the social contacts'user devices 210. In some implementations, the social score of an item may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the friend activity data, such as whether the social contacts have recommended the item to others. - In some implementations, trending
system 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a combination of the score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, trendingsystem 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. In some implementations, trendingsystem 220 may generate a total score for an item based on a weighted combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, trendingsystem 220 may assign a weight value to the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. The weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary.Trending system 220 may combine the weighted score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score. The total score, for an item, may reflect a measure of quality of the item. -
Trending system 220 may select a set of items, to be provided touser device 210, based on their scores. For example, trendingsystem 220 may rank the items based on their scores and select the top scoring X items (X>1). In some implementations, the quantity of items, in the selected set of items, may based on the configuration parameters (e.g., based on a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface, a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, and/or a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed on the trending user interface). -
Process 600 may include providing trending information and configuration parameters (block 630). For example, trendingsystem 220 may provide the obtained trending information and configuration parameters touser device 210. In some implementations, the trending information may include a ranked list of items. Each item may, for example, be associated with information identifying the category with which the item is associated (e.g., search, video, image, news, etc.), information identifying the item, an image associated with the item, a date/time associated with the item, and/or other types of information. - The configuration parameters may include information relating to a manner in which the provided items are to be displayed by the trending user interface at
user device 210. For example, the configuration parameters may include information relating to a speed at which items are to move across the trending user interface, a quantity of items to be simultaneously provided on the trending user interface, a size at which the items are to be graphically displayed in the trending user interface, and/or a location at which the trending user interface is to be displayed. In some implementations, a different speed may be specified for different items in the set of items. For example, the speed may be specified based on the score of the item. In some implementations, the speed of a higher scoring item may be set to be slower than the speed of a lower scoring item. In some implementations, a different size may be specified for different items in the set of items. For example, the size may be specified based on the score of the item. In some implementations, the size of a higher scoring item may be set to be bigger than the size of a lower scoring item. In some implementations,user device 210 may store the configuration parameters. In these implementations, trendingsystem 220 may not provide the configuration parameters. -
Process 600 may include receiving the trending information and the configuration parameters (block 635,FIG. 6A ). For example,user device 210 may receive the trending information and the configuration parameters from trendingsystem 220. -
Process 600 may include providing a trending user interface using the trending information and based on the configuration parameters (block 640). For example, based on receiving the trending information,user device 210 may cause a trending user interface to be provided on a display ofuser device 210.User device 210 may cause the received items to be presented in a manner consistent with the configuration parameters. Further details regarding an example trending user interface is provided below with respect toFIG. 7A . -
Process 600 may include detecting user interaction with the trending user interface (block 645). For example,user device 210 may detect that the user has interacted with the trending user interface. In some implementations, the user interaction may include a negative user interaction relating to an item and/or a positive user interaction relating to an item. Negative user interaction may include the user physically removing an item from the trending user interface (e.g., by dragging the item to a particular location), the user allowing an item to move across the trending user interface and be removed without selecting the item (e.g., user inactivity with respect to the item), and/or other similar types of user activity. Positive user interaction may include the user physically moving an item to a particular location on the trending user interface, which indicates an interest in the item (e.g., by dragging the item to the particular location), the user saving an item for later consideration, the user requesting additional items relating to an item, the user selecting an item on the trending user interface, and/or other similar types of user activity. -
Process 600 may include providing information relating to the user interaction (block 650). For example,user device 210 may provide information relating to the user interaction to trendingsystem 220. In some implementations, the information may include information identifying the item and information relating to whether the user interaction is negative, e.g., indicating that the user is not interested in the item, or positive, e.g., indicating that the user is interested in the item. -
Process 600 may include receiving the information relating to the user interaction (block 655,FIG. 6B ). For example, trendingsystem 220 may receive the information relating to the user interaction fromuser device 210. In some implementations, trendingsystem 220 may store the information in a profile relating to the user ofuser device 210. -
Process 600 may include identifying new trending information (block 660). For example, trendingsystem 220 may parse the received information to identify the item to which the user interaction relates and whether the user interaction was negative or positive.Trending system 220 may identify new items to provide touser device 210 based on the identified item and whether the user interaction was negative or positive. For example, when the user interaction is negative,trending system 220 may identify new items, to provide touser device 210, that are unrelated to the identified item. When the user interaction is positive,trending system 220 may identify new items, to provide touser device 210, that are related to the identified item. -
Process 600 may include providing the new trending information (block 665). For example, trendingsystem 220 may provide the new trending information touser device 210. In some implementations, the new trending information may include a ranked list of new items. Each item may, for example, be associated with information identifying the category with which the item is associated (e.g., search, video, image, news, etc.), information identifying the item, an image associated with the item, and/or other types of information. -
Process 600 may include receiving the trending information and the configuration parameters (block 670,FIG. 6A ). For example,user device 210 may receive the new trending information from trendingsystem 220. -
Process 600 may include updating the trending user interface based on the new trending information (block 675). For example,user device 210 may cause new items to be presented on the trending user interface based on the new trending information.User device 210 may cause the new items to be presented in a manner consistent with the configuration parameters. - While
FIG. 6 showsprocess 600 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations,process 600 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel. -
FIG. 7A is an example configuration of a trendinguser interface 700. As shown, trendinguser interface 700 may include amain area 705, adock area 710, abranch area 715, asearch element 720, and adisplay element 725. -
Main area 705 may include an area, of trendinguser interface 700, where items, received from trendingsystem 220, may appear. In some implementations,user device 210 may cause the items, inmain area 705, to move, as if in a stream of water, from the left side of trendinguser interface 700 to the right side of trendinguser interface 700. Thus, additional items appear on the left side of trendinguser interface 700 and items are removed from the right side of trendinguser interface 700. In some implementations,user device 210 may present the items in a static manner inmain area 705. In either event,user device 210 may allow the user to move the items, displayed inmain area 705, in a left-to-right or right-to-left direction, which causes additional items to appear inmain area 705 and causes displayed items to be removed frommain area 705. In some implementations, moving the items in a right-to-left direction may cause items, which were previously removed frommain area 705, to reappear. Thus, in this way, the user may recapture items that have been removed frommain area 705. - In some implementations, as items are continually moved in a left-to-right direction, the additional items that are displayed, in
main area 705, may become more diverse and speculative. Thus, if the items, displayed inmain area 705, are directed to a particular topic, as items are continually moved in a left-to-right direction, the additional items that are displayed inmain area 705 may begin to diverge from the topic. - In some implementations, one or more items, displayed in
main area 705, may be configured to be automatically selected. For example, as an auto-selected item moves across trendinguser interface 700, additional information, relating to the item, may appear, as if the user had selected the item.User device 210 may determine which items are to be auto-selected based on a number of factors, including the user's past interaction with trendinguser interface 700. -
Dock area 710 may include an area, of trendinguser interface 700, where items may be placed which may be of interest to the user ofuser device 210. For example, a user, ofuser device 210, may move an item frommain area 705 to dockarea 710 in order to later review the item. To later review the item, the user may simply select the item, such as by touching or clicking on the item. In some implementations, when an item is placed indock area 710, the item may be available whenever the user accesses trendinguser interface 700 and regardless of the user device from which the user accesses trendinguser interface 700. To remove the item fromdock area 710, the user may simply drag the item back tomain area 705 or off the right or left side of trendinguser interface 700. -
Branch area 715 may include an area, of trendinguser interface 700, where items may be placed which may be of interest to the user ofuser device 210. In some implementations, when an item is placed inbranch area 715,user device 210 may cause items, relating to the placed item, to appear inbranch area 715. For example, a user, ofuser device 210, may move an item frommain area 705 tobranch area 715.User device 210 may detect that the item is placed inbranch area 715 and may send a request, to trendingsystem 220, for additional trending information related to the item. The request may include, for example, information identifying the item.Trending system 220 may obtain items relating to the identified item and may provide those identified items touser device 210. Other ways of identifying an item may alternatively be used. For example, a twisting gesture on a particular item, in main area, may cause items, relating to the twisted item, to appear inbranch area 715. As another example, each item, displayed inmain area 705, may include an element that, if selected, causes items, related to the item that includes the element, to be displayed. Thus, selection of an element on an item, inmain area 705, may cause items, relating to the item, to appear inbranch area 715. -
User device 210 may cause the related items to be displayed inbranch area 715 of trendinguser interface 700. In some implementations,user device 210 may present the received items in a dynamic manner. For example,user device 210 may cause the received items to move, as if in a stream of water, from the left side of trendinguser interface 700 to the right side of trendinguser interface 700. Thus, additional items appear on the left side of trendinguser interface 700 and items are removed from the right side of trendinguser interface 700. In some implementations,user device 210 may cause the received items to be displayed, inbranch area 715, in a static manner. In these implementations,user device 210 may allow the user to move the items, displayed inbranch area 715, in a left-to-right or a right-to-left direction, which causes additional items to appear inbranch area 715 and causes displayed items to be removed frombranch area 715. To remove the items frombranch area 715, the user may simply drag one of the received items back tomain area 705 or off the right or left side of trendinguser interface 700. To change the items inbranch area 715, the user may simply drag a different item, frommain area 705, tobranch area 715. - In some implementations, instead of related items being displayed in
branch area 715, the related items may be displayed inmain area 705. For example, in some implementations, an item that is identified for branching (e.g., by detecting that the item has been moved to a particular location of trendinguser interface 700, that an element on the item has been selected, that a twisting gesture has been made in relation to the item, etc.) may remain stationary inmain area 705, as the related items move in a left-to-right direction across trendinguser interface 700. If the user wishes to return to the previous items, the user may simply drag the stationary item to a particular location on or off trendinguser interface 700. Other ways of returning to the previous items may alternatively be used. -
Search element 720 may include a button or another type of selectable element that causesuser device 210 to provide an interface that allows the user to perform a search. In some implementations, when a search is performed using the interface,user device 210 may cause items, relating to the search, to be displayed inmain area 705. For example,user device 210 may receive one or more search terms in the interface and may send a request, to trendingsystem 220, for additional trending information. The request may include, for example, information identifying the one or more search terms.Trending system 220 may obtain items relating to the search terms and may provide those identified items touser device 210.User device 210 may cause the received items to be displayed inmain area 705. In some implementations, when a search is performed using the interface,user device 210 may perform a network search and provide a document that includes a ranked list of search results, relating to the search. -
Display element 725 may include a button or another type of selectable element that causesuser device 210 to change the manner in which items are provided inmain area 705. In some implementations,display element 725 may allow the user to choose between providing items, inmain area 705, in a static manner or a dynamic manner. The static manner may include, for example, providing the items in a non-moving, grid pattern. The dynamic manner may include, for example, providing the items in moving, grid or non-grid pattern. Other manners of providing items, inmain area 705, may alternatively be used. - Although
FIG. 7A shows an example configuration of trendinguser interface 700, in some implementations, trendinguser interface 700 may include additional areas/elements, different areas/elements, fewer areas/elements, or differently arranged areas/elements than those depicted inFIG. 7A . For example, in some implementations, trendinguser interface 700 may simply includemain area 705, and not includedock area 710 orbranch area 715. -
FIGS. 7B-7I are an example 730 of the process described above with respect toFIGS. 6A and 6B . With reference toFIG. 7B , assume that a user, ofuser device 210, has requested trending information. In response, assume thatuser device 210 has provided atrending user interface 700 with a configuration similar to that described above with respect toFIG. 7A . Moreover, assume that trendinguser interface 700 displays a number of items, inmain area 705, that move in a left to right direction. Further, assume that the user is interested in a particular video-related item, but wants to review the video-related item at a later time. Thus, as shown inFIG. 7B , the user may move the video-related item, frommain area 705, to dockarea 710. Once moved todock area 710, the video-related item may remain on trendinguser interface 700 until removed. Thus, the user may select the video-related item at a later time. - With reference to
FIG. 7C , assume that, at some later point in time, the user is interested in obtaining additional items relating to a particular search-related item. Thus, as shown inFIG. 7C , the user may move the search-related item, frommain area 705, tobranch area 715. Once moved tobranch area 715,user device 210 may cause additional items to be obtained, from trendingsystem 220, relating to the search-related item, as shown inFIG. 7D . Thus, in this way, the user may obtain additional items relating to a particular item of interest inmain area 705. - With continued reference to
FIG. 7D , assume that the user is interested in a particular video-related item inmain area 705. Thus, the user may select the video-related item. By selecting the video-related item,user device 210 may cause auser interface 735 to be provided that provides additional information relating to the particular video-related item, as shown inFIG. 7E . With reference toFIG. 7E ,user interface 735 may provide avideo 740 associated with the video-related item. In addition,user interface 735 may provideadditional items 745 that relate to the video. Assume, after watching all or a portion ofvideo 740, that the user is interested in the related search item. Thus, as shown inFIG. 7E , the user may select the related search item. By selecting the related search item,user device 210 may cause auser interface 750 to be provided that provides additional information relating to the related search item, as shown inFIG. 7F .User interface 750 may include, for example, an image section, a news section, a biography section, and a related search section. The image section may include a scrollable area that provides images relating to a topic of the related search item. The news section may include a scrollable area that provides links to news-related documents relating to the topic of the related search item. The biography section may include an area that provides biography information relating to the topic of the related search item. The related search section may include a scrollable area that provides search items relating to the topic of the related search item. Although not shown,user interface 750 may also include a search results section that provides a scrollable area that includes search results for the topic of the related search item. The user may select an item inuser interface 750 to obtain another user interface with information relating to the topic of the selected item. In this way, the user may causeuser device 210 to present multiple user interfaces that provide information relating to various topics of interest to the user. - If the user is interested in returning to
user interface 735, the user may either closeuser interface 750 or swipeuser interface 735 to the right to causeuser interface 735 to be fully displayed in trendinguser interface 700. If the user is interested in returning tomain area 705, of trendinguser interface 700, the user may close all of the overlaying user interfaces, touchmain area 705, or perform some other kind of act that signifies a desire to return tomain area 705. - With reference back to
FIG. 7B , assume that the user wishes to display the items, inmain area 705, in a static manner. To do so, the user may selectdisplay element 725. As shown inFIG. 7G ,user device 210 may, in response to the user's selection ofdisplay element 725, cause the items to be displayed inmain area 705 in a static manner. The user may browse items, in this configuration, by moving the items, displayed inmain area 705, in a left-to-right or a right-to-left direction. For example, the user may make a right-to-left swiping motion (or another type of gesture) to move items on the right side of trendinguser interface 700 to the left side of trendinguser interface 700. In some implementations, the user may simply tiltuser device 210 in the direction that the user wishes the items to be moved. For example, if the user tiltsuser device 210 to the left,user device 210 may cause items on the right side of trendinguser interface 700 to move toward the left side of trendinguser interface 700. As another example, if the user tiltsuser device 210 to the right,user device 210 may cause items on the left side of trendinguser interface 700 to move toward the right side of trendinguser interface 700. In some implementations, the degree of tilt may directly correspond to the speed at which the items move across trendinguser interface 700. - As indicated above, in some implementations, the items, displayed in
main area 705, may be associated with date/time information. For example, each item may be associated with the date and/or time at which the item was trending. In some implementations, trendinguser interface 700 may act as a graphical timeline, where the user may cause trendinguser interface 700 to provide items that were trending at an earlier point in time. As an example and with reference toFIG. 7H , assume that trendinguser interface 700 displays a number of items inmain area 705. Moreover, assume that trendinguser interface 700displays time information 755 relating to when the displayed items were trending. To view what items were trending at an earlier point in time, the user may scrollmain area 705 in a left-to-right direction. Assume that the user scrollsmain area 705, of trendinguser interface 700, to an earlier time, as shown inFIG. 7I . In response, trendinguser interface 700 may displaytime information 755 identifying the earlier point in time and display items that were trending at the earlier point in time. In this way, trendinguser interface 700 may provide the user with the ability to see how other users' understanding and interest in a particular topic evolved in news documents, videos, search queries, images, etc. -
FIGS. 7J-7L are examples of locations at which trendinguser interface 700 may be provided onuser device 210. As shown inFIG. 7J , trendinguser interface 700 may be provided as asidebar 760 onuser device 210. As shown inFIG. 7K , trendinguser interface 700 may be provided as afooter bar 765 onuser device 210. As shown inFIG. 7L , trendinguser interface 700 may be provided as ascreensaver 770 onuser device 210. In some implementations, trendinguser interface 700 may be provided in a different manner or location onuser device 210. For example, trendinguser interface 700 may be provided in a browser window ofuser device 210, as desktop wallpaper ofuser device 210, or as a part of a download application. -
FIG. 7M is an example configuration of anitem 775 that may be provided on the trending user interface. In essence,item 775 may include enough information to allow a user, of the trending user interface, to identify the topic and category to whichitem 775 relates. As shown,item 775 may include an image section 780, acategory designation section 785, and atitle section 790. Image section 780 may include an image relating toitem 775. For example, whenitem 775 is a search-related item, image section 780 may include an image relating to a term or terms to which the search-related item relates. Whenitem 775 is a video-related item, image section 780 may include an image captured from the video that is provided when the video-related item is selected. Whenitem 775 is an image-related item, image section 780 may include the image that is provided when the image-related item is selected. Whenitem 775 is a news-related item, image section 780 may include an image obtained from a news document associated with the news-related item. -
Category designation section 785 may include information that identifies the category to whichitem 775 relates. In some implementations and as shown inFIG. 7M , the category information may be provided in a graphical form. In some implementations, the category information may be provided textually or in some other manner. -
Title section 790 may include a title foritem 775. In some implementations, the title may be provided textually. In some implementations, the title may be provided in another manner. In some implementations, the location of the title may be different, depending on the category to whichitem 775 relates. For example, whenitem 775 is a news-related item,title section 790 may overlay image section 780, and whenitem 775 is an image-related item,title section 790 may be located below image section 780. - Although
FIG. 7M shows an example configuration ofitem 775, in some implementations,item 775 may include additional sections, different sections, fewer sections, or differently arranged sections than those depicted inFIG. 7M . -
FIGS. 8A-8I are another example 800 of the process described above with respect toFIGS. 6A and 6B . With reference toFIG. 8A , assume a user, named John Smith, is interested in obtaining trending information. The user may select an element, called “Trends,” from a user interface to obtain the trending information. Upon selection of the element,user device 210 may send a request for trending information to trendingsystem 220.Trending system 220 may identify trending items that are to be provided touser device 210, for example, based on configuration parameters associated with user, John Smith, and may provide information relating to the trending items touser device 210. - Assume that
user device 210 receives the information, from trendingsystem 220, and provides a trending user interface based on the information, as shown inFIG. 8B . As shown, the trending user interface may display a group of items, of various categories, in a static manner. To browse through the items, the user may move the group of items in a right-to-left direction or a left-to-right direction. In either event, items will be removed from the trending user interface and additional items will be provided on the trending user interface. Assume, as shown inFIG. 8B , that the user wishes to view additional items and makes a right-to-left swiping motion across the trending user interface. As a result,user device 210 may cause items on the right side of the trending user interface to move toward the left side of trending user interface and may cause additional items to appear on the right side of the trending user interface, as shown inFIG. 8C . - With continued reference to
FIG. 8C , assume the user has identified an item of interest. For example, assume that the user has found the search-related item, titled “tony lucca,” to be of interest. Thus, the user may select the search-related item to obtain additional information relating to “tony lucca.” - As shown in
FIG. 8D ,user device 210 may, in response to selection of the search-related item, cause a pop-up window to appear. The pop-up window may display search-related information relating to the topic of the selected search-related item, “tony lucca.” As shown, the pop-up window may include an image section that provides a scrollable list of images identified as relevant to the topic, “tony lucca,” a search results section that provides search results relating to “tony lucca,” a biography section that provides biographical information relating to “tony lucca,” and a related search section that provides a scrollable list of search-related items for people that are determined to be relevant to “tony lucca.” - For example 800, assume that the user scrolls through the images, in the image section of the pop-up window, to identify an image of interest. Thus, the user may make a swiping or other kind of motion on an image in the image section of the pop-up window. Thus, as shown in
FIG. 8E , one or more different images may be displayed in the image section of the pop-up window. - Assume further that the user did not find an image of interest in the image section, so instead, decides to scroll through the items in the related search section. Thus, the user may make a swiping or other kind of motion on an item in the related search section of the pop-up window. Thus, as shown in
FIG. 8F , one or more different items may be displayed in the related search section of the pop-up window. - Assume, with continued reference to
FIG. 8F , that the user is interested in obtaining additional information relating to an item in the related search section. Thus, the user may select the item by, for example, touching the item, clicking on the item, etc.User device 210 may, based on detecting that the item has been selected, move the existing pop-window to the left and present a new pop-up window, relating to the topic of the item, as shown inFIG. 8G . The new pop-up window may be configured in a manner similar to the configuration of the existing pop-up window. For example, the new pop-up window may include an image section that provides a scrollable list of images identified as relevant to the new topic, which is shown as “Jc Chasez,” a search results section that provides search results relating to the new topic, a biography section that provides biographical information relating to the new topic, and/or a related search section that provides a scrollable list of search-related items for people that are determined to be relevant to the new topic. - Assume, with reference to
FIG. 8G , that the user is interested in one of the search results in the search results section of the new pop-up window. Thus, the user may select the search result by, for example, touching the search result, clicking on the search result, etc.User device 210 may, based on detecting that the search result has been selected, obtain a document relating to the search result. For example,user device 210 may retrieve a document that corresponds to the selected search result and cause that document to be presented to the user, as shown inFIG. 8H . If the user wishes to return to the trending user interface, the user may causeuser device 210 to close the existing document being presented or may provide a particular gesture on the trending user interface. In example 800, the particular gesture may be a swiping motion from left to right on the presented document. Other types of gestures may alternatively be used. Thus, ifuser device 210 detects the particular gesture,user device 210 may close the presented document, causing the trending user interface to be presented again, as shown inFIG. 8I . -
