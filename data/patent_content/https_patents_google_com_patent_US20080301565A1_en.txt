Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of bookmarking and lassoing in a geo-spatial environment
- Computer bookmarks are used to catalog and access web pages, documents, music, video, and/or other digital media with ease. Bookmarks may be represented as pointers to the media that are catalogued. For example, a website may be bookmarked using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website and/or a name for the website; the name may be taken from contents of a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) tag within the website, such as a title tag, or the name may be provided by a user bookmarking the website. Bookmarking utilities are often provided by web browsers for users to access sites without having to remember the URLs or rely on other computer programs. The bookmarks may also be saved on a web server for access from multiple locations.
- In addition to personal bookmarks (e.g., stored by a web browser), the bookmarks may be shared among multiple users. Social bookmarking refers to a web-based service for storing, classifying, sharing, and/or searching Internet links. The bookmarks may be accessible to public and/or to a specific network based on a privacy level for each bookmark. The bookmarks may also be associated with one or more tags and/or categories to classify and/or group the bookmarks. Consequently, users with similar interests may view the bookmarks by the category, by searching for one or more tags associated with the bookmarks, or by random.
- Social bookmarking services have also extended the categorization of bookmarks by implementing algorithms to draw inferences from keywords and/or tags that are assigned to bookmarks by examining clustering of particular keywords and relation of the keywords to one another. In addition, the social bookmarking services have enabled user rating, commenting, import and export of bookmarks, addition of notes and/or email links, automatic notification, feed subscription, web annotation, and/or creation of groups and community networks around the bookmarks.
- Internet and social bookmarking may be currently limited to sharing of web links. In addition, bookmarks are normally found, tagged, and/or grouped independently of one another. As a result, creating categories and/or groups around bookmarks may be slow, tedious, and/or limited to certain Internet resources such as URLs.
- A method, apparatus and system of bookmarking and lassoing in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed. In one aspect, a method of bookmarking a plurality of entries (e.g., may be selected from a group consisting of persons, businesses, organizations, and/or landmarks) includes receiving a lasso drawn on a geo-spatial map by a user, obtaining a region on the geo-spatial map based on the lasso, obtaining the plurality of entries from within the region, creating a plurality of bookmarks corresponding to the plurality of entries, associating the plurality of bookmarks with the user, and enabling access to the plurality of entries by the user using the plurality of bookmarks.
- The method may further include associating the plurality of entries with a group. The method may include providing additional information (e.g., may be selected from a group consisting of sale, event, neighbor, travel option, and/or lodging option) corresponding to the plurality of entries to the user. The method may include presenting a mass profile edit option associated with the plurality of entries to the user. The method may include presenting a profile analytic associated with the plurality of entries to the user.
- In another aspect, a community network includes a geo-spatial repository containing a plurality of locations on a geo-spatial map, and a group management module configured to receive a lasso drawn on the geo-spatial map by a user, obtain a region (e.g., may include a plurality of entries) on the geo-spatial map based on the lasso, create a group corresponding to the plurality of entries (e.g., may be selected from group consisting of person, business, organization, and landmark), and associate the plurality of entries with the group.
- The community network may further include a bookmark management module configured to create a plurality of bookmarks corresponding to the plurality of entries, associate the plurality of bookmarks with the user, and enable access to the plurality of entries by the user using the plurality of bookmarks.
- The community network may include a member repository containing a plurality of members (e.g., may include the user), and a member management module configured to obtain member data (e.g., may include a location) associated with each of the plurality of members. The community network may include the bookmark management module further configured to provide additional information (e.g., may be selected from a group consisting of sale, event, neighbor, travel option, and/or lodging option) corresponding to the plurality of entries to the user.
- In yet another aspect, a method of creating a group in a community network includes receiving a lasso drawn on a geo-spatial map by a user, obtaining a region on the geo-spatial map based on the lasso, obtaining a plurality of entries (e.g., may be selected from a group consisting of person, business, organization, and landmark) from within the region, obtaining a group name from the user, creating a group under the group name, and associating the plurality of entries with the group.
- The method may further include creating a plurality of bookmarks corresponding to the plurality of entries, associating the plurality of bookmarks with the user, and enabling access to the plurality of entries by the user using the plurality of bookmarks. The method may include providing additional information (e.g., may be selected from a group consisting of sale, event, neighbor, travel option, and/or lodging option.) corresponding to the plurality of entries to the user. The method may include presenting a mass profile edit option associated with the plurality of entries to the user. In addition, the method may include presenting a profile analytic associated with the plurality of entries to the user.

- A method, apparatus and system of bookmarking and lassoing in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.
- In one embodiment, a method of bookmarking any number of entries includes receiving a lasso (e.g., the
lasso 204 ofFIG. 2A-B ) drawn on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A-B ) by a user (e.g., the user 210 ofFIG. 2A-B ), obtaining a region on the geo-spatial map 200 based on thelasso 204, obtaining the entries from within the region, creating any number of bookmarks (e.g., using thebookmark management module 110 ofFIG. 1 ) corresponding to the entries, associating the bookmarks with the user 210, and enabling access to the entries by the user 210 using the bookmarks. - In another embodiment, a community network (e.g., the
community network 106 ofFIG. 1 ) includes a geo-spatial repository (e.g., the geo-spatial repository 114 ofFIG. 1 ) containing a number of locations on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A-B ), and a group management module (e.g., thegroup management module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) configured to receive a lasso (e.g., thelasso 204 ofFIG. 2A-B ) drawn on the geo-spatial map 200 by a user 210, obtain a region (e.g., may include any number of entries) on the geo-spatial map 200 based on thelasso 204, create a group corresponding to the entries, and associate the number of entries with the group. - In yet another embodiment, a method of creating a group in a
community network 106 includes receiving a lasso (e.g., thelasso 204 ofFIG. 2A-B ) drawn on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A-B ) by a user 210, obtaining a region on the geo-spatial map 200 based on thelasso 204, obtaining any number of entries from within the region, obtaining a group name from the user 210, creating a group (e.g., using thegroup management module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) under the group name, and associating the entries with the group. -
FIG. 1 is a system view ofmembers 104A-N of acommunity 102 communicating with each other through acommunity network 106, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 1 illustrates thecommunity 102, themembers 104A-N, thecommunity network 106, amember management module 108, abookmark management module 110, agroup management module 112, a geo-spatial repository 114, and amember repository 116, according to one embodiment. - The
community 102 may refer to a group ofmembers 104A-N residing in a specific region. Themembers 104A-N may include persons, businesses, organizations and/or landmarks associated with specific geographic locations in thecommunity 102. In an alternate embodiment, themembers 104A-N may reside in multiple regions (e.g., multiple cities, states, countries, etc.). Themembers 104A-N may be connected through thecommunity network 106. Thecommunity network 106 may be a network formed by association of themembers 104A-N having user profiles in thecommunity 102. Themember management module 108 may obtain member data associated with themembers 104A-N. For example, the member data may include a name, an age, a profession, and/or an address data associated with themembers 104A-N of thecommunity 102. The member data may be displayed in profiles of themembers 104A-N. In addition, the profiles of themembers 104A-N may be editable by other members. - In one example embodiment, the
member management module 108 displays a profile analytic to a user scrolling over a profile. For example, the profile analytic may contain information of themembers 104A-N who edited a profile, who appended content to the profile, a level of completeness of the profile, a number of users (e.g., themembers 104A-N) that have viewed the profile, etc. In addition, the profile analytic may provide a set of statistics associated with the profile without displaying an actual profile to the user 210. - The
bookmark management module 110 may create bookmarks corresponding to entries obtained from a specified region in a lasso (e.g., thelasso 204 ofFIG. 2A-B ) drawn by the user 210. In addition, thebookmark management module 110 may enable the user 210 to access the entries using the bookmarks. For example, the user 210 may access the entries to view, update and/or modify the information associated with the entries obtained from the specified region. The bookmark may be a process to store the entries obtained from the specific region into a specific category (e.g., my places 304, my businesses 306, myneighbors 308, etc.) so that the user 210 can access the entries in the future. For example, the bookmark may be a pointer to an entry. The pointer may be represented as a memory address, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Internet Protocol (IP) address, etc. - The
bookmark management module 110 may also provide additional information associated with a sale, an event, a neighbor, a travel option, and/or a lodging option to the user 210. For example, the user 210 may click on a bookmark saved in thebookmark management module 110. Thebookmark management module 110 may display the bookmarked location to the user 210 on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A-B ). In addition, thebookmark management module 110 may provide additional information related to the bookmarked location, such as neighbors residing near the bookmarked location, sales near the bookmarked location, events occurring in the vicinity of the bookmarked location, driving directions to the bookmarked location, airfare options to the bookmarked location, lodging options near the bookmarked location, etc. - The
group management module 112 may obtain a region on a geo-spatial map 200 corresponding to thelasso 204 drawn on the geo-spatial map 200 by the user 210. Thegroup management module 112 may further create groups having similar interests (e.g., pet lovers group, friends group, neighbors group, etc.) around the bookmarks corresponding to the entries. For example, the entries having interest in music may be stored in a music group created by the user 210 in groups buddy list. In another example, a high school or college group may be created by drawing alasso 204 around neighborhoods encompassing the high school or college. The geo-spatial repository 114 may be a database containing location information associated with themembers 104A-N of thecommunity 102 on the geo-spatial map 200. Themember repository 116 may be a database containing the member data associated with themembers 104A-N. In one example embodiment, groups may be created with any number ofmembers 104A-N in themember repository 116. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 1 , themembers 104A-N of thecommunity 102 communicate with each other through thecommunity network 106. Themembers 104A-N may communicate with each other using a variety of methods, such as mail, email, text messaging, instant messaging, telephone, etc. Thecommunity network 106 includes themember management module 108, thebookmark management module 110, thegroup management module 112, the geo-spatial repository 114, and themember repository 116, according to one embodiment. - A
lasso 204 drawn (e.g., using theselection tools 206 ofFIG. 2A-B ) on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A-B ) by a user (e.g., the user 210 ofFIG. 2A-B ) may be received. In one example embodiment, thelasso 204 may be generated by obtaining a polygon drawn by the user 210. The polygon may be specified by clicking on points in the geo-spatial map 200. For example, other shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, etc. may also be drawn using theselection tools 206. - A region may be obtained on the geo-
spatial map 200 based on the lasso 204 (i.e., the shape drawn by the user 210). A number of entries (e.g., person, business, organization and/or landmark) from within the region may be obtained (e.g., using themember management module 108 ofFIG. 1 ). For example, entries with locations corresponding to the selected region may be retrieved from one or more repositories. A number of bookmarks corresponding to the entries may be created (e.g., using thebookmark management module 110 ofFIG. 1 ) and/or may be associated with the user 210. The user 210 may be enabled to access the entries using the bookmarks. - The entries may be associated (e.g., using the
group management module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) with a group (e.g., class of 2006group option 310, carlovers group option 312, and/or classical music group option 314 ofFIG. 3 ). Additional information (e.g., sale, event, neighbor, travel option, and/or lodging option) corresponding to the entries may be provided to the user 210. A mass profile edit option associated with the entries may be presented to the user 210. The profile analytic associated with the entries may be presented to the user 210. - The geo-
spatial repository 114 may include any number of locations on the geo-spatial map 200. For example, the geo-spatial repository 114 may include locations within a certain region, such as a city, state, country, continent, etc. Thegroup management module 112 may be configured to receive thelasso 204 drawn on the geo-spatial map 200 by the user 210. In addition, thegroup management module 112 may obtain the region (e.g., the region may include any number of entries) on the geo-spatial map 200 based on thelasso 204. In addition, thegroup management module 112 may create the group corresponding to the entries (e.g., person, business, organization, and/or landmark) and/or may associate the entries with the group. - The
bookmark management module 110 may be configured to create the bookmarks corresponding to the entries. In addition, thebookmark management module 110 may associate the bookmarks with the user 210. In addition, thebookmark management module 110 may enable the user 210 to access the entries using the bookmarks. - The
member repository 116 may include any number ofmembers 104A-N (e.g.,members 104A-N may include the user 210). Themember management module 108 may be configured to obtain member data (e.g., may include a location) associated with each of themembers 104A-N. For example, themember management module 108 may send a list ofmembers 104A-N in themember repository 116 corresponding to a region received by thegroup management module 112. In addition, themember management module 108 may cross-reference members in themember repository 116 with locations in the geo-spatial repository 114 to determine themembers 104A-N that correspond to the region. Thebookmark management module 110 may further be configured to provide additional information (e.g., sale, event, travel option, and/or lodging option) corresponding to the entries to the user 210. -
FIG. 2A is a user interface view of creating bookmarks corresponding to the entries, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 2A illustrates a geo-spatial map 200, a bookmark utility 202, alasso 204, andselection tools 206, according to one embodiment. - The geo-
spatial map 200 may graphically display thelasso 204 drawn by the user 210 corresponding to the region in a geo-spatial environment. The bookmark utility 202 may create the bookmarks corresponding to the entries in the region and associate the bookmarks with the user 210. Theselection tools 206 may enable the user 210 to draw thelasso 204 corresponding to the region on the geo-spatial map 200. - The user 210 may select, update and/or modify the entries, and add content to the entries using the
selection tools 206. Thelasso 204 may be a loop drawn around target location(s) using theselection tools 206. In addition, groups may be created by the user 210 making use of the entries that belong to similar categories in the region corresponding to thelasso 204. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 2A , the geo-spatial map 200 displays a particular neighborhood in the geo-spatial environment which highlights the markers associated with the locations corresponding to the entries. In addition, the user 210 may create, append and/or delete content associated with the profiles in the lasso group. The user interface view also displays a group name “Apple, Cupertino, Calif., United States” corresponding to thelasso 204. -
