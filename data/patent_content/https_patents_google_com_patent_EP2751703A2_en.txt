ORGANIZING AND TRACKING BELONGINGS USING
SOCIAL GRAPH INFORMATION
BACKGROUND
[00011 The subject disclosure generally relates to organizing and tracking items, and, in particular, to organizing and tracking items owned or associated with users.
[0002J Social networking users typically share their activities related to purchasing of items with their contacts on social networking sites through posts and feeds. To do so, users may create a post in text form and may share the post with their contacts.
[0003| However, these item-related posts are typically mixed in with all other posts, and the user may not have control over the posts once they have been released. Since the posts are in text form, it is difficult to sort the shared information. Typically, users are not able to easily see what they have shared with other users about their products, have no control over who can see their posts once the posts have been released, and cannot modify the posts after they have been created and shared. Thus, a convenient way for viewing and managing product related posts may be desirable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0032] The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology.
However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
[0033] As used herein, "belongings" refer to items owned by a user or items a user has indicated that the user is looking to own, borrow or learn more about. A user's belongings may include items purchased online (e.g., through an internet based retailer), offline (e.g., at regular retail stores), or received as gifts. In accordance with the subject disclosure, a method and a system are provided for building a social graph of belongings of one or more users. In one instance, each user of the system may add one or more belongings, and the system may associate each of the belongings with the user. Thus, in one example of the subject disclosure, a social graph of belongings may include associations between a user and their belongings. In one example, the social graph of belongings may further include associations between users (e.g., by leveraging existing social graphs at one or more remote social networking sites). An exemplary social graph of belongings is described in further detail below with respect to FIG. 12.
[0034] In one example, the system may allow users of the system to share activities related to their belonging with their contacts. As used herein, "posts" generally refer to any displayable notification or announcement regarding activities performed with respect to a belonging, including for example comments, replies, announcements, status updates, digital photos, videos
or other appropriate electronic information. Activities related to belongings may include adding a belonging, adding reviews regarding a belonging, adding a description regarding the belonging, modifying one or more attributes of a belonging, sharing the belonging, or indicating a state for the belonging.
[0035] Users of remote social networking sites may create associations with one another. These associations may be stored within a social graph at each remote social networking site (e.g., maintained at remote server(s) 120). Such user associations may be defined on a user-to- user basis, or as a group of users associated through membership within a group. As used herein, "contacts'" refer to a user's friends, social circles, groups and other users that the user is associated with, at one or more remote social networking sites.
[0036J As used herein, "social circles" are categories to which a user can assign their social networking contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking messages. In accordance with the subject disclosure, a social circle is provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with one another. As used herein, a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people. In some examples, a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle may be familiar with one another, and pemiission may be required for a member to join a social circle. In accordance with the subject disclosure, a user of an electronic device may define a social circle, and the social circle, as a data set defining a collection of contacts, may reflect a real-life social circle of the user.
10037] For example, a user of an electronic device may have different groups of friends, coworkers, and family, and there may be some overlap among those groups (e.g., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker). Through the creation and use of social circles, the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings.
[0038] The system may leverage existing social graphs maintained at one or more remote social networking sites to facilitate distribution of posts with contacts of a user. For example, one or more remote social networking sites may maintain a social graph of users and their
contacts. The system may access social graphs maintained at these remote social networking sites and retrieve contacts of the users of the system. In one instance, the user may indicate membership at one or more remote social networking sites and provide the system with access to these remote social networking sites, for example, through a token. The contacts retrieved by the system may depend upon the specific privacy settings enforced at each of the remote social networking sites.
[0039] The system may, upon accessing the remote social networking sites, retrieve information with respect to one or more users of the system and their associated contacts. Using the retrieved contacts, the system can then allow users of the system to share posts related to their belongings with their contacts. The post may then be distributed to the one or more remote social networking sites to be displayed to the user's contacts at the remote social networking site. The system may allow the user to choose specific contacts or groups of contacts at the one or more remote social networking sites with whom the post is shared. In one example, some or all of the remote social networking sites may provide support for selectively sharing posts with one or more contacts of the users.
[0040J The system may further provide for tracking the shared posts. In one example, prior to the post being distributed to the one or more remote social networking sites, each post may be assigned a unique identifier to facilitate tracking and control of the post once the post has been distributed either locally or to one or more remote social networking sites. The unique identifier may be associated with a belonging the post is related to and/or a user associated with the specific belonging. In one exemplary instance, the system tracks the post through the unique identifier. For example, the post may be linked with the unique identifier such that after distribution the post may be retrieved and modified using the link, even after the post has be distributed and displayed to contacts.
[0041 J Additionally, the system may allow users of the system to borrow or lend belongings to one or more other users of the system. For example, a first user may request to try out a belonging of a contact owning the belonging (e.g., to further help the user in making a decision regarding purchasing the item corresponding to the belonging). For example, a user may generate a request, post or comment, displayed to one or more contacts, to borrow an item
corresponding to a belonging owned by one or more contacts or specifically a belonging of a contact. The system may further allow users to keep track of items they have borrowed as well as items they have lent to other users of the system.
[0042J Once a belonging is lent to the user, the contact may modify the state of the belonging (e.g., by interacting with a graphical user interface of the system displaying a belonging profile), or reorganize the belonging within a specific belonging category, to indicate that the item has been lent, and may further indicate that the item has been lent to the user. The system may then modify the state of the belonging within the social graph of belongings and may further store the information regarding the user the item has been lent to. The system may further create a new association between the user and the belonging lent to the user within the social graph of belongings. The belonging may then be indicated as being borrowed in the user's belongings, and may further include information regarding the owner of the belonging (e.g., contact of the user). Thus, both the user and his/her contact may keep track of the belonging having been lent to the user. In response to the borrowing/lending of belonging the system may detect a belonging related activity and may generate a post to be distributed to one or more contacts of the user, and/or contact of the user owning the belonging.
[0043 j Furthermore, a user of the system may add a belonging to his/her profile and may indicate the belonging as an item the user wishes to purchase, own or borrow (hereinafter referred to as a "wish list belonging"). As used herein, a "wish list belonging" may refer to a belonging which a user may wish to own, purchase, borrow, and/or learn more about. For example, such belongings may be included within the social graph of belongings associated with the user. The wish list belongings may be assigned to a belonging category dedicated to belongings the user may not own but may wish to own, purchase, or borrow, and/or belongings the user may be generally interested in purchasing. For example, in one aspect, the user may add a belonging and may add the belonging to a category indicated for wish list belongings of the user. In another example, the user may assign a state to each belonging when the belonging is being added. The state of a belonging may be indicated as wish to purchase, wish to borrow, wish to own or wish to learn more about, in one aspect, contacts of the user may view the belongings indicated as a wish list belonging and may provide comments and feedback regarding the belonging, and may further offer to lend the belonging to the user. The user may further be
provided with a list of contacts owning a belonging corresponding to the wish list belonging, and may request to borrow the belonging (e.g., by creating and distributing a post).
[0044J In one aspect, when adding a belonging (e.g., a wish list belonging), the user may enter a name of a belonging or other indication of a belonging name or identification. The system may then determine a full name or identifier of the item associated with the belonging and may associate the belonging with the item corresponding to the belonging. Thus, each belonging within the social graph of belongings corresponds to an item, and therefore while each belonging is unique and customized to the user associated with the belonging, one or more belongings may correspond to the same or similar item. In this manner, the belongings of the user may be more accurately stored using actual product names. The user may alternatively be presented with specific queries regarding the entered product such as serial number information, product version, product name, product developer and other product specific information, to determine the actual item associated with the belonging being inputted by the user.
[0045J When a user wishes to borrow an item or try out the item (e.g., a wish list belonging or item the user wishes to purchase), the system may identify one or more belongings within the social graph of belongings corresponding to the same item and may present the belongings to the user. The system may further only present the belongings identified and owned by a contact of the user or shared with the user, such that the user may request to borrow the belonging. The system may then keep track of whether a contact of the user lends the belonging to the user and may keep track of the item being lent to the user.
[0046J FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment, which provides for managing belonging-related information using a social graph of belongings. A network environment 100 includes a number of electronic devices 102-106 communicably connected to a server 1 10 and remote servers 120 by a network 108. Network 108 can be a public
communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines).
Further, network 108 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, a tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
[0047 j In some example embodiments, electronic devices 102-106 can be computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, PDAs, portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices. In the example of FIG. 1, electronic device 102 is depicted as a smartphone, electronic device 104 is depicted as a desktop computer and electronic device 106 is depicted as a PDA.
[0048] In one embodiment, server 1 10 includes a processing device 1 12 and a data store 1 14. Processing device 1 12 executes computer instructions stored in data store 1 14, for example, to facilitate managing belonging-related information associated with users interacting with electronic devices 102-106. Server 1 10 may further be in communication with remote servers 120 either through the network 108 or through another network or communication means.
[0049| According to some aspects, remote servers 120 can be any system or device having a processor, a memory and communications capability for hosting various remote social networking sites. In one embodiment, remote servers 120 may be further capable of maintaining social graphs of users and their contacts. The remote social networking sites hosted on the remote server 120 may enable users to create a profile and associate themselves with other users at a remote social networking site. The remote servers 120 may further facilitate the generation and maintenance of a social graph including the user created associations. The social graphs may include, for example, a list of all users of the remote social networking site and their associations with other users of a remote social networking site.
[0050] In some example aspects, server 1 10 and/or one or more remote servers 120 can be a single computing device such as a computer server. In other embodiments, server 1 10 and/or one or more remote servers 120 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing). In some embodiments, server 1 10 and/or one or more remote servers 120 may be coupled with various remote databases or storage services. Communications between the client devices 102-106, server 1 10 and/or one or more remote servers 120 may be facilitated through the HTTP communication protocol.
Other communication protocols may also be facilitated including for example, XMPP
communication, for some or all communications between the client devices 102-106, server 1 10 and one or more remote servers 120.
[0051] Users 130-134 may interact with the system hosted by server 1 10, and/or one or more social networking sites hosted by remote servers 120, through a client application installed at the electronic devices 102-106. Alternatively, the user may interact with the system and the one or more remote social networking sites through a web based browser application at the electronic devices 102-106. Communication between client devices 102-106 and the system, and/or one or more remote social networking sites, may be facilitated through a network (e.g., network 108).
[0052] In one embodiment, users 130-134 may interact with the system maintaining a social graph of belongings, which is hosted at the server 1 10, to manage their belongings. Users 130- 134 operating electronic devices 102- 106 can manage their belongings, share their belonging- related activities with contacts and control track and modify their posts (e.g., using server 110). For example, users 130-132 may access the system and may create a user profile including a user belonging profile.
[0053] In one aspect, upon receiving a user request to interact with the system at a client device (e.g., electronic devices 102-106), the client device may initiate a communication with the system and send a data set including login information of the user. The data set can be transmitted from the user's client device (e.g., electronic devices 102-106) and received at server 1 10 hosting the system, for user authentication. Once the user is authenticated and access is granted to the user, the system may retrieve and send a data set to the user's client device, for displaying a graphical user interface at the client device operated by the user (e.g., electronic devices 102-106).
[0054] The system may further send a query to the user's client device (e.g., displayed within the graphical user interface displayed at the client device) for information regarding one or more social networking sites the user is associated with. Upon receiving a response from the user's client device (e.g., in response to a selection by the user operating the device) the system may initiate establishing communication with one or more remote social networking sites (e.g., through network 108 and remote servers 120). For example, the system may cause the client device to reroute the user to the social networking site. The user's client device may then communicate with the social networking site and send login information to the social networking site, for example by sending a data set including the login information. The social networking
site may authenticate the user using the received data set and may provide the user's client device with a token (e.g., a temporary token). The system hosted at server 1 10 may then retrieve the token from the user's client device, and may establish communication with one or more servers 120 hosting the remote social networking site using the token. For example, the communication may be facilitated using API calls. Similar steps may be performed for each of the one or more social networking sites associated with the user operating the client device.
[0055J Upon being granted access to each of the one or more social networking sites (e.g., through one or more remote servers 120), the system may then issue a request to each remote social networking site associated with the user to retrieve all contacts of the user. In one embodiment, for example, the system (e.g., through server 1 10) may issue an API call sent to the social networking site (e.g., sent from server 100 to one or more remote servers 120 through network 108). In one aspect, a remote social networking site hosted by one or more remote servers 120, may maintain a social graph comprising all contacts of each of its members, including the user. The social graph may be stored at the storage at the one or more remote servers 120 or may be stored remotely and the one or more remote servers 120 may access the remote storage and retrieve such information. The social networking site may access the social graph and may retrieve the contacts of the user. The social networking site may further retrieve infonnation associated with each contact or the association of the user with the contact, such as privacy preferences. The one or more remote servers 120 hosting the social networking site may provide the system (e.g., through server 1 10) with data sets including the contacts of the user, and may do so based upon contact information such as the privacy preferences. The server 1 10, upon receiving the contact information from one or more remote social networking sites, may store the data set including the contact information for each user (e.g., within the belonging profile of the belonging) at the server 1 10 (e.g., at storage 1 14). In one aspect, the contact infonnation maintained at the server 1 10 may be updated periodically, by issuing a request to the one or more remote social networking sites (e.g., through one or more remote servers 120) and receiving updated data sets including user contact information.
[0056] The system may then provide the user's client device with an updated graphical user interface including the retrieved contacts of the user. Users 130-132 may interact with the graphical user interface provided by the system and displayed at the user's client device to add
one or more belongings to their user belonging profile. Each user may further enter belonging attributes regarding their belongings, such as a belonging name, a belonging image, a description and review regarding the belonging. Additionally, purchase information regarding a belonging may further be entered by a user of the system for each of the user's belongings. For example, information such as purchase receipts, warranty information and other such information may be inputted by the user and may be maintained at the system. Still further, a user may assign a state for each of his/her belonging maintained within the social graph of belongings. A "belonging state" as used herein may refer to a status of the belonging. Belonging states may include, for example, the belonging being owned, borrowed, for sale, reviewed, given away, lent, or being a belonging the user wishes to buy, borrow or own. Each user may additionally organize their belongings into different belonging categories, and may further select contacts with whom activities regarding the newly added belonging may be shared. The entered information may then be sent from the user's client device, as a data set, to the system (e.g., through server 1 10) and may be stored at the server (e.g., at storage 1 14). The system (e.g., through server 1 10) may use the received information within the data set and may update the social graph of belongings maintained at the system (e.g., through server 1 10).
[0057] In addition to receiving belonging information, the system may further receive requests from the user's client device when the user wishes to share activities related to their belongings with contacts. Upon detecting a belonging-related activity performed by the user or upon a request from the user's client device to the system, the system may generate a post related to a belonging. Upon generating the post, the system may issue requests (e.g., API calls) to one or more remote social networking sites to display the post to selected contacts of the user at the one or more remote social networking sites. A data set including the post may be sent to the one or more social networking sites. The social networking site may then use the information included within the data set to display the post at the remote social networking site. Thus, the system may provide a platform where users can organize and share their belongings in a centralized and more effective way.
[0058J Posts generated with respect to belonging by users of the system may be stored within a database accessible by the system (e.g., at storage 1 14). A user of the system may interact with a graphical user interface displayed at the user's client device to request to access posts regarding
a belonging, and/or modify the posts regarding a belonging in response to an event (e.g., the belonging being sold, the belonging being lent, updated experience or views regarding the belonging, etc.). Upon receiving the request, the system may access the database storing the posts relating to belongings and may identify all posts associated with a specific belonging and/or all of the belongings of the user, and may generate a dataset of the posts. The dataset is then used to update the graphical user interface at the user's client device to display a listing of the posts such that the user may view and modify one or more of the posts.
[0059j The system may provide users with the ability to easily share information about their belongings, know and control what is shared and with whom, preserve valuable information about their belongings, organize all the information shared regarding their belongings, including reviews and comments in one place, share their wishes to borrow or buy an item with their contacts, seek recommendations from their contacts, sell, buy, give away, borrow and led their belongings, and search and browse belongings of their contacts.

The post entry box 714 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 7 may function similarly to the post entry box 508 illustrates in the graphical user interface of FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C.
[0101 J FIG. 8 illustrates a flow chart illustrating a process 800 for generating and maintaining a social graph of belongings. The process 800 begins in step 801 when the system detects a user request to add a new belonging, for example from user 130. In some aspects, the request may be detected when user 130 selects to add a belonging, for example by selecting the add button when viewing a graphical user interface of a belonging profile (e.g., add button 504 of the graphical user interface of FIGS. 5A, 5B, 5C and 6) or when viewing a graphical user interface of a user profile (e.g., add button 703 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 7). Alternatively, the system may detect the user request to add a new belonging when user 130 selects a suggested belonging within the graphical user interface provided to the user first logs into the system (e.g., the graphical user interface of FIG. 2).
|0102] Next, in step 802 the system displays a graphical user interface to user 130 for adding a new belonging. The graphical user interface may be similar to that displayed in FIGS. 3 A and 3B. As described above, user 130 may then enter attributes regarding the belonging, such as a name of the belonging, an image of the belonging, contacts to share activities related to belongings with, belonging categories associated with the belonging, a belonging sharing preference, belonging description, belonging review and ranking, belonging state and belonging purchase information. In some embodiments, the attributes may be similar to those illustrated in the graphical user interface of FIGS. 3 A and 3B.
[0103J In step 803, the system receives a belonging input from the user. For example, the user may select the save item button 308 of the graphical user interface of FIGS. 3A and 3B, and the information regarding the belonging may then be received by the system. Alternatively, user 130 may select the save item button 208 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 2 when selecting a suggested belonging. In one instance, where the user is selecting a suggested belonging, step 802 may be skipped and the user may simply select one of the suggested belongings and select to
save the item as a belonging, and the system may receive the belonging in step 803. In another embodiment, upon selecting a suggested belonging, a graphical user interface similar to that of FIGS. 3 A and 3B may be presented to the user and user 130 may enter information regarding the suggested belonging before requesting that the belonging be added.
[0104] Next, the process continues to step 804 in which the system generates a belonging profile based upon the information entered by user 130 and received in step 803. Next, in step 805, the system associates the belonging and/or the belonging profile with user 130. As described above, a social graph of belongings may be generated and maintained by the system. The social graph of the belongings, according to some aspects, includes associations between a user and belongings of that user for all users of the system. In step 805, the system may add the new belonging entry into the social graph of belongings as a belonging of the user 130, thus expanding the social graph of belongings through the new user-belonging association.
[0105| In some aspects, once user 130 and the belonging inputted in step 803 have been associated, the system may then generate and distribute posts related to the belonging with one or more contacts of user 130. In one embodiment, user 130 selects one or more contacts and/or groups of contacts, which the user wishes to share the user's belonging activities with. In some embodiments, adding the belonging is detected as a belonging-related activity and thus the system may initiate the process for generating and sharing a post related to the belonging with the contacts selected by the user.
[0106] FIG. 9 illustrates a flow chart illustrating a process 900 for generating a belonging- related post and sharing the post with contacts of a user. In step 901 , the process 900 begins when the system detects a belonging-related activity by a user, for example user 130. As described above, the belonging-related activity may include a new belonging being added. Other examples of belonging-related activity may include a user modifying a belonging, deleting a belonging, adding a new post regarding a belonging and adding a new comment regarding the belonging. The belonging-related activities listed herein may be performed through the one or more graphical user interfaces described above in FIGS. 2-7.
[0107] Upon detecting the belonging-related activity, in step 902 the system retrieves sharing preferences with respect to the belonging. The sharing preference of a belonging may be stored
within the belonging profile of the belonging generated in step 804 of process 800. As described above, a user (e.g., user 130), may set the sharing preferences by selecting a sharing preference from the sharing preferences menu 303 of FIGS. 3 A and 3B. Accordingly, user 130 may also modify the sharing preferences for a belonging already added and stored within the social graph of belongings, for example by selecting to modify the belonging, or by setting the sharing preference upon receiving a prompt, for example similar to the prompt window 401 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 4.
[0108 J In step 903, based on the retrieved sharing preferences, the system may determine whether the activity detected in step 901 is associated with a private belonging. As described above, when a user selects to not share any posts regarding a belonging with contacts, the belonging may be stored as a private belonging. Similarly, the post may also be private if no contacts are selected.
[0109] If in step 903, the system determines that the belonging is a private belonging, then the process ends in step 904. Otherwise, in step 905, the system generates a post regarding the belonging-related activity detected in step 901. Generating a post may comprise generating text regarding the activity and appending an image of the belonging to the text to generate a post. The text may be system generated and pre-stored text. For example, the system may store pre- generated text associated with each specific action, and upon detecting the action, may retrieve the pre-stored and pre-generated text associated with the specific action detected in step 901. In another embodiment, the text may include user-generated text, for example, text entered within a post entry box (e.g., post entry box 508 of the graphical user interface of FIGS. 5A-5C, or post entry box 712 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 7). The image may, in some examples, correspond to the main image selected by user 130 and stored within the belonging profile of the belonging associated with the detected belonging-related activity.
[01 10J Next, in step 906, the system associates the post with the belonging associated with the belonging-related activity detected in step 901 , and further with user 130 associated with the belonging. In one instance, each post may be assigned a unique identifier. The unique identifier may be associated with a belonging the post is related to and/or a user associated with the belonging. In one exemplary instance, the system may track the post through the unique
identifier. For example, the post may be linked with the unique identifier such that after distribution the post may be retrieved and modified using the link, even after the post has be distributed and displayed to contacts.
[0111 J In step 906, a link associated with user 130 and a link associated with the belonging may further be included within the post generated in step 905. In one instance, for example, the generated post may include the name of user 130 and the name of user 130 may include a link to user 130. In one embodiment, the link to user 130 may be selectable and upon selection may access and display the belonging profile of user 130 (e.g., the user belonging profile illustrated in the graphical user interface of FIG. 7). In another instance, a link to the belonging may be included within the post. For example, in one instance the link may be inserted within the text or image of the post. The link to the post may be selectable and upon selection may access and display the belonging profile of the belonging.
|0112| In step 907, the system may determine whether user 130 should be prompted before the post is shared. For example, the system may look at the sharing preference retrieved in step 902 to determine whether user 130 has selected the prompt to post option. If it is determined that user 130 should be prompted, the process 900 continues to step 908 and prompts user 130, for example by displaying a prompt window (e.g., prompt window 401 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 4). The user may in some instances view and modify the post, before authorizing that the post be shared with contacts. Next, in step 909, the system determines whether user 130 has authorized sharing the post with contacts selected by user 130. If it is detennined that user 130 has not authorized the post, then the system continues to step 904 and ends the process.
[0113] Otherwise, in step 910 the system determines contacts to share the post with. The contacts may be stored within the belonging profile. In one embodiment, the determined contacts may be associated with one or more remote social networking sites. In step 91 1 , the system distributes the post to the one or more remote social networking sites, and requests that the post be displayed to the selected users identified in step 910. Similarly, if in step 907 it is determined that that user 130 should not be prompted, the process 900 continues to step 910 and then to step 91 1 where the post is distributed to the one or more remote social networking sites,
requesting that the post be displayed to the determined contacts at the one or more remote social networking sites.
[0114] The one or more remote social networking sites may provide API functionality for receiving and posting posts. In such embodiments, the system generates an API call to each of the one or more remote social networking sites to display the post. In one instance, the post may be displayed along with other posts by user 130 within the one or more remote social networking sites and shared with the one or more determined contacts. The post may further be stored within a database maintained by the system. A date and time associated with the posts (e.g., the time the post was created, generated or stored) may be stored with the post for later retrieval and display within a belonging specific stream.
|0115] Upon being displayed at the remote social networking site, the selected contacts may then enter feedback or reviews regarding the post at the social networking site. The comments and feedbacks are associated with the post and may be retrieved and stored in the database of posts and comments along with the post. For example, each post may include a unique identifier, and posts and comments created by contacts in connection with the post may be associated with the unique identifier such that the comments and posts associated with the post may be retrieved from the remote social networking site and displayed to the user locally when interacting with the graphical user interface of the system.
[0116J After distribution, the post may be retrieved and modified using the unique identifier, the link to the user and/or the link to the belonging. For example, a user may modify information regarding the belonging, may delete the belonging or may perform other activity with respect to the belonging. In such instances, it may be beneficial to update the posts related to the belonging in view of the action performed by the user.
10117] FIG. 10 illustrates a flow chart of a process 1000 for tracking and modifying belonging-related posts. The posts may be already distributed and displayed to contacts locally and/or at one or more remote social networking sites. The process 1000 begins in step 1001 where the system detects a request to modify posts. In one embodiment, the request may be for retrieving all posts related to a user, while in other embodiments, the request may be for retrieving posts related to a belonging of the user. Such a request may be detected for example
when the user requests to retrieve and modify all posts, posts related to a belonging, or may be automatically detected when a modification is made with respect to a belonging, such as when the belonging is deleted, given away or sold, or when the user is no longer associated with the system (e.g., when the user deactivates his/her account).
[0118] In step 1002, the system retrieves posts related to the belonging. In one instance, all posts related to the belonging may be retrieved, while in other instances, only specific posts may be retrieved. In step 1002, the system may detect posts associated with the request and retrieve those posts. As described above, each post may be assigned a unique identifier and may further include a link to the user and the belonging. The system may use the unique identifier and/or the links embedded within the post to retrieve the post.
[0119] In step 1003, all retrieved posts may be displayed to the user. The user may then view the posts and modify one or more posts, including modifying the text of the post and/or the image included within the post. Alternatively, in step 1003, the system may automatically modify one or more of the retrieved posts. In one exemplary instance, step 1003 may not be performed where the posts are modified in response to a system detection and seamlessly without notification to the user. An exemplary graphical user interface displayed to the user for modifying a belonging related post is illustrated below with respect to FIGS. 1 1 A and 1 IB.
[0120] The modifications to the posts are detected in step 1004. The modifications may be user generated, system generated or may be a combination thereof. In step 1005, the system generates modified posts according to the detected modifications. In one embodiment, the modified posts are generated in a similar manner as describe above with respect to generating an original post associated with a belonging-related activity (e.g., process steps 905 and 906 of FIG. 9). In some instances, the modified posts each comprise a link to the user and a link to the belonging associated with the modified posts. The modified posts may each be associated with their respective unique identifier, or may alternatively be associated with a new unique identifier.
[0121] Next, in step 1006 of process 1000 the system distributes the modified posts to the one or more remote social networking sites to be displayed to selected contacts. In one embodiment, step 1006 is performed in a similar manner as steps 908 and 909 of FIG. 9 described above. Additionally, in some instances, steps similar to steps 903, 907 and 909 of
FIG. 9 may further be performed with respect to the modified posts generated during the process 1000.
[0122] FIG. 1 1A illustrates a screen shot of an exemplary graphical user interface for modifying a belonging-related post. In the exemplary graphical user interface of FIG. 1 1 A the user may modify the post from a belonging-related stream displaying one or more posts related to a specific belonging. The user may select an icon next to each post (e.g., icon 1 101 ) for editing the post. Upon selecting the icon, the post may be presented to the user in editable form and the user may edit the post. Similarly, a second icon (e.g., icon 1 102) may be provided to the user for deleting the post. In one example, a single icon may be provided in lieu of icons 1 101 and 1 102. Upon the user pressing the icon, the user may be presented with a drop down menu and may select to edit or delete the post using the drop down menu. Upon selecting the icon and performing an edit or deletion, the user may be presented with a confirmation message for confirming the edit or deletion of the post. FIG. 1 1 B illustrates a screen shot of an exemplary graphical user interface providing a confirmation message 1 103 to the user. Upon receiving confirmation from the user, the system detects the modification to the post.
[0123] FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary social graph of belongings. As illustrated, the social graph of belongings includes one or more users. Each of the one or more users is associated with one or more belongings. Furthermore, as illustrated, the social graph of belongings may further define associations between the user and other users within the social graph of belonging (i.e., his/her contacts). The exemplary social graph of belongings includes associations among users 1 -5 and further defines associations between each of the users 1-5 and one or more belongings.
[0124] More specifically, user 1 is associated with user 2, user 4 and user 5. Furthermore, User 1 is associated with belongings including "Camera A", "Tablet A", "Mobile Phone" and "Laptop C". User 2 is illustrated as being associated with user 1 , user 3 and user 5, and with belongings including "SKIS" and "MOBILE A". User 3 is illustrated as being associated with user 2 and user 4, and further with belongings including "CAR B", "BOOK C" and "JACKET S". User 4 is illustrated as associate with user 1 and user 3 and belongings including "TV A" and "My Kix". Finally, User 5 is illustrated as being associated with user 1 and user 2 and with belongings including "TABLET A" and "SUNGLASSES A".
(0125] Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
(0126J In this specification, the term "software" is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
[0127] A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
[0128] FIG. 13 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented. Electronic system 1300 can be a computer, phone, PDA, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer readable media. Electronic system 1300 includes a bus 1308, processing unit(s) 1312, a system memory 1304, a read-only memory (ROM) 1310, a permanent storage device 1302, an input device interface 1314, an output device interface 1306, and a network interface 1316.
[0129] Bus 1308 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of electronic system 1300. For instance, bus 1308 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 1312 with ROM 1310, system memory 1304, and permanent storage device 1302.
[0130] From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 1312 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject disclosure. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations.
[0131 J ROM 1310 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 1312 and other modules of the electronic system. Permanent storage device 1302, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when electronic system 1300 is off. Some implementations of the subject disclosure use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) as permanent storage device 1302.
[0132] Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as permanent storage device 1302. Like permanent storage device 1302, system memory 1304 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlike storage device 1302, system memory 1304 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such a random access memory. System memory 1304 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored in system memory 1304, permanent storage device 1302, and/or ROM 1310. For example, the various memory units include instructions for processing multimedia items in accordance with
some implementations. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 1312 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations.
[0133] Bus 1308 also connects to input and output device interfaces 1314 and 1306. Input device interface 1314 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used with input device interface 1314 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called "cursor control devices"). Output device interfaces 1306 enables, for example, the display of images generated by the electronic system 1300. Output devices used with output device interface 1306 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). Some implementations include devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices.
[0134] Finally, as shown in FIG. 13, bus 1308 also couples electronic system 1300 to a network (not shown) through a network interface 13 16. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system 1300 can be used in conjunction with the subject disclosure.
[0135J These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
[0136] Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer- readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable
compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
(0137] While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
[0138] As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms "computer", "server", "processor", and "memory" all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the tenns "computer readable medium" and "computer readable media" are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These tenns exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
[0139] To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback,
e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
[0140] Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. While several components or steps are described as being performed by the system, it should be understood that various components and steps may be performed by different systems in communication with one another, e.g., through a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide area network ("WAN"), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
[0141] The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
[0142] It is understood that any specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed is an illustration of exemplary approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged, or that all illustrated
steps be performed. Some of the steps may be performed simultaneously. For example, in certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
