Definitions
- This document relates to generating and providing vehicle information, such as vehicle route information or schedule information.
- route maps and vehicle schedules Users of mass transmit vehicles, such as trains, buses, or planes, often rely on route maps and vehicle schedules to properly identify a desirable vehicle, stop location, and time of departure from that stop location. If the route map or vehicle schedules are erroneous, out-of-date, or temporarily adjusted (e.g., due to extreme weather conditions, broken tracks, road construction, or the like), the passengers are often left waiting for excessive amounts of time at the stop location or, in some cases, may never find the appropriate vehicle for their purposes.
- a number of factors can affect the design of a system that generates vehicle information and provides access to route map information, vehicle schedule information, and the like.
- Information reliability is one such factor. If a vehicle information system is unreliable, passengers may dismiss any information provided by the system as being untrustworthy and may become frustrated with the overall mass transit system. For example, in some developing countries, train schedules are published for the benefit of train passengers, but the schedules are frequently erroneous—sometimes causing passengers to wait for hours after the published arrival time. Moreover, in some developing nations, the train schedules are not even published, thereby leaving passengers with past experience and word-of-mouth to determine the appropriate arrival and departure time of the trains.
- a monitoring device designed to periodically track and report the location of the train—that is registered to a particular train and is physically attached to the train's conductor car.
- the train-registered monitoring device can provide updated estimates of the particular train's location on a given day based upon a predetermined route map.
- train-registered monitors are generally complex and require a significant investment from the train companies.
- This document describes vehicle information systems and methods that may generate route map information, schedule information, estimated time of arrival information, or the like based upon location information received from passenger-carried wireless devices, such as passengers' cellular phones.
- a remote device e.g., a display device at a vehicle station, a network-connected personal computer, or a cellular phone of a person who plans to board a mass transit vehicle
- the information may be generated, for example, by analyzing locations of aggregated mobile devices, whether at one point in time or over a time period, such as mobile telephones, and making inferences when multiple devices are observed to be moving together.

- a method of generating route map information for a mass transit vehicle may include receiving location information associated with a plurality of wireless devices carried by passengers or cargo of a mass transit vehicle. The method may also include aggregating the location information over a period of time so that the location information represents a plurality of locations of the mass transit vehicle, and generating vehicle path data that substantially includes the plurality of locations.
- a system for providing transportation-related information may include an interface to receive location information associated with a plurality of wireless devices carried by passengers or cargo of a mass transit vehicle, and means for generating schedule information associated with the mass transit vehicle based at least in part on the location information of the plurality of wireless devices.
- the interface may transmit data relating to the schedule information to the remote device.
- a system for providing transportation-related information may include an interface to receive location information associated with a plurality of wireless devices carried by passengers or cargo of a mass transit vehicle.
- the system may also include a schedule generator in communication with the interface to determine schedule information related to a future location of the mass transit vehicle.

- the schedules, routes, or a combination thereof may be represented in a compact and derivable, integrable manner using, for example, Galerkin functions.
- various other services may query or otherwise employ the location, route and schedule data generated by the system.
- location-based services such as news, traffic, or weather alert services may query or otherwise employ the location, route and schedule data generated by the system.
- the system may be capable of receiving location information associated with a plurality of wireless devices situated on a moving vehicle and capable of generating more accurate and precise data (related to the vehicle's position, velocity, acceleration, or combination thereof) than the data any single wireless device may report of itself.
- the system may be configured to determine vehicle stop locations based on entry/exit of devices to/from the vehicle.
- the system may receive location information associated with a plurality of wireless devices that are entering or exiting a vehicle.
- the entry/exit locations may be deduced by time history of the location information associated with a wireless device and the deduced pose (position, velocity, and acceleration) history data of the vehicle.
- the system may be adapted to label vehicle stop locations and vehicle routes using statistically aggregated query data of wireless device users who may be aboard the vehicle or positioned at the stop locations.
- the location and time information corresponding to a particular mass transit vehicle may be obtained from a plurality of passenger-carried wireless devices that are not registered with that particular vehicle.

- the systems and methods described herein may be used to provide a number of service applications to passengers and potential passengers of one or more mass transit vehicles.
- the system may be used to provide trip planning services to potential passengers or situational awareness features and location-based services for those passengers aboard a particular mass transit vehicle.
- the route of a mass transit vehicle may be determined without relying upon outdated maps. Rather, the vehicle route may be more accurately determined using a set of global coordinates or the like, and thereafter the vehicle's route may overlay a preexisting map image. In such circumstances, the system may identify vehicle paths or stop locations that were previously hidden or unmapped.

- Such coordinate entries may be directly compatible with a route generator 130 (described in more detail below).
- each of these entries may be stored over a period of time, and the particular time of each geographic location measurement may be entered into the “time” category 128 c . Accordingly, each entry in the “device identifier” category 128 a may include a series of corresponding “location” and “time” entries as the location information of the wireless devices 150 is periodically received by the information provider 120 via the network 105 .
- the location information database 126 may include a “vector” category 128 d associated with each “device identifier” category 128 a .

- the velocity/direction data may be calculated by the location information engine 125 using, for example, the relative location/time differences in the associated “location” and “time” categories 128 b and 128 c .
- Such calculations by the location information engine 125 may be more accurate if the time between the geographic location measurements is reduced or if variable sampling or indexing techniques are employed (e.g., sample particular wireless devices more frequently as the non-linearity—variation from the predicted location, velocity, acceleration, or other functions—increases).
- the entries in the vector category 128 d and other categories may be used by a route generator 130 , a schedule generator 134 , the report generator 122 , or another subsystem to sort various groups of wireless devices 150 , to determine vehicle stop locations, or to determine other vehicle information (e.g., estimated time of arrival).

- the location information database 126 may include a category that stores the error bounds related to the location, time, or vector data.
- the entries in the location information database 126 may be continuously or periodically updated and refreshed to provide current location information for particular mass transit vehicles. For example, after the information provider 120 has identified and generated vehicle route data after aggregating location and time information or a period of time, the information provider 120 may continuously track the location information of a group of wireless devices 150 that are aboard a particular vehicle so as to determine the current location of that vehicle. As described in more detail below, the current location of the vehicle may be compared with the previously recorded route data and schedule data to determine estimated times of arrival, to determine which vehicles are currently operating ahead of schedule or behind schedule, or the like.
- the volume of data received by the information provider 120 may be so great that the data stored in the location, time, vector, and other categories 128 a - d may be stored only for a brief period of time.
- the data related to a particular wireless device 150 may be cached for a time sufficient to derive the actual geographic location of that wireless device 150 before it is discarded.

- the “route group” category 132 a may include a name identifies with a particular route, such as the “commuter blue line,” “train # 9 ,” “bus # 17 ,” “flight # 1611 ,” “New Delhi westbound train,” or the like.
- the “route group” category may include identifier numerals assigned by the information provider (e.g., group 835 - 912 ) to distinguish a set of data having, for example, a similar set of vector entries from vector category 128 d and a similar location entries from the location category 128 b.
- the route database 131 may also include an “estimated locations” category 132 b having a series of entries representative of the approximated geographic locations of the vehicles that are tracked using the location information of the wireless devices 150 .
- the geographic location entries may comprise, for example, GPS coordinates, global longitude and latitude coordinates, or other coordinates.
- the series of entries in the “estimated locations” category 132 b may represent a series of locations of a vehicle measured or inferred over a period of time. Thus, each entry in the “route group” category 132 a may be associated with a plurality of entries in the “estimated locations” category 132 b .
- the series of entries in the “estimated locations” category 132 b may be used by the report generator 122 to provide route map data or provide lists of geographic locations representative of a vehicle path.
- the route generator 130 may sort entries stored in the location information database 126 based upon a group of device identifiers in category 128 a sharing a similar set of vector entries from vector category 128 d and a similar set location entries from the from the location category 128 b .
- this selected group of device identifiers may be representative of wireless devices 150 traveling aboard a mass transit vehicle (e.g., train 165 , bus 175 , airplane, or the like).
- the route generator 130 may assign a route group entry into the “route group” category 132 a for this sorted data in the location information database 126 .
- the location information entries (category 128 b ) for the selected group of device identifiers in category 128 a may be used by the route generator 130 to assign a list of approximate locations in category 132 b .
- the approximate locations of the vehicle may be calculated using statistical techniques based upon the “location” entries in category 128 b .
- a subset of data in the location information database 126 may be used by the route generator 130 to create a route group and an associated list of approximate locations of a mass transit vehicle.
- the associated list of approximate locations of the mass transit vehicle can be incrementally updated as the entries in the location information database are updated or refreshed in the future.
- the route generator 130 may characterize a route as functions of a single variable, for example, variable s, where s goes from 0 to D and where D is the total distance of a route.
- each route may be characterized as functions x(s), y(s), and z(s) (e.g., representing the three-dimensional coordinates of the vehicle on the Earth's surface), as functions lat(s), long(s), elevation(s) (representing the latitude, longitude, and elevation of the vehicle), or the like.
- These function may be recorded in the “estimated locations” category 132 b or another category associated with the “route group” category 132 a .
- each route may be captured as a series of location points (as described above), as a series of one or more functions that capture the approximate paths of the vehicle, or a combination thereof.
- the route generator 130 may substantially compress the data necessary to characterize each route and may substantially speed up any query or search processes.
- One example of a process used to generate the one or more functions that characterize a route is to identify clusters of wireless devices that are traveling through the same space (e.g., x-y-z coordinates or latitude-longitude-elevation coordinates) for short periods of time (e.g., from 1 to 15 minutes or more). Then, route segments may be generated for each of these short time periods. After a series of route segments have been generated, the route segments may be combined into one route path characterized by one or more functions if the route segments are continuous (e.g., one end of a route segment matches the beginning of a second route segment). If more than two route segments meet at a single location, that location may be identified as a regular stop, a passenger station, or the like. As more location information is received by the information provider 120 , the route functions may be further refined by analysis to determine if a predominant number of wireless devices 150 travel from one of the route segments to the next.
- the route functions may be further refined by analysis to determine if a predominant number of wireless
- a schedule generator 134 may be used to generate vehicle schedule data of particular mass transit vehicles based upon the location information of the wireless devices 150 carried by passengers in those particular vehicles.
- the schedule generator 134 may include a database 135 that is continuously or periodically updated based upon the data received by the information provider 120 .
- the schedule generator database 135 may include “route group” category 136 a to distinguish a particular set of data points representative of a vehicle's geographic route.
- the entries in the “route group” category 136 a may be assigned based upon sorted groups of in the location information database 126 (as previously described in connection with the route generator database 131 ) or may be retrieved directly from the route generator database 131 (e.g., from category 132 a ).
- each entry in the “route group” category 136 a may be a series of entries in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b and the “estimated stop times” category 136 c .
- the series of entries in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b may be determined by analyzing when a group of wireless devices 150 aboard a vehicle remain at a similar location for an extended period of time. Such an analysis may be conducted by analyzing when a selected group of device identifiers in the location information database 126 share a similar string of “location” entries and “time” entries.
- the entries in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b may be selected from these sorted “location” entries in the location information database 126 .
- the regular stop locations of the vehicle may be calculated using statistical techniques based upon the “location” entries in category 128 b .
- the entries in the “estimated stop times” category 136 c may be selected from the corresponding “time” entries in the location information database 126 . Accordingly, a subset of data in the location information database 126 may be used by the schedule generator 134 to create a list of estimated stop locations of a mass transit vehicle and an associated list of stop times for a particular route group.
- the series of entries in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b and the “estimated stop times” category 136 c may be used by the report generator 122 to provide vehicle map data or provide lists of locations representative of the vehicle's regular stopping locations.
- the route generator may characterize a route as functions of a single variable, for example, variable s.
- each route may be characterized as functions x(s), y(s), and z(s) (e.g., representing the three-dimensional coordinates of the vehicle on the Earth's surface), as functions lat(s), long(s), elevation(s) (representing the latitude, longitude, and elevation of the vehicle), or the like.
- the distinction between the route and the schedule is imposition of time.
- a schedule may require a function t(s), which represents a function of time relative to the variable “s,” to be generated along with the route functions (e.g., x(s), y(s), and z(s)). These functions may be recorded in one of the categories associated with the “route group” category 136 a of the schedule generator 135 . Accordingly, the processes for generating route functions as previously described can be used to generate route and schedule data contemporaneously. It should be understood that a single route may have multiple such schedules (e.g., t 1 (s), t 2 (s), and so on).
- Functions suitable to characterize schedules may include selecting s points between which acceleration is piecewise linear, galerkin functions, second order polynomials (e.g., c 2 continuous functions), or the like.
- One example of a process to generate these schedule functions includes taking data captured from any time instant (e.g. a very short time interval) as examples of these schedules and attempting to merge these schedules with others based on similarity with other schedules offset by time constants. If the time constants are uniformly spaced daily or every “k” days or every “m” minutes, they may be classified as repeating schedules that repeat according to the pattern found.
- the process to determine these repeating schedules is using statistical techniques.
- the statistical techniques may include employing the least squares or SVD techniques, creating a standard deviation or some other density function from the mean, determining a confidence based on the number of distinct schedule examples.
- the statistical techniques may include using Savitsky Golay techniques.
- the series of entries in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b and the “estimated stop times” category 136 c may be used by the report generator 122 to provide data corresponding to the vehicle's estimated time of arrival at a particular stop location.
- a remote user of a wireless device 150 may use an SMS application to send a text message requesting the estimated time of arrival of a vehicle on a particular route at a particular stop location (e.g., text message sent to information provider may include “estimated arrival time of 4:30 Caltrain to Palo Alto”).
- This data request from the remote wireless device may also include the current time and the remote user's location information, which could be manually entered by the user or automatically embedded in the data request after a determination using any of the previously described GPS or triangulation techniques.
- the information provider 120 may receive this data request and parse the information into the appropriate text components.
- the information provider may identify the particular route that was queried by the remote user (i.e., “4:30 Caltrain to Palo Alto”) and compare the remote user's location information to the nearest stop location (e.g., an entry in the “regular stop locations” category 136 b ) for that identified route. Then, the information provider 120 may compare the most recent location and speed information for that particular vehicle (using information from the group of wireless devices that are currently aboard the identified vehicle route) to the historical or previously aggregated schedule data for the identified route to determine the estimated time of arrival. The data corresponding to the estimated time of arrival may be transmitted back to the SMS application or other application of the remote user's wireless device.
- the routes stored by the information provider 120 may be labeled by human intervention or by some other external application that is capable of identifying and labeling the routes.
- the routes may be labeled by workers assigned to label routes that stored by the information provider 120 , by users who access an interface to label particular routes, by collaborative filtering or data requests from users (e.g., text messages), or other such processes.
- the embodiments of the information provider 120 are not limited the illustrative embodiment depicted in FIG. 2 .
- the operations and the databases of the route generator 130 and the schedule generator 134 may be combined into a single subsystem.
- the route generator 130 and the schedule generator 134 may be subsystems of the report generator 122 .
- the report generator 122 may be equipped to provide route map data, schedule data, estimated time of arrival data, and other vehicle information, either collectively or separately, to a remote device (e.g., a personal computer, a display device 186 at a vehicle stopping station 185 , or a wireless device 150 of a remote user 180 as shown in FIG. 1 ) so that the user 180 can effectively plan an appropriate travel route and schedule, as described in more detail below.
- a remote device e.g., a personal computer, a display device 186 at a vehicle stopping station 185 , or a wireless device 150 of a remote user 180 as shown in FIG. 1
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing one exemplary method 200 for generating and providing vehicle information.
- the information provider 120 may generate route map data, schedule data, estimated times of arrival, or and other information related to one or more mass transit vehicles based upon location information received from a plurality of wireless devices 150 , such as a plurality of passengers' cellular phones aboard the mass transit vehicles.
- the exemplary method 200 depicted in FIG. 3 and other methods described herein may be implemented, for example, using one or more computer systems as described in more detail below, and may be stored as instructions on a recordable media so that the methods are performed when the instructions are executed (as described, for example, in more detail below).
- the information provider 120 may perform the operation 205 of receiving location information over a period of time associated with a plurality of wireless devices 150 .
- the location information may be received (directly or indirectly, as previously described) from a plurality of wireless devices 150 , such as cellular phones, that are carried by passengers or cargo aboard a mass transit vehicle (e.g., a train 165 , a bus 175 , or a plane).
- the location information may be sent, for example, via the antenna towers 152 , 154 , or 156 and the cellular service provider and then through the network 105 (e.g., the internet).
- the information provider 120 may receive the location information from the network 105 through its external interface 121 .
- the information provider 120 may perform the operation 210 of determining the movement vector for some or all devices in the plurality of the wireless devices 150 .
- the information providers 120 may include the location information engine 125 or other similar subsystem (e.g., route generator 130 , schedule generator 134 , or the like) that is capable of determining the movement vector of some or all of the wireless devices 150 for which it received location information.
- the movement vector may be representative of the approximate velocity and direction of the wireless device 150 at the particular time of each geographic location measurement.
- the information provider 120 may determine the movement vector for each device separately, or the information provider 120 may determine the movement vector for only some of the wireless devices 150 that are traveling together aboard a vehicle.
- some of the wireless devices 150 may be equipped with inertial sensors that may directly report the movement vectors of that particular device.
- the information provider 120 may filter the information received from wireless devices that do not meet selected criteria.
- the information provider 120 may include a subsystem (location information engine 125 , route generator 130 , schedule generator 134 , or the like) that uses statistical techniques to filter information received from wireless devices 150 that (1) are not geographically clustered near other wireless devices 150 (e.g., a person carrying a cellular phone who is walking alone on a sidewalk), or (2) are not traveling at a similar rate of speed and in a similar direction as other wireless devices 150 (e.g., a plurality of cellular phone users who are near a common street corner but are walking, biking, or driving in different directions or at different speeds).
- Such filtering may permit the information provider 120 to identify a group of wireless devices 150 having substantially similar movement vectors and geographical locations, as shown in operation 220 .
- the information provider 120 may include a subsystem that is capable of identifying wireless devices 150 having a similar set of movement vectors at similar geographic locations such that those wireless devices 150 may be identified, to a reasonable degree of certainty, as collectively riding aboard a mass transit vehicle (e.g., a train 165 , a bus 175 , or a plane). Locations and movement vectors may also be recorded over a period of time to help ensure that individuals are moving together. Also, each device may transmit location and vector information independent of other devices so that data collection is not truly simultaneous. As a result, interpolation or other adjustments may be applied to the location and vector information to set the relevant devices in a common time domain.
- a mass transit vehicle e.g., a train 165 , a bus 175 , or a plane.
- the method 200 may include a operation 222 are determines a confidence level for the group of wireless devices 150 that were previously identified. If the confidence level does not satisfy a particular threshold (e.g., there is a low confidence that all of the wireless devices in the identified group are actually traveling together aboard the same vehicle), another iteration of filtering may be employed. The subsequent iterations of filtering may use different criteria or statistical techniques in order to further refine the identified group of wireless devices 150 . In this embodiment, if the confidence level is determined to satisfy a particular threshold level, the method may proceed to subsequent operations.
- the information provider 120 may aggregate time and location information received from the group of wireless devices 150 (e.g., the group of wireless devices 150 carried by train passengers 160 as shown in FIG. 1 ). After the group of wireless devices 150 that are riding aboard a mass transit vehicle is identified, the location information of those particular wireless devices 150 may be tracked over a period of time. As previously described in connection with FIG. 2 , this location and time information may be used to generate vehicle route data or vehicle schedule data without the use of electronic components that are physically attached to the vehicle. It should be understood the group of wireless devices may be subject to minor changes over that period of time, for example, when a passenger departs the mass transit vehicle and another person boards that vehicle. In such circumstances, the information provider may redefine the group of wireless devices 150 aboard the mass transit vehicle based upon the location and movement vector information of the wireless devices 150 .
- the group of wireless devices 150 e.g., the group of wireless devices 150 carried by train passengers 160 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the location information of those particular wireless devices 150 may be tracked over a period of time.
- the information provider 120 may have the capability to generate vehicle route data, vehicle schedule data, or both.
- the operations for generating route data and for generating schedule data are shown as separate and independent from one another. It is contemplated that, in other implementations, the generation of route data and the generation of schedule data may be performed separately but dependent on one another or collectively and contemporaneously with one another.
- the information provider 120 may generate route map data representative of a plurality of location of the group of wireless devices 150 over a period of time.
- the information provider 120 may include a subsystem, such as the route generator 130 ( FIG. 2 ), that is capable of generating a list of location data for particular groups of wireless devices 150 that were previously determined to have substantially similar movement vectors and geographical locations.
- This location data for the group of wireless devices 150 may be used, for example, to create a route map of the mass transit vehicle on which the group of wireless devices were believed to be aboard.
- the information provider 120 may transmit the route map data to a remote device (e.g., a personal computer, a display device 186 at a vehicle stopping station 185 , or a wireless device 150 of a remote user 180 ).
- the route map data may be transmitted to the remote device as part of a regular, periodic transmission or as part of a response to a data request from a particular remote device.
- the information provider 120 may include a report generator 122 or another subsystem that is capable of receiving data requests and obtaining route map data from the route generator 130 .
- the report generator 122 may transmit one or more packets of information that includes the route map data so that a route map may be displayed on a remote device.
- the route map data and other such information may be stored in an index internal to the information provider 120 .
- the index may be updatable and search able, and in some circumstances, two or more parallel indexes that are optimized for various uses can be employed by the information provider 120 .
- the index may be used, for example, by various services (e.g., a location-based alert service or other services described in more detail below) that are configured to query the index for particular route map data and/or other information and configured to transmit such data to a remote device (e.g., a wireless phone having an SMS application).
- the service may be a report generator 122 in that it transmits the route data to a remote device.
- the information provider 120 may generate schedule data representative of a plurality of stop locations and corresponding approximate stop times of the group of wireless devices 150 over a period of time.
- the information provider 120 may include a subsystem, such as the schedule generator 134 ( FIG. 2 ), that is capable of generating a list of regular stop locations for particular groups of wireless devices 150 that were previously determined to have substantially similar movement vectors and geographical locations.
- This location data for the group of wireless devices 150 may be used, for example, to create a schedules or stop location maps for the mass transit vehicle on which the group of wireless devices were believed to be aboard.
- a route map has previously been identified, individuals aboard a vehicle on that route may be more readily identified than when the system has no knowledge of a transit system. Specifically rather than using statistical analysis to identify common travelers, the system may simply seek individual wireless devices having location and vector information that substantially matches those for an already-identified route map.
- the information provider 120 may transmit the route schedule data to a remote device (e.g., a personal computer, a display device 186 at a vehicle stopping station 185 , or a wireless device 150 of a remote user 180 ).
- the route schedule data may be transmitted to the remote device as part of a regular, periodic transmission or as part of a response to a data request from a particular remote device.

- the service may be a report generator 122 in that it transmits the schedule data to a remote device.
- the information provider 120 may be configured to receive text messages from a SMS application of a remote wireless device and to transmit the data in the form of a text message for viewability using the SMS application of the remote device.
- the information provider 120 may transmit the requested data in HTML format, XML format, or another format that can be displayed in a browser application of the remote device.
- the information provider 120 may be configured to provide various types of information related to a mass transit vehicle in addition to route map data and schedule data.
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to provide, in addition to route map data and schedule data, information associated with the future scheduled stops of the vehicle on that particular day (e.g., indicating whether the vehicle is early or late for subsequent stops).
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to provide the estimated duration of the vehicle at a particular stop location (e.g., the train will be boarding passengers from 3:12 PM to 3:16 PM). Such information may be helpful to a person who is accessing the vehicle information via his or her cellular phone while that person is trying to get to a particular stop location.
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to provide data associated with a particular vehicle's estimated time of arrival at a defined location.
- the information provider 120 may identify the particular route that was queried by the remote device and compare the remote device's location information to the nearest stop location for that identified route. Then, the information provider 120 may compare the most recent location and speed information for that particular vehicle (using information from the group of wireless devices that are currently aboard the identified vehicle route) to the historical or previously aggregated schedule data for the identified route to determine the estimated time of arrival. Such information may be helpful to a person who is planning to go to a particular stop location and desires to know how much time is available before the mass transit vehicle arrives.
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to provide an estimated time of passage at various points in the route map (e.g., crossing over the North River Bridge at 5:13 PM). This information may be determined by comparing the most recent location and speed information for that particular vehicle (using information from the group of wireless devices that are currently aboard the identified vehicle route) to the historical or previously aggregated route map data for the identified route.
- the information associated with the estimated time of arrival or the estimate time of passage at various points in the route may be intentionally skewed for security purposes.
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to add or subtract one minute or less from the estimated times so that the reported estimates are slightly skewed from the true estimates.
- the information provider 120 can provide potential passengers with sufficiently accurate data associated with the estimated times of arrival (or other estimated times) without providing exact timing information.
- the information provider 120 may be configured to intentionally skew the current location of the mass transit vehicle for security purposes.
- the report generator 122 or other subsystem of the information provider 120 may be configured to add or subtract several meters or miles from the vehicle's current location so that the reported locations are slightly skewed from the true locations. In those circumstances, the information provider 120 can provide potential passengers with sufficiently accurate data associated with the vehicle's location without providing exact timing information.
- FIGS. 4-6 show diagrams of one example of the route map generation techniques.
- FIG. 4 in a given geographical area 310 , there are a plurality of wireless devices 150 that are individually carried by different persons.
- FIG. 4 represents a diagram that visually illustrates some of the processes of the systems and methods described herein. The diagram itself is not necessarily displayed onscreen of any previously described device (in some embodiments, it may be displayed on a central or remote device), but rather represents some of the data that may be received or determined by the information provider 120 .
- the location information 350 for each of the wireless devices 150 may be received by the information provider 120 .
- the location 350 a of one wireless device 150 a may be determine to be substantially different from the location 350 b another wireless device 150 b .
- the movement vectors 351 of the wireless devices 150 may be determined such that the movement vector 351 a of one wireless device 150 a is substantially different from the movement vector 351 c of another wireless device 15 c.
- the information provider 120 may be adapted to filter information associated with some wireless devices 150 that do not meet certain criteria.
- a wireless device 150 b in the geographic area 310 may have a location 350 b that is somewhat distant from other wireless devices 150 .
- the information provider 120 may filter out the information from the wireless device 150 b for purposes of identifying a group of wireless devices 150 that are carried by passengers 160 riding aboard a mass transit vehicle 165 .
- a wireless device 150 c may have a substantially similar location 350 c to a group of wireless devices (e.g., wireless device 150 a and other near by devices), but the wireless device 150 c has a substantially different movement vector 351 c from the movement vectors (e.g., movement vector 351 a ) of the group of wireless devices.
- the information provider 120 may filter out the information from the wireless device 150 c for purposes of identifying a group of wireless devices 150 that are carried by passengers 160 riding aboard a mass transit vehicle 165 .
- a group 365 of wireless devices 150 having substantially similar locations (e.g., in proximity to location 350 a ) and movement vectors (e.g., movement vector 351 a ). Based upon the number of wireless devices and the velocity profile of the wireless devices 150 in the group 365 , this group 365 may be identified as those passenger-carried (or cargo-carried) wireless devices that are collectively riding aboard a mass transit vehicle 165 .
- the statistical techniques may be known to those having skill in the art in statistics, machine learning, regression, optimization, optimal control, and other algorithmic/numerical techniques.
- the location and time information for those wireless devices in that group 365 may be aggregated over a period time.
- the group 365 of wireless devices may have a particular location (as shown, for example, on the left side of the geographic area 320 ) and a particular movement vector 351 .
- the group 365 may have a different location (as shown, for example, to the right of the previous location).
- the aggregation of the location and time information may continue for a period of time (e.g., including t 1 through t 25 and beyond) so as to generate a listing of locations for route map data and to generate a listing of stop locations (e.g., location 370 ) for route schedule data. Aggregation may also occur even before a particular group has been identified as common travelers.
- the stop locations for the group 365 of wireless devices may be determined from the movement vectors 351 .
- the group 365 of wireless devices may have movement vectors 351 that indicate the group 365 is slowing down.
- the group 365 may have movement vectors 351 that indicate the group 365 is completely stopped over a period of time.
- the location information for the group 365 of wireless devices during this period of time e.g., from time t 12 to time t 15 ) may be stored as a stop location 370 that can be part of the schedule data reported by the information provider 120 .
- the group 365 of wireless devices may have a movement vector 351 that indicates a forward motion after the vehicle stop is completed. Where only a subgroup of group 365 has registered its location during a time period, only the location and time information from that subgroup may be considered.
- the aggregation of the location and time information for a group of wireless devices 150 inside a particular mass transit vehicle may continue over a period of days or weeks. Such information from different days or weeks may be used to refine the route map data and route schedule data (e.g., indicate that some stop locations do not occur everyday) reported by the information provider 120 . Furthermore, it should be understood that location and time information from many groups of wireless devices 150 may be aggregated so as to generate route map data and route schedule data for a plurality of mass transit vehicle routes, any one of which may be reported by the information provider 120 to a remote device. Also, the location and time information for a particular group of wireless devices aboard a previously identified vehicle route may be aggregated again at a later time to update or incrementally change the route map data and/or route schedule data for that particular route.
- map image 330 may correspond to the geographic area 320 that was analyzed as shown in FIG. 5 .
- at least a portion of the map image 330 may be provided by the report generator 122 of the information provider 120 .
- the map image 330 may include previously known geographic features, such as cities 332 , airports 334 , highways 336 , other roads 338 , or the like.
- the route map data may be used to indicate the location of a mass transit vehicle's pathway 335 relative to the other geographic features.
- the route schedule data may be used to indicate a stop point 337 that corresponds to the vehicle stop location 370 ( FIG. 5 ) previously determined by the information provider.
- the route of a mass transit vehicle may be determined without the use of predetermined maps. Rather, the maps showing other geographic features may be incorporated after the location information for the vehicle's route has already been determined by the information provider 120 .
- the information provider may include an function that determines what type of vehicle (e.g., on-road, off-road, train, plane, etc.) was identified based upon information such as the cluster size of the group of wireless devices, the velocity, the stop locations, the terrain over which the route passes, or the like.
- This process of determining the vehicle's route without relying upon old or outdated maps may provide a more accurate estimate of the vehicle's route pathway and route schedule.
- the vehicle may consistently stop at an unofficial stop point 337 to pick up passengers.
- This unofficial stop point 337 may not be located on a road, on a highway, or in a large city that could be identified on an old map. Rather, the unofficial stop point 337 may be located proximal to a hidden or otherwise unmapped walking or biking pathway 339 that local villagers regularly use to intercept a train or a bus (e.g., a situation that occasionally occurs in India and other nations).
- stop point 337 may be detected by identifying a location where a statistically significant number of previously ungrouped wireless devices engage the previous group of wireless devices that were known to be aboard the vehicle. Because the vehicle's route data and schedule data can be generated without reliance on old maps, the vehicle's route pathway 335 and stop points (e.g., stop point 337 ) may be accurately reported regardless of whether the vehicle uses unmapped pathways or unofficial stop points.
- the location and time information corresponding to a particular mass transit vehicle may be obtained from a plurality of passenger-carried wireless devices 150 that are not registered with that particular vehicle. Accordingly, a robust system to gather and report route map information, vehicle schedule information, estimated time or arrival, and other vehicle information may be developed without the requirement of location monitoring devices that are physically mounted and registered to each and every mass transit vehicle in the fleet.
- the route map data and schedule data generated by the information provider 120 may be used to provide a number of different services to remote users.
- remote wireless devices 150 e.g., a cellular phone or a PDA device
- the information provider 120 may supply more accurate information than static, pre-recorded schedules that are published by transit authorities.
- the information provider 120 may provide access to route data and schedule data that would not otherwise be available to potential passengers (e.g., public train authorities in some countries do not publish train schedules).
- the information provider 120 may be used to provide situational awareness features to passengers of the mass transit vehicle.
- a passenger of a vehicle may desire to know the next possible stopping location or the future route locations.
- the wireless device carried by that passenger may be used to request such information without having to enter the user's location or time information.
- the user's location and time information can be automatically embedded in the data request using the previously described GPS or triangulation techniques.
- the report generator 122 may respond to the data request with information related to the vehicles next stopping location and the estimated duration of that stop (e.g., the response may include a text message stating “the train will stop at the River Dam with an 80% confidence in 32 minutes” even though the River Dam is not an officially scheduled stop on the literature published by the transit authority).
- the information provider 120 may be used to provide location-based services for those passengers aboard a particular mass transit vehicle. These services may be accessed, for example, using a passenger's cellular phone or a PDA device connected to a wireless network, a passenger's laptop computer that is connected to a Wifi network or other local network provided on the vehicle, or a public computer station accessible to a plurality of passengers aboard the vehicle.
- the location-based services may include location-based news, location-based factoids or zeitgeist alerts (e.g., used by tourists aboard a cross-country bus or train route), location-based advertisements, or localized web searches.
- a passenger aboard a mass transit vehicle may send a data request via his or her cellular phone to the information provider 120 requesting information on the coffee shops close to the next stop location.
- the information provider 120 may use the passenger's location and time information that was embedded in the data request to identify a vehicle route and the next stop location. From there, the information provider 120 may include a subsystem to perform a localized web search of the coffee shops nearest to the identified stop location. The result of the localized web search may be reported back to the passenger's cellular phone.
- the location-based services may include automatic location-based notifications.
- a wireless device user may subscribe to a service that automatically notifies the user of location-based events, such as train delays or current local news stories.
- the information provider 120 may determine the user's location as previously described and then transmit a relevant mass transit alert or other locally relevant information.
- location-based advertisements can be automatically transmitted to wireless devices or computer stations aboard the vehicle when the information provider 120 transmits responses to other data requests. For example, if a passenger aboard a vehicle sends a data request to the information provider 120 requesting the estimated time of arrival at the next stop location, the report generator 122 may transmit a response that reports the estimated time until the next stop location (as previously described). In addition, the response may include location-based advertisements that are associated with the vehicle's next stop location. The information provider 120 may use the passenger's location and time information that was embedded in the data request to identify a vehicle route and the next stop location.
- the information provider 120 may include an advertisement generator or other subsystem to embed one or more advertisements in the response to the data request.
- the passenger may receive the requested information (e.g., the estimated time of arrival at the next stop location) along with one or more advertisements pertinent to the location of the next stop.
- training of a system to determine the parameters of a route may be distinct from obtaining latter data from devices that follow that route. For example, greater amounts of aggregated data may be required before a system has the confidence level necessary to conclude that a route is present at a particular path in the initial case. Once the route has been established, however, less data may be used to confirm that a mass transit vehicle is at a particular location along that route.
- data may be aggregated over days or more to establish the repetition needed to conclude that a particular path is a transit route.
- it may be enough to locate a single device moving along that route to determine where a mass transit vehicle is along the route—particularly if the received data is consistent with other data showing when a vehicle should be on the route.
- the lesser amount of data may allow a system to report the progress of the vehicle, such as to a user waiting on a station platform and having a GPS-enabled device that reports the user's location, which location is checked against the location of various stops.
- implementations of the systems and techniques described herein can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT or LCD monitor or a audio output instrument such as a headset) for communicating information to the user and a user-input device (e.g., a keyboard or a pointing device, such as a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT or LCD monitor or a audio output instrument such as a headset
- a user-input device e.g., a keyboard or a pointing device, such as a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well.
- feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback).
- input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet the global information network
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- Some systems and methods described herein may be implemented in many different wireless networks, including by way of example, cellular voice networks; wide area wireless networks such as TDMA, CDMA, W-CDMA, GSM, satellite-based, or EDGE networks; metro area networks such as WiMAX networks; local area networks such as WiFi networks; and any other wireless networks that can deliver voice, data, information, gaming applications, business or utility applications, or other services over a large or small geographical area.
- cellular voice networks such as TDMA, CDMA, W-CDMA, GSM, satellite-based, or EDGE networks
- metro area networks such as WiMAX networks
- local area networks such as WiFi networks
- any other wireless networks that can deliver voice, data, information, gaming applications, business or utility applications, or other services over a large or small geographical area.
- the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results.
- Other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed
