Description
the cross reference of related application
The application requires the U. S. application sequence No.12/253 that is entitled as " TEXTUAL DISAMBIGUATION USING SOCIAL CONNECTIONS " submitting on October 17th, 2008,791 right of priority, and its disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
Technical field
This document has been described system and the technology of the text disambiguation for the user of computing equipment is inputted.
Background technology
Be no matter to key in Email, submit search inquiry to, fill in electronic spreadsheet etc., people spend the plenty of time to input text in computing equipment.Research and develop particular technology and assisted the text input in such particular condition.For example, system can be carried out valid conjecture after user has keyed in some characters, carrys out the possible text that automatically completes of suggestion and inputs so that obtain user without each character of keying in tediously long input.And, thereby the keyboard of mobile device often has the each button of limitation to represent multiple characters-after user has pressed some buttons, system can carry out wishing to key in which the alphabetical relevant deduction on each button to user.By this way, such system can from otherwise suitable word or the phrase of selection may indefinite button pressing.
No matter the form that automatically completes or determine suitable character in the time that each button is pressed of input character, or the combination of the two, the disambiguation of input often depends on dictionary.Particularly, the dictionary under this background can comprise multiple text word and/or phrase, and the instruction of the frequency dependence occurring in typical writing language with word or phrase.The most conventional word can be given the priority higher than other word in the time carrying out suggestion or select in response to indefinite user's input.For example, if user inputs B and A, user wants to key in BALL or BASEBALL, or multiple other word.If the instruction of the dictionary on user's computing equipment BALL is the word of more commonly using than BASEBALL, the in the situation that of stopping after two characters user keying in, BALL can be provided as the default word being transfused to.In a similar fashion, if user presses 2 keys twice on telephone keypad, user may attempt inputting BALL, BASEBALL again, or or even ACT, ACTION, ABDICATE and other such word.In dictionary, the popularity of each word (popularity) can be controlled to user suggestion or select many which in may words.
Summary of the invention
This document has been described system and the technology that the text input for user is provided to computing equipment is carried out disambiguation, and described computing equipment is such as desk-top computer or smart phone.Usually, user's social networks is analyzed, and generated dictionary data with the word popularity between the user of this social networks and carry out disambiguation for the text that user is inputted.Its principle is the word that user more may use their good friend often to use.For example, if a teenager is identified as good friend by various users in social networking website, can in the time of the popularity of definite this user's word, content of pages and other the similar content to those good friends analyze.For example, such user more may use the slang of particular form-be prerequisite using across more extensive crowd's more common word in its communication, and it may not can be included by dictionary.
In the first general aspect, a kind of computer implemented method is described.Described method comprises the request that dictionary is provided to the computing equipment being associated with user that receives; The word of identifying described user's social network members uses information; And the word use information of utilizing described social network members is that described user generates dictionary.
In the second general aspect, a kind of recordable storage medium of the instruction that has record and be stored thereon has been described, described instruction performs an action in the time being performed.Described recordable storage medium comprises the request that dictionary is provided to the computing equipment being associated with user that receives; The word of identifying described user's social network members uses information; And the word use information of utilizing described social network members is that described user generates dictionary.
In the 3rd general aspect, a kind of computer implemented text disambiguating system is described.Described system comprises social networks interface, the data that the word of its social network members being associated with user for generation of reflection uses; Dictionary creation device, it is programmed to produce dictionary data by the data that the word of described reflection social network members is used, and described dictionary data is formatted so that use in the time that the text that described user is inputted carries out disambiguation; And prediction module, it is programmed to use the text that described dictionary data is inputted described user to carry out disambiguation.
In another general aspect again, a kind of computer implemented system is described.Described system comprises social networks interface, the data that the word that its identifier that is used for user produces the described user's of reflection social network members uses; The storer of storage main dictionary data, described main dictionary data reflection is not used specific to described user's general word; With for described usage data is treated to dictionary data so that the text that is used for user to input together with described main dictionary carries out the device of disambiguation.

Embodiment
Fig. 1 illustrates that social activity contact in social networks wherein can be used to make word to use Information generation for inputting the schematic diagram of mode of dictionary data of disambiguation.The figure shows system 100, wherein multiple different users 102,110,114 are set up contact due to the individual's association by website as the good friend in social networks and good friend's good friend.Each member in described social networks can have multi-form content of text associated with it, the page 112 that releases news thereon such as them, they list and the summary page 116 of self correlated characteristic, and other content the discussion page or the text message daily record of communication between each member.Each in these sources can reflect that group membership's typical case uses, and can reflect thus the use that this group membership may adopt in future.As a result, described source can be used with all variety of ways as described in more detail below, taking provide dictionary data for computing equipment in the time advising word or phrase as user.
More specifically, referring to Fig. 1, user 102 is illustrated as being associated with the dictionary 104 that comprises multiple entries 106.Described entry can be specific word or phrase, or can take other appropriate format.Each vocabulary shows that system 100 has been judged as the word of word that user 102 may adopt in future.In this example, institute's predicate is illustrated as, with least conventional sequence of commonly using the most bottom from top, having from 0.01 to 0.90 standardization scale.Conventionally, the word in disambiguation dictionary will substitute with tree structure and sort, and wherein each node is by representing each continuation character in word or the downward stepping of tree from each button of keyboard.Each word then can have word and use information (for example, the weight of its correspondence position in tree).For example, the tree structure of call type code keyboard can have eight branches of drawing from root node (because letter is displayed on button 2-9, can comprise one or more additional branches for non-alphabetic character), and in next stage other eight branches of each node.Therefore, in the time that pressing the button on keyboard, user can travel through described tree to wipe out impossible scheme.Other suitable mechanism also can be used to arrange word or phrase, and be used to indicate its use possibility.The specific arrangements of dictionary 104 is not crucial conventionally.
Although for concise and to the point each word has single score value in this example, also can use more complicated scoring technology.For example, word can have and depends on contextual score value, makes the score value of " day " in the time that user has just keyed in " sunny ", have score value higher while keying in another word than user 102.
The score value ordinary representation word being associated with each word or phrase will have the predict popularity that how may input aspect this word or phrase in future user 102.In General System, such data can be analyzed by the large document collected works the Email in many books or whole company, identify each word and concentrate the frequency using at this article, and with standardized way, word carried out to rank based on its frequency of occurrences and obtain.Then, can adjust such score value by checking specific to user 102 document, Email in described document such as user 102 outbox and/or inbox, be stored in the document on user 102 computing equipment, or be stored in the document on server with the user account number being associated with user 102.
In this example, alternatively, the rank of each word (for example, word or phrase) can be associated with contacting in social networks.In illustrated example, user 102 is shown in has two-stage contact in its social networks.User 102 first order contact 110 is shown to have the document 112 being associated with them.User 102 is also shown to have with user 114 the second level and contacts, and described user 114 has one or more associated document 116.
Document 112,116 can be taked various forms, and for example can comprise the typical summary page on the social network sites such as ORKUT, MYSPACE or FACEBOOK.Also can comprise other page, the extra page that is attached to its summary page of submitting to such as user.In addition, other communication that can carry out user 110,114 checks, such as the record of the text message session between user 102,110,114.Therefore, system 100 for example can analyze to determine word in document 112,116 and the frequency of utilization of phrase to each document 112,116.If user is teenager, this analysis can be identified many phrases that there will not be in English the browsing of using of standard, such as OMG (" Oh my ") " like ", " totally ", " sick " and other such slang word.
Or alternatively, system 100 can be analyzed the dictionary being associated with each user 110,116 in addition.Described dictionary can be stored on the client device being associated with each user 102,110,114, and the copy of described dictionary can be stored on central server, and described central server can comprise one or more server apparatus.Can contact to affect in every way the score value of word in dictionary 104 with the social activity between each user.As an example, system 100 can be analyzed and create frequency distribution for the word in described document or phrase all or some documents 112,116 in social networks.Can be weighted it the position in system according to word.For example, the food of liking such as indicating user in summary page is the score value that the word of blueberry can receive lower weight or regulate downwards with respect to the word in outbox text message, reason is compared with the word with before, user 110 probably more may use word below-by expansion in following communication session, suppose that good friend uses similar word and phrase in the time of communication, user 102 also probably may use this word more.
And the contribution (contribution) of the user 110 in first order social networks to user 102 may have larger weight than the contribution of the user far away such as user 114.In one example, can use recursion method, thereby utilize the score value of its next adjacent neighbors in social networks to average the score value of the word in each user-oriented dictionary.For example, therefore, in iteration for the first time, can be partly passed to the dictionary of two top user 110 in this figure from user 114 score value, and a part in those score values can be then in upper once circulation by indirect transfer to dictionary 104.Each user's score value can also be by artificial weight in addition, so as by its final score value slightly grappling be its original score value, thereby after iteration repeatedly, all users do not have identical dictionary.By this way, dictionary 104 can reflect actual use of the user 102 the most steadily, weakens to some extent, and more weaken for user 114 use for user 110 use.So in specific implementations, the weight of specific user's use may deviate from by index, or with mode like the distance-like of the central user away from social networks.
In addition the use of carrying out from user 102 and user 110,114, and the scoring that provides can mix with other more traditional scoring technology.The typical dictionary for example generating from a large amount of common document collected works can be used as the basis of scoring, and then can combine with user 102 usage data, and with combine from user 110,114 usage data.Also can adopt for word and the phrase of the dictionary to such as dictionary 104 and carry out other combination of the signal of rank.
When new entry and value merge to user 102 dictionary 104 from social networks, the text that dictionary 104 can be used to user to input provides disambiguation.Disambiguation can the input based on user 102 provide and replace selection to user 102.For example, the user who has inputted 2-2-7 has wanted word " Carla " or " baseball ".Can carry out laminated tissue to the entry in dictionary according to its character, thereby along with user's key entry, can wipe out the corresponding scheme of button of not pressing with user from potential scheme set.Then can present remaining candidate scheme to user, it is the sequence of the score value in dictionary 104 according to them.Such disambiguation can be in the case of requiring system to infer limited keyboard user view by the button that has been pressed and need to the text from the entry having generated is inferred input (wherein said entry can be clearly (for example,, if user has complete keyboard) or indefinite) in system and carry out.In a similar manner, along with user continues pressing keys, can further wipe out and narrow the set of possibility scheme, the scheme wherein advised is updated after each button is pressed.
In some embodiments, user 102 can send her and not want to its equipment the signal of shown specific word.On the contrary, she can select a word from the list of the text input frame drop-down demonstration in below, and its equipment can then use selected word to complete input.
If user 102 has selected a word instead of another, such selection can affect the value of two entries in dictionary 104.In certain embodiments, an entry (selected entry) can increase the value that it is associated.Equally, other entry can reduce its value being associated.Such user's 102 decision-makings also may not affect the value being associated with the multiple entries 106 in dictionary 104.
In dictionary, the rank of word can depend on and be different from the mechanism based on social networks discussed above or except it.For example, process value being associated with the word in dictionary can be undertaken by the number that contacts between definite member's popularity or special member and other member.For example, in its dictionary, have if having one of the member that the MYSPACE of the first order contact that exceedes 2,000,000 is the most popular Tila Tequila " MTV " that be associated with high value, those people that are linked to her can have " MTV " that be associated with higher value compared with having the good friend who has 20 first contacts of " MTV " that be associated with identical value.
Equally, the value being associated with entry can depend on the degree contacting with user 102.For example, contact 110 identical entries if user 102 has with the first order, the value being associated with this word can increase to and be greater than user 102 and have the situation that contacts 114 same item with the second level.Similarly, the common point between user, such as music or the video inputted in shared group, network, school and user's 102 summary and contact summary, can determine the value that the shared word that increases in dictionary corresponding to it is associated.The increase of the value being associated with the word in dictionary in other embodiments, can depend on the number of contacts of member in social networks.For example, if a member reads and comments in the blog of an one good friend or contact, or write on the metope of described contact, can in described user's dictionary, increase the value being associated with the described word contacting in dictionary.
Can allow user 102 to delete or amendment entry from its dictionary 104 is manual.In some embodiments, described user can access the value of dictionary and change entry.For example, if user 102 does not like " Grey ' s Anatomy ", it can change into minimum setting value by the value with this collection of drama correlation word occurring in its dictionary, and reason is only that the multiple members in its social networks may have the many of this word are quoted in their social network page.
Dictionary can also be shared.For example, company can safeguard from the constructed shared dictionary of the data of company clerk's page using.Such shared dictionary can make office worker easily access the text disambiguation of having considered company's ad hoc structure thus, described ad hoc structure such as personnel's in company specific acronym or name.Alternatively, can create dictionary and provide textual entry disambiguation to each member of this network for particular social network, wherein can carry out a little amendment to initial dictionary and use to reflect better the individuality in group.
User 102 can also have multiple dictionaries.For example, user can have public dictionary, thereby all dictionaries in social networks can both affect its public dictionary or be subject to the impact of its public dictionary, and privately owned dictionary and half privately owned dictionary (for example, it only can be accessed by first order good friend).User 102 can also have specific to the dictionary of application.For example, in the time that user keys in Email, they more may key in the word such as LOL or OMG, so these words can have higher scoring in the time that user 102 uses Email.On the contrary, user may can never use such word in the time searching for, thereby can use under these circumstances the dictionary of more overall (and being non-specific for user), such as considering the dictionary of recent search activities that points to particular search engine, thereby user may see at the top of the list of suggestion word it being the word of popular search terms in other user recently.
Fig. 2 A illustrates for using social network data to upgrade the process flow diagram of the example of the process 200 of user-oriented dictionary.Process 200 generally includes the user ID of the social activity contact that receives identification user, calculates user's keyword, word is applied to weight, and upgrade the dictionary that belongs to described user.Conventionally, process 200 comprises the social activity contact of determining user, and the word that identification user and social network members thereof use uses the frequency of institute's predicate to apply weight to institute's predicate based on user and social network members thereof, and the described user's of corresponding renewal disambiguation dictionary.
In initial step, process 200 receives (202) user's mark.For example, user can sign in in social network sites to send its mark to server.Described mark can obtain in every way, such as obtaining identification information by the cookie from user's computing equipment, and by making user that username and password is provided, or by other mechanisms known.
Process 200 is then identified user's social activity contact.For example, social networking service device can be stored the first order whom has a described user to and contact relevant data, such as " good friend " list.Social networking service device can also storage the data relevant with the shared link of other social network members to user, described other social network members such as the member as described user classmate, share the member of common interest with described user, or otherwise with the member of described user in common group.
Process 200 is then calculated (206) user's keyword.Such keyword in user's content (for example can be, the Email that described user sent or received or text message, such as the webpage of described user's social networks summary page, etc.) middle word or the phrase occurring, or other word or the phrase that can be associated with described user, such as the content in the page or the communication of described user's social networks.For example, user's good friend each can there is themselves keyword.After described user's good friend is identified, each good friend's keyword just can be determined and be compared with described user's keyword.In some embodiments, good friend's keyword can compare each other to determining described user determines whether to exist multiple good friends with same keyword before whether also having same keyword.
Then described weight user's keyword applied to weight (208), although also can be used as a part for the process of identifying keyword and is applied in.In one example, each user can start with default dictionary, and described default dictionary may simply be general group dictionary, such as being conventionally intended to the applicable dictionary to all people that speak English.For example, described default dictionary can by large-scale common document collected works or from the frequency of utilization of the word in the document of particular organization analyze institute produce.Word in this default dictionary can be in described collected works, to occur maximum X word (wherein X can be determined by the space that can be used for storing dictionary), has the weight of its relative frequency of occurrences in collected works of reflection.As the above mentioned, weight can also reflect word combine with other word occur frequency.Then can for example, analyze user's particular document (, text message, Email and webpage), and word in those documents can be added to described default dictionary and/or change the weight of word in described default dictionary.Word exists the produced weight can be much larger than the weight from general use in user's personal document, and reason is to suppose that described user repeats certain its pattern early using.Then can be by weight further being refined such as the dictionary of checking other user in the social networks of first user in mode described above, to make use the having the greatest impact for word score value of first user, good friend's use has less impact, and this impact is along with further declining away from described user in social networks.In some embodiments, described weight can compare with standard language dictionary.For example, if user's social networks has the example that word " their " is spelled as to " thier ", the disappearance of word " their " that can be based in English dictionary is refined for the weight of standard English dictionary.
At frame 210, upgrade the dictionary that belongs to described user.Such renewal can comprise adds new keyword (that is, providing used word in search inquiry recently) from obtaining such as search engine, and comprises and change new in dictionary or the weight of the word of existence before.
User's dictionary also can be regularly or continuous updating.For example, suppose user may be very soon dittograph again, each user keys in text message or submits search inquiry to, the word in described submission just can be added in user's dictionary, or can obviously improve the scoring of this word.For example, and system is other people dictionary data in (, each evening) access social networks to schedule, and can upgrade the dictionary of all users in network.The dictionary data of upgrading like this can utilize described system to store, or be stored in described dictionary and be stored in equally or alternatively in the system on remote equipment, when described dictionary data can once be utilized its remote equipment login on user, carry out synchronous.
By this way, process 200 provides an example, and utilizing this example can be that described user individual generates disambiguation dictionary by the data of consideration user social contact network members.Such data may be useful especially, and reason is that it more cries specific to described user than the general usage data for masses, and it is than abundanter for described user's usage data separately.As a result, it can be effectively for user's dictionary provides forecast updating so that data when choosing prompting and bring into use the neologisms that used in user catering one's wishes friend among dictionary.
Fig. 2 B is the process flow diagram that the example for utilizing the process 218 that social network data upgrades user-oriented dictionary is shown.Process 218 shows for the prediction example that text completes is provided to the user that computing equipment inputted search is inquired about.The word that social network members to the shown information of forecasting part of user based on this user uses and selecting.
In initial step, process 218 receives (220) inquiry.For example, user can be to the search engine submit Query such as general-purpose web search engine or specialized search engine, and described specialized search engine is such as the research tool for social networking website.Like this or other submission can wish that to system indicating user (clearly or impliedly) is provided the data of improving the degree of accuracy of the text disambiguation of institute's input text on user's computing equipment.
Process 218 then determines that whether (222) user is effective.In other words, system can be stored multiple members' information, and process 218 can verify that this user is such a member.For example, user can send its password to the server of social networking service device or other form, such as by manual entry website, or by its computing machine such as sending information from other similar mechanism of cookie from trend server.
Once process 218 determines that user is effective, process 218 is identified the social information that (226) are associated with described user.For example, server system can be stored the social information specific to this user, such as user profile, user-oriented dictionary, user's blog, user social contact contact and user's group.Described social information can be stored on a social networking service device together, or can store across multiple servers.In other embodiments, some or all social informations can be stored on subscriber equipment, and copy can be stored between subscriber equipment and server system and between subscriber equipment and server system, carry out synchronous.
Utilize that identify and user-dependent social information, process 218 is determined the keyword of (228) these social networks.For example, social networking service device can be from for example, corresponding to having term in the people's that social activity contacts document (, webpage, Email or text message) with described user.If these words are not present in described user's dictionary, they can be added among described dictionary.
After lists of keywords is edited, process 218 is determined the weight (and can change the weight to having put on word in dictionary) that (230) are associated with each keyword, although weight can be carried out in identification keyword.For example, can be to keyword designation number value.More describe in detail as above, can determine the value being associated with each keyword with various embodiments.
Process 218 is then returned to the data that (232) are relevant to the word classification of dictionary, such as by identification keyword and the weighted value that is associated to use with user-oriented dictionary.Process 218 is then utilized new social Data Update (234) dictionary.For example, server can use new data to edit user-oriented dictionary, and described new data is that user's social activity contact is calculated.
Once user-oriented dictionary is edited, process 218 receives (236) and follows the user's input after the original input that triggers dictionary renewal.For example, user can input the numeral that need to input disambiguation.If user has inputted 2-2-7 on numeric keypad, application can be assigned letter, A, the B or the C that assign such as the numeral 2 on numeric keypad to each numeral.User can also use qwerty keyboard input alphabet.Equally, user can utilize pen input alphabet in program, and described program can be determined letter based on this shape of inputting.In another embodiment discussed further below, described application can be used said word to input as user.
Process 218 then utilizes dictionary to carry out disambiguation (238) to user's input.For example, all candidate's words that described disambiguation can match with the input that user carries out in dictionary by identification, and then each potential candidate is carried out to rank and carry out.Such disambiguation can be upgraded in a similar manner in the time that user inputs fresh character at every turn.
Described disambiguation can be carried out in distinct device.For example, disambiguation server can use dictionary to carry out disambiguation to input, and upgraded information can be sent to user's computing equipment, thereby is the list that user presents suggestion word fast.Described disambiguation can also be carried out this locality on user's computing equipment, and it can make the response time faster but also can limit in some cases the size of dictionary.The specific part of disambiguation can be on subscriber equipment this locality carry out and specific part also can carry out on server.For example, subscriber equipment can track user be input to the word (and can cancel those words after predetermined amount of time) in its equipment recently, and the top that these words can be provided to the drop-down list completing at the word of suggestion, all the other words in list can provide by disambiguation dictionary at server.
At frame 240, process 218 can show have been predicted.For example, as mentioned, the order of the value that application can be associated with it shows the list from the word of user-oriented dictionary, wherein this demonstration be just positioned at the current region of keying in of user above or below.In other embodiments, described application can show to have the keyword of high associated values, and it is suitably presented at the top of the text box that user is current keyed in.
In step 242, process 218 determine advise complete whether accepted 242 by user.For example, user can clearly accept advised completing (for example,, by pressing carriage return or clicking on mouse button.In other embodiments, that accepts to advise completes and can imply, such as being keyed in space by user to indicate it to complete the key entry of specific word).
If what user did not wish to accept to advise completes, user can continue simply to key in and ignore all suggestions.User can also press delete key and return a character in keying at it, and the proposed projects of show needle to new shorter input of character string.In the case of user do not wish accept advise complete, process 218 can turn back to step 236 until user accept new suggestion complete or inputted with dictionary in all unmatched words of any word.
Once what user had accepted prediction or suggestion has completed or inputted new word, process 218 utilizes new data to upgrade (244) to dictionary.For example, the prediction of accepting completes can increase the value being associated with keyword with constant.For example, the relative weighting of user-selected word can increase to some extent in user's dictionary and/or selected word can be added in the independent word group of user's input recently, and wherein this group can be positioned at the top that any suggestion subsequently completes list.Such list can be associated with time decling phase, thereby the word that user uses disappears from the top of described list in the situation that user uses them once just not re-use.
In one embodiment, user can use said word to input data to subscriber equipment.Disambiguation can help to apply determines which word user is associated with independent sound.User can be by continuing to imply to its equipment input voice data completing of accepting to predict.User can also clearly accept to have predicted by the verbal order such as "Yes" or " correctly ".In other embodiments, user can also accept word by non-oral mode, such as passing through keypad or mouse action.
Fig. 3 A is the sequence chart of describing the example of mutual 300 between client 302 and server 304.Similar to shown in Fig. 2 A of the process here, and provide the more specifically diagram of exemplary approach, client and server system can be carried out in this way alternately in the time providing disambiguation information to computer user, and the word that under can user, the members of social networks carries out uses such information is upgraded.Conventionally, describedly comprise that alternately client is from server request dictinary information, server based on user the contact in social networks retrieve such information, and server provides the renewal to dictionary to client.Client can be with improving through the dictionary upgrading the disambiguation that word completes.
In the drawings, the request (frame 306) that client 302 transmits access dictionary to server 304 at first, described dictionary such as user's individual dictionary.Server 304 is then identified the contact (frame 308) of user in social networks and is calculated user's keyword 310 based on those contacts.In some embodiments, server 304 can the data by everyone be carried out search and is determined the keyword that has the people that social activity contacts with described user.For example, social network members can have summary, and server 304 can be sorted out and be determined keyword by the text in described summary or other data analysis.
Server 304 then can apply weight (frame 312) to word based on keyword, generates new dictionary or additional dictionary data, and new dictionary data 314 is sent to client.
Server 304 can be determined keyword and use various factors to apply with weight (frame 312) each keyword.For example, the separation degree that server 304 can obtain between described user's the social network members of word from it based on user with applies weight to word.Described weight can be simultaneously or the good friend's quantity alternatively having based on user.Equally, the described weight similarity between can data and good friend's data based on being associated with user.Described weight can also be based on there is the good friend of same keyword in its contact data quantity.
Server 304 then adopts the word of weighting, and information format is turned to dictionary data, and described dictionary data is sent to client 302 (frame 314).Client 302 can be upgraded user-oriented dictionary (frame 316) by new dictionary data.For example, client 302 can be added new dictionary data to the dictionary existing before being stored in client 302.In some embodiments, new word can be added to previous dictionary.In other embodiments, new dictionary data can substitute previous dictionary.In other embodiment again, client 302 can apply the new weight from server 304 to the corresponding word in original dictionary Already in.In other embodiments, dictionary can be retained in server 304, and can in the time that user keys in and is presented the selected ci poem of being advised with client 302 and selects, between client 302 and server 304, transmit data.
Fig. 3 B is the sequence chart of describing the example of mutual 320 between client 348, disambiguation server 350 and social server 352.In this example, the specific example that is illustrated alternately the system that is provided for realization and the shared social data of disambiguation engine between different private server groups.Particularly, social server 352 can be a part for general social networking system, and can communicate via application programming interface (API) and disambiguation server 350, to make disambiguation server to obtain and to use relevant information to user's social networks and the word of network members when as User Exploitation or renewal disambiguation dictionary.By this way, disambiguation server 350 can be in the time that user be in the process to system input text the more easy and intention of predictive user exactly.
In this example process, client 348 transmits the request (frame 322) to dictionary data to disambiguation server 350 at first.Disambiguation server 350 is identified the user's (frame 324) who is associated with client 348 such as the information by from the cookie storing in client 348.Disambiguation server 350 is then asked social information (frame 326) from social server 352.Disambiguation server 350 can be used as a part for the larger process of exploitation or renewal dictionary data and carries out this operation, and described dictionary data will be provided for the user who uses client 348.For example, disambiguation server 350 can be considered to use many factors such as the word in online news source in the time that the word in disambiguation dictionary or phrase carry out rank, use from the word in the public's nearest search engine inquiry, and user's self use.Submit to request to be and the another kind of mechanism of obtaining data to social server 352, described data can reflect the use following possible to the user of client 348.
The then user's of identify customer end 348 social networks (frame 328) of social server 352, such as the keyword 330 of determining social networks by analyzing the document being associated with described user's social network members, determine the weight (frame 332) of keyword, and return to social data (frame 334) to disambiguation server 350.Described data can adopt various ways, thus protection social networks user's privacy.For example, the data of returning can comprise the score information that word and word are associated simply, thereby disambiguation server 350 cannot determine who has used institute's predicate in each member from social networks.And social server 352 can be maintained secrecy to the member's of user social contact network identity.
Disambiguation dictionary before disambiguation server 350 then utilizes is integrated customization usage data 336.For example, dictionary before can for based on it general use in general English word and phrase are carried out to the general dictionary of rank.Described customization usage data can comprise the various lastest imformations of dictionary, comprises the data that history that the members of reflection user social contact network carries out is used.After having integrated described customization usage data, new dictionary data is sent to client 348 (frame 338) by disambiguation server 350.In the embodiment shown in the figures, client 348 is upgraded dictionary 340, accepts to input 342 from user, and shows that its prediction completes 344.By this way, client device can complete for its user provides the prediction of mating text input more closely with user's oneself use, its people's who is inquired about by current inputted search user is inferred, as determined by nearest media event, and the word being undertaken by user's social circle and phrase use determine.
Client 348 can be automatically from disambiguation server request dictionary data 322.For example, when, client 348 can be worked as user and at any time opens the application-specific in client 348, transmit request.In another embodiment, user can send request to upgrade dictionary data on its computing equipment.On the contrary, client 348 can regularly send the request to dictionary data, such as every day, weekly or monthly.
Fig. 4 A is for upgrading dictionary to user's input is carried out to the schematic diagram of the system 400 of disambiguation.Conventionally, system 400 allows the social activity contact in the time creating or upgrade one or more disambiguation dictionary, it being used as each user of social network members to carry out information notice.
User can be undertaken by the various mechanism such as mobile phone 402, laptop computer 410 and smart phone 412 and system alternately.Mobile phone 402 can comprise limited keyboard, thereby in the time of user's pressing keys, system cannot determine what specific character user wants to input.Such input may benefit from disambiguation therefrom.On the contrary, laptop computer 410 and smart phone 412 can have qwerty keyboard completely, but the input of its text is indefinite on them in the time that user has only inputted word or phrase a part of.Word by completing user among input process, the disambiguation of user version input in this case may be useful.
Disambiguation server 406 can contribute to the text that user is inputted on various remote equipments to carry out disambiguation.For example, server 406 can be provided at equipment the data of disambiguation dictionary from it, or can in the time that user keys in, provide advised text to input by network 404.Disambiguation server 406 can comprise one or more servers, and can be used as the part such as the system of search engine, and suggestion utilizes webpage to show user when keying in the text such as search inquiry in the page.In a similar fashion, user can key in text in the search box on toolbar, and toolbar application can cooperate with disambiguation server 406 in the time that user keys in, to show the answer of being advised.
In this example, disambiguation engine also communicates with one group of social server 408, and described social server 408 can be used as the part with disambiguation server 408 same domain, or can be from different territories.As above described in detail and as between disambiguation server 406 and social server 408 arrow schematically showed, generating for user in the process of dictionary data, disambiguation server can be found the information relevant to user's social networks.For example, can to transmit user's identifier and indicate described disambiguation dictionary to social server 408 be effective requestor's of data certificate to disambiguation dictionary.In the time identifying the word on the document being associated with user social contact network and apply weight to those words, described social server can then be carried out those actions as discussed above.Social server 408 then can be passed the list (wherein having removed as the generic word of " a ", " the ", " and " etc.) of identified word and the weight being associated with those words back to disambiguation server 406.The information of returning then can be incorporated in user's disambiguation dictionary, and described disambiguation dictionary can be stored on one of disambiguation server 406 and/or equipment 402,410,412.
Fig. 4 B is the schematic diagram that the system 420 of disambiguation is provided to the user who inputs data on computing equipment.System 420 is similar with the system 400 in Fig. 4 A, but more pays close attention in this example specific disambiguation server 426.
And the same with system 400, system 420 comprises the remote equipment such as computing machine 422, described computing machine 422 can be by the multiple servers of network 424 electricity access such as internet.The service such as web search service like this can be increased and be carried out the service of disambiguation with the text input to user, thereby makes such text input fast and more accurate.In this example, disambiguation service is provided by disambiguation server 426.
Server 426 comprises and allows it that multiple assemblies of disambiguation are provided to the user's remote equipment such as computing machine 422 when keying in equipment user.For example, prediction module 434 receives the information relevant to content that user keys in, and returns to the predicted data that complete to subscriber equipment.Module 434 can operate by traverse tree structure, the character that the each node in wherein said tree construction is inputted for user, and the scheme of text input is all words below present node in tree.And each input of word can comprise weight, it determines how institute's predicate can show with respect to other potential scheme in the time that user keys in the prediction input list shown in it.Such structure can be stored as one or more dictionaries, the main dictionary 436 using across the word of large volume document such as reflection, and can be before user's dictionary customizes as described above as user's initial dictionary.User data 440 can be stored the multiple parameters that are associated with each user in system then, and can store each user's Customized dictionary data.Described Customized dictionary data can substitute main dictionary 436 and use, or can be used to the main dictionary 436 that increases.
Such Customized dictionary can be built by dictionary creation device 432.Dictionary creation device can depend on multiple not homologies in the time building Customized dictionary for user, wherein selected word or the phrase that may key in the near future with reflection user in those sources.In one example, can analyze to determine the word using in described article to the current event data 442 such as nearest newspaper and magazine article, and the frequency that used of institute's predicate.Suppose that such " fresh " content has reflected that user is such as the classification that may key in the current event problem among its equipment in the time building search.Equally, suppose that the user of computing machine 422 may repeat the input that other people carry out, especially in the situation that described input is relevant to rising tendency, can inquiry log 438 be analyzed to identify user and has been committed to the query terms of search engine.
Dictionary creation device can also depend on external data source, such as social network data 430.In the drawings, show social networks interface 433, and it is programmed to the information using from one group of social server 428 request reflection word.Described request can be followed common API, and it can require disambiguation server 426 not carry out any operation except identification user and himself.Social server can carry out processing as discussed above, and can return to the data relevant to user's social networks 430, such as formatted and add the data of user's disambiguation dictionary to, these data have reflected the use that user's social networks carries out.The use of supposing good friend is the prediction that the word in user future uses at least to a certain extent.
By this way, system 420 can be inputted help for user provides the text of customization.Described customization can be directed to the temporary information such as recent media event and search inquiry, but also can be towards social activity, thereby may provide than alternate manner disambiguation more accurately.
In some embodiments, can use from the data of computing machine 422 and carry out text disambiguation.For example, user can have the file such as word processing file, instant message, film, contact person and calendar item being stored on computing machine 422.In these projects included data can be in the time of the data sharing of computing machine 422 and disambiguation server 426 (for example,, in the time that computing machine 422 is synchronizeed with disambiguation server 426) provide further data for disambiguation server 426.In one example, if calendar comprises project " Samantha ' s Birthday ", word " Samantha ' s " and " Birthday " can be added to user data 440.Similarly, browsing histories that can user is as data.For example, if user's data cached baseball (baseball) file that comprises espn.com, the word " baseball " using in text, image or filename can be used by dictionary creation device 432.Data can also provide from other client device, such as mobile device, media player or other computing machine.
Equally, other server that is connected to network 424 can provide further data to user data 440.For example, user can have account on the server separating with disambiguation server 426 or social server 428, the information of described server stores such as electronic mail account or instant message account.Data from described disjoint server can be synchronizeed with the data of disambiguation server 426 in user data 440.In some embodiments, user can add account to provide more data to disambiguation server 426 on each server.Electronic mail account and AOL instant message account are linked to disambiguation server 426.Data can provide from the multiple sources that comprise server and client side's equipment.For example, mobile device and the user account from disjoint server can provide data to user data 440.
