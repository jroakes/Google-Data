Definitions
- This specification relates to content management.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results. Reference is directed to US 2008/243611 and US 7577244B2 .
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- the method comprises: presenting a user interface to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign including a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location; receiving a selection from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest; evaluating content delivery options for presenting content associated with the campaign including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location; and serving content from the campaign when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign.
- Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals.
- the user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted.
- the method comprises: enabling a content item sponsor to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location, including enabling a content sponsor to exclude presentation of their content for at least one of these types of requests, where enabling includes receiving a presence/interest specification from the content item sponsor for a campaign; evaluating a received content item request to determine a likelihood that the user is at a given location; evaluating the received content item request to determine a likelihood that the user is merely interested in the given location but is not physically present at the given location; and providing content from a content sponsor in response to the received content item request only if targeting criteria for the campaign match the request including satisfying a presence/interest specification from a respective content item sponsor for the campaign.
- Evaluating a received content item request can include determining a geographic location associated with the request. Determining the geographic location can be based on location based services. Determining the geographic location can be based on an IP address associated with the request. The likelihood that a user is at a given location can be expressed in terms of a probability. The probability can be above a first threshold. The likelihood that a user is merely interested in the given location can be expressed in terms of a probability. The probability can be above a second threshold.
- the method can include tracking details of how each content delivery by a content delivery service satisfied the content sponsor's presence/interest specification.
- the method can include, for each delivered content item, determining performance information for a respective content item for when the content item was provided based on the user being at a given location and when the content item was provided based on the user being interested in but not physically present at the given location.
- the performance information can include click through rate and conversion information.
- the method can include providing to the content sponsor a report that includes the tracked details and the performance information for a time interval.
- the report can include one or more controls which enable the content sponsor to optimize the campaign based on the performance information.
- the method can include automatically optimizing the campaign based on the performance information.
- Optimizing can include splitting the campaign into a first campaign with a first presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who are at a given location and a second campaign with a second presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who have expressed an interest in a given location.
- a first bid associated with the first campaign can be different than a second bid associated with the second campaign.
- Optimizing can include splitting a campaign into multiple campaigns based on location information.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device that comprises instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations.
- the operations include: presenting a user interface to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign including a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location; receiving a selection from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest; evaluating content delivery options for presenting content associated with the campaign including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location; and serving content from the campaign when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign.
- Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals.
- the user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted.
- Evaluating content delivery options can include receiving a request and evaluating whether the request is associated with a user at a location or merely interested in the location.
- Evaluating content delivery options can include evaluating a received content item request including determining a geographic location associated with the request. Determining the geographic location can be based on location based services. Determining the geographic location can be based on an IP address associated with the request.
- Evaluating content delivery options can include determining a likelihood that a user is at a given location in terms of a probability, where the probability is above a first threshold.
- Evaluating content delivery options can include determining a likelihood that a user is merely interested in a given location in terms of a probability, where the probability is above a second threshold.
- the campaign management user interface can include a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or at least one targeting criterion includes an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location.
- the campaign management user interface can be configured to receive a selection from a campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest.
- the content delivery system can be configured to: evaluate content delivery options for presenting content associated with the campaign including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location; and serve content from the campaign when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign.
- Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals.
- the user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted.
- a campaign sponsor can be enabled to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location.
- a campaign sponsor can receive a report that indicates which content items were served based on an associated user being at a given location and which content items were served based on an associated user being interested in the given location but not physically present at the given location.
- a content campaign can be automatically optimized based on tracked information which indicates, for multiple content item requests, whether respective content items were served based on the user associated with the request being at a given location or interested in but not physically present at the location.
- a user interface can be presented to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign.
- the user interface can include a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed (e.g., specific or particular) geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location.
- a selection can be received from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence or/and interest.
- a content management system can determine whether the user is present or merely interested in a geographic location, and based on the determination, content from the campaign can be served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, including satisfying the user presence criterion and/or the interest criterion.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user
- a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104, user devices 106, content providers 108, publishers, and a content management system 110.
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104, user devices 106, and content providers 108.
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible.
- a content provider 108 can create a content campaign using tools provided by the content management system 110.
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- the content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 111 which define a content campaign.
- the campaign parameters 111 can be stored in a parameters data store 112.
- Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creative), and targeting criteria.
- Targeting criteria can include, for example, a targeted language, one or more targeted geographical locations, and a presence / interest specification.
- One account management user interface can include one or more controls for specifying targeting criteria, such as a control that is used to specify the presence / interest specification.
- the presence / interest specification indicates whether the content provider 108 desires to target users based on a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location, based on an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location, or both.
- a campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 111 specified by the content provider 108.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102.
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105.
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 113 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102.
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104.
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106.
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 113 over the network 102.
- Some search queries 116 can be submitted using a map application.
- the search system 113 can, for example, provide a map application which can present a search control along with a viewport for use in presenting location data. A map showing a particular location can be presented in the viewport and the user can enter one or more query terms using the search control.
- the search system 113 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116.
- the search system 113 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in one or more search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 113 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116, and includes a link to the resource 105.
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the search system 113 or the content information system 110 can update usage information 124 based on user activities, such as requests for resources 105, search queries 116, other requests for content, web sites visited, or interactions with content.
- the usage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a search query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content.
- the usage information 124 can include, for each entry, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requesting user device 106, a type of usage, a location of interest associated with the activity (if any), the location of the user when the activity occurred, and other details associated with the usage.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the usage information 124 can be used for various purposes, such as to determine targeting information.
- targeting information can be determined for a particular location, such as to target users who appear to be traveling to or are physically located in the particular location or who have otherwise expressed an interest in the particular location.
- the content management system 110 can determine targeting information for a location based on historical information that matches a pattern of users that have traveled to or planned travel to the particular location.
- a request for content can be received from a user.
- the request for content can be, for example, a request for a resource 105 or a search query 116 from a user device 106.
- the content management system 110 can determine whether the user is present or merely interested in a geographic location associated with the request.
- search query terms associated with the request may include or indicate a location of interest.
- search query terms may include a zip code, a city name, or an address.
- a search query term of "Golden Gate Bridge" may indicate a location of "San Francisco".
- a location of interest can also be determined based on location information associated with a location displayed in a map viewport at the time the request was submitted.
- the content management system 110 can determine the location of the user at the time of submission of a request for content, based, for example, on an IP address of a user device 106 that submitted the request.
- the user device 106 can determine the location of the user using a location based service (e.g., a GPS (Global Positioning System) service) and can communicate the location to the search system 113 and/or the content management system 110.
- a user's location can also be determined based on a mode (e.g., home, work, away) of the user, which may be determined based on the day and/or time of the request.
- the content management system 110 can determine whether the user is traveling to the location, such as by comparing the location of the user to a home location associated with the user.
- the content management system 110 can serve content from the campaign to the requesting user device 106 when the content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, such as if the content item request satisfies the presence / interest specification. For example, if the presence / interest specification indicates that the content provider 108 desires to target users who are present at one or more particular locations and if the content management system 110 determines that the user is located at one of the particular locations, the content management system 110 can serve content to the user. As another example, the content management system 110 can serve content if the presence / interest specification indicates that the content provider 108 desires to target users who have expressed interest in one or more particular locations and the content management system 110 determines that the user has expressed an interest in one or more of the particular locations. The content management system 110 can provide content to the user based at least in part on particular targeting information previously determined from the usage information 124.
- the content management system 110 can use other criteria to select content items to provide in response to the request.
- the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content "slots" that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page.
- resource keywords associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query 116 can be provided to the content management system 110.
- Content items selected by the content management system 110 can include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. For example, content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 can be selected by the content management system 110.
- the content management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to a user.
- the system 200 includes a search system 202, a content management system 204, a campaign sponsor client device 206, and user devices 208, 210, 212, and 214, connected to a network 216.
- the content management system 204 can receive requests for content from user devices 208-214, over the network 216.
- a user 218 can submit search queries while using the user device 208 while at work in San Diego.
- the user 218 can submit search queries while using the user device 210 while at home in Oceanside.
- the user device 210 may be the same device as the user device 208 or may be a different device.
- Other examples include the content management system 204 receiving a request for content from the user device 212 associated with a user 220 who resides in Yuma, Arizona and receiving a request for content from the user device 214 (which may be the same device as the user device 212) when the user 220 travels to San Francisco (e.g., as illustrated by a user 222).
- Historical information about queries, other requests for content, user content interactions, and other user activities can be stored in usage information 224.
- the content management system 204 can determine targeting information, such as targeting information that is associated with particular locations, such as Oceanside, Yuma, San Diego, and San Francisco.
- the content management system 204 can group the usage information 224 by location (e.g., by recorded locations of users and/or recorded location of interest information associated with received user requests), and for each location, the content management system 204 can, for example, identify frequently used search terms entered by users who performed associated queries. Targeting information for a particular location can be determined based on the identified frequently used search terms for that location.
- a campaign sponsor 206 can use the campaign sponsor client device 226 to access a user interface 228 provided by the content management system 204 to customize targeting information for a campaign.
- the user interface 228 can include, among other controls, a user selectable control 230 for specifying one or more targeting criteria.
- the control 230 includes a control 232 which can be used to specify a targeting criterion of a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location, a control 234 which can be used to specify a targeting criterion of an interest by a user in a prescribed geographic location, and a control 236 which can be used to specify targeting criteria that includes both the presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an interest by a user in a prescribed geographic location.
- a selection can be received from the campaign sponsor 226 of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign, including a selection of one of the controls 232, 234, or 236.
- An indication of the campaign sponsor's selection can be stored in a targeting criteria data store 238 as a presence / interest specification.
- the user In response to a received content request for a user, it can be determined whether the user is present or merely interested in a particular geographic location, and based on the determination, content from the campaign can be served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, including satisfying the user presence criterion and/or the interest criterion. For example, if the presence / interest specification for the campaign sponsor 226 corresponds to targeting based on presence and if the campaign sponsor 226 has targeted the location of San Francisco, content provided by the campaign sponsor 226 may be provided to the user device 214 when the user 222 is traveling to San Francisco, such as content items 246, 248, and 250 included in content slots in a resource 252 displayed on a display device 254 of the user device 214. In contrast, the content items 246, 248, and 250 might not be displayed, for example, to the user 218, since the user 218 is not physically present in San Francisco.
- Content may be provided to the user device 214 if the request for content matches targeting criteria other than the presence / interest specification. For example, a search keyword, such as “attractions” or “hotels”, may match one or more targeting keywords provided by the campaign sponsor 226.
- the content management system 204 can select one or more content items based at least in part on targeting information associated with the location of San Francisco previously determined from the usage information 224.
- content provided by the campaign sponsor 226 may be provided to the user device 210 in response to the user 218 performing a search 260 using a search application 262 displayed on a display device 264 while the San Francisco area is displayed in a map viewport 266.
- a content item 268 provided by the campaign sponsor 226 may be provided to and displayed in the user device 210 in a content slot included in the search application 262.
- content provided by the campaign sponsor 226 may be provided to the user device 210 in response to the user 218 selecting a San Francisco related search result 271 included in a search results list 272 or in response to the user 218 performing a search that includes one or more San Francisco-related search terms.
- the content item 268 might not be displayed to the user 218 if the user 218 performs a search query that does not include a San Francisco-related search term.
- the content item 268 might not be displayed to the user 222, even though the user 222 is in San Francisco, if the user 222 performs a search query that does not include a San Francisco-related search term and does not otherwise indicate a location of interest of San Francisco.
- the user device 214 submits a request for content where the request for content does have a location of interest related to San Francisco, such as if the request for content is associated with the San Francisco weather report resource 252, then the content item 268 might be displayed to the user 222 (e.g., as illustrated by the content item 248).
- the presence / interest specification can indicate exclusion criteria as well as targeting criteria.

- the controls 308, 310, and 312 can be displayed, for example, in response to selection of an advanced location options control 314.
- an option to target both based on presence and on interest can be recommended to a campaign sponsor, as targeting based on presence or on interest may result in fewer impressions for the campaign sponsor.

- the content management system 204 can, along with tracking details of how each content delivery by the content management system 204 satisfied a content sponsor's presence/interest specification, determine performance information for each respective content item for when the content item was provided based on the user being at a given location and when the content item was provided based on the user being interested in but not physically present at the given location.
- Performance information can include, for example, click through rate and conversion information.
- the report 270 can include the performance information and can also include one or more controls which enable the content sponsor to optimize the campaign based on the performance information.

- the campaign sponsor 226 can select the control 232 to specify to target using user presence, can select the control 234 to specify to target using interest, or can select the control 236 to specify to target using either presence or interest.
- Content delivery options are evaluated for presenting content associated with the campaign, including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location (406).
- the content management system 110 can determine the location of a user from the user's user device 106, e.g., using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user device 106, or obtained through cell triangulation, e.g., from three or more signal transmitters, towers or satellites that serve the user device 106.
- GPS global positioning system
- the location of the user device 106 can be obtained through periodic mobile check-ins, such as positional checkpoints made by the mobile device at regular intervals, or from a user's check-in at an establishment using, for example, a social application.
- the location of the user can be determined by geocoding an IP address of a client device (e.g., the user device 214) that submitted the content item request.
- Whether a user is interested in the geographic location can be determined based on whether a location of interest is included in or associated with the content item request.
- the user can include one or more location-related search terms (e.g., city names, state names, street names, ZIP codes, landmark names, etc.) in a search query.
- a location of interest can be determined from geographic information displayed in, or related to, a map viewport (e.g., the San Francisco area displayed in the map viewport 266).
- the location of interest can be inferred, for example, from the center-point coordinates of the map's viewport or from a destination included in driving directions provided by the map application.
- Content from the campaign is served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign (408). For example, if the targeting criteria indicates that the campaign sponsor desires to target users who are present at one or more particular locations and if the content management system 110 determines that the user is located at one of the particular locations, the content management system 110 can serve content to the user. For example, the content management system 204 can serve the content item 248 to the user device 214 based on determining that the campaign sponsor 226 has previously selected the control 232 and has targeted San Francisco and that the user 222 is located in San Francisco.
- the content management system 110 can serve content if the targeting criteria indicates that the campaign sponsor desires to target users who have expressed interest in one or more particular locations and the content management system 110 determines that the user has expressed an interest in one or more of the particular locations.
- the content management system 204 can serve the content item 268 to the user device 210 based on determining that the campaign sponsor 226 has previously selected the control 234 and has targeted San Francisco and that the user 218 has performed the search query 260 while the map viewport 266 displays the San Francisco area.

- a content item sponsor is enabled to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location (502), including enabling a content sponsor to exclude presentation of their content for at least one of these types of requests, where enabling includes receiving a presence/interest specification from the content item sponsor for a campaign.
- the content item sponsor can be presented with a user interface that includes the controls 302 or 304.
- the control 302 enables the content item sponsor to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location.
- the control 304 enables the content item sponsor to specify exclusion criteria based on whether a user is at a location or whether a user has expressed interest in a location.
- a received content item request is evaluated to determine a likelihood that the user is at a given location (504). For example, as described above, a user's location can be determined based on an IP address associated with the request, or based on location based services (e.g., GPS, cell triangulation). The likelihood can be expressed in terms of a probability.
- the received content item request is evaluated to determine a likelihood that the user is merely interested in the given location but is not physically present at the given location (506). For example, it can be determined that the user is not physically present at the given location by comparing the user's current location to the given location (e.g., if the distance between the user's current location and the given location is more than a threshold, it can be determined that the user is not physically present at the given location). Whether the user is interested in the given location can be determined if the user has expressed an interest in the given location, such as by one or more location-related search terms, or other location-related information, such as the display of the given location in a map application. The likelihood can be expressed in terms of a probability.
- Content from a content sponsor is provided in response to the received content item request only if targeting criteria for the campaign match the request including satisfying a presence/interest specification from a respective content item sponsor for the campaign (508).
- content can be served if the presence/interest specification indicates that the content item sponsor desires to target based on presence of the user and if the likelihood that the user is at the given location is greater than a first threshold.
- content can be served if the presence/interest specification indicates that the content item sponsor desires to target based on interest of the user and if the likelihood that the user is interested in the given location is greater than a second threshold.

Description
- This specification relates to content management.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results. Reference is directed to
US 2008/243611 andUS 7577244B2 . - Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- The invention is set forth in the claims hereinafter. In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing content. The method comprises: presenting a user interface to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign including a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location; receiving a selection from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest; evaluating content delivery options for presenting content associated with the campaign including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location; and serving content from the campaign when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals. The user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for serving content. The method comprises: enabling a content item sponsor to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location, including enabling a content sponsor to exclude presentation of their content for at least one of these types of requests, where enabling includes receiving a presence/interest specification from the content item sponsor for a campaign; evaluating a received content item request to determine a likelihood that the user is at a given location; evaluating the received content item request to determine a likelihood that the user is merely interested in the given location but is not physically present at the given location; and providing content from a content sponsor in response to the received content item request only if targeting criteria for the campaign match the request including satisfying a presence/interest specification from a respective content item sponsor for the campaign.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Evaluating a received content item request can include determining a geographic location associated with the request. Determining the geographic location can be based on location based services. Determining the geographic location can be based on an IP address associated with the request. The likelihood that a user is at a given location can be expressed in terms of a probability. The probability can be above a first threshold. The likelihood that a user is merely interested in the given location can be expressed in terms of a probability. The probability can be above a second threshold. The method can include tracking details of how each content delivery by a content delivery service satisfied the content sponsor's presence/interest specification. The method can include, for each delivered content item, determining performance information for a respective content item for when the content item was provided based on the user being at a given location and when the content item was provided based on the user being interested in but not physically present at the given location. The performance information can include click through rate and conversion information. The method can include providing to the content sponsor a report that includes the tracked details and the performance information for a time interval. The report can include one or more controls which enable the content sponsor to optimize the campaign based on the performance information. The method can include automatically optimizing the campaign based on the performance information. Optimizing can include splitting the campaign into a first campaign with a first presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who are at a given location and a second campaign with a second presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who have expressed an interest in a given location. A first bid associated with the first campaign can be different than a second bid associated with the second campaign. Optimizing can include splitting a campaign into multiple campaigns based on location information.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device that comprises instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations.

- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals. The user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted. Evaluating content delivery options can include receiving a request and evaluating whether the request is associated with a user at a location or merely interested in the location. Evaluating content delivery options can include evaluating a received content item request including determining a geographic location associated with the request. Determining the geographic location can be based on location based services. Determining the geographic location can be based on an IP address associated with the request. Evaluating content delivery options can include determining a likelihood that a user is at a given location in terms of a probability, where the probability is above a first threshold.

- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a system comprising a content delivery system and a campaign management user interface. The campaign management user interface can include a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or at least one targeting criterion includes an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location. The campaign management user interface can be configured to receive a selection from a campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest. The content delivery system can be configured to: evaluate content delivery options for presenting content associated with the campaign including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location; and serve content from the campaign when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining whether a user is present or merely interested in the geographic location can include evaluating one or more user signals. The user signals can include one or more of an IP address of a client device that submitted the content item request, a location-based signal available to the client device, one or more location-related terms associated with the content item request, a time that the content item request was submitted, a mode of the user, where the mode is selected from at work, home, or away, and location information describing a location that was presented in a map application viewport on the client device at the time the content item request was submitted.
- Particular implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. A campaign sponsor can be enabled to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location. A campaign sponsor can receive a report that indicates which content items were served based on an associated user being at a given location and which content items were served based on an associated user being interested in the given location but not physically present at the given location. A content campaign can be automatically optimized based on tracked information which indicates, for multiple content item requests, whether respective content items were served based on the user associated with the request being at a given location or interested in but not physically present at the location.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A user interface can be presented to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign. The user interface can include a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criterion includes a presence of a user in a prescribed (e.g., specific or particular) geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location. A selection can be received from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign including a selection of one or both of user presence or/and interest. In response to a received content request for a user, a content management system can determine whether the user is present or merely interested in a geographic location, and based on the determination, content from the campaign can be served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, including satisfying the user presence criterion and/or the interest criterion.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user , or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to a user. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, publishers, and acontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andcontent providers 108. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Thecontent providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. - A
content provider 108 can create a content campaign using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - The
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 111 which define a content campaign. Thecampaign parameters 111 can be stored in aparameters data store 112.Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creative), and targeting criteria. Targeting criteria can include, for example, a targeted language, one or more targeted geographical locations, and a presence / interest specification. - One account management user interface can include one or more controls for specifying targeting criteria, such as a control that is used to specify the presence / interest specification. The presence / interest specification indicates whether the
content provider 108 desires to target users based on a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location, based on an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location, or both. A campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 111 specified by thecontent provider 108. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To facilitate searching of
resources 105, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 113 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 can be stored in anindexed cache 114. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 113 over thenetwork 102. - Some search queries 116 can be submitted using a map application. The
search system 113 can, for example, provide a map application which can present a search control along with a viewport for use in presenting location data. A map showing a particular location can be presented in the viewport and the user can enter one or more query terms using the search control. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 113 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 113 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in one or more search results pages. In some implementations, asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 113 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The
search system 113 or thecontent information system 110 can update usage information 124 based on user activities, such as requests forresources 105, search queries 116, other requests for content, web sites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, the usage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a search query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content. The usage information 124 can include, for each entry, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requestinguser device 106, a type of usage, a location of interest associated with the activity (if any), the location of the user when the activity occurred, and other details associated with the usage. - The usage information 124 can be used for various purposes, such as to determine targeting information. For example, targeting information can be determined for a particular location, such as to target users who appear to be traveling to or are physically located in the particular location or who have otherwise expressed an interest in the particular location. For example, the
content management system 110 can determine targeting information for a location based on historical information that matches a pattern of users that have traveled to or planned travel to the particular location. - After targeting information has been determined for a particular location, a request for content can be received from a user. The request for content can be, for example, a request for a
resource 105 or asearch query 116 from auser device 106. Thecontent management system 110 can determine whether the user is present or merely interested in a geographic location associated with the request. For example, search query terms associated with the request may include or indicate a location of interest. For example, search query terms may include a zip code, a city name, or an address. As another example, a search query term of "Golden Gate Bridge" may indicate a location of "San Francisco". A location of interest can also be determined based on location information associated with a location displayed in a map viewport at the time the request was submitted. - The
content management system 110 can determine the location of the user at the time of submission of a request for content, based, for example, on an IP address of auser device 106 that submitted the request. As another example, theuser device 106 can determine the location of the user using a location based service (e.g., a GPS (Global Positioning System) service) and can communicate the location to thesearch system 113 and/or thecontent management system 110. A user's location can also be determined based on a mode (e.g., home, work, away) of the user, which may be determined based on the day and/or time of the request. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can determine whether the user is traveling to the location, such as by comparing the location of the user to a home location associated with the user. - The
content management system 110 can serve content from the campaign to the requestinguser device 106 when the content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, such as if the content item request satisfies the presence / interest specification. For example, if the presence / interest specification indicates that thecontent provider 108 desires to target users who are present at one or more particular locations and if thecontent management system 110 determines that the user is located at one of the particular locations, thecontent management system 110 can serve content to the user. As another example, thecontent management system 110 can serve content if the presence / interest specification indicates that thecontent provider 108 desires to target users who have expressed interest in one or more particular locations and thecontent management system 110 determines that the user has expressed an interest in one or more of the particular locations. Thecontent management system 110 can provide content to the user based at least in part on particular targeting information previously determined from the usage information 124. - The
content management system 110 can use other criteria to select content items to provide in response to the request. For example, the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content "slots" that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. As another example, resource keywords associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 116 can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Content items selected by thecontent management system 110 can include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. For example, content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 can be selected by thecontent management system 110. Thecontent management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to a user. The system 200 includes asearch system 202, acontent management system 204, a campaignsponsor client device 206, anduser devices network 216. Thecontent management system 204 can receive requests for content from user devices 208-214, over thenetwork 216. For example, auser 218 can submit search queries while using theuser device 208 while at work in San Diego. Similarly, theuser 218 can submit search queries while using theuser device 210 while at home in Oceanside. Theuser device 210 may be the same device as theuser device 208 or may be a different device. Other examples include thecontent management system 204 receiving a request for content from theuser device 212 associated with auser 220 who resides in Yuma, Arizona and receiving a request for content from the user device 214 (which may be the same device as the user device 212) when theuser 220 travels to San Francisco (e.g., as illustrated by a user 222). - Historical information about queries, other requests for content, user content interactions, and other user activities can be stored in
usage information 224. Thecontent management system 204 can determine targeting information, such as targeting information that is associated with particular locations, such as Oceanside, Yuma, San Diego, and San Francisco. For example, thecontent management system 204 can group theusage information 224 by location (e.g., by recorded locations of users and/or recorded location of interest information associated with received user requests), and for each location, thecontent management system 204 can, for example, identify frequently used search terms entered by users who performed associated queries. Targeting information for a particular location can be determined based on the identified frequently used search terms for that location. - A
campaign sponsor 206 can use the campaignsponsor client device 226 to access auser interface 228 provided by thecontent management system 204 to customize targeting information for a campaign. Theuser interface 228 can include, among other controls, a userselectable control 230 for specifying one or more targeting criteria. For example, thecontrol 230 includes acontrol 232 which can be used to specify a targeting criterion of a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location, acontrol 234 which can be used to specify a targeting criterion of an interest by a user in a prescribed geographic location, and acontrol 236 which can be used to specify targeting criteria that includes both the presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an interest by a user in a prescribed geographic location. A selection can be received from thecampaign sponsor 226 of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign, including a selection of one of thecontrols criteria data store 238 as a presence / interest specification. - In response to a received content request for a user, it can be determined whether the user is present or merely interested in a particular geographic location, and based on the determination, content from the campaign can be served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign, including satisfying the user presence criterion and/or the interest criterion. For example, if the presence / interest specification for the
campaign sponsor 226 corresponds to targeting based on presence and if thecampaign sponsor 226 has targeted the location of San Francisco, content provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 may be provided to theuser device 214 when theuser 222 is traveling to San Francisco, such ascontent items resource 252 displayed on a display device 254 of theuser device 214. In contrast, thecontent items user 218, since theuser 218 is not physically present in San Francisco. - Content may be provided to the
user device 214 if the request for content matches targeting criteria other than the presence / interest specification. For example, a search keyword, such as "attractions" or "hotels", may match one or more targeting keywords provided by thecampaign sponsor 226. When selecting content to provide to theuser device 214, thecontent management system 204 can select one or more content items based at least in part on targeting information associated with the location of San Francisco previously determined from theusage information 224. - As another example, if the presence / interest specification for the
campaign sponsor 226 corresponds to targeting based on interest and if thecampaign sponsor 226 has targeted the location of San Francisco, content provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 may be provided to theuser device 210 in response to theuser 218 performing asearch 260 using asearch application 262 displayed on a display device 264 while the San Francisco area is displayed in amap viewport 266. For example, acontent item 268 provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 may be provided to and displayed in theuser device 210 in a content slot included in thesearch application 262. As another example, content provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 may be provided to theuser device 210 in response to theuser 218 selecting a San Francisco related search result 271 included in a search resultslist 272 or in response to theuser 218 performing a search that includes one or more San Francisco-related search terms. - In this example, where the presence / interest specification indicates targeting based on interest for the
campaign sponsor 226, thecontent item 268 might not be displayed to theuser 218 if theuser 218 performs a search query that does not include a San Francisco-related search term. Similarly, thecontent item 268 might not be displayed to theuser 222, even though theuser 222 is in San Francisco, if theuser 222 performs a search query that does not include a San Francisco-related search term and does not otherwise indicate a location of interest of San Francisco. If theuser device 214 submits a request for content where the request for content does have a location of interest related to San Francisco, such as if the request for content is associated with the San Franciscoweather report resource 252, then thecontent item 268 might be displayed to the user 222 (e.g., as illustrated by the content item 248). - The presence / interest specification can indicate exclusion criteria as well as targeting criteria. For example,
FIGS 3A-3C illustrate example controls 302-306, respectively, that may be displayed in theuser interface 228, for specifying a presence/interest specification. Thecontrol 302 is similar to thecontrol 230, in that it includes acontrol 307 which includescontrols controls control 308, an option to target both based on presence and on interest can be recommended to a campaign sponsor, as targeting based on presence or on interest may result in fewer impressions for the campaign sponsor. For example, in some implementations, it is recommended that the campaign sponsor select thecontrol 310 or the control 312 if the campaign sponsor has a particular reason to target based on presence or on interest, and to otherwise select thecontrol 308. - In response to the campaign sponsor selecting the
control 310, the control 304 (e.g., as shown inFIG. 3B ) can be displayed in place of thecontrol 302. The user can select a control 316 to cause thecontrol 307 to reappear. Thecontrol 304 includes acontrol 318, which can be used to specify an exclusion method. For example, thecontrol 318 includes a control 320 which the campaign sponsor can select to exclude based on physical location and search interest. If the control 320 is selected, associated content provided by the campaign sponsor is not shown to users who are physically located in an excluded location or who indicate an excluded location as a location of interest. - For example, referring again to
FIG. 2 , if thecampaign sponsor 226 has targeted the United States, and has excluded based on physical location and search interest with an excluded location of California, content provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 may be provided to theuser device 212 if theuser 220 does not indicate a location of interest related to California in a request for content, since theuser device 212 is located within the United States but outside of California. In this example, content from thecampaign sponsor 226 that is associated with the excluded location is not provided to theuser device 212 if theuser 222 indicates a location of interest of California. Also in this example, content from thecampaign sponsor 226 that is associated with the excluded location is not provided to theuser devices - Referring now to
FIG. 3C , suppose the campaign sponsor has specified to target based on search intent (e.g., as illustrated by a label 322) and has selected acontrol 324 to exclude by physical location only and that an excluded location is the state of California. In this example, referring back toFIG. 2 , content provided by thecampaign sponsor 226 that is associated with the excluded location of California is not provided to theuser devices user device 212, since theuser device 212 is not in California, if theuser 220 indicates a location of interest related to California. - As another example, in some implementations, the
campaign sponsor 226 can specify to target users who are traveling to a particular location, such as San Francisco. For example, thecontent management system 204 can determine that theuser 220 is a traveler who is currently located in San Francisco (e.g., as illustrated by the user 222), such as by comparing a home location of Yuma associated with theuser 220 to a current location of San Francisco associated with a request received from theuser device 214. For example, in some implementations, a home IP address and/or a work IP address can be associated with a user, and the user's current location can be determined to be a home location (e.g., Oceanside for the user 218), a work location (e.g., San Diego for the user 218), or an away (e.g., travel) location based on comparing an IP address associated with a content request to the home IP address and/or the work IP address of the user. - In some implementations, a
report 270 can be provided to thecampaign sponsor 226 where thereport 270 includes details for a time interval for content delivery (e.g., the previous month) by thecontent management system 204 including details of how each delivery satisfied a presence/interest specification of thecampaign sponsor 226. For example, thereport 270 includes columns 272-284 indicating, for each delivery, if applicable, a date, a user, a description of the request that resulted in the delivery, the user's location, the value of the presence / interest specification at the time of the delivery, a targeted location, and an excluded location, respectively. Thereport 270 includes details for some of the examples discussed above where content was delivered to theuser report 270 can include other information. For example, thereport 270 can indicate that therow 286 is associated with an exclude by physical location and search interest setting and that therow 288 is associated with an exclude by physical location only setting. As another example, thereport 270 can include other information which indicates which content item(s) were served in response to each request. - In some implementations, the
content management system 204 can, along with tracking details of how each content delivery by thecontent management system 204 satisfied a content sponsor's presence/interest specification, determine performance information for each respective content item for when the content item was provided based on the user being at a given location and when the content item was provided based on the user being interested in but not physically present at the given location. Performance information can include, for example, click through rate and conversion information. - The
report 270 can include the performance information and can also include one or more controls which enable the content sponsor to optimize the campaign based on the performance information. For example, the content sponsor can select a control to split a campaign into a first campaign with a first presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who are at a given location and a second campaign with a second presence/interest specification corresponding to targeting users who have expressed an interest in a given location. The first and second campaigns can have, for example, different associated bid amounts and other, different campaign settings. As another example of optimizing, the content sponsor can split a campaign into two or more campaigns based on performance information associated with multiple locations. In some implementations, thecontent management system 204 can perform the example optimizations described above automatically based on the performance information. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for serving content. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . As another example, the process 400 can be performed by thecontent management system 204 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - A user interface is presented to a campaign sponsor (402) for customizing targeting information for a campaign, including a user selectable control for specifying one or more targeting criteria, where at least one targeting criteria includes a presence of a user in a prescribed geographic location or an indication of an interest by a user in the prescribed geographic location. For example, with respect to
FIG. 2 , theuser interface 228, which includes thecontrol 230 for specifying targeting using physical location (e.g., presence) and/or targeting using search interest (e.g., intent), can be presented to thecampaign sponsor 226. - A selection is received from the campaign sponsor of one or more targeting criteria to be associated with the campaign, including a selection of one or both of user presence and interest (404). For example, the
campaign sponsor 226 can select thecontrol 232 to specify to target using user presence, can select thecontrol 234 to specify to target using interest, or can select thecontrol 236 to specify to target using either presence or interest. - Content delivery options are evaluated for presenting content associated with the campaign, including determining for a given content request whether a user is present or merely interested in a geographic location (406). For example, the
content management system 110 can determine the location of a user from the user'suser device 106, e.g., using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of theuser device 106, or obtained through cell triangulation, e.g., from three or more signal transmitters, towers or satellites that serve theuser device 106. In some implementations, the location of theuser device 106 can be obtained through periodic mobile check-ins, such as positional checkpoints made by the mobile device at regular intervals, or from a user's check-in at an establishment using, for example, a social application. As another example, the location of the user can be determined by geocoding an IP address of a client device (e.g., the user device 214) that submitted the content item request. - Whether a user is interested in the geographic location can be determined based on whether a location of interest is included in or associated with the content item request. For example, the user can include one or more location-related search terms (e.g., city names, state names, street names, ZIP codes, landmark names, etc.) in a search query. As another example, a location of interest can be determined from geographic information displayed in, or related to, a map viewport (e.g., the San Francisco area displayed in the map viewport 266). In some implementations, the location of interest can be inferred, for example, from the center-point coordinates of the map's viewport or from a destination included in driving directions provided by the map application.
- Content from the campaign is served when a content item request satisfies the targeting criteria for the campaign (408). For example, if the targeting criteria indicates that the campaign sponsor desires to target users who are present at one or more particular locations and if the
content management system 110 determines that the user is located at one of the particular locations, thecontent management system 110 can serve content to the user. For example, thecontent management system 204 can serve thecontent item 248 to theuser device 214 based on determining that thecampaign sponsor 226 has previously selected thecontrol 232 and has targeted San Francisco and that theuser 222 is located in San Francisco. - As another example, the
content management system 110 can serve content if the targeting criteria indicates that the campaign sponsor desires to target users who have expressed interest in one or more particular locations and thecontent management system 110 determines that the user has expressed an interest in one or more of the particular locations. For example, thecontent management system 204 can serve thecontent item 268 to theuser device 210 based on determining that thecampaign sponsor 226 has previously selected thecontrol 234 and has targeted San Francisco and that theuser 218 has performed thesearch query 260 while themap viewport 266 displays the San Francisco area. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for providing content to a user. The process 500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . As another example, the process 500 can be performed by thecontent management system 204 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - A content item sponsor is enabled to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location (502), including enabling a content sponsor to exclude presentation of their content for at least one of these types of requests, where enabling includes receiving a presence/interest specification from the content item sponsor for a campaign. For example, the content item sponsor can be presented with a user interface that includes the
controls control 302 enables the content item sponsor to target content to users based on whether a content item request is associated with a user at a particular location or is associated with a user that has expressed an interest in the particular location. Thecontrol 304 enables the content item sponsor to specify exclusion criteria based on whether a user is at a location or whether a user has expressed interest in a location. - A received content item request is evaluated to determine a likelihood that the user is at a given location (504). For example, as described above, a user's location can be determined based on an IP address associated with the request, or based on location based services (e.g., GPS, cell triangulation). The likelihood can be expressed in terms of a probability.
- The received content item request is evaluated to determine a likelihood that the user is merely interested in the given location but is not physically present at the given location (506). For example, it can be determined that the user is not physically present at the given location by comparing the user's current location to the given location (e.g., if the distance between the user's current location and the given location is more than a threshold, it can be determined that the user is not physically present at the given location). Whether the user is interested in the given location can be determined if the user has expressed an interest in the given location, such as by one or more location-related search terms, or other location-related information, such as the display of the given location in a map application. The likelihood can be expressed in terms of a probability.
