Definitions
- the present invention relates to the design of digital networks. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and system for discovering network paths which include both layer-2 and layer-3 switches.
- Hi-performance web sites often rely on “server farms”—hundreds of networked computers performing similar tasks—for scalability, reliability, and fast response time. Deploying these server farms typically requires the power of a high-speed, versatile network to provide reliable connectivity and sufficient bandwidth among the servers.
- IP routers which process packets on layer-3, or the IP layer.
- IP routers By processing every packet's IP header based on routing tables, IP routers provide flexibility and re-configurability.
- IP routers provide flexibility and re-configurability.
- such heavy processing also imposes constraints on router speed. Consequently, high-speed ports on an IP router are expensive, and building an entire server-farm network using only IP routers can be very costly.
- Layer-2 switches require less per-packet processing and, hence, can provide high-speed ports at a lower cost.
- the most widely deployed layer-2 switch is the Ethernet switch, which forwards Ethernet frames based on layer-2 forwarding tables.
- the recently ratified standard for 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE) further unleashes the power of fiber-optic transmission and allows high-speed Ethernet switches to inter-operate with a wide range of legacy equipment.
- Other proprietary layer-2 or sub-layer-2 protocols facilitate the construction of large-scale, high-speed Ethernet switch fabrics.
- a typical topology of such a network includes layer-3 switches located at the “edge” of the network, providing access connectivity to the servers, and layer-2 or sub-layer-2 switches located in the “core,” providing high-speed inter-connectivity to the layer-3 switches.
- a network operator needs effective tools to monitor the network state and the health of each switch.
- a network operator needs effective tools to monitor the network state and the health of each switch.
- the traceroute command becomes insufficient, because the switches operating below layer-3 are “invisible” to the traceroute command.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that identifies network switches along a path.
- the system receives an address of a source node and an address of a destination node.
- the system also maintains a set of topology information for a network which includes layer-3, layer-2, and sub-layer-2 switches.
- the system simulates a data packet originated at the source node and destined for the destination node. During the simulation, the system determines whether a current-hop node performs layer-3, layer-2, or sub-layer-2 switching.
- the system further sends a query to the current-hop node over a separate control channel to determine the status of the current-hop node and discover the next-hop node.
- the system then receives a reply from the current-hop node in response to the query. Subsequently, the system determines the next-hop node based on the reply and sets the next-hop node as the current-hop node. The system records the identifiers for all the switches along a path from the source node to the destination node.
- determining whether the current-hop node performs layer-3, layer-2, or sub-layer-2 switching includes looking up network topology information. If the current-hop node performs layer-3 switching, sending a query to the current-hop node includes sending a query to the node's layer-3 switching table. Additionally, receiving a reply from the current-hop node includes receiving an address of the next layer-3 node along the path. Furthermore, the system identifies an egress interface at the current-hop node, and determines the status of the identified egress interface at the current-hop node by querying an Interface Manager.
- the system identifies the interface at the end host coupled to an edge switch by querying the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table of the edge switch. Furthermore, identifying an egress interface at the current-hop node includes querying ARP table to obtain an interface index. Determining the status of the egress interface at the current-hop node includes querying an Interface Manager for the status of the identified egress interface.
- ARP Address Resolution Protocol
- determining whether the current-hop node performs layer-3, layer-2, or sub-layer-2 switching includes looking up the network topology information. If the current-hop node performs only sub-layer-2 switching, finding the next sub-layer-2 switch along the path includes looking up the network topology information. The system further identifies an egress interface at the current-hop node by looking up network topology information and determines the status of the identified egress interface at the current-hop node by querying an Interface Manager.
- the system queries the current-hop node's IP routing table. If the current-hop node supports equal-cost multiple-path (ECMP) selection in its IP routing table, the current-hop node returns multiple next-hop layer-3 nodes which result in multiple paths leading to the destination node. The system further selects an exact path by simulating an ECMP-selection schemes that includes a hash operation performed by the current-hop node.
- ECMP equal-cost multiple-path
- the system displays each node's address and/or node identifier, ingress interface, and egress interface along the path.

- an edge layer-3 switch is only one layer-3 hop away from another layer-3 switch, because the layer-2 switches form a mesh network interconnecting the layer-3 switches. Furthermore, the layer-2 switches are “invisible” to the layer-3 switches, because a layer-3 packet is generally encapsulated in a layer-2 frame. The layer-2 switches only process layer-2 packet headers, and the layer-3 switches only process layer-3 headers.
- This tiered network architecture while providing scalability, also presents a challenge for network monitoring.
- a network operator can monitor the layer-3 switches along a path from a source host to a destination host by issuing a traceroute command, which obtains the IP addresses and response times of the intermediary layer-3 switches by varying the time-to-live (TTL) values in the IP headers of packets transmitted from the source host.
- TTL time-to-live
- the traceroute command cannot identify layer-2 or sub-layer-2 switches along the path, because these switches do not process IP headers.
- the network operator cannot identify and monitor the state of layer-2 or sub-layer-2 switches along a path in network 100 .

Otherwise, the system further determines whether the current-hop node performs layer-3, layer-2, or sub-layer-2 switching. In one embodiment, the system first determines whether forwarding of the packet at the current-hop node requires layer-3 lookup (step 410 ), by looking up the network topology information. If layer-3 lookup is necessary, the system queries the layer-3 switching table to determine the next layer-3 hop's IP address. If both the source and destination nodes are connected to the same switch, the system then obtains the egress interface index by querying an ARP table (step 412 ) and further determines whether the egress interface is operational by querying an Interface Manager (step 418 ).
- the system determines whether layer-2 or sub-layer-2 lookup is necessary based on the network topology. Further, the system queries the network topology to determine the next-hop node and the corresponding egress interface (step 416 ).
- the system determines whether the egress interface is operational (step 418 ). If not operational, the system prints an error message (step 424 ) and exits. If the egress interface is operational, the system prints the next-hop node information (step 420 ) and sets the next-hop node as the current-hop node (step 422 ). The system then repeats the process (step 408 ) until it reaches the destination node. The system then displays each node's IP address and/or node identifier, ingress interface identifier, and egress identifier along the traversed path.
Abstract
Description
-
- 1. Determine whether the current-hop node performs layer-3, layer-2, or sub-layer-2 switching based on the network topology information or the node's ingress interface, and obtain the next hop and egress interface information. If layer-3 switching information is desired, query the layer-3 switching table of the current switch chip. If layer-2 or sub-layer-2 switching information is desired, query the network topology information.
- 2. Query the current switch chip's Interface Manager to check the egress interface status. If the egress interface is down, stop. Otherwise, print the next-hop switch information.
- 3. Move to the next-hop switch and repeat steps 1-2, until the system reaches the destination host.
