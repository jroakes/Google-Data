Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to video mandatory system, and relate more particularly to a kind of video coding system for video being carried out with the visual quality optimized code conversion under scramble time and bitrate constraint.
Background technology
Video trusteeship service (such as YOUTUBE) allows user to issue video. Most of video trusteeship services are by original source video from its primary coded format (such as, MOV) code converts one or more output format (such as, ADOBEFLASH or WindowsMediaVideo (WMV)) to. Code conversion includes using the video coder-decoder for native format that from native format, source video is decoded into uncoded expression, and then utilizes the video coder-decoder for output format to uncoded presentation code. Code conversion can be used to reduce memory requirement, and also reduces the bandwidth requirement being used for client supply video.
A challenge when the video trusteeship service for having millions of videos designs video coding system is video to carry out code conversion and storage with acceptable visual quality and with reasonable computation cost. One special problem is rate-distortion (R-D) and the time of calculating of efficient allocated code bit and the calculating optimization to realize source video. It is said that in general, given target resolution and frame rate, the coding bit rate that the visual quality of video is calculated by its use rate control algorithm is determined. Convention video coding system uses multiple coding strategy to obtain the rate-distortion of the optimization of source video, and these coding strategies include once by encoding (CBR), constant quantization device coding (CQP) and constant rate of speed factor coding (CRF) with Multiple through then out mean bit rate coding (ABR), constant bit rate.
Conventional coding strategy cannot provide constant visual quality to the video of coding and meets the bitrate constraint associated with video and jointly do not optimize bit rate, distortion and complexity. Such as, ABR coding strategy uses contraction-expansion factor and long-term and short-term compensatory to realize target bit rate and to meet network wide constraints. But the visual quality of ABR coding is likely to when video scene changes to fluctuate. CBR coding strategy is designed to the real-time streaming transport with constant bit rate controlled by the storage buffer with fixed size. But CBR provides the highest coding rate minimum R-D performance among above-mentioned conventional coding strategy.CQP coding strategy maintains constant quantization device and uses identical quantization parameter (QP) to compress each frame. CQP is likely to especially cause the Time Perception fluctuation of the video of coding when the video with intensive scene change is used large-scale quantizer by it. CRF coding strategy is to realize constant visual quality for target by the constant rate of speed factor. CRF with nominal quantization device to Video coding, but increase QP and vice versa when there is a large amount of action and motion in scene. The shortcoming of CRF coding is in that output video file size is unpredictable due to the variable scene in video content. Accordingly, it is difficult to select suitable constant rate of speed factor values to meet network or the required bitrate constraint of storage system.
Summary of the invention

VDL is bit rate Video coding needed with certain visual quality. Total VDL indicates total content complexity of input video. The time complexity of the time VDL reflecting video of input video. The space complexity of the SPACE V DL reflecting video of input video. Based on the comparison, the method adjusts the total coding complexity of input video, time and space encoding complexity and by the total coding complexity of the adjustment of input video, time and space encoding complexity, input video is encoded.
Can be further enhanced by the CRF bit rate model of the CRF reference bits rate model of use training and correction and by the total coding complexity of adjustment of input video, time and space encoding complexity, input video be encoded.

II.To video bitrate-relationship between quality modeling: CRF reference bits rate model
CRF coding strategy is to realize the constant visual quality using constant rate of speed factor pair Video coding for target. It is said that in general, the CRF for video selection represents the desired visual quality levels being used in first encoding passes through to Video coding. For the big CRF value of Video coding is caused big quantization parameter (" QP "), high compression ratio, and thus result in low visual quality. Little CRF causes little QP, low compression ratio, and thus results in high visual quality. Be zero CRF value mean lossless compress and therefore, it is intended that the highest visual quality. CRF coding differently compresses the different frame of video by dynamically adjusting QP according to the amount of movement in frame of video.
The video compression performance using CRF coding can be modeled by CRF reference bits rate model (such as, the CRF reference bits rate model 220 of Fig. 2), and wherein video compress quality can be represented by suitable CRF value. Use the CRF reference bits rate model of training, video coding system 102 based on RDC selects the suitable CRF value for source video, and this CRF value enables the actual bit rate used when to source Video coding to export, close to the target with source video, the target bit rate that video format associates. It addition, the CRF reference bits rate model of training provides about needing how many mean bit rates to use the instruction to Video coding of the CRF coding strategy. For the actual bit rate of source Video coding can be used to revise CRF bit rate model when to given source Video coding to realize constant visual quality exporting in the bitrate constraint that video format associates with the target of source video with from the CRF that obtains of CRF reference bits rate of training.
Using the RDC training module 200 of Fig. 2 exemplarily, the video in video complete or collected works 160 is trained CRF reference bits rate model 220 by RDC training module 200. Video complete or collected works 160 storage has a large amount of many scene videos sequences of multiple spatial resolution, frame rate and bit rate. The video encoder 210 of RDC training module 200 uses the CRF coding CRF value selected in advance each Video coding to selecting from video complete or collected works 160 and obtains actual bit rate from coding. The Video Coding Scheme of any existence known to persons of ordinary skill in the art can be used for Video coding by video encoder 210. In one embodiment, video encoder 210 is the x.264 video encoder that the video of selection is encoded into HD.264/MPEG-4AVC form.The other embodiments of video encoder 210 can use VP8 encoder or other available video encoder.
CRF reference bits rate model 220 use to (crf, the bitrate) of the Video coding in video complete or collected works 160 as training sampling with to the relationship modeling between CRF and the CRF bit rate encoded. Relational dependence between the mean bit rate of CRF and the video of video complete or collected works is in the spatial resolution of video, temporal resolution and encryption algorithm fixing in acquiescence x.264CRF coding. Relation between mean bit rate and spatial resolution, temporal resolution and CRF is described as follows:
B=f (crf, M, T), (1)
Wherein B is mean bit rate, and M is the number of pixels (that is, spatial resolution) of the luminance component of the frame of video, and T is frame number (that is, temporal resolution) per second. Owing to parameter crf, M and T are generally independent of one another, so can be expressed as followsin at the mean bit rate described in equation (1):
B=f1(crf)×f2(M)×f3(T).(2)
Matching sampled representation is the four-tuple (crf, M, T, B) found by method of least square by CRF reference bits rate model 220.
For the average behavior to the Video coding that single game scape and many scene videos encode, CRF reference bits rate model 220 according to the number of scenes in video to from the gained bit rate weighting to Video coding and as follows according to the scene sum normalization bit rate in the training video of the number selected:
Wherein B is mean bit rate, BiIt is the actual bit rate to i-th Video coding, and SiIt it is the number of scenes in i-th video. The residual value error of model is ri=Bi-f(crfi, Mi, Ti). The degree of fitting of CRF reference bits rate model 220 is assessed as follows by error of sum square (SSE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE):
Wherein riIt is residual value error, and n is matching number of samples.
It is said that in general, according to the frame rate evaluation time resolution being unit with frame (fps) per second. For the impact on CRF reference bits rate model 220 of the search time resolution, along time shaft to select for training the video of CRF reference bits rate model 220 to carry out down-sampling, and with the half of original frame rate of the video Video coding to down-sampling. In this way, the version of original video and down-sampling thereof has the identical display time. CRF reference bits rate model 220 is trained to obtain the mean bit rate to video about each spatial resolution, for instance, fps=12.5 and fps=25, fps=15 and fps=30.
Training result shows that bit rate is almost linearly increasing along with encoding frame rate (fps), in other words:
Based on the linear relationship shown in equation (6), the relation between mean bit rate and frame rate can be described as follows:
Y=a × T, (7)
Wherein parameter a includes the impact from spatial resolution and CRF.
Fig. 7 illustrates the exemplary training result of the CRF reference bits rate model 220 with fixed frame rate (that is, fps=25). Training result shown in the figure 7 also shows that mean bit rate is the Approximate power function of spatial resolution when fixing CRF value and mean bit rate, and is the approximate exponential function of CRF when fixed space resolution. When frame rate is different from fps=25, it is possible to by factor fps/25 zoom model. One embodiment of training CRF reference bits rate model 220 is to use frame rate fps=25.
In order to explore in relation between mean bit rate and spatial resolution M described in equation (4), with the video training CRF reference bits rate model 220 to emulation/derive of the classification spatial resolution by the low-pass filtering of original video and down-sampling are obtained.Such as, low pass filter is applied to original video with spatial resolution 704x576 for anti-aliased by video encoder 210. Video encoder 210 to these video down-samplings to obtain the more low-definition version with size 352x288 and 176x144 of video. The more low-definition version of original 704x576 video and down-sampling thereof is encoded to determine relative to each CRF value relation between bit rate and spatial resolution by video encoder 210 by identical CRF value. Training result shows that the bit rate-spatial resolution broken line corresponding from different CRF values is close to parallel. Bit rate is advanced the speed and is gradually decreased together with the increase of spatial resolution when reducing CRF value. Train CRF reference bits rate model 220 further with the video with multiple spatial resolution, and training result shows the relation similar to the relation between bit rate, spatial resolution and CRF value of the video for emulating.
Based on training result, CRF reference bits rate model 220 is as follows to the relationship modeling between mean bit rate and spatial resolution:
Y=b × xc, (8)
It is wherein 0 < c < 1 for each CRF value. Function y=b × xcBy the initial point of coordinate system, it means that kernel resolution causes zero bit rate. 0 < c < 1 indicates the monotone increasing relation between bit rate and spatial resolution, and mean bit rate has less the advancing the speed than spatial resolution, because the video with more high spatial resolution has in more effective frame and inter prediction in estimation. In one embodiment, parameter c average out to 0.65 when to training sampling matching. From to the power function being used in described in equation (8), acquisition the mapping, modeling between mean bit rate and spatial resolution can be used for the parameter b of each CRF value.
CRF value can take floating point values. In one embodiment, CRF value is in being used for the scope [0,51] x.264CRF encoded. CRF=0 is used for lossless coding, and CRF=51 is used for the lossy compression method with minimum file size and minimum peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Use floating-point RF value to train CRF reference bits rate model 220, only change CRF value, and acquiescence fixes other coding parameter (such as frame rate) for encoding video into some object space and temporal resolution. Sampling CRF value 12,14 ... are used for encoding video into the PSNR of 28-55dB with 34 and have visually acceptable and gratifying compression quality.
Can described in below equation (9) under certain room and time resolution relation between Mean Speed and CRF:
Y=m × enx.(9)
In order to peer-to-peer (9) models, parameter m is arranged to 1380, and parameter n is arranged to-0.20. Error of fitting is assessed by SSE=540.3 and RMSE=7.351. Can be represented by below equation (10) at the mean bit rate B described in equation (4) and CRF relation (crf, M, T, B):
Assuming that through conventional default frame speed to Video coding, the equation (10) ignoring parameter T acquisition amendment is as follows:
B=f1(crf)×f2(M)=m × en·crf×Mc.(11)
Therefore, it is possible to use below equation (12) to obtain CRF from bit rate B:
Relative fitness error is assessed by the every spatial resolution of below equation:
Wherein:
M is spatial resolution,It is actual bit rate average for the CRF to the video with spatial resolution M, ΩMIt is the video collection with spatial resolution M, and | ΩM| it is ΩMRadix. ErRepresent relative error,Represent average actual bit rate, andRepresent the bit rate estimated according to equation (10).
III.Use the Video coding of the CRF bit rate model revised
Input video is encoded by the CRF in order to obtain with the CRF reference bits rate model 220 from training, can from the target bit rate deviation associated with input video from the actual bit rate that input video is encoded. Need the CRF bit rate model of the correction between CRF and actual bit rate with towards being used for the target bit rate adjustment actual bit rate to input video coding. In one embodiment, use the CRF bit rate model 410 revised to be adapted for the CRF value to input video coding based on the video transcoding module 400 of RDC. The CRF bit rate model 410 revised can use below equation (15) to be corrected:
B=k × f1(crf)×f2(M)=k × m × en·crf×Mc, (15)
Wherein k is and will be coded of the modifying factor that input video associates.
In order to illustrate correction further, the CRF bit rate model 410 of correction first passes through and comes from obtaining CRF the mapping between CRF and mean bit rate described in equation (12) with the target bit rate alternative parameter B associated with input video. It is used for determining that the modifying factor k of equation (15) is as follows to the gained actual bit rate of input video coding and corresponding CRF thereof (that is, actual bit rate, CRF):
Fig. 5 is for the Dynamic gene k of example video sequence, target bit rate Bt, actual bit rate BaExample data, wherein parameter M represents the spatial resolution of video sequence.
The CRF reference bits rate model 220 using training and the CRF bit rate model 410 revised, input video can be encoded by constant visual quality by the video transcoding module 400 based on RDC in the bitrate constraint associated with input video. Following algorithm represents the embodiment by constant visual quality, input video encoded in the bitrate constraint associated with input video.
// * inputs: unpressed video and target bit rate B thereoft
// * exports: have the video of the compression of constant visual quality in its target bit rate

Fig. 4 be input video is encoded into have in target bit rate constant visual quality output video flow chart. Initially, the video transcoding module 400 based on RDC receives 401 input videos, and input video has the target bit rate as bitrate constraint for input video is encoded. In one embodiment, the target bit rate of input video associates with the target output video format of input video. In another embodiment, the target bit rate revising input video is analyzed based on video presentation length (VDL) described below. Video transcoding module 400 finds the 403 constant rate of speed factors (such as, using equation (12) to replace mean bit rate parameter B with target bit rate) relative to the target bit rate of input video.Code conversion module 400 CRF obtained to input video coding 405 and obtains 407 actual bit rate for input video is encoded. Video transcoding module actual bit rate calculates 409 modifying factors (such as, using equation (15)) and finds the constant rate of speed factor of 411 amendments by modifying factor. Video transcoding module 400 encodes 413 with the constant rate of speed factor pair input video of amendment and determines that 415 carry out the actual bit rate of own coding 413 whether in the scope of target bit rate. In response to actual bit rate in the scope of target bit rate, video transcoding module 400 exports the video of 417 codings. Special not in the scope of target bit rate in response to actual ratio, video transcoding module 400 repetitive operation step 409 is to 417.
Towards the target bit rate associated with input video, input video being encoded, test result shows coding number of pass times average out to 1.8. If input video has the content complexity close with meansigma methods, then utilize the CRF value found by CRF reference bits rate model 220 once by CRF coding will towards target bit rate to Video coding. If input video has the content complexity from meansigma methods deviation, then need to utilize the Multiple through then out CRF coding of the CRF value found by the CRF bit rate model 410 revised adaptively.
IV.Coding calculates profile (ECP)
Variable content in the scene caught by video sequence causes the information of the various quantity comprised in the video sequence. The Large video complete or collected works of given video trusteeship service, are applied to different video content by identical coding bit rate and cause different video quality. It addition, video trusteeship service 100 is service the 100 each video supply various video output formats uploaded to video supply. Different output formats have different video in target playback platform (such as, mobile phone and fine definition electromotive force), delivery constraint (such as, real-time video streaming and order video) and user's contemplated aspects and process target.
The solution that a kind of video to having various video format and content complexity carries out code conversion is that different bit rates control strategy is applied to different video. In one embodiment, the video output formats that the video coding system 102 based on RDC is given selects at least one Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy and the coding parameter in three different bit rates control strategies and coding parameter:
Control _ bit rate,
Control _ quality,
Control _ quality _ bounded _ bit rate.
Control _ bit rate strategy be realize with the target bit rate of video as close possible to the actual bit rate to Video coding. This Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy is suitable for mobile video streaming and the video flowing transmission using dialup Internet to connect.
Control _ quality policy be realize constant target visual quality regardless of whether the bit rate realizing it and needing how. For the control _ quality policy of Video coding being faced variable actual bit rate by variable complexity, for instance, for the high bit rate to complicated Video coding and the low bit rate for simple video. This Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy is suitable for the Video processing in distributed video processing environment and streaming and changes (such as, lossless coding quality) for high visual coding QCS-code.
Control _ quality _ bounded _ bit rate strategy is to realize constant target visual quality as far as possible and maintain the upper bound of bit rate. Therefore, it is allowed to visual quality is down to below aimed quality rank only for complicated video, wherein this quality can not realize in the Maximum Bit Rate constraint of distribution.For simpler video, as long as achieving desired aimed quality rank, bit rate just can lower than this Maximum Bit Rate.
In order to improve video code conversion performance further, based on RDC video coding system 102 for use given Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy code converter support rating calculation rank. Specifically, for Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy (such as, control _ quality _ bounded _ bit rate strategy), it is possible to such as there are five different codings supported by the video coding system 102 based on RDC to calculate rank:
The fastest: the fastest transcode time to be provided, but the compactest output bit flow or the highest visual quality may not be produced for identical bit. For most of Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategies and output format, carry out once by encoding.
Quick: reasonable fast coding is provided. For most of Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategies and output format, carry out once by encoding.
Medium: trading off of the scramble time comparison code efficiency being suitable for most of Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy and output format is provided.
At a slow speed: use the higher coding tools assessed the cost to produce the video of code conversion with more high coding efficiency (that is, at the higher visual quality of identical bit). Such as, video coder-decoder x.264 arrange compression efficiency control parameter " preset=slower " or " presetting=placebo " with high visual quality to Video coding.
The slowest: to use the high coding tools with complexity of calculation requirement to produce the compactest output bit flow and the highest perceived quality video, such as film workshop quality video. When in PSNR measured time, the visual quality calculating rank at this coding can equal to or less than the visual quality that realized by slow speed mode.
The multiple codings that can be used for code converter have been had to calculate rank, various code switching strategy is implemented to calculate rank according to factor (current system load on the such as server in network (such as, system for cloud computing), for the demand of live stream transmission or admissible code transfer delay) adaptive coding based on the video coding system 102 of RDC. For example, it is possible to carry out the conversion of multiple initial flow transmission code to reduce the time delay for live video streaming in low calculating rank. On the other hand, it is possible to carry out video flowing transmission by the higher calculating rank with acceptable time delay and rerun, wherein reruning is that the popularity of the increase to video responds.
In order to optimize various Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy and support to encode for the grade of each Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy to calculate rank, video coding system 102 based on RDC follows systematic procedure, this systematic procedure not only assesses the mode of multiple enforcement different bit rates control strategy, but also considers to distribute for the Optimal calculation of each Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy. In one embodiment, coding is trained to calculate profile (ECP) mapping block 230 to model computational efficiency is compromise according to fine granularity mode based on the video coding system 102 of RDC.
EPC is that the computational complexity distribution can being easily integrated in x.264 coding controls parameter. ECP parameter is taken at the floating point values between 0 and 1 and can be used to fine setting trading off between bit rate, distortion and computational complexity. Existing Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy focuses on trading off between the speed and distortion of Video coding. But, when coding calculates the criterion being considered for assessing code efficiency, it is necessary to adjust trading off between speed and distortion together with the calculating with coding.
Such as, in passing twice through encoding scheme, generally pass through by carrying out first time coding quickly than second time coding, because first time coding is by being used for obtaining some statistical information of video.The whole general ratio that consumes of coding that passes twice through once passes through the calculating that encoding scheme is higher. But, it is not clear that than what have less computational complexity, whether what have high computational complexity once passes twice through that code efficiency is higher or efficiency is lower by encoding. ECP mapping block 230 based on the video coding system 102 of RDC is designed to find for changing the Optimal calculation distribution of (such as, changing based on Multiple through then out code x.264) based on multipass video code and calculating the coding number of pass times of rank for given coding.
Turning now to Fig. 2, the ECP mapping block 230 to the video training RDC training module 200 being stored in video complete or collected works 160. For each coding strategy, it is likely to implementation for the difference changed for Multiple through then out code and difference is likely to calculate rank training ECP mapping block 230 to obtain original rate-distortion-complexity data. Such as, use to original rate, distortion, complexity data many criterions Pareto-type claim-size set analysis optimize further ECP mapping block 230 with derive multiple equidistant from distance coding calculate rank for each Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy optimum code change implementation and calculate distribution (such as, in one embodiment, it is possible to have five codings to calculate ranks: the fastest, quick, medium, calculate rank at a slow speed and the most slowly).
Taking Multiple through then out x.264 code to change exemplarily, ECP mapping block 230 is by { ecp0, ecp1Represent the calculating distribution for passing twice through coding. ecp0Represent once by bit rate coding or pass twice through the computational complexity that the first time of bit rate coding passes through. ecp1Represent and pass twice through the computational complexity that the second time of bit rate coding is passed through. Such as, { 0.07, NULL} represents once by the computational complexity of bit rate coding implementation, and { 0.07,0.71} is the example calculations complexity passing twice through bit rate coding implementation.
For each Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy, to the video collection off-line training ECP mapping block 230 from video complete or collected works 160. Each training sampling and rate-distortion-complexity performance, { R, D, C} tlv triple associates, wherein from training, obtain actual coding bit rate (R), distortion (D) is measured by the mean square error (MSE) of the luminance component of frame of video, and complexity (C) was represented by every frame scramble time. The following is for use multiple pass past x.264 transcoding scheme for the algorithm of control _ bit rate Bit-Rate Control Algorithm Strategies Training EPC mapping block 230:
1: with all possible { ecp0, ecp1Use control _ bit rate strategy that training video is encoded to different target bit rate;
2: from training, obtain { R, D, C} performance sampling;
3: for training video for each { ecp0, ecp1To distortion D and time C smoothly interpolation is calculated to for speed R;
4: find R, D, C} sampling among Pareto-type claim-size set and to Pareto interpolation to obtain zonal cooling { R, D, C} surface;
5: calculating time C is divided into 5 evenly spaced continuous ranks;
6: select rate value and in the bit-rates values selected, { ecp selected on Pareto-type claim-size surface for five each calculating ranks calculated in rank0, ecp1;
7: verified the strategy effectiveness to video of optimization by regression test.
Illustrate the calculating distribution for five optimizations calculating rank utilizing control _ Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy in table 1 below:
Table 1: utilize x.264 for controlling _ the ECP parameter of Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy
Calculate rank | ecp0 | ecp1 |
The fastest | 0.14 | Null value |
Quickly | 0.35 | Null value |
Medium | 0.07 | 0.50 |
At a slow speed | 0.07 | 0.71 |
The slowest | 0.42 | 0.71 |
As shown in table 1, for each calculating rank, ECP mapping block 230 provides a pair ECP value { ecp0, ecp1, ECP value instruction coding number of pass times and the distribution of required computational complexity are controlled parameter value by this.Such as, for using control _ Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy Video coding to having medium computational complexity, twice coding is traded off by the rate-distortion-complexity that can be used to realize optimizing, and passes through for first time coding, ECP value is 0.07, and for second time coding by for 0.50. In order to the Video coding for real-time streaming transport, the scramble time need quickly and without unacceptable delay. Video coding system 102 based on RDC can select have the once compromise by encoding with balancing speed-distortion-complexity of ECP value 0.35.
In another embodiment, another Video Coding Scheme VP8 (being also referred to as WebM) is used to train ECP mapping block 230. Replace and use coding to calculate profiling parameters (that is, ecp0、ecp1), VP8 uses coding rate to control (ES) parameter with management trading off between speed, distortion and computational complexity. Table 2 illustrates the examples for five calculating distribution calculating rank using VP8 encoding scheme, utilizing control _ Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy:

At a slow speed | 220 | 218 |
The slowest | 218 | 216 |
To the video from video complete or collected works 160, ECP mapping block 230 is similarly trained for other Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy (such as control _ quality policy and control _ quality _ bounded _ bit rate strategy). Table 3 illustrates and utilizes the x.264 calculating distribution of the optimizations for five calculating ranks of encoding scheme, utilization control _ Quality Control Strategy and the corresponding calculating for VP8 encoding scheme to distribute. In order to realize constant target quality, ECP mapping block 230 is changed to the video code based on RDC and is only advised once by encoding. Table 4 illustrates and utilizes the x.264 calculating distribution of the optimizations for five calculating ranks of encoding scheme, utilization control _ quality _ bounded _ Bit-Rate Control Algorithm strategy and the corresponding calculating for VP8 encoding scheme to distribute.

Fig. 6 is the flow chart that off-line training EPC mapping block 230 optimizes for rate-distortion complexity. Initially, RDC training module 200 receives 610 videos from video complete or collected works 160. The video encoder 210 of RDC training module 200 is to the collective encoding 620 of the video of selection and obtains 630{R, D, C} sampling from training. EPC mapping block 230 { finds 640 optimum { R, D, C} samplings from what obtain in R, D, C} sampling. Such as, ECP mapping block 230 find R, D, C} sampling among Pareto-type claim-size set and to Pareto interpolation to obtain zonal cooling { R, D, C} surface. By optimum, { R, D, C} sample space divides 650 one-tenth multiple computational complexity ranks (such as, five described above calculate rank) to ECP mapping block 230. ECP mapping block 230 selects 660 for the RDC optimum code strategy (such as, control _ quality _ bounded _ bit rate strategy) of each calculating rank and to obtain 670 for the ECP parameter of each calculating rank and coding number of pass times.
Video coding system 102 based on RDC can optimize Multiple through then out coding efficiency by the coding parameter passed through by adjusting next code based on previous coding. Such as, passing twice through in encoding scheme for what input video was encoded, video coding system 102 based on RDC can encode, based on encoding for the first time coding parameter (such as, bit rate, method for estimating and the motion vector search ranges) adaptation passed through, the coding parameter passed through for the second time.If encoding the actual bit rate passed through for the first time less than the mean bit rate encoded by identical ECP value, then it instruction input video have more simpler video content than average video, it is possible to reduce second time coding by ECP value with save for input video encode calculating and keep identical rate-distortion performance. If encoding the actual bit rate passed through for the first time more than the mean bit rate encoded by identical ECP value, then can increase and encode the ECP value passed through for the second time to realize the more rate-distortion performance gains for input video is encoded.
V.Encode by video presentation length (VDL)
With acceptable visual quality, source video is carried out code conversion in minimum cost and need the Video coding complexity of assessment source video effectively. Ignore the impact on transcoded video of the video content complexity and reduce visual quality and the Consumer's Experience of the video that code is changed. About needing how many bit rates to optimize useful to the information of Video coding for video coding efficiency at certain visual quality, because for the video content complexity of the bitrate information reflection source video to input video coding.
In one embodiment, use video presentation length to represent the video content complexity of video based on the video coding system 102 of RDC. VDL is bit rate Video coding needed at certain visual quality. Different video has different VDL. The video with microinching and smoothed image has short VDL, but this instruction video is prone to encode with the high visual quality of little bit rate. On the other hand, the video with dense motion and complex text content has long VDL, and this instruction video is difficult to encode.
Video presentation length is useful for many application (such as adaptive video coding and decoding). Changing for video code, VDL guides the video transcoder based on RDC to select target bit rate or target constant rate factor so that video to be encoded into its output video format efficiently. Based on RDC video transcoder can by the complexity of input video and reference video they associate VDL in compare, and the existing reasonable coding parameter of reference video by reference determines the appropriate coding parameter for input video.
The VDL information of video can have at least three form:
Total VDL,
Time VDL, and
SPACE V DL.
Total VDL is the video actual bit rate when it being encoded with ' CRF=26, complexity=the fastest '. CRF value is configurable parameter, and experimental data show video with CRF encode, with CRF=26 to Video coding time have good visual quality.
Time VDL is the difference of the video actual bit rate when it is encoded by it by two different complexity (such as, ' CRF=26, complexity=quick ' and ' CRF=26, complexity=the fastest '). The time complexity of the time VDL reflecting video of video. There is the video of different time complexity differ mainly from and process the motion being detected in video how soon. The motion detected how soon processed in video is depended on one or more factor, such as the method for estimating of estimation and reference frame number. One embodiment of express time VDL is to use video when the bit rate variance when different complexity level are to Video coding.
SPACE V DL is the difference of the video actual bit rate when it is encoded by it with two different CRF (such as, ' CRF=26, complexity=the fastest ' and ' CRF=28, complexity=the fastest ').It is said that in general, the complexity of the residual value signal complexity reflecting video frame predicted by motion estimation algorithm, and the quantization that the conversion coefficient experience of residual value signal is represented by CRF value. Therefore, but affect with the few time factor of bit rate subtractive of the video of the different identical complexity grade encodings of CRF value, and the space complexity of reflecting video. The video with greater room VDL has more complicated space content in video.
Total VDL of video, time VDL and SPACE V DL can be used to guide the video code based on RDC to change. For example, referring to Fig. 4, the video presentation length modules 420 based on the video transcoding module 400 of RDC obtains total VDL of input video, time VDL and SPACE V DL from input video is encoded. The VDL data of the acquisition of input video are stored in dynamic VDL data base as the reference VDL for input video. Such as, video presentation length modules 420 maintains for the dynamic reference table of total VDL, wherein each table clause storage mark of input video, total VDL of input video, the temporal resolution of input video and spatial resolution. After video is carried out code conversion, video presentation length modules 420 deletes the VDL reference of input video. Video presentation length modules 420 similarly maintains the dynamic reference table for time VDL and SPACE V DL respectively. The total VDL obtained for a video output formats of input video can be used to guide the coding for other video output formats of input video. The time obtained for a video output formats of input video and SPACE V DL can be similarly used for other video output formats of input video.
In another embodiment, static VDL reference table is generated based on the video coding system 102 of RDC based on the total VDL of the video that VDL data are video complete or collected works 160, the time VDL that are stored in dynamic VDL reference table and SPACE V DL. Such as, the static VDL reference table for total VDL is used for each average total VDL data being individually entered data for the temporal resolution storage selected, and another static VDL reference table is used for total VDL for the spatial resolution selected. Can similarly generate the static VDL reference table for time VDL and SPACE V DL of the temporal resolution for selecting or spatial resolution. Static VDL reference table can be updated whenever generating or update the record in dynamic VDL reference table.
For given input video, video presentation length modules 420 calculates total VDL of input video, time VDL and SPACE V DL as described above and communicates for rate-distortion complexity optimization with the code converter 430 based on RDC. Such as, in response to total VDL of input video less than the target bit rate of input video, video presentation length modules 420 arranges total VDL of input video as target bit rate. Total VDL target bit rate help acquisition good visual quality as input video is set. In response to the SPACE V DL of input video more than the SPACE V DL of reference video, video presentation length modules 420 instruction increases the complexity level (such as, from such as " medium ", complexity level being changed over " quickly ") of the coding about spatial manipulation based on the code converter 430 of RDC. Similarly, video presentation length modules 420 instruction adjusts the complexity level of coding based on the code converter 430 of RDC based on the comparison between the time VDL and the time VDL of reference video of input video about the time-triggered protocol of input video.
Fig. 3 further illustrates the VDL described above video code guided conversion. Initially, receive 310 input videos based on the video transcoding module 400 of RDC and via the CRF bit rate model 410 revised, input video encoded. Video presentation length modules 420 obtains total VDL of 320 input videos, time VDL and SPACE V DL. Video presentation length modules 420 obtains the VDL information of input video or calculates the VDL information of input video voluntarily from the coding of the CRF bit rate model 420 revised.
Video presentation length modules 420 compares total VDL of 330 input videos and the target bit rate of input video and the target bit rate (such as, arranging total VDL target bit rate as input video of input video in response to total VDL less than target bit rate) adjusting 340 input videos based on the comparison. Video presentation length modules 420 compares the time VDL and reference time VDL of 350 input videos and compares based on this and adjust 360 Video coding complexity in time. Video presentation length modules 420 compares the SPACE V DL of 370 input videos and with reference to SPACE V DL and compare based on this and spatially adjust 380 Video coding complexity. Input video is encoded 390 by the target bit rate adjusted, time encoding complexity and space encoding complexity by code converter 430 based on RDC as shown in Figure 4. Target bit rate, time or the instruction of space encoding complexity adjusted needs different ECP value and coding number of pass times to reflect that target bit rate and codec complexity update.
