- the ranking system may determine that the Carly's sensor data satisfies the triggering criteria. For example, assume that Carly is currently 50 meters from Regal Cinema which is showing the Action League movie, which satisfies the criterion that the user be within 100 meters of a theater showing the Action League movie. Further assume that the movie starts in 8 minutes, which satisfies the criterion that the current time be within 60 minutes of the movie start time. Based on Carly's sensor data, Carly is moving at 0.8 KPH, which satisfies the criterion that the user be moving less than 5 KPH.
- the ranking system applies the sensor data to the triggering criteria for the relevant microsites in the index to generate index scores for the relevant microsites. For example, the ranking system may compare the sensor data to the triggering criteria, for each of the relevant microsites, to generate the index scores.

- ranked list 4450 includes the workout microsite as the top ranking microsite, followed by the bus stops microsite, the coffee microsite, the restaurant microsite, and the banks microsite.
- ranking system 3820 may provide ranked list 4450 to Mary's watch.
- ranking system 3820 may provide other information, as discussed above, such as a list of sensors for each microsite identified in ranked list 4450 .
- Mary's watch may receive ranked list 4450 and send a request for one or more of the microsites in ranked list 4450 . Since the workout microsite is the highest ranking microsite in ranked list 4450 , Mary's watch may cause the workout microsite to be rendered for display prior to the other microsites in ranked list 4450 . Thus, since Mary paid for the workout microsite, the workout microsite may be given priority over other microsites, including higher scoring microsites.

- the signal based recommender system 4502 includes data processing apparatus e.g., handheld devices, rack-mounted servers, or other computing devices.
- the data processing apparatus within the signal based recommender system 4502 can be in the same physical location (e.g., data center) or can be in different physical locations.
- the data processing apparatus and user devices communicatively coupled to the signal based recommender system 4502 can have different capabilities and computer architectures.
- the user device 4508 is a personal computer, a laptop computer, a watch, a tablet computer, or a mobile device.
- the signal based recommender system 4502 can use crowd-sourced content segments to identify user intentions.
- the signal based recommender system 4502 can obtain crowd-sourced (e.g., sent by many users) content and other information (e.g., location) from public sites.
- Public sites are sites that can be accessed at least in part without requiring a login. For example, public sites contain publicly available content.
- One or more user devices e.g., a user device 4508
- the signal based recommender system 4502 can provide one or more search results that can predict what a user might intend to search given a location and previously obtained content segments around the user's location.
- a classifier 4504 resides within the signal based recommender system 4502 . In some other implementations, the classifier 4504 resides on a data processing apparatus separate from the signal based recommender system 4502 . The classifier 4504 can classify content segments into categories. The use of categories can aid a search system in increasing relevancy of its search results.
- a search system 4505 resides within the signal based recommender system 4502 . In some other implementations, the search system 4505 resides on a data processing apparatus separate from the signal based recommender system 4502 . The search system 4505 can perform searches on relevant content segments to obtain a search result.
- the signal based recommender system 4502 can also communicate with a database 4506 .
- the database 4506 is an electronic file system, a distributed file system, or other network-accessible persistent storage that can store information on computer-readable storage media.
- the database 4506 is a database of intentions.
- the database of intentions includes data representing a general intention of users who perform mobile searches or access social media content, which can be data obtained from social networks. For example, if a user enters “gourmet restaurants” as a mobile search query, the system determines that the user intends to find information about gourmet restaurants.
- FIG. 46 is a flowchart of an example method 4600 of the signal based recommender system to identify user intentions. For convenience, the method 4600 will be described with respect to a system having one or more computing devices that performs the method 4600 .
- the system obtains content segments from various sources 4602 .
- the system can retrieve numerous content segments from multiple sources.
- content segments are “crowd-sourced” such that the content segments correspond to information that is entered by many users.
- potential sources of crowd-sourced content segments include social network feeds and posts to social sites or blogs.
- Sources of content segments can also include mobile search queries entered by a group of users.
- the system can aggregate the content segments and process them.
- the initial processing can include one or more of spam removal, clustering, high frequency, and local relevance.
- the content segment is entered into a database of intentions.
- the system can filter the content segments according to a classification algorithm trained to filter spam information 4604 .
- Spam information can be unwanted or unsolicited information that is marketing a product or service (e.g., pornography). Spam information can also include high frequency terms that lead to high trafficked sites, e.g., a search engine destination page or a social network page.
- the system can filter out spam information by detecting spam-like keywords. For example, search queries associated with pornography can be filtered out.
- the classification algorithm can be implemented, for example, using a classifier (e.g., classifier 4504 within the signal based recommender system 4502 or a separate classifier from the signal based recommender system 4502 ).
- the system clusters the content segments 4606 .
- the system clusters the content segments to aggregate content segments with small typographical differences. For example, if text of one content segment is “gourmet restaurant” while text of another content segment has ‘restaurant’ misspelled, e.g., “gourmet restaurants,” the aggregation of the two content segments can result in one content segment of “gourmet restaurant.”
- the system can also cluster content segments to remove duplicates. For example, if text of two unique content segments both contain “gourmet restaurant,” the aggregation of the two content segments can result in one content segment of “gourmet restaurant.” This filtering allows the system to remove repeated entries of content segments.
- the system keeps track of each content segment's aggregation frequency and considers the aggregation frequency as a factor in determining a popularity metric as will be described below.
- the server uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to cluster the content segments.
- HAC hierarchical agglomerative clustering
- the clustered content segments can be filtered according to a frequency threshold 4608 .
- the system implements the frequency threshold to remove rarely occurring content segments. If a content segment does not appear enough to meet the frequency threshold, the system determines that the content segment is not relevant enough to present to users.
- the frequency threshold is a specified value indicating a frequency of occurrence of the content segment (e.g., the content segment must appear at least 50 times).
- the frequency threshold is dynamically adjusted by the system based on one or more criteria (e.g., the number of received total content segments, or the number of received content segments over a specified time).
- the content segments are filtered by a local relevance score 4610 .
- a local relevance score can be based on one or more signals of a content segment. In some implementations, these signals include location, time, aggregation frequency of the content segment, current events, or other information. For example, the system may give a higher local relevance score to a content segment about a highly-searched event near a location at a certain time. Also, mobile searches can be given a higher local relevance score because mobile searches can include metadata about a location and a timestamp at which the search occurred. In some implementations, if the local relevance score is low, the system discards the content segment.
- the system classifies the remaining content segments into categories 4612 .
- the categories can be locally relevant. For example, categories include places, movies, shopping items, health, or weather.
- the system uses a classifier to group content segments into categories.
- the system assigns each content segment a popularity metric 4614 .
- the popularity metric indicates a level of a content segment's appearance frequency. In some implementations, the popularity metric is based on the number of search queries that include the content segment. In some implementations, the popularity metric is based on one or more parameters that indicate a number of “reposts” on social media channels (e.g., social feeds, social sites).
- a repost can be a content segment that has previously been posted on a social media website. For example, if a content segment is a mobile search query about a popular event and the mobile search query has metadata including a timestamp, the content segment may be given a higher score if the current time at the location is close to the timestamp embedded in the mobile query search.
- a content segment may be given a higher score if the movie is a new movie that has just been released. If a content segment is about a sale at a department store and the content segment includes an end date of the sale, the content segment may be given a higher score if the sale is ending shortly and reassigned a lower score after the sale ends.
- the system assigns a social graph distance that measures how relevant the content segment is to a user.
- the system if the content segment is a mobile search query, the system also filters out the mobile search query's “long tail,” meaning the system removes terms from the query if the query is over a specified length. For example, if text of the query is “gourmet restaurants in san jose having a bar,” the system can remove the “long tail” and convert the content segment into “gourmet restaurants.”
- the system After assigning each content segment a popularity metric, the system stores the content segments 4616 .
- the system can input each content segment along with one or more associated parameters into the database of intentions.
- the one or more associated parameters can be generated by the system, e.g., the popularity metric can be generated as described above.
- Signals associated with the content segment can also be stored as associated parameters.
- the content segment is a mobile search query
- signals associated with the content segment can include items of mobile search query metadata.
- the mobile search query metadata can be obtained from search query logs.
- the system can obtain mobile search query metadata, along with other signals, from data that is sent from one or more mobile devices.
- signals associated with the content segment can include items of metadata otherwise associated with the content segment.
- a row in a table of the database of intentions about a mobile search query includes a unique identification number, a date, an hour, a latitude and longitude geolocation, text of the content segment, a category, a query count indicating a number of times the content segment has been queried, and a popularity metric. In some implementations, if two content segments are determined to be duplicates, the content segment having the higher popularity metric is stored.
- An example row within a database of intentions is shown below:
- a row in the table of intentions is expanded to include a variety of signals based on sensors of a mobile device of a user.
- other signals can include the acceleration of the mobile device, or whether the mobile device is geographically near a friend of the user.
- FIG. 47 is a flowchart of an example method 4700 of providing a search result to a user. For convenience, the method 4700 will be described with respect to a system having one or more computing devices that performs the method 4700 .
- the system receives a query 4702 .
- the query can be received from a user device, for example, a computer, a laptop, a tablet, a watch, or a mobile phone.
- the user device can submit the query, for example, to obtain a relevant entry from the database of intentions.
- the user provides an input to the user device, which in turn causes the user device to send the query to the server.
- the user does not provide any input to the user device, but the user device periodically sends requests to the system. For example, the user device can request a response from the server according to a fixed schedule or a location of the user device.
- the user device can also request a response from the server based on content segment activity around the user device's location (e.g., many content segments are added to the database of intentions near a location at a specific time).
- the submission of the query can also be triggered by different events, such as a wake-up from a user device's sleep mode.
- the query can contain information specific to the user device. For example, the query can contain location, time, user data, or prior search query data of the user device.
- the system identifies a location of interest 4704 from a database of intentions (e.g., a database of intentions described above with respect to FIG. 46 ) that is near the user device's location.
- a database of intentions e.g., a database of intentions described above with respect to FIG. 46
- the location of interest is a city.
- the location of interest includes all locations within a specified radius around the user device's location. The radius can be fixed or dynamically adjusted by the system.
- the system determines a relevant entry 4706 by identifying entries from the database of intentions that match the location of interest and selecting one entry that is near the identified location of interest based on one or more factors discussed below. If the location of interest is a city, the system can determine a relevant entry that relates to the city, similarly for a neighborhood within a city. In some implementations, the system considers a popularity metric for each content segment. If the content segment is a mobile search query, the system considers the number of times the mobile search query has been queried. If the content segment is a social media post, the system can consider the number of times the social media post is reposted. The system can also consider one or more parameters that indicate a user's preferences. For example, if a user has specified that the user wants a search result related to restaurants, the system can determine a relevant entry from restaurants in the database of intentions.
- the system also considers the location, date, and/or time associated with the user device when processing the query. For example, if a user device sends a query at 12 AM on a Friday and the user device is located outside a bar, the system can consider the time, date, location, user preferences, and popularity metric. If many users are searching for “taxi cabs” at the time, date, and location (e.g., using mobile search queries), a content segment about taxi cabs may have a high popularity metric. If the content segment has the highest popularity metric compared to other content segments, the system can select the content segment about “taxi cabs” as the most relevant entry.
- the system filters out content segments that include generic information less likely to be searched by a user. For example, if the content segment is about a city or country, the system can serve the next relevant result because the user presumably is not seeking information regarding the city or country in which he or she is located.
- the system After selecting the relevant entry, the system performs a local search (e.g., a search that has a restriction based on location) that includes the entry's content segment 4708 .
- a local search e.g., a search that has a restriction based on location
- the system queries a service for further details about the content segment. For example, if the content segment is in the place category, the system queries a places Application Program Interface (API) for more information regarding the place.
- Information from the places API can include the content segment's address, location, reviews, telephone number, operating hours, or other local information.
- the server may also search using other local API's.
- the system can also perform a local search on the relevant entry by using a search mechanism related to the category from the content segment's row in the database of intentions. For example, if the user were to have submitted a query when the user is near a latitude and longitude of (34.0522, ⁇ 118.2437) at hour 20 on a day similar to 07/19 (see table above), the system can determine “gourmet restaurant” as the relevant entry and run a “places” search for “gourmet restaurant” centered near the user device's coordinates using a search system within the signal based recommender system, or by submitting a search to a search system.
- a search mechanism related to the category from the content segment's row in the database of intentions. For example, if the user were to have submitted a query when the user is near a latitude and longitude of (34.0522, ⁇ 118.2437) at hour 20 on a day similar to 07/19 (see table above), the system can determine “gourmet restaurant” as the relevant entry and run a
- the system After performing the local search, the system obtains one or more responsive search results.
- the system selects a search result from the search results. In some implementations, the system selects a specific search result by choosing the top-ranked search result.
- the system sends the relevant entry to a search engine.
- the search engine can show the relevant entry as a search suggestion, e.g., the suggestion can be shown near or in a search field.
- the system provides information about the selected search result to the user device 4710 .
- the system obtains the information from local API's. For example, if the system searches for “gourmet restaurant,” the system can obtain multiple responsive local search results from an API including information about local businesses. If the selected search result is of a gourmet restaurant called “Country Gourmet Restaurants,” the system can obtain the name, address, phone number, and average reviews of Country Gourmet Restaurant (e.g., from the API) and send the information to the user device.

Abstract
A server device is configured to receive criteria that indicate when a microsite is to be provided to a user device. The user device is configured to obtain sensor data and user profile data and send the sensor data and the user profile data to the server device. The server device is configured to receive the sensor data and the user profile data, identify a relevant microsite, and provide information regarding the relevant microsite to the user device. In some cases, the service device is configured to identify that a particular microsite has been purchased by a user of the user device and provide information, to the user device, identifying that the particular microsite has been purchased.
Description

According to some possible implementations, the instructions may further include one or more instructions to receive, from the user device, criteria for the particular microsite, where the received criteria dictate when the particular microsite is to be provided to the user device. One or more instructions, of the group of instructions, to identify the group of microsites may include one or more instructions to compare the sensor data to the received criteria.

According to some possible implementations, the group of sources may include search queries or public data feeds.
According to some possible implementations, the processor, when obtaining the collection of content segments from the group of sources, may cluster content segments from the group of sources using a clustering mechanism, where the clustering mechanism may aggregate the content segments to remove content segments that are duplicates or have less than a threshold quantity of typographical differences.
According to some possible implementations, the processor, when obtaining the collection of content segments from the group of sources, may remove spam content from the content segments.
According to some possible implementations, the processor may be further configured to determine, based on selecting a content segment from a collection of content segments, that the content segment satisfies a local relevance score, where the local relevance score may represent how relevant the content segment is to local information.
According to some possible implementations, the selected search result may correspond to a business, and the information may identify operating hours of the business, a geographic location of the business, reviews of the business, or a name of the business.

The above discussion mentions examples in which some implementations may be implemented via one or more methods performed by one or more processors of one or more devices. In some implementations, one or more systems and/or one or more devices may be configured to perform one or more of the acts mentioned above.

The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate one or more implementations described herein and, together with the description, explain these implementations. In the drawings:
The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.
In the description to follow, various examples of systems and methods relating to the presentation of microsites will be described. A microsite may be broadly defined as a mini-web page that may be presented based on a network address, such as a uniform resource locator (URL) or a uniform resource identifier (URI), associated with the microsite. As used herein, a microsite includes an amount of content that can be presented in a user-discernible format on a display of a watch or in a display area the size of the display of a watch. In some implementations, a microsite is configured to display less than 100, 50, or 20 words to a user at a time, and/or less than 1000, 500, or 300 characters. In some implementations, a microsite includes content, such as embedded instructions (e.g., Javascript), data, image information, or metadata.
While the descriptions, herein, are described in terms of presenting information regarding microsites, the description may also apply to presenting documents. A document, as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a microsite, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news article, a blog, a discussion group forum, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript.
For the described systems and methods, the users can control whether the programs or features collect user personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, actions, activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or the extent such information is collected or used. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before the data is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed, encrypted, and/or otherwise protected for the user. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a server.
While the descriptions of the examples are presented separately from each other, the descriptions are interchangeable and combinable in various ways. Thus, some or all of one example may be combined with some or all of one or more other examples.
A system and/or method, as described herein, may allow a creator of a microsite to specify criteria that dictates when the microsite is to be presented—e.g., pushed—to a user device. A ranking system may associate the specified criteria with information identifying the microsite in, for example, an index. The ranking system may subsequently receive sensor data from a user device. If the sensor data matches the specified criteria, the ranking system may identify the microsite as a candidate in determining which microsite content is to be presented to the user device. The microsite content may include information that may be useful to the user.
With reference to FIG. 1B , assume that a user, named Mary, is associated with a user device (shown as a watch in FIG. 1B ) that is capable of receiving microsite content. Assume that Mary's watch periodically sends sensor data to the ranking system and that the sensor data includes information identifying a current time, information identifying a current geographic location of the watch, information identifying a speed at which the watch is currently moving (e.g., based on global positioning satellite (GPS) data), and/or other information. In the example of FIG. 1B , assume that Mary's watch sends, over a first period of time, first sensor data. Based on the first sensor data, assume that the ranking system determines that the current time at the geographic location of Mary's watch is 8:10 AM, that Mary's watch has been moving at a speed of greater than 7 km/hr for more than 4 minutes, and that the geographic location of Mary's watch is not within 10 meters of a bus stop. The ranking system may determine that the sensor data, from Mary's watch, satisfies the triggering criteria of the workout microsite. As a result, the ranking system may cause the workout microsite to be presented to Mary's watch, as illustrated in FIG. 1B .
With reference to FIG. 1C , assume that Mary's watch sends, over a second period of time, second sensor data. Based on the second sensor data, assume that the ranking system determines that the current time at the geographic location of Mary's watch is 8:30 AM, and that Mary's watch has been moving at a speed of greater than 7 km/hr for more than 4 minutes. In the example of FIG. 1C , however, assume that the ranking system determines that the geographic location of Mary's watch is within 10 meters of a bus stop. The ranking system may determine, as a result of the geographic location of Mary's watch being within 10 meters of a bus stop, that the sensor data, from Mary's watch, does not satisfy the criteria of the workout microsite. As a result, the ranking system may not cause the workout microsite to be presented to Mary's watch, as illustrated in FIG. 1C . In those situations where the ranking system does not identify any other microsites as relevant to the second sensor data, Mary's watch may, for example, simply display a clock.
While ranking system 230 is shown as separate from servers 240, it may be possible for ranking system 230 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by a server 240 and/or a server 240 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 230. For example, ranking system 230 may host some or all of the microsites. Additionally, or alternatively, a user device 210 may host some of the microsites and/or perform one or more of the functions of ranking system 230.
Although FIG. 2 shows example components of environment 200, in some implementations, environment 200 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, or differently arranged components than those depicted in FIG. 2 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components of environment 200 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment 200.
In some implementations, input component 310 may identify microsites via manual input. For example, input component 310 may provide a user interface via which microsite creators may provide information regarding microsites that the microsite creators have created. In some implementations, a microsite creator, via the user interface, may identify a network address, such as a URL or a URI, associated with a microsite. Additionally, or alternatively, the microsite creator, via the user interface, may upload the content of the microsite. The content of the microsite may be hosted by ranking system 230 or a device separate from ranking system 230, such as a server 240.
The location category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a geographic location of a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the location category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when a user device 210 is or is not at a particular geographic location. Additionally, or alternatively, a criterion under the location category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when a user device 210 is or is not within a certain distance of a geographic location. The geographic location may be specified, for example, as a particular geographic address, a particular set of geographic coordinates, a particular type of location, and/or in another manner. A type of location may be expressed generally, such as, for example, a bus stop, an airport, a gas station, a restaurant, etc., or more specifically, such as, for example, a particular type of restaurant or a particular restaurant, a particular country, state, city, or town, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the location category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data, from a user device 210, indicates that user device 210 is within a park. As another example, a location criterion may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that user device 210 is not within 10 meters of a bus stop.
The time category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a time or time range. As one example, a criterion under the time category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when the current time, at the geographic location of a user device 210, is or is not at a particular time, or is or is not within a particular time range. A time range may be expressed specifically, for example, using a start time and an end time, or more generally as, for example, day time, nighttime, morning, afternoon, evening, dinner time, lunch time, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the time category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that the current time, at the geographic location of user device 210, is not within a time range of 11 PM and 4 AM.
The motion category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a motion of a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the motion category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not being moved in a particular motion. Examples of motions may include walking, running, driving in a car, riding on a train, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the motion category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that a user, of user device 210, is running.
The transport mode category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a transport mode being used by a user of a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the transport mode category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not currently being moved by a particular transport mode. Examples of transport modes may include a bus, a car, a ferry, a train, foot, bicycle, etc. To distinguish between these different modes of transportation, ranking system 230 may collect sensor data relating to users who are using these different transportation modes and determine, for example, a pattern of movement of user devices 210 that is indicative of each different type of travel. In this way, ranking system 230 may distinguish when a user is moving via bus, car, ferry, train, foot, bicycle, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the transport mode category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that a user, of user device 210, is currently walking.
The sound category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a sound that is currently being detected by a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the sound category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not currently detecting a particular sound. Examples of factors on which a criterion in this category may be based may include detection of a voice or a particular type of voice (e.g., such as a male voice, a female voice, a child's voice, etc.), detection of a collection of voices (e.g., a crowd), detection of a particular word or words, detection of music or a particular type of music, detection of a song (e.g., any song), a particular song (e.g., a song with a specific name), or a particular type of song (e.g., a rock and roll song), etc. Additionally, or alternatively, a criterion under the sound category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not currently detecting sound above or below a particular threshold. As an example, a criterion, in the sound category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that user device 210 is currently detecting music being played.
The date category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a date or date range. As one example, a criterion under the date category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when the current date, at the geographic location of a user device 210, is or is not a particular date, or is or is not within a particular date range. A date range may be expressed specifically, for example, using a start date and an end date, or more generally as, for example, a particular day or days, a particular week or weeks, a particular month or months, summer, fall, winter, spring, a particular holiday, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the date category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that the current date, at the geographic location of user device 210, is within a date range of Jun. 1, 2012 and Jun. 30, 2012.
The device event category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a particular event that is currently being detected by a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the device event category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not currently connected to a Wi-Fi network. Examples of factors on which a criterion in this category may be based may include whether a user device 210 is or is not currently connected to network, whether user device 210 is currently connected to a particular type of network, whether a network is available to which user device 210 can connect, whether user device 210 is currently receiving a telephone call, whether user device 210 is currently conducting a telephone call, whether a telephone call has ended in connection with user device 210, whether a new message has arrived in a voicemail account associated with user device 210, whether a battery level of user device is at, above, or below a threshold, whether user device 210 is currently charging, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the device event category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that battery of user device 210 is below a particular threshold.
The other devices category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to one or more devices that are currently being detected by a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the other devices category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is in proximity to another user device. Examples of factors on which a criterion in this category may be based may include whether a user device 210 is or is not within a particular distance of another device (e.g., a cell phone, a Wi-Fi access point, etc.), another particular device (e.g., a particular's friend's cell phone), etc. As an example, a criterion, in the other devices category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that user device 210 is within a particular distance of a Wi-Fi access point, having a particular service set identifier (SSID).
The people category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a person who may be in proximity to a user device 210. As one example, a criterion under the people category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is in proximity to a particular person, which can be determined, for example, based on detecting a user device with which the particular person is associated. Examples of factors on which criterion in this category may be based include whether a user device 210 is within a particular distance of a particular person, people with one or more characteristics in common with the user of user device 210, etc. To determine whether another person has a characteristic in common with the user, a social networking website, an address book, or other information may be considered. As an example, a criterion, in the people category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that a person who is associated with a user, of user device 210, on a social networking website is within proximity of user device 210.
The speed category may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to a speed at which user device 210 is currently moving. As one example, a criterion under the speed category may specify that the criterion is satisfied when user device 210 is or is not moving at a particular speed for a particular period of time. Examples of factors on which a criterion in this category may be based include whether user device 210 is or is not moving at, above, or below a particular speed, whether user device 210 is or is not moving at, above, or below a particular speed for longer than a particular period of time, whether user device 210 is or is not moving at, above, or below a particular speed for less than a particular period of time, etc. As an example, a criterion, in the speed category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that user device 210 is moving faster than 7 kilometers per hour for longer than 4 minutes.
While specific triggering criteria categories are discussed above, the user interface may include additional categories, fewer categories, or different categories. For example, the list of triggering criteria categories may also include an orientation category that may allow the microsite creator to specify criteria relating to an orientation of user device 210. As an example, a criterion, in the orientation category, may specify that the criterion is satisfied if sensor data from a user device 210 indicates that a display of user device 210 is facing away from a user of user device 210.
Each triggering criteria category may be associated with one or more sensors. Thus, input component 310 may identify, based on selection of particular triggering criteria categories for a particular microsite, a list of sensors that are relevant to the particular microsite. Input component 310 may provide the triggering criteria and/or the list of sensors to indexing component 320.
In some example implementations, ranking component 330 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on one or more factors. For example, ranking component 330 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a popularity score of the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated based on user behavior data associated with the microsite, such as how many users expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 210, and/or how many users expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 210, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, or purchasing a service associated with the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user behavior data, such as a quantity of times that the microsite has been presented to user devices 210, an age of the microsite, a prior ranking or score of the microsite, or the like.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking component 330 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a personalization score of the microsite. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated based on user activity data, associated with a user of a particular user device 210, with regard to the microsite, such as whether the user has expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 210, and/or whether the user expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 210, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user activity data, such as whether the user has recommended the microsite to one of the user's social contacts.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking component 330 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a social score of the microsite. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated based on friend activity data, associated with social contacts—e.g., social contacts—of the user of a particular user device 210, with regard to the microsite. The user's social contacts may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of friend activity data, associated with a microsite, include whether the user's social contacts have expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the social contacts' user devices 210, and/or whether the user's social contacts expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the social contacts' user devices 210, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the friend activity data, such as whether the social contacts have recommended the microsite to others.
In some implementations, ranking component 330 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, ranking component 330 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. In some implementations, ranking component 330 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a weighted combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, ranking component 330 may assign a weight value to the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. The weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary. Rank component 330 may combine the weighted score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score.
Although FIG. 3 shows example functional components of ranking system 230, in some implementations, ranking system 230 may include additional functional components, different functional components, or fewer functional components than those depicted in FIG. 3 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of ranking system 230 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of ranking system 230.
speed AND motion AND time,
speed OR motion OR time,
(speed OR motion) AND time,
speed AND (motion OR time),
etc.
Thus, Boolean operators and/or parentheses may be used to specify how different triggering criteria are to be combined for the microsite. In some implementations, the microsite creator may also provide different weights for the different criteria that are part of the triggering criteria. In the example above, the microsite creator may specify a first weight for the speed criteria, a second, different weight for the motion criteria, and a third, different weight for the time criteria.
Additionally, or alternatively, input component 310 may provide a user interface that allows the microsite creator to specify triggering criteria in other ways. For example, the user interface may allow the microsite creator to specify triggering criteria in a freestyle manner, such as by typing in what the microsite creator desires the triggering criteria to be. As one example, the microsite creator may specify the triggering criteria shown in FIG. 1A as:
-
- the criteria is met when the user device is moving faster than 7 km/hr for longer than 4 minutes, and the user device is not within 10 meters of a bus stop, and the time is not between 11 PM and 4 AM.
Input component 310 may receive the entered information and parse the information to identify the triggering criteria categories and the triggering criteria for the identified triggering criteria categories. Additionally, or alternatively,input component 310 may provide default triggering criteria, which can be edited by the microsite designer to specify the triggering criteria for the microsite. The default triggering criteria may be provided, for example, in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format, a Comma (or Character)-Separated Values (CSV) format, a Microsoft Excel (XLS) format, a non-string type of format, and/or another type of format; as a flat text file (e.g., ASCII); as a file containing an array of key-value pairs; etc. In some implementations, the default triggering criteria may include an entire list of possible criteria or a subset of possible criteria, which may be determined based on a type of the microsite received inblock 410 above. In some implementations, the microsite creator may simply remove the triggering criteria that are not desired and provide the appropriate parameters for the remaining triggering criteria to form the triggering criteria for the microsite.
- the criteria is met when the user device is moving faster than 7 km/hr for longer than 4 minutes, and the user device is not within 10 meters of a bus stop, and the time is not between 11 PM and 4 AM.
While FIG. 4 shows process 400 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 400 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
Returning to FIG. 5 , process 500 may include detecting selection of a triggering criteria category (block 520). For example, input component 310 may detect that the microsite creator selected a triggering criteria category from the list of triggering criteria categories. With reference to FIG. 6A , the microsite creator may select the triggering criteria category by dragging a triggering criteria category from first area 610 to second area 620. Other manners of selecting a triggering criteria category may alternatively be used. For example, the microsite creator may select a triggering criteria category by clicking on the triggering criteria category, in first area 610, with a mouse or other type of input device, or touching the triggering criteria category, in first area 610, with a finger or input device.
While the location category is shown as associated with one criterion, in some implementations, a triggering criteria category may include more than one criterion. In such implementations, the microsite creator may select one or more of the available criteria for the triggering criteria category.
Returning to FIG. 5 , process 500 may include determining whether an additional triggering criteria category has been selected (block 550). For example, input component 310 may determine, for example, whether the microsite creator has selected an additional triggering criteria category, from the list of triggering criteria categories. Additionally, or alternatively, input component 310 may determine whether the microsite creator has selected a SUBMIT button or similar type of button, which may indicate that the microsite creator has completed selecting triggering criteria categories.
In those situations where an additional triggering criteria category has been selected (block 550—YES), process 500 may return to block 530 with input component 310 populating the user interface with information for the newly selected triggering criteria category. In those situations where an additional triggering criteria category has not been selected (block 550—NO), process 500 may include receiving parameters for combining the selected triggering criteria (block 560). For example, input component 310 may provide a user interface to microsite creator device 220 that includes information identifying the selected triggering criteria. The microsite creator may, via the user interface, specify how the selected triggering criteria are to be combined. In some implementations, the user interface may provide the microsite creator with the ability to combine the selected triggering criteria using one or more Boolean operators and/or parentheses. FIG. 6C is a diagram of an example user interface 650 that may be provided to a microsite creator to allow the microsite creator to combine selected triggering criteria. As shown, the microsite creator has combined, in area 660 of user interface 650, the triggering criteria, selected in FIG. 6B , as follows: (SPEED OR MOTION) AND LOCATION. Thus, satisfying this triggering criteria requires the location criterion to be satisfied, as well as either the speed criterion or the motion criterion. In some implementations, area 660 may be pre-populated with the triggering criteria and possibly the Boolean operators selected in user interface 600. The microsite creator may, however, modify the pre-populated information in any desired manner.
While FIG. 5 shows process 500 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 500 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
A system and method, described herein, may allow a microsite creator to specify triggering criteria that dictate when the creator's microsite is to be presented—e.g., pushed—to a user device. In some implementations, the microsite may be based on context data without the need for a user, of the user device, to request the microsite. The microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
A system and/or method, as described herein, may provide a microsite to a user device based on context data and without the need for a user, of the user device, to request the microsite. The context data may include user profile data relating to the user or the user device and/or sensor data relating to one or more conditions associated with the user device. The microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
As shown in FIG. 8 , a server may obtain context data relating to Mary and/or Mary's mobile device. The context data may include information regarding Mary's interest in the movie, information regarding current conditions (e.g., time, date, weather, etc.), information regarding the current geographic location of Mary's mobile device, or the like. The server may use the context data to determine whether to trigger the presentation of a microsite.
The server may store information regarding a group of microsites and criteria for triggering the presentation of these microsites. The server may compare the context data to the triggering criteria for the microsites and use the comparison results to generate scores for the microsites. The server may select a relevant microsite based on its score and provide information, regarding the relevant microsite, to Mary's mobile device. In the example shown in FIG. 1 , the relevant microsite may include details regarding an upcoming showing of The Action League Movie. For example, Mary may be presented with information that a showing of the movie begins in eight minutes at the Regal Cinema and information regarding how to get to the Regal Cinema (e.g., Mary may be informed that the Regal Cinema is just two blocks away and an arrow may identify the direction of the Regal Cinema relative to Mary's current location). As a result, Mary may be presented with information in which Mary is interested without the need for Mary to request the information.
While ranking system 920 is shown as separate from servers 930, it may be possible for ranking system 920 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by a server 930 and/or a server 930 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 920. For example, ranking system 920 may host some of the microsites. Additionally, or alternatively, a user device 910 may host some of the microsites.
While ranking system 920 is shown as separate from user device 910, it may be possible for user device 910 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 920 and/or ranking system 920 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by user device 910.
As shown in FIG. 10 , user device 910 may include an application module 1010, a user profile module 1020, a sensors module 1030, and a display module 1040. In some implementations, user device 910 may include additional or fewer functional components than are illustrated in FIG. 10 .
Examples of user profile data may include information regarding geographic addresses associated with the user, such as the address of the user's home, the address of the user's place of business, the address of a location frequented by the user, etc.; information inputted into a calendar associated with the user; information regarding the user's interaction with microsites that have been presented to the user, such as ratings given to the microsites, whether the user has dismissed—e.g., swiped away—from microsites that have been presented to the user, or the like; information regarding the user's communications, such as e-mails, text messages, instant messages, voicemail messages, or the like; information regarding the user's activity on the web, such as information regarding the user's searches, the user's browsing activity, the user's posts on social networks, blogs, and/or other public web sites; information regarding the user's social contacts, such as identifiers—e.g., identifiers that are anonymized with regard to the identities of particular individuals—associated with people listed in the user's address book, people friended by the user on social networks or other public web sites, people with whom the user has communicated, or other people having a social relationship with the user; and/or information regarding the user's habits, such as places that the user has visited, things that the user has done, at what time the user usually gets up in the morning, or the like. While certain examples of user profile data have been identified above, other types of user profile data are possible.
The user may review, add, remove, and/or revise the user profile data at any time. In some implementations, the user may specify what type of information is to be used for the user profile data. For example, the user may specify that the information regarding the user's activity on the web is to be used for the user profile data, and the information regarding the user's communications and the information regarding the user's friends' activities on the web are not to be used for user profile data.
Examples of sensor data may include information regarding a current geographic location of user device 910; information regarding sounds occurring at or around user device 910; information regarding current lighting condition at user device 910; information regarding a current date and/or time associated with user device 910; information regarding a current speed of user device 910; information regarding a current direction in which user device 910 is moving; information regarding a current orientation or change in orientation of user device 910; information regarding a current weather condition in the location in which user device 910 is located; information regarding a current temperature in the location in which user device 910 is located; and/or information regarding interaction of user device 910 with other devices with which user device 910 is in communication. While certain examples of sensor data have been identified above, other types of sensor data are possible.
The user may specify what type of information is to be used for the sensor data. For example, the user may specify that the current geographic location, the current time, the current speed, the current direction, and the current orientation or change in orientation of user device 910 are to be used for the sensor data, and the interaction of user device 910 with other devices is not to be used for the sensor data.
In some implementations, display module 1040 may push the content to the display so as to override any content already on the display. In some implementations, display module 1040 may determine an appropriate time to render the content of the microsite, such as when user device 910 is idle for a particular amount of time, when user device 910 is in a lock mode, when user device 910 is in a particular orientation, or the like. In some implementations, a user of user device 910 may specify how and when the user will be presented with the content of a microsite. For example, the user may specify that the content of a microsite can only be presented between 8 AM and 8 PM on weekdays and between 12 PM and 11 PM on weekends; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is located in her home state of Virginia; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is moving at a speed of less than 20 KPH; or the like.
In some implementations, display module 1040 may present the content of the microsite on the display of user device 910 for a particular amount of time and, thereafter, remove the content of the microsite from the display. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be configurable by the user of user device 910. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be preset by application module 1010, by an entity associated with ranking system 920, or by an entity associated with server 930 hosting the content of the microsite.
In some implementations, display module 1040 may present the content of the microsite within a particular region of the display of user device 910. The particular region may include the entire display area of the display or a subset of the entire display area of the display. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be configurable by the user of user device 910. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be preset by application module 1010, by an entity associated with ranking system 920, or by an entity associated with server 930 hosting the content of the microsite.
A user may interact with the content of the microsite to dismiss the content—e.g., by swiping the content—or to obtain additional information regarding the content—e.g., by selecting the content. The user's interaction with the microsite content may be recorded as user profile data by user profile module 1020.
As shown in FIG. 11 , ranking system 920 may include an input module 1110, an indexing module 1120, and a ranking module 1130. In some implementations, ranking system 920 may include additional or fewer functional components than are illustrated in FIG. 11 .
In some implementations, input module 1110 may identify microsites via manual input. For example, input module 1110 may provide a user interface via which users may provide information regarding microsites that the users have created. In some implementations, a user, via the user interface, may identify a network address associated with a microsite and/or may specify triggering criteria and a list of sensors that are relevant for the microsite. Additionally, or alternatively, the user, via the user interface, may upload the content of the microsite. The content of the microsite may be hosted by ranking system 920 or a device separate from ranking system 920, such as a server 930.
In some implementations, ranking module 1130 may identify microsites that are relevant to information in the user profile data, compare the sensor data to the triggering criteria for the microsites, and generate scores for the microsites based on result of the comparisons. For example, ranking module 1130 may perform a first analysis to identify microsites based on the user profile data; perform a second analysis to identify relevant microsites based on the sensor data and the triggering criteria; and perform a third analysis on the relevant microsites, based on a comparison of the sensor data and the triggering criteria, to generate a score for each of the relevant microsites.
In some implementations, ranking module 1130 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on one or more factors. For example, ranking module 1130 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a popularity score of the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated based on user behavior data associated with the microsite, such as how many users expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 910, and/or how many users expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, or purchasing a service associated with the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user behavior data, such as a quantity of times that the microsite has been presented to user devices 910, an age of the microsite, a prior ranking or score of the microsite, or the like.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking module 1130 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a personalization score of the microsite. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated based on the user profile data, such as user activity data, associated with a user of a particular user device 910, with regard to the microsite. The user activity data may include, for example, whether the user has expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 910, and/or whether the user expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service or product associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, orienting the particular user device 910 to view the microsite without swiping away from the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user profile data, such as whether the user has recommended the microsite to one of the user's friends.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking module 1130 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a social score of the microsite. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated based on friend activity data, associated with social contacts—e.g., friends—of the user of a particular user device 910, with regard to the microsite. The user's friends may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of friend activity data, associated with a microsite, include whether the user's friends have expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the friends' user devices 910, and/or whether the user's friends expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the friends' user devices 910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the friend activity data, such as whether the friends have recommended the microsite to others.
In some implementations, ranking module 1130 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, ranking module 1130 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. In some implementations, ranking module 1130 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a weighted combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, ranking module 1130 may assign a weight value to the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. The weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary. Rank module 1130 may combine the weighted score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score.
As described above, ranking system 920 may receive the user profile data and the sensor data from user device 910. Ranking system 920 may use the user profile data and/or the sensor data to identify a set of relevant microsites. Ranking system 920 may compare the sensor data to the triggering criteria for a microsite and generate a score for the microsite based on a result of the comparison. As described above, ranking system 920 may modify the score based on one or more factors, such as a popularity score, a personalization score, and/or a social score. Ranking system 920 may select a set of microsites based on their scores and provide information, regarding the set of microsites, to user device 910.
While FIG. 12 shows process 1200 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 1200 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
While FIG. 13 shows process 1300 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 1300 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
While FIG. 14 shows process 1400 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 1400 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
As shown at (A) in FIG. 15 , input module 1110, of ranking system 920, may identify microsites for use by ranking system 920. In some implementations, as described above, input module 1110 may identify microsites through crawling and/or via manual input. In either situation, input module 1110 may obtain information regarding a particular microsite, such as a descriptive name of the particular microsite, a network address for the particular microsite, triggering criteria for the particular microsite, and/or a list of sensors that are relevant for the particular microsite.
As shown at (B) in FIG. 15 , input module 1110, of ranking system 920, may provide information regarding various microsites to indexing module 1120. Indexing module 1120 may store information regarding the microsites in one or more indexes. In some implementations, as described above, indexing module 1120 may store, for a particular microsite in an index, a descriptive name of the particular microsite, a network address for the particular microsite, triggering criteria for the particular microsite, and/or a list of sensors that are relevant for the particular microsite.
As shown at (C) in FIG. 15 , application module 1010, of user device 910, may obtain user profile data from user profile module 1020 and/or may obtain sensor data from sensors module 1030. The user profile data may include various information regarding user device 910 and/or a user of user device 910. Examples of user profile data have been given above. The sensor data may include various information regarding user device 910 and/or conditions associated with user device 910. Examples of sensor data have been given above.
As shown at (D) in FIG. 15 , application module 1010 may provide the user profile data and/or the sensor data to ranking system 920. As described above, application module 1010 may automatically—e.g., without requiring an instruction from a user of user device 910—provide the user profile data and/or the sensor data to ranking system 920. Ranking module 1130, of ranking system 920, may receive the user profile data and/or the sensor data.
As shown at (E) in FIG. 15 , ranking module 1130 may use the user profile data and/or the sensor data to identify relevant microsites. As described above, in some implementations, ranking module 1130 may identify relevant microsites, in the index, based on the sensor data and the triggering criteria, and generate a score for the relevant microsites based on a result of a comparison of the sensor data and the triggering criteria. As also described above, in some implementations, ranking module 1130 may identify microsites, in the index, based on the user profile data, determine which of these microsites is relevant based on the sensor data and the triggering criteria, and generate a score for the relevant microsites based on a result of a comparison of the sensor data and the triggering criteria. As described above, in some implementations, ranking module 1130 may modify the score, for a microsite, based on one or more factors to generate a total score for the microsite. Ranking module 1130 may use the score, or total score, to identify a set of relevant microsites.
As shown at (F) in FIG. 15 , ranking module 1130 may provide information, regarding the set of relevant microsites, to user device 910. As explained above, in some implementations, the information may include, for each microsite in the set of relevant microsites, a network address for the microsite and a list of sensors relevant to the microsite. Application module 1010, of user device 910, may receive the information regarding the set of relevant microsites.
As shown at (G) in FIG. 15 , application module 1010 may provide the information, regarding the set of relevant microsites, to display module 1040 of user device 910. Display module 1040 may receive the information regarding the set of relevant microsites. Display module 1040 may obtain sensor data associated with the list of sensors that have been identified as relevant to the relevant microsites. For each relevant microsite, display module 1040 may generate a request that includes the network address for the relevant microsite and the sensor data relevant to the relevant microsite.
As shown at (H) in FIG. 15 , display module 1040 may transmit the requests to one or more servers 930. Whether display module 1040 transmits the requests to more than one server 930 depends on which server(s) 930 is/are hosting the relevant microsites. In other words, all of the relevant microsites may be hosted by a single server 930, all of the relevant microsites may be hosted by separate, different servers 930, or something in between these two extremes.
Server(s) 930 may receive the requests from user device 910 may obtain content of the relevant microsites. In some implementations, as described above, the content of a relevant microsite may be dynamic in the sense that the content of the relevant microsite is based on the sensor data received from user device 910.
As shown at (I) in FIG. 15 , server(s) 930 may provide the content of the relevant microsites to user device 910. Display module 1040, of user device 910, may receive the content and present the content on a display associated with user device 910. For example, display module 1040 may push the content, for the relevant microsites, as a sliding display of content. In some implementations, content for one of the relevant microsites may be presented on the display at a time. A user, of user device 910, may interact with the content, using a finger or the like, to express the user's interest or disinterest in the content or to see the content for another one of the relevant microsites.
Assume that the ranking system identifies, based on the user profile data and the sensor data, that a Run Tracker microsite is relevant. For example, the Run Tracker microsite might have triggering criteria that specifies a condition that the user be moving at a speed between 3 KPH and 20 KPH during the hours between 6 AM and 8 PM. In this case, Emma's sensor data indicates that she is moving at a speed of 10 KPH, which is between 3 KPH and 20 KPH, at 8:10 AM, which is between 6 AM and 8 PM. Thus, the ranking system identifies the Run Tracker microsite as a relevant microsite.
The ranking system may provide, to the watch, information associated with the Run Tracker microsite, such as a network address for the microsite—i.e., run tracker.com/123—and a list of sensors relevant to the microsite—i.e., speed and location. The watch may receive the information associated with the Run Tracker microsite and generate a request based on the information.
The watch may transmit the request, including the network address of run tracker.com/123 and the sensor data that includes the speed of 10 KPH and the location of LAT 40.52202 and LONG −79.84180, to a server associated with the Run Tracker microsite—hereinafter called the run tracker server. The run tracker server may process the sensor data to generate and/or modify the content of the Run Tracker microsite. The run tracker server may provide the content of the Run Tracker microsite to the watch. The watch may then display the content of the Run Tracker microsite on its display. As shown in FIG. 16 , the Run Tracker microsite may display the distance that Emma has run and her current pace.
Assume that the ranking system identifies, based on the user profile data and the sensor data, that a Bus Notifier microsite is relevant. For example, the Bus Notifier microsite might have triggering criteria that specifies that the user be moving at a speed below 3 KPH and that the user be located within 50 meters of a bus stop within 5 minutes of the scheduled time that a bus is going to arrive at the bus stop. In this case, Emma's sensor data indicates that she is moving at a speed of 0.8 KPH, which is below 3 KPH, that she is located within 5 meters of a bus stop, and that, based on the current time of 9:32 AM, a bus is scheduled to arrive in 2 minutes. Thus, the ranking system identifies the Bus Notifier microsite as a relevant microsite.
The ranking system may provide, to the watch, information associated with the Bus Notifier microsite, such as a network address for the microsite—i.e., busnotifier.com/123—and a list of sensors relevant to the microsite—i.e., time and location. The watch may receive the information associated with the Bus Notifier microsite and generate a request based on the information.
The watch may transmit the request, including the network address of busnotifier.com/123 and the sensor data that includes the current time of 9:32 AM and the location of LAT 40.52202 and LONG −79.84180, to a server associated with the Bus Notifier microsite—hereinafter called the metrobus notifier server. The metrobus notifier server may process the sensor data to generate and/or modify the content of the Bus Notifier microsite. The metrobus notifier server may provide the content of the Bus Notifier microsite to the watch. The watch may then display the content of the Bus Notifier microsite on its display.
Assume, for the purposes of FIGS. 17B-17D , that, in the above example, the ranking system not only provided information regarding the Bus Notifier microsite, but also provided information regarding a history microsite. Assume that the history microsite provides historical facts relating to a user's location and the current day.
As shown in FIG. 17B , the watch may display the content of the Bus Notifier microsite. Emma may interact with the content using, for example, her finger. Assume that Emma is disinterested in the content of the Bus Notifier microsite and uses her finger to swipe away from the Bus Notifier microsite. Information regarding Emma's disinterest in the Bus Notifier microsite, as evidenced by her swiping away from the Bus Notifier microsite, may be recorded as additional user profile data.
As shown in FIG. 17C , Emma swipes the screen of the watch with her finger. As a result of the swiping action, the watch displays the content of the next microsite—i.e., the content of the history microsite, as shown in FIG. 17D . The history microsite indicates a historical fact relating to Emma's current location on this day—i.e., Paul Revere's famous ride occurred on the street on which Emma is walking on this day in 1775.
A system and method, described herein, may push a microsite to a user device based on context data without the need for a user, of the user device, to request the microsite. The microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
A system and/or method, as described herein, may provide information regarding a relevant microsite to a user device based on context data. The context data may include user profile data relating to the user or the user device and/or sensor data relating to one or more conditions associated with the user device. The relevant microsite may be determined based on popularity data associated with the microsite, personalization data associated with the user, and/or social data associated with a social contact of the user. The microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
The ranking system may maintain a microsite index. The microsite index may store information regarding microsites. For a particular microsite, the microsite index may store triggering criteria that indicates when the particular microsite is relevant. The ranking system may compare the sensor data, from Mary's mobile device, to the triggering criteria in the microsite index to identify a set of relevant microsites.
The ranking system may generate scores for the relevant microsites based on popularity data, personalization data, and/or social data. The popularity data, for a particular microsite, may reflect a measure of popularity of the particular microsite. Assume, for the example of FIG. 18 , that a microsite for the Rio Grand restaurant has been identified as a popular microsite. The personalization data may reflect a measure of interest, by a user, in the particular microsite. Assume, for the example of FIG. 18 , that Mary has expressed an interest in the Rio Grand restaurant by, for example, accessing a web site associated with the Rio Grand restaurant, entering information in her calendar regarding a lunch date at the Rio Grand restaurant on more than one occasion, and communicating with a friend about meeting at the Rio Grand restaurant. The social data may reflect a measure of interest, by a social contact of the user, in the particular microsite. Assume, for the example of FIG. 18 , that Mary's friends Bob, Alice, and Diane have expressed an interest in the Rio Grand restaurant by, for example, posting information regarding a recent dinner at the Rio Grand restaurant on a social network, visiting the Rio Grand restaurant, and/or giving a favorable rating to the Rio Grand microsite.
The ranking system may select one or more of the relevant microsites based on the scores of the relevant microsites. Assume that the Rio Grand microsite is the highest scoring microsite in the set of relevant microsites. As shown in FIG. 18 , the ranking system may provide information regarding the Rio Grand microsite to Mary's mobile device. Mary's mobile device may, thereafter, display the content of the Rio Grand microsite. As shown in FIG. 18 , the content of the Rio Grand microsite may include information regarding the distance to the restaurant relative to Mary's current location and information regarding Mary's friends' average rating. As a result, Mary may be presented with information in which Mary is interested without the need for Mary to request the information.
While ranking system 1920 is shown as separate from servers 1930, it may be possible for ranking system 1920 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by a server 1930 and/or a server 1930 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 1920. For example, ranking system 1920 may host some of the microsites. Additionally, or alternatively, a user device 1910 may host some of the microsites.
While ranking system 1920 is shown as separate from user device 1910, it may be possible for user device 1910 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 1920 and/or ranking system 1920 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by user device 210.
While FIG. 19 shows environment 1900 as having a particular quantity and arrangement of user devices 1910, ranking system 1920, servers 1930, and network 1940, in some implementations, environment 1900 may include fewer, additional, or different user devices 1910, ranking system 1920, servers 1930, and network 1940 than are shown in FIG. 19 .
Examples of user profile data may include information regarding geographic addresses associated with the user, such as the address of the user's home, the address of the user's place of business, the address of a location frequented by the user, etc.; information inputted into a calendar associated with the user; information regarding the user's interaction with microsites that have been presented to the user, such as ratings given to the microsites, whether the user has dismissed—e.g., swiped away—from microsites that have been presented to the user, or the like; information regarding the user's communications, such as e-mails, text messages, instant messages, voicemail messages, or the like; information regarding the user's activity on the web, such as information regarding the user's searches, the user's browsing activity, the user's posts on social networks, blogs, and/or other public web sites; information regarding the user's social contacts, such as identifiers—e.g., identifiers that are anonymized with regard to the identities of particular individuals—associated with people listed in the user's address book, people friended by the user on social networks or other public web sites, people with whom the user has communicated, or other people having a social relationship with the user; and/or information regarding the user's habits, such as places that the user has visited, things that the user has done, at what time the user usually gets up in the morning, or the like. While certain examples of user profile data have been identified above, other types of user profile data are possible.
The user may review, add, remove, and/or revise the user profile data at any time. In some implementations, the user may specify what type of information is to be used for the user profile data and for what purpose. For example, the user may specify that the information regarding the user's activity on the web is to be used for the user profile data, and the information regarding the user's communications is not to be used for user profile data. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may specify that all or some of the user profile data may be used for generating a personalization score—described below—that can be used when determining what microsite content to present to the user. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may specify that all or some of the user profile data may be used for generating a social score—described below—that can be used when determining what microsite content to present to another user, for whom the user is a social contact.
Examples of sensor data may include information regarding a current geographic location of user device 1910; information regarding sounds occurring at or around user device 1910; information regarding current lighting condition at user device 1910; information regarding a current date and/or time associated with user device 1910; information regarding a current speed of user device 1910; information regarding a current direction in which user device 1910 is moving; information regarding a current orientation or change in orientation of user device 1910; information regarding a current weather condition in the location in which user device 1910 is located; information regarding a current temperature in the location in which user device 1910 is located; and/or information regarding interaction of user device 1910 with other devices with which user device 1910 is in communication. While certain examples of sensor data have been identified above, other types of sensor data are possible.
The user may specify what type of information is to be used for the sensor data. For example, the user may specify that the current geographic location, the current time, the current speed, the current direction, and the current orientation or change in orientation of user device 1910 are to be used for the sensor data, and the interaction of user device 1910 with other devices is not to be used for the sensor data.
In some implementations, display module 2040 may push the content to the display so as to override any content already on the display. In some implementations, display module 2040 may determine an appropriate time to render the content of the microsite, such as when user device 1910 is idle for a particular amount of time, when user device 1910 is in a lock mode, when user device 1910 is in a particular orientation, or the like. In some implementations, a user of user device 1910 may specify how and when the user will be presented with the content of a microsite. For example, the user may specify that the content of a microsite can only be presented between 8 AM and 8 PM on weekdays and between 12 PM and 11 PM on weekends; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is located in her home state of Virginia; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is moving at a speed of less than 20 KPH; or the like.
In some implementations, display module 2040 may present the content of the microsite on the display of user device 1910 for a particular amount of time and, thereafter, remove the content of the microsite from the display. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be configurable by the user of user device 1910. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be preset by application module 2010, by an entity associated with ranking system 1920, or by an entity associated with server 1930 hosting the content of the microsite.
In some implementations, display module 2040 may present the content of the microsite within a particular region of the display of user device 1910. The particular region may include the entire display area of the display or a subset of the entire display area of the display. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be configurable by the user of user device 1910. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be preset by application module 2010, by an entity associated with ranking system 1920, or by an entity associated with server 1930 hosting the content of the microsite.
A user may interact with the content of the microsite to dismiss the content—e.g., by swiping the content—or to obtain additional information regarding the content—e.g., by selecting the content. The user's interaction with the microsite content may be recorded as user profile data by user profile module 2020.
While FIG. 20 shows user device 1910 as having a particular quantity and arrangement of functional components, in some implementations, user device 1910 may include fewer functional components, additional functional components, or different functional components than are shown in FIG. 20 .
As shown in FIG. 21 , ranking system 1920 may include an input module 2110, an indexing module 2120, and a ranking module 2130. In some implementations, ranking system 1920 may include additional or fewer functional components than are illustrated in FIG. 21 .
In some implementations, input module 2110 may identify microsites via manual input. For example, input module 2110 may provide a user interface via which users may provide information regarding microsites that the users have created. In some implementations, a user, via the user interface, may identify a network address associated with a microsite and/or may specify triggering criteria and a list of sensors that are relevant for the microsite. Additionally, or alternatively, the user, via the user interface, may upload the content of the microsite. The content of the microsite may be hosted by ranking system 1920 or a device separate from ranking system 1920, such as a server 1930.
Triggering criteria field 2230 may store triggering criteria that identify when the particular microsite will be identified as relevant. The triggering criteria may relate to various types of sensor data. In some implementations, the triggering criteria may be stored in an N-ary tree. As shown in FIG. 22 , triggering criteria field 2230 may store triggering criteria that specifies that the Rio Grand microsite is relevant when a user is located within 50 meters of the restaurant AND the current time is between 11 AM and 11 PM AND . . . .
The triggering criteria may be specified as a Boolean expression. Assume that the triggering criteria, for the particular microsite, include criterion A and criterion B. In this case, for example, the triggering criteria may be specified as criterion A AND criterion B, or as criterion A OR criterion B. The Boolean expression may include operators other than AND and OR.
In some implementations, indexing module 2120 may order the triggering criteria to place the criterion that is least likely to be satisfied, from among the triggering criteria, first. As one example, assume that the triggering criteria include criterion A—the time is between 6 AM and 8 PM—AND criterion B—a user is located within 10 meters of a bus stop. In this case, indexing module 2120 may order the triggering criteria as criterion B AND criterion A, because criterion B is least often to be satisfied between criterion A and criterion B. As another example, assume that the triggering criteria include criterion A—the time is between 6 AM and 8 PM—AND criterion B—a user is located within 10 meters of a bus stop—OR criterion C—the user is located within 25 meters of a train stop. In this case, indexing module 2120 may order the triggering criteria as (criterion B or criterion C) AND criterion A, because criterion B and criterion C are least likely to be satisfied among criterion A, criterion B, and criterion C.
By placing the least likely criterion, or criteria, first in the Boolean expression, it may be determined whether to exclude the particular microsite from consideration without having to test every criterion in the triggering criteria. Returning to the example above with the triggering criteria of criterion B AND criterion A, the particular microsite may be excluded from further consideration when criterion B is not satisfied regardless of whether criterion A is satisfied. Returning to the example above with the triggering criteria of (criterion B or criterion C) AND criterion A, the particular microsite may be excluded from further consideration when criterion B and criterion C are not satisfied regardless of whether criterion A is satisfied. This may help reduce the set of microsites, in the index, considered for presentation to a user device 1910.
List of sensors field 2240 may store information identifying a list of sensors that is relevant to the particular microsite. The list of sensors may identify sensors that output sensor data that is relevant to the triggering criteria in triggering criteria field 2230 and/or sensor data that is relevant to the generation of the content of the particular microsite that will be presented on a user device 1910. As shown in FIG. 22 , list of sensors field 2240 may indicate that sensors relating to location, time, etc. are relevant to the Rio Grand microsite.
Score(s) field 2250 may store information regarding one or more scores generated for the particular microsite, such as a popularity score, a personalization score, and/or a social score. Other types of scores may additionally, or alternatively, be generated. One or more techniques, for generating the score(s) stored in score(s) field 2250, will be described below.
The popularity score may be generated based on popularity data associated with the particular microsite. The personalization score may be generated based on personalization data specific to a particular user relative to the particular microsite. Score(s) field 2250 may store a respective personalization score for each of multiple users with a personalization score, for the particular microsite, that satisfies a personalization threshold. The social score may be generated based on social data specific to one or more social contacts, associated with a particular user, for the particular microsite. Score(s) field 2250 may store a respective social score for each of multiple users with a social score, for the particular microsite, that satisfies a social threshold. It may be possible for score(s) field 2250 to store, for the same user, a personalization score and a social score. The personalization score, in this situation, may be used when presenting information regarding the particular microsite to the user. The social score, in this situation, may be used when presenting information regarding the particular microsite to another user for which the user is a social contact.
While FIG. 22 shows entry 2200 of the index as including particular fields, in some implementations, entry 2200 may include additional fields, fewer fields, or different fields than are shown in FIG. 22 .
Returning to FIG. 21 , ranking module 2130 may receive user profile data and sensor data from a user device 1910. Ranking module 2130 may use the user profile data and/or the sensor data to identify relevant microsites. Ranking module 2130 may generate scores for the relevant microsites and present information regarding one or more of the relevant microsites, to user device 1910, based on the scores.
In either situation, as described above, the triggering criteria may be represented as a Boolean expression. Microsite selection module 2310 may analyze as many of the triggering criteria, as necessary, to determine whether a microsite is relevant. For example, if the triggering criteria include criterion A AND criterion B, microsite selection module 2310 may determine that microsites, which do not satisfy criterion A, are not relevant microsites. As another example, if the triggering criteria include criterion A AND criterion B, microsite selection module 2310 may determine that microsites, which satisfy criterion A but do not satisfy criterion B, are not relevant microsites.
Microsite ranking module 2320 may generate scores for the relevant microsites and create a ranked list of microsites based on the scores. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may perform a matching of the sensor data to the triggering criteria, for a relevant microsite, to generate an index score for the relevant microsite. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may perform a matching of the sensor data and the user profile data to the triggering criteria, for a relevant microsite, to generate an index score for the relevant microsite. In either situation, microsite ranking module 2320 may compare the sensor data and/or the user profile data to each criterion, of the triggering criteria, and generate a real value that represents a result of the comparison. Microsite ranking module 2320 may combine the real values to generate the index score for the relevant microsite.
While examples of functions are illustrated in FIGS. 24A-24C , other functions are possible instead of the linear ascendant, quadratic ascendant, and quadratic parabola functions.
Returning to FIG. 23 , microsite ranking module 2320 may generate the index score for a relevant microsite by combining the real values. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may calculate the index score as a sum, or some other combination, of the real values. In some example implementations, each criterion, of the triggering criteria, may contribute equally to the index score. In some example implementations, each criterion, of the triggering criteria, may be assigned a weight so that one criterion may contribute more to the index score than another criterion.
In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may use the index scores of the relevant microsites, as the total scores described below, to rank the relevant microsites in the ranked list of microsites. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may modify the index scores with one or more other scores, such as a popularity score, a personalization score, and/or a social score, to generate total scores for the relevant microsites and rank the relevant microsites, in the ranked list of microsites, based on the total scores.
In some implementations, as described above, microsite ranking module 2320 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a popularity score of the microsite. The popularity score of a microsite may be generated based on user behavior data associated with the microsite, such as how many users expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 1910, and/or how many users expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 1910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, or purchasing a service or product associated with the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user behavior data, such as a quantity of times that the microsite has been presented to user devices 1910, an age of the microsite, a prior ranking or score of the microsite, or the like.
The popularity score, for a particular microsite, may be based on multiple factors. A popularity factor score may be calculated for each of the factors and these popularity factor scores may be combined to form the popularity score. In some example implementations, each of the popularity factor scores may contribute equally to the popularity score. In some example implementations, each of the popularity factor scores may be assigned a weight, such that one of the popularity factor scores may contribute more to the popularity score than another one of the popularity factor scores. A weight associated with a popularity factor score, corresponding to a particular popularity factor, may depend on how well the particular popularity factor is indicative of measuring the popularity of a microsite.
Additionally, or alternatively, microsite ranking module 2320 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a personalization score of the microsite. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated based on the user profile data, such as user activity data, associated with a user of a particular user device 1910, with regard to the microsite. The user activity data may include, for example, whether the user has expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 1910, and/or whether the user expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 1910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service or product associated with the microsite, bookmarking—e.g., saving—the microsite, orienting the particular user device 1910 to view the microsite without swiping away from the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user profile data, such as whether the user has recommended the microsite to one of the user's social contacts.
The personalization score, for a particular microsite, may be based on multiple factors. A personalization factor score may be calculated for each of the factors and these personalization factor scores may be combined to form the personalization score. In some example implementations, each of the personalization factor scores may contribute equally to the personalization score. In some example implementations, each of the personalization factor scores may be assigned a weight, or multiple weights, such that one of the personalization factor scores may contribute more to the personalization score than another one of the personalization factor scores. A weight associated with a personalization factor score, corresponding to a particular personalization factor, may depend on how well the particular personalization factor is indicative of measuring a user's interest in a microsite.
Additionally, or alternatively, microsite ranking module 2320 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a social score of the microsite. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated based on friend activity data, associated with social contacts—e.g., friends—of the user of a particular user device 1910, with regard to the microsite. The user's friends may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of friend activity data, associated with a microsite, include whether the user's friends have expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the friends' user devices 1910, and/or whether the user's friends expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the friends' user devices 1910, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service or product associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the friend activity data, such as whether the friends have recommended the microsite to others.
In some implementations, the friend activity data may correspond to the same data included in the user activity data. In some implementations, the friend activity data may include a subset—less than all—of the user activity data. For example, the friend activity data may include that data, of the user activity data, that can be anonymized—i.e., not traceable to a particular social contact. For example, the friend activity data may include information regarding ratings of microsites given by social contacts, and may not include information contained in communications of the social contacts. In some example implementations, particular friend activity data may be used only when the same friend activity data is available from at least a threshold quantity of social contacts. In some example implementations, particular friend activity data, associated with a particular social contact, may be used only with the express permission of the particular social contact.
In some implementations, the social score, for a particular user and a particular microsite, may be based on friend activity data of multiple social contacts. A social contact score may be calculated for each of the social contacts and these social contact scores may be combined to form the social score. In some example implementations, each of the social contact scores may contribute equally to the social score. In some example implementations, each of the social contact scores may be assigned a weight, such that one of the social contact scores may contribute more to the social score than another one of the social contact scores. A weight associated with a social contact score, corresponding to a particular social contact, may depend on how close of a friend the particular social contact is to the particular user. This may be determined in a number of different ways, such as whether the particular social contact is in an address book of the particular user, whether the particular user has friended the particular social contact in a social network, the quantity of social networks that the particular user has friended the particular social contact, the quantity of communications that the particular user has had with the particular social contact, the frequency of communications that the particular user has had with the particular social contact, or the like.
In some implementations, as described above, microsite ranking module 2320 may generate a total score for a relevant microsite based on a combination of the index score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may generate a total score for a relevant microsite based on a combination of the index score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, microsite ranking module 2320 may add the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score to the index score; multiply the index score by the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score; boost the index score based on the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score; or combine the index score with the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score using a combination of these and/or other ways of combining the index score with the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score.
In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a weighted combination of the index score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, microsite ranking module 2320 may assign a weight to the index score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. The weights may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the index score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary. Microsite ranking module 2320 may combine the weighted index score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score.
Microsite ranking module 2320 may generate a ranked list of microsites based on the total scores. For example, microsite ranking module 2320 may sort the relevant microsites based on the total scores for the relevant microsites. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may rank a relevant microsite, with a higher total score, closer to a top of the ranked list than another relevant microsite, with a lower total score. In some implementations, microsite ranking module 2320 may rank a relevant microsite, with a higher total score, closer to a bottom of the ranked list than another relevant microsite, with a lower total score.
While FIG. 23 shows a particular quantity and arrangement of modules, in some implementations, ranking module 2130 may include fewer modules, additional modules, different modules, or differently arranged modules.
As described above, ranking system 1920 may receive the user profile data and the sensor data from user device 1910. Ranking system 1920 may use the user profile data and/or the sensor data to identify a set of relevant microsites. Ranking system 1920 may compare the user profile data and/or the sensor data to the triggering criteria for a microsite and generate a score for the microsite based on a result of the comparison. As described above, ranking system 1920 may modify the score based on one or more factors, such as a popularity score, a personalization score, and/or a social score. Ranking system 1920 may select a set of microsites based on their scores and provide information, regarding the set of microsites, to user device 1910.
While FIG. 25 shows process 2500 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 2500 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
While FIG. 26 shows process 2600 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 2600 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
While FIG. 27 shows process 2700 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 2700 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel. Additionally, or alternatively, multiple instances of process 2700 may be performed concurrently for different microsites.
As shown at (A) in FIG. 28 , input module 2110, of ranking system 1920, may identify microsites for use by ranking system 1920. In some implementations, as described above, input module 2110 may identify microsites through crawling and/or via manual input. In either situation, input module 2110 may obtain information regarding a particular microsite, such as a descriptive name of the particular microsite, a network address for the particular microsite, triggering criteria for the particular microsite, and/or a list of sensors that are relevant for the particular microsite.
As shown at (B) in FIG. 28 , input module 2110, of ranking system 1920, may provide information regarding various microsites to indexing module 2120. Indexing module 2120 may store information regarding the microsites in one or more indexes. In some implementations, as described above, indexing module 2120 may store, for a particular microsite in an index, a descriptive name of the particular microsite, a network address for the particular microsite, triggering criteria for the particular microsite, and/or a list of sensors that are relevant for the particular microsite.
As shown at (C) in FIG. 28 , application module 2010, of user device 1910, may obtain user profile data from user profile module 2020 and/or may obtain sensor data from sensors module 2030. The user profile data may include various information regarding user device 1910 and/or a user of user device 1910. Examples of user profile data have been given above. The sensor data may include various information regarding user device 1910 and/or conditions associated with user device 1910. Examples of sensor data have been given above.
As shown at (D) in FIG. 28 , application module 2010 may provide the user profile data and/or the sensor data to ranking system 1920. As described above, application module 2010 may automatically—e.g., without requiring an instruction from a user of user device 1910—provide the user profile data and/or the sensor data to ranking system 1920. Ranking module 2130, of ranking system 1920, may receive the user profile data and/or the sensor data.
As shown at (E) in FIG. 28 , ranking module 2130 may use the user profile data and/or the sensor data to identify relevant microsites. As described above, in some implementations, ranking module 2130 may identify relevant microsites, in the index, based on the sensor data and the triggering criteria, and generate an index score for the relevant microsites based on a result of a matching of the sensor data to the triggering criteria. As also described above, in some implementations, ranking module 2130 may identify relevant microsites, in the index, based on the user profile data and the sensor data, and generate an index score for the relevant microsites based on a result of a matching of the user profile data and the sensor data to the triggering criteria. As described above, in some implementations, ranking module 2130 may modify the index score, for a microsite, based on one or more other scores to generate a total score for the microsite. Ranking module 2130 may use the total score to identify a set of relevant microsites.
As shown at (F) in FIG. 28 , ranking module 2130 may provide information, regarding the set of relevant microsites, to user device 1910. As explained above, in some implementations, the information may include, for each microsite in the set of relevant microsites, a network address for the microsite and a list of sensors relevant to the microsite. Application module 2010, of user device 1910, may receive the information regarding the set of relevant microsites.
As shown at (G) in FIG. 28 , application module 2010 may provide the information, regarding the set of relevant microsites, to display module 2040 of user device 1910. Display module 2040 may receive the information regarding the set of relevant microsites. Display module 2040 may obtain sensor data associated with the list of sensors that have been identified as relevant to the relevant microsites. For each relevant microsite, display module 2040 may generate a request that includes the network address for the relevant microsite and the sensor data relevant to the relevant microsite.
As shown at (H) in FIG. 28 , display module 2040 may transmit the requests to one or more servers 1930. Whether display module 2040 transmits the requests to more than one server 1930 depends on which server(s) 1930 is/are hosting the relevant microsites. In other words, all of the relevant microsites may be hosted by a single server 1930, all of the relevant microsites may be hosted by separate, different servers 1930, or something in between these two extremes.
Server(s) 1930 may receive the requests from user device 1910 may obtain content of the relevant microsites. In some implementations, as described above, the content of a relevant microsite may be dynamic in the sense that the content of the relevant microsite is based on the sensor data received from user device 1910.
As shown at (I) in FIG. 28 , server(s) 1930 may provide the content of the relevant microsites to user device 1910. Display module 2040, of user device 1910, may receive the content and present the content on a display associated with user device 1910. For example, display module 2040 may push the content, for the relevant microsites, as a sliding display of content. In some implementations, content for one of the relevant microsites may be presented on the display at a time. A user, of user device 1910, may interact with the content, using a finger or the like, to express the user's interest or disinterest in the content or to see the content for another one of the relevant microsites.
As shown in FIG. 30 , assume that the ranking system applies the sensor data to the triggering criteria, for the microsites in the index, to identify a set of relevant microsites. For example, the ranking system may compare the sensor data to the triggering criteria, for each of the microsites in the index, to identify which of the microsites are relevant to the sensor data. As shown in FIG. 30 , assume that the ranking system identifies the following relevant microsites: a bus notifier microsite, an Action League microsite, a Calendar microsite, a Rio Grand microsite, and a history microsite.
For the Action League microsite, assume that the index stores the following triggering criteria: user is within 100 meters of a theater showing the Action League movie AND the current time is within 60 minutes of the movie start time AND the user is moving less than 5 KPH. The ranking system may determine that the Carly's sensor data satisfies the triggering criteria. For example, assume that Carly is currently 50 meters from Regal Cinema which is showing the Action League movie, which satisfies the criterion that the user be within 100 meters of a theater showing the Action League movie. Further assume that the movie starts in 8 minutes, which satisfies the criterion that the current time be within 60 minutes of the movie start time. Based on Carly's sensor data, Carly is moving at 0.8 KPH, which satisfies the criterion that the user be moving less than 5 KPH.
As shown in FIG. 31 , assume that the ranking system applies the sensor data to the triggering criteria for the relevant microsites in the index to generate index scores for the relevant microsites. For example, the ranking system may compare the sensor data to the triggering criteria, for each of the relevant microsites, to generate the index scores. As described above, the ranking system may use a function, similar to the functions described with regard to FIGS. 24A-24C , to generate real values that may be used for the index scores.
For the Action League microsite, assume that the ranking system applies Carly's sensor data to the triggering criteria and generates an index score of 0.9—on an example scale of zero to one. Assume further that the Action League microsite is the top-scoring microsite among the relevant microsites.
As shown in FIG. 32 , the ranking system may determine a popularity score for a relevant microsite—shown as the Action League microsite in FIG. 32 . The ranking system may use various data, as described above. Examples of types of data, shown in FIG. 32 , include user behavior data relating to the Action League microsite; user rankings data relating to the Action League microsite; microsite age data corresponding to the age of the Action League microsite, and/or data reflecting the quantity of times that the Action League microsite has been presented to user devices 1910. Assume that the user behavior data indicates that users have previously followed a recommendation given by the Action League microsite by going to see the movie; that the user rankings data indicates that users have given the Action League microsites overall favorable ratings; that the microsite age data indicates that the Action League microsite is relatively new; and that the data reflecting the quantity of times that the microsite has been presented to user devices 1910 indicates that the Action League microsite has been presented 1,000 times. The ranking system may generate a popularity factor score for each of these types of data and combine the popularity factor scores to determine the popularity score for the Action League microsite.
As shown in FIG. 33 , the ranking system may determine a personalization score for Carly relative to the Action League microsite. The ranking system may use various data, as described above. Examples of types of data, shown in FIG. 33 , include search activity data corresponding to Carly's searches relating to the Action League movie; browsing activity data corresponding to Carly browsing the web for information relating to the Action League movie; communication activity data corresponding to Carly's communications involving the Action League movie; posting activity data relating to Carly's postings on social networks, blogs, or other public sites relating to the Action League movie; and microsite activity data corresponding to Carly's prior interactions with the Action League microsite. Assume that the search activity data indicates that Carly has performed one or more web searches for the Action League movie; that the browsing activity data indicates that Carly has accessed a trailer for the Action League movie; that the communication activity data indicates that Carly has sent two e-mails regarding the Action League movie; that the posting activity data indicates that Carly has posted a comment regarding the Action League movie on a social network; and that the microsite activity data indicates that Carly has not dismissed—e.g., swiped away—the Action League microsite when previously presented on Carly's watch. The ranking system may generate a personalization factor score for each of these types of data and combine the personalization factor scores to determine the personalization score for Carly relative to the Action League microsite.
As shown in FIG. 34 , the ranking system may determine a social score for Carly's social contacts relative to the Action League microsite. The ranking system may use various data, as described above. Examples of types of data, shown in FIG. 34 , include search activity data corresponding to Carly's social contacts' searches relating to the Action League movie; posting activity data relating to Carly's social contacts' postings on social networks, blogs, or other public sites relating to the Action League movie; and microsite activity data corresponding to Carly's social contacts' prior interactions with the Action League microsite. Assume that the search activity data indicates that Carly's social contacts have performed web searches for the Action League movie; that the posting activity data indicates that Carly's social contacts have posted several comments regarding the Action League movie on social networks; and that the microsite activity data indicates that Carly's social contacts have provided favorable ratings to the Action League microsite when previously presented to user devices of Carly's social contacts. The ranking system may generate a social factor score for each of these types of data and combine the social factor scores to determine the social score for Carly's social contacts relative to the Action League microsite.
As shown in FIG. 35 , the ranking system may input the index score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score into a scoring function. The scoring function may be a simple summation of these scores or something more complex. For example, the ranking system may assign weights to the different scores and combine the weighted scores using the scoring function to obtain a total score.
As shown in FIG. 36 , assume that the ranking system selects the top-scoring Action League microsite for presentation to Carly's watch. The ranking system may provide information regarding the Action League microsite to Carly's watch. As shown in FIG. 36 , the ranking system may provide a network address for the Action League microsite—shown as alm.com/micro—and a list of sensors for the Action League microsite—shown as time and location. Carly's watch may receive the network address and list of sensors and determine sensor data relating to the sensors on the list. Carly's watch may use the network address to access the Action League server and send the sensor data to the Action League server. The Action League server may generate or modify the content of the Action League microsite based on the sensor data and provide the content for presentation on a display of Carly's watch. As shown in FIG. 36 , Carly's watch may display information that the Action League movie starts in 8 minutes at the Regal Cinema, which is just two blocks from Carly's current location.
A system and method, described herein, may determine a relevant microsite to provide to a user device based on context data without the need for a user, of the user device, to request the microsite. The microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
A system and/or method, as described herein, may provide relevant microsites to a user device based on context data and without the need for a user, of the user device, to request the microsites. The context data may include user profile data relating to the user or the user device and/or sensor data relating to one or more conditions associated with the user device. In some implementations, the relevant microsites that are provided or the order in which the relevant microsites are provided to the user device may be based on whether the user has previously purchased any of the relevant microsites. The microsites may provide information that may be useful to the user.
Upon purchase of the microsite, the user may be presented with a list of triggering criteria that dictate when the purchased microsite will be provided to the user's device, as shown in FIG. 37B . The user may accept or edit the triggering criteria. Upon acceptance of the originally-presented triggering criteria or an edited version of the triggering criteria, the user's device may store, in a user profile, information relating to the purchased microsite, such as information identifying the microsite and possibly the triggering criteria. Assume, for example 3700, that the user accepts the original triggering criteria, which indicate that the Music ID microsite will be presented to the user's device when the user is at home, the time is not between 11 PM and 7 AM, and music is playing.
From time to time, the user's device may transmit, with the user's permission, sensor data to a ranking system. In addition, the user's device may transmit, with the user's permission, user profile data to the ranking system. Assume, at some point in time, the user's device transmits, as shown in FIG. 37C , sensor data, to the ranking system, that indicates that the current geographic location of the user's device corresponds to the user's home, that the time is 9 PM, and that music has been detected. In addition, the user's device may transmit, to the ranking system, information identifying microsites that have been purchased by the user. Thus, in example 3700, the user's device may transmit, to the ranking system, information identifying the Music ID microsite.
Based on the sensor data, assume that the ranking system identifies a group of microsites that are relevant to the sensor data. Since the sensor data satisfies the triggering criteria for the Music ID microsite, assume that the group of microsites includes the Music ID microsite. In addition, based on the information identifying microsites that have been purchased by the user, the ranking system may identify the Music ID microsite as the one that is to be provided to the user's device before the other microsites in the identified group. As a result, the ranking system may provide, to the user's device, an address for accessing the Music ID microsite, as illustrated in FIG. 37C .
The user's device may use the address to obtain the Music ID microsite from, for example, a server that hosts the microsite. As part of obtaining the microsite, the user's device may send an audio clip, containing a portion of the music detected by the user's device, to the server. The server may use the audio clip to identify the song and artist. The Music ID microsite may be presented to the user via the user's device, as shown in FIG. 37D . As shown, the Music ID microsite may present the name of the song that is currently playing in the user's home and the name of the artist of the song. Thus, a purchased microsite that is determined to be relevant to sensor data, received from a user's device, may be provided before other relevant microsites that have not been purchased.
While ranking system 3820 is shown as separate from servers 3830, it may be possible for ranking system 3820 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by a server 3830 and/or a server 3830 to perform one or more of the functions described as being performed by ranking system 3820. For example, ranking system 3820 may host some or all of the microsites. Additionally, or alternatively, a user device 3810 may host some of the microsites and/or may perform one or more of the functions of ranking system 3820.
Although FIG. 38 shows example components of environment 3800, in some implementations, environment 3800 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, or differently arranged components than those depicted in FIG. 38 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components of environment 3800 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment 3800.
As shown in FIG. 39 , user device 3810 may include an application component 3910, a user profile component 3920, a sensors component 3930, and a display component 3940. Application component 3910 may control the operation of user device 3810 with regard to the presentation of microsites on user device 3810. In some implementations, application component 3910 may take the form of a browser application. In some implementations, application component 3910 may automatically run when user device 3810 powers on or boots up, or may run when instructed by a user of user device 3810. In some implementations, application component 3910 may run in the background on user device 3810. The user, of user device 3810, may stop application component 3910 from running at any time.
Examples of user profile data may include information identifying a microsite that has been purchased via user device 3810; information identifying a date on which a microsite was purchased; information identifying a time at which the microsite was purchased; user-modified triggering criteria for a purchased microsite; rankings for purchased microsites; geographic addresses associated with the user, such as the address of the user's home, the address of the user's place of business, the address of a location frequented by the user, etc.; information inputted into a calendar associated with the user; information regarding the user's interaction with microsites that have been presented to the user, such as ratings given to the microsites, whether the user has dismissed—e.g., swiped away—from microsites that have been presented to the user, or the like; information regarding the user's communications, such as e-mails, text messages, instant messages, voicemail messages, or the like; information regarding the user's activity on the web, such as information regarding the user's searches, the user's browsing activity, the user's posts on social networks, blogs, and/or other public web sites; information regarding activities on the web of the user's social contacts, such as people with which the user has communicated, or other people having a social relationship with the user, names and/or identifiers—e.g., identifiers that are anonymized with regard to the identities of particular individuals—of people listed in the user's address book, people friended by the user on social networks or other public web sites; and/or information regarding the user's habits, such as places that the user has visited, things that the user has done, at what time the user usually gets up in the morning, or the like. While certain examples of user profile data have been identified above, other types of user profile data are possible.
The user may review, add, remove, and/or revise the user profile data at any time. In some implementations, the user may specify what type of information is to be used for the user profile data. For example, the user may specify that the information regarding the user's activity on the web is to be used for the user profile data, and the information regarding the user's communications and the information regarding the user's friends' activities on the web are not to be used for user profile data.
Examples of sensor data may include information regarding a current geographic location of user device 3810; information regarding sounds occurring at or around user device 3810; information regarding current lighting condition at user device 3810; information regarding a current date and/or time associated with user device 3810; information regarding a current speed of user device 3810; information regarding a current direction in which user device 3810 is moving; information regarding a current orientation or change in orientation of user device 3810; information regarding a current weather condition in the location in which user device 3810 is located; information regarding a current temperature in the location in which user device 3810 is located; and/or information regarding interaction of user device 3810 with other devices with which user device 3810 is in communication. While certain examples of sensor data have been identified above, other types of sensor data are possible.
The user may specify what type of information is to be used for the sensor data. For example, the user may specify that the current geographic location, the current time, the current speed, the current direction, and the current orientation or change in orientation of user device 3810 are to be used for the sensor data, and the interaction of user device 3810 with other devices is not to be used for the sensor data.
In some implementations, display component 3940 may push the content to the display so as to override any content already on the display. In some implementations, display component 3940 may determine an appropriate time to render the content of the microsite, such as when user device 3810 is idle for a particular amount of time, when user device 3810 is in a lock mode, when user device 3810 is in a particular orientation, or the like. In some implementations, a user of user device 3810 may specify how and when the user will be presented with the content of a microsite. For example, the user may specify that the content of a microsite can only be presented between 8 AM and 8 PM on weekdays and between 12 PM and 11 PM on weekends; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is located in her home state of Virginia; that the content of a microsite can only be presented when the user is moving at a speed of less than 20 KPH; or the like.
In some implementations, display component 3940 may present the content of the microsite on the display of user device 3810 for a particular amount of time and, thereafter, remove the content of the microsite from the display. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be configurable by the user of user device 3810. In some example implementations, the particular amount of time may be preset by application component 3910, by an entity associated with ranking system 3820, or by an entity associated with server 3830 hosting the content of the microsite.
In some implementations, display component 3940 may present the content of the microsite within a particular region of the display of user device 3810. The particular region may include the entire display area of the display or a subset of the entire display area of the display. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be configurable by the user of user device 3810. In some example implementations, the size and/or location of the particular region may be preset by application component 3910, by an entity associated with ranking system 3820, or by an entity associated with server 3830 hosting the content of the microsite.
A user may interact with the content of the microsite to dismiss the content—e.g., by swiping the content—or to obtain additional information regarding the content—e.g., by selecting the content. The user's interaction with the microsite content may be recorded as user profile data by user profile component 3920.
Although FIG. 39 shows example functional components of user device 3810, in some implementations, user device 3810 may include additional functional components, different functional components, or fewer functional components than those depicted in FIG. 39 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of user device 3810 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of user device 3810.
In some implementations, input component 4010 may identify microsites via manual input. For example, input component 4010 may provide a user interface via which microsite designers may provide information regarding microsites that the microsite designers have created. In some implementations, a microsite designer, via the user interface, may identify a network address, such as a URL, associated with a microsite. Additionally, or alternatively, the microsite designer, via the user interface, may upload the content of the microsite. The content of the microsite may be hosted by ranking system 3820 or a device separate from ranking system 3820, such as a server 3830.
In some example implementations, ranking component 4030 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on one or more factors. For example, ranking component 4030 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a popularity score of the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated based on user behavior data associated with the microsite, such as how many users expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 3810, and/or how many users expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to a user device 3810, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, or purchasing a service associated with the microsite. In some implementations, the popularity score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user behavior data, such as a quantity of times that the microsite has been presented to user devices 3810, an age of the microsite, a prior ranking or score of the microsite, or the like.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking component 4030 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a personalization score of the microsite. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated based on the user profile data, such as user activity data, associated with a user of a particular user device 3810, with regard to the microsite. The user activity data may include, for example, information relating to whether the user has expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 3810, and/or whether the user expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the particular user device 3810, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the personalization score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the user activity data, such as whether the user has recommended the microsite to one of the user's social contacts.
Additionally, or alternatively, ranking component 4030 may modify the score, of a microsite, based on a social score of the microsite. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated based on social contact activity data, associated with social contacts—e.g., friends—of the user of a particular user device 3810, with regard to the microsite. The user's social contacts may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of social contact activity data, associated with a microsite, include whether the user's social contacts have expressed disinterest in the microsite by, for example, swiping away from the microsite or providing a negative rating when the microsite was presented to the social contacts' user devices 3810, and/or whether the user's social contacts expressed interest in the microsite by, for example, providing a positive rating when the microsite was presented to the social contacts' user devices 3810, requesting additional information regarding the microsite, purchasing a service associated with the microsite, bookmarking the microsite, and/or following a recommendation provided by the microsite—e.g., a recommendation to visit a particular restaurant, see a particular movie, ride a particular bus, or the like. In some implementations, the social score of a microsite may be generated using one or more factors instead of, or in addition to, the social contact activity data, such as whether the social contacts have recommended the microsite to others.
In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score and the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate a total score for a microsite based on a weighted combination of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score. For example, ranking component 4030 may assign a weight value to the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and/or the social score. The weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score, the popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score contributes to the total score may vary. Ranking component 4030 may combine the weighted score, the weighted popularity score, the weighted personalization score, and/or the weighted social score to generate the total score.
In some implementations, the user profile data may indicate that one or more of the relevant microsites, in the ranked list, have been purchased by user device 3810. In these implementations, ranking component 4030 may adjust the ranking of the one or more relevant microsites, in the ranked list, by, for example, moving those purchased microsites to the top of the ranked list. Thus, those relevant microsites, which have been purchased by user device 3810, may be ranked more highly than those relevant microsites that have not been purchased by user device 3810.
In some implementations, when ranking component 4030 determines that the user profile data indicates that one or more of microsites, in set of microsites that have been identified as relevant to received sensor data, have been purchased by user device 3810, ranking component 4030 may generate scores for only the one or more purchased microsites. In addition, ranking component 4030 may form a list that includes only those microsites that have been purchased. In these situations, ranking component 4030 may form a ranked list by sorting the microsites, in the formed list, based on their scores and/or other factors.
In any of the above situations, ranking component 4030 may provide information, regarding the ranked list of microsites, to user device 3810. In some implementations, the information may include a network address and/or a list of sensors for each microsite in the set of microsites. In some implementations, the network addresses of the microsites may be provided in a ranked list based on the scores of the microsites. In some implementations, the network addresses of the microsites may be provided along with the scores of the microsites.
Although FIG. 40 shows example functional components of ranking system 3820, in some implementations, ranking system 3820 may include additional functional components, different functional components, or fewer functional components than those depicted in FIG. 40 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more functional components of ranking system 3820 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of ranking system 3820.
While FIG. 41 shows process 4100 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 4100 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
While FIG. 42 shows process 4200 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 4200 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate the scores for the microsites based on the quantity of triggering criteria in the triggering criteria. For example, if the triggering criteria for a first relevant microsite include 5 different triggering criteria and if the triggering criteria for a second relevant microsite include 2 different triggering criteria, ranking component 4030 may generate a higher score for the first relevant microsite than the second relevant microsite.
In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate scores for the microsites based on a degree to which the sensor data matches the triggering criteria. For example, assume that the sensor data indicates that the current time is 8:55 PM. Also, assume that a first set of triggering criteria, for a first relevant microsite, includes a time range of 8 PM to 1 AM, and a second set of triggering criteria, for a second relevant microsite, includes a time range of 8 PM to 9 PM. Since the current time, as indicated by the sensor data, is closer to the beginning of the time range for the first set of triggering criteria and closer to the end of the time range for the second set of triggering criteria, ranking component 4030 may give a higher score to the first relevant microsite than the second relevant microsite.
In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may generate an initial score for each microsite, in the group of microsites, based on the sensor data and/or the user profile data. Ranking component 4030 may modify the initial score, of a microsite, based on one or more factors to obtain the score for the microsite. The one or more factors may include, for example, a popularity score of the microsite, a personalization score of the microsite, a social score of the microsite, and/or another factor. The popularity score, the personalization score, and the social score were discussed above with respect to FIG. 40 . Other ways of obtaining a score for a microsite may alternatively be used.
When the group of microsites includes single purchased microsite (block 4315—YES), process 4300 may include creating a list of microsites that are sorted based on the generated scores (block 4320). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a list that includes information identifying the microsites. Ranking component 4030 may sort the list in descending order, such that information identifying the microsite with the highest generated score appears at the top of the list and information identifying the microsite with the lowest generated score appears at the bottom of the list.
When the group of microsites does not include a single purchased microsite (block 4315—NO), process 4300 may include determining whether the group of microsites includes more than one purchased microsite (block 4330). For example, ranking component 4030 may parse the user profile data, provided by user device 3810, to identify microsites that have been purchased. Ranking component 4030 may compare the identified microsites to the microsites in the group of relevant microsites to determine whether the group of microsites includes multiple purchased microsites.
When the group of microsites does not include more than one purchased microsite (block 4330—NO), process 4300 may include creating a ranked list of microsites by sorting the microsites, in the group of microsites, based on the generated scores (block 4335). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a list that includes information identifying the microsites. Ranking component 4030 may generate a ranked list of microsites by sorting the list in descending order, such that information identifying the microsite with the highest generated score appears at the top of the list and information identifying the microsite with the lowest generated score appears at the bottom of the list. In this way, ranking component 4030 ensures that the microsite, with the highest generated score, is rendered, by user device 3810, before any other microsite in the ranked list.
When the group of microsites includes more than one purchased microsite (block 4330—YES), process 4300 may include creating a list of microsites that are sorted based on the generated scores (block 4340, FIG. 43B ). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a list that includes information identifying the microsites. Ranking component 4030 may sort the list in descending order, such that information identifying the microsite with the highest generated score appears at the top of the list and information identifying the microsite with the lowest generated score appears at the bottom of the list.
Similarly, the user profile data may include rating information that indicates rating values for the purchased microsites. The rating values may provide an indication of how much the user likes or dislikes the purchased microsites. As one example, assume that the user has purchased, via user device 3810, three microsites, named MICROSITE A, MICROSITE B, and MICROSITE C. In addition, assume that the user has given MICROSITE A a rating of 4, MICROSITE B a rating of 1, and MICROSITE C a rating of 3. The user profile data, provided by user device 3810, may include this rating information.
When the purchased microsites have been ranked or rated by the user (block 4345—YES), process 4300 may include moving the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list, in an order based on the rankings/ratings, to create a ranked list of microsites (block 4350). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a ranked list of microsites by moving the information for the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list. Ranking component 4030 may sort the purchased microsites, at the top of the sorted list, based on the rankings/ratings in the user profile data. For example, if the user profile data includes ranking information, ranking component 4030 may rank the purchased microsites in the order specified by the ranking information. Thus, in the example given above, if the sorted list of microsites includes MICROSITE A and MICROSITE B, ranking component 4030 may move information identifying MICROSITE B to the top of the list, followed by information identifying MICROSITE A.
If the user profile data includes rating information, ranking component 4030 may rank the purchased microsites in the order specified by the rating information. Thus, in the example given above, if the sorted list of microsites includes MICROSITE A, MICROSITE B, and MICROSITE C, ranking component 4030 may move information identifying MICROSITE A to the top of the list, followed by information identifying MICROSITE C, and followed by information identifying MICROSITE B.
If the user profile data includes ranking information and rating information, ranking component 4030 may rank the purchased microsites in an order based on the ranking information and the rating information. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may consider the ranking information and may ignore the rating information in determining how to rank the purchased microsites in the sorted list. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may consider the rating information and may ignore the ranking information in determining how to rank the purchased microsites in the sorted list. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may assign weights to the rating information, where those weights may affect the ranking information for the purchased microsites. Other manners of using the ranking information and the rating information to determine an order of the purchased microsites, in the sorted list, may alternatively be used.
In this way, ranking component 4030 may ensure that the purchased microsites are rendered, by user device 3810, before non-purchased microsites in the ranked list.
When the microsites have not been ranked or rated by the user (block 4345—NO), process 4300 may include determining whether the generated score of one purchased microsite is larger than the generated score for another purchased microsite (block 4355). For example, ranking component 4030 may compare the generated scores of the purchased microsites to determine whether the score of one purchased microsite is larger than the score of another purchased microsite.
When the generated score of one purchased microsite is larger than the generated score for another purchased microsite (block 4355—YES), process 4300 may include moving the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list, in an order based on the generated scores, to create a ranked list of microsites (block 4360). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a ranked list of microsites by moving the information for the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list. Ranking component 4030 may sort the purchased microsites, at the top of the sorted list, based on the generated scores. For example, assuming ranking component 4030 generates a score of 0.9 for MICROSITE A and a score of 0.95 for MICROSITE B, ranking component 4030 may move information identifying MICROSITE B to the top of the list, followed by information identifying MICROSITE A.
In this way, ranking component 4030 may ensure that the purchased microsites are rendered, by user device 3810, before non-purchased microsites in the ranked list.
When the generated score of one purchased microsite is not larger than the generated score for another purchased microsite (block 4355—NO), process 4300 may include moving the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list, in an order based on the dates/times that the microsites were purchased, to create a ranked list of microsites (block 4365). For example, ranking component 4030 may create a ranked list of microsites by moving the information for the purchased microsites to the top of the sorted list. Ranking component 4030 may sort the purchased microsites, at the top of the sorted list, based on the dates/times that the microsites were purchased. In some implementations, ranking component 4030 may sort the purchased microsites in a descending date/time order. For example, assume that MICROSITE A was purchased on Jul. 12, 2011 and that MICROSITE B was purchased on Nov. 29, 2010. In this situation, ranking component 4030 may move information identifying MICROSITE A to the top of the list, followed by information identifying MICROSITE B. Other ways for sorting the purchased microsites based on the dates/times of purchase may alternatively be used.
In this way, ranking component 4030 may ensure that the purchased microsites are rendered, by user device 3810, before non-purchased microsites in the ranked list.
While FIG. 43 shows process 4300 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations, process 4300 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.
Further, assume, as shown in FIG. 44A , that Mary's watch periodically sends, as depicted by reference number 4410, sensor data and user profile data to ranking system 3820. In addition, assume that the user profile data includes, among other things, information identifying the workout microsite.
With reference to FIG. 44B , ranking component 4030, of ranking system 3820, may receive sensor data and user profile data 4410. Ranking component 4030 may identify a group 4420 of microsites that are relevant to the sensor data and/or the user profile data and generate a score 4430 for each microsite in group 4420. Ranking component 4030 may sort the microsites, in group 4420, based on scores 4430 to form a sorted list 4440 of microsites. As shown in FIG. 44B , sorted list 4440 includes a bus stops microsite as the top ranking microsite, followed by a coffee microsite, the workout microsite, a restaurant microsite, and a banks microsite. Since the workout microsite was purchased by Mary, ranking component 4030 may modify sorted list 4440, by moving the workout microsite to the top of the list, to create a ranked list 4450. A shown, ranked list 4450 includes the workout microsite as the top ranking microsite, followed by the bus stops microsite, the coffee microsite, the restaurant microsite, and the banks microsite.
With reference to FIG. 44C , ranking system 3820 may provide ranked list 4450 to Mary's watch. In addition to ranked list 4450, ranking system 3820 may provide other information, as discussed above, such as a list of sensors for each microsite identified in ranked list 4450.
With reference to FIG. 44D , Mary's watch may receive ranked list 4450 and send a request for one or more of the microsites in ranked list 4450. Since the workout microsite is the highest ranking microsite in ranked list 4450, Mary's watch may cause the workout microsite to be rendered for display prior to the other microsites in ranked list 4450. Thus, since Mary paid for the workout microsite, the workout microsite may be given priority over other microsites, including higher scoring microsites.
A system and method, described herein, may cause a purchased microsite to be presented (e.g., pushed) to a user device before other microsites, including microsites that may be scored higher than the purchased microsite. The purchased microsite may provide information that may be useful to the user.
The signal based recommender system 4502 can use crowd-sourced content segments to identify user intentions. The signal based recommender system 4502 can obtain crowd-sourced (e.g., sent by many users) content and other information (e.g., location) from public sites. Public sites are sites that can be accessed at least in part without requiring a login. For example, public sites contain publicly available content. One or more user devices (e.g., a user device 4508) can communicate with the signal based recommender system 4502 using a network 4510. The signal based recommender system 4502 can provide one or more search results that can predict what a user might intend to search given a location and previously obtained content segments around the user's location.
In some implementations, a classifier 4504 resides within the signal based recommender system 4502. In some other implementations, the classifier 4504 resides on a data processing apparatus separate from the signal based recommender system 4502. The classifier 4504 can classify content segments into categories. The use of categories can aid a search system in increasing relevancy of its search results. In some implementations, a search system 4505 resides within the signal based recommender system 4502. In some other implementations, the search system 4505 resides on a data processing apparatus separate from the signal based recommender system 4502. The search system 4505 can perform searches on relevant content segments to obtain a search result.
The signal based recommender system 4502 can also communicate with a database 4506. The database 4506 is an electronic file system, a distributed file system, or other network-accessible persistent storage that can store information on computer-readable storage media. In some implementations, the database 4506 is a database of intentions. The database of intentions includes data representing a general intention of users who perform mobile searches or access social media content, which can be data obtained from social networks. For example, if a user enters “gourmet restaurants” as a mobile search query, the system determines that the user intends to find information about gourmet restaurants.
The system obtains content segments from various sources 4602. The system can retrieve numerous content segments from multiple sources. In some implementations, content segments are “crowd-sourced” such that the content segments correspond to information that is entered by many users. For example, potential sources of crowd-sourced content segments include social network feeds and posts to social sites or blogs. Sources of content segments can also include mobile search queries entered by a group of users.
After receiving content segments, the system can aggregate the content segments and process them. The initial processing can include one or more of spam removal, clustering, high frequency, and local relevance. In some implementations, if a content segment is not filtered out as a result of the processing, the content segment is entered into a database of intentions.
The system can filter the content segments according to a classification algorithm trained to filter spam information 4604. Spam information can be unwanted or unsolicited information that is marketing a product or service (e.g., pornography). Spam information can also include high frequency terms that lead to high trafficked sites, e.g., a search engine destination page or a social network page. The system can filter out spam information by detecting spam-like keywords. For example, search queries associated with pornography can be filtered out. The classification algorithm can be implemented, for example, using a classifier (e.g., classifier 4504 within the signal based recommender system 4502 or a separate classifier from the signal based recommender system 4502).
The system clusters the content segments 4606. In some implementations, the system clusters the content segments to aggregate content segments with small typographical differences. For example, if text of one content segment is “gourmet restaurant” while text of another content segment has ‘restaurant’ misspelled, e.g., “gourmet restaurants,” the aggregation of the two content segments can result in one content segment of “gourmet restaurant.”
The system can also cluster content segments to remove duplicates. For example, if text of two unique content segments both contain “gourmet restaurant,” the aggregation of the two content segments can result in one content segment of “gourmet restaurant.” This filtering allows the system to remove repeated entries of content segments. When the system aggregates content segments, the system keeps track of each content segment's aggregation frequency and considers the aggregation frequency as a factor in determining a popularity metric as will be described below. In some implementations, the server uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to cluster the content segments.
The clustered content segments can be filtered according to a frequency threshold 4608. The system implements the frequency threshold to remove rarely occurring content segments. If a content segment does not appear enough to meet the frequency threshold, the system determines that the content segment is not relevant enough to present to users. In some implementations, the frequency threshold is a specified value indicating a frequency of occurrence of the content segment (e.g., the content segment must appear at least 50 times). In some other implementations, the frequency threshold is dynamically adjusted by the system based on one or more criteria (e.g., the number of received total content segments, or the number of received content segments over a specified time).
The content segments are filtered by a local relevance score 4610. A local relevance score can be based on one or more signals of a content segment. In some implementations, these signals include location, time, aggregation frequency of the content segment, current events, or other information. For example, the system may give a higher local relevance score to a content segment about a highly-searched event near a location at a certain time. Also, mobile searches can be given a higher local relevance score because mobile searches can include metadata about a location and a timestamp at which the search occurred. In some implementations, if the local relevance score is low, the system discards the content segment.
After some content segments are filtered out, the system classifies the remaining content segments into categories 4612. The categories can be locally relevant. For example, categories include places, movies, shopping items, health, or weather. The system uses a classifier to group content segments into categories.
The system assigns each content segment a popularity metric 4614. The popularity metric indicates a level of a content segment's appearance frequency. In some implementations, the popularity metric is based on the number of search queries that include the content segment. In some implementations, the popularity metric is based on one or more parameters that indicate a number of “reposts” on social media channels (e.g., social feeds, social sites). A repost can be a content segment that has previously been posted on a social media website. For example, if a content segment is a mobile search query about a popular event and the mobile search query has metadata including a timestamp, the content segment may be given a higher score if the current time at the location is close to the timestamp embedded in the mobile query search. In another example, if a content segment is about a movie, the content segment may be given a higher score if the movie is a new movie that has just been released. If a content segment is about a sale at a department store and the content segment includes an end date of the sale, the content segment may be given a higher score if the sale is ending shortly and reassigned a lower score after the sale ends. In some alternative implementations, instead of assigning a popularity metric, the system assigns a social graph distance that measures how relevant the content segment is to a user.
In some implementations, if the content segment is a mobile search query, the system also filters out the mobile search query's “long tail,” meaning the system removes terms from the query if the query is over a specified length. For example, if text of the query is “gourmet restaurants in san jose having a bar,” the system can remove the “long tail” and convert the content segment into “gourmet restaurants.”
After assigning each content segment a popularity metric, the system stores the content segments 4616. For example, the system can input each content segment along with one or more associated parameters into the database of intentions. The one or more associated parameters can be generated by the system, e.g., the popularity metric can be generated as described above. Signals associated with the content segment can also be stored as associated parameters. For example, if the content segment is a mobile search query, signals associated with the content segment can include items of mobile search query metadata. The mobile search query metadata can be obtained from search query logs. Alternatively, the system can obtain mobile search query metadata, along with other signals, from data that is sent from one or more mobile devices. For other kinds of content segments, signals associated with the content segment can include items of metadata otherwise associated with the content segment.
A row in a table of the database of intentions about a mobile search query includes a unique identification number, a date, an hour, a latitude and longitude geolocation, text of the content segment, a category, a query count indicating a number of times the content segment has been queried, and a popularity metric. In some implementations, if two content segments are determined to be duplicates, the content segment having the higher popularity metric is stored. An example row within a database of intentions is shown below:
Content | Query | Popularity | ||||||
ID | Date | Hour | Latitude | Longitude | Segment | Category | Count | metric |
Id = 3 | Jul. 19, 2011 | 20 | 34.0522 | −118.2437 | Gourmet | Place | 1000000 | 1.0 |
restaurant | ||||||||
An example row for a content segment about a social media post is shown below:
Content | Repost | Popularity | |||||||
ID | Date | Hour | Latitude | Longitude | Segment | Category | Count | metric | |
Id = 4 | Jul. 18, 2011 | 11 | 26.0522 | −95.2437 | | Place | 500 | 1.0 | |
In some implementations, a row in the table of intentions is expanded to include a variety of signals based on sensors of a mobile device of a user. For example, other signals can include the acceleration of the mobile device, or whether the mobile device is geographically near a friend of the user.
The system receives a query 4702. The query can be received from a user device, for example, a computer, a laptop, a tablet, a watch, or a mobile phone. The user device can submit the query, for example, to obtain a relevant entry from the database of intentions. In some implementations, the user provides an input to the user device, which in turn causes the user device to send the query to the server. In some alternative implementations, the user does not provide any input to the user device, but the user device periodically sends requests to the system. For example, the user device can request a response from the server according to a fixed schedule or a location of the user device. The user device can also request a response from the server based on content segment activity around the user device's location (e.g., many content segments are added to the database of intentions near a location at a specific time). The submission of the query can also be triggered by different events, such as a wake-up from a user device's sleep mode. The query can contain information specific to the user device. For example, the query can contain location, time, user data, or prior search query data of the user device.
The system identifies a location of interest 4704 from a database of intentions (e.g., a database of intentions described above with respect to FIG. 46 ) that is near the user device's location. In some implementations, the location of interest is a city. In some implementations, the location of interest includes all locations within a specified radius around the user device's location. The radius can be fixed or dynamically adjusted by the system.
The system determines a relevant entry 4706 by identifying entries from the database of intentions that match the location of interest and selecting one entry that is near the identified location of interest based on one or more factors discussed below. If the location of interest is a city, the system can determine a relevant entry that relates to the city, similarly for a neighborhood within a city. In some implementations, the system considers a popularity metric for each content segment. If the content segment is a mobile search query, the system considers the number of times the mobile search query has been queried. If the content segment is a social media post, the system can consider the number of times the social media post is reposted. The system can also consider one or more parameters that indicate a user's preferences. For example, if a user has specified that the user wants a search result related to restaurants, the system can determine a relevant entry from restaurants in the database of intentions.
The system also considers the location, date, and/or time associated with the user device when processing the query. For example, if a user device sends a query at 12 AM on a Friday and the user device is located outside a bar, the system can consider the time, date, location, user preferences, and popularity metric. If many users are searching for “taxi cabs” at the time, date, and location (e.g., using mobile search queries), a content segment about taxi cabs may have a high popularity metric. If the content segment has the highest popularity metric compared to other content segments, the system can select the content segment about “taxi cabs” as the most relevant entry.
In some implementations, the system filters out content segments that include generic information less likely to be searched by a user. For example, if the content segment is about a city or country, the system can serve the next relevant result because the user presumably is not seeking information regarding the city or country in which he or she is located.
After selecting the relevant entry, the system performs a local search (e.g., a search that has a restriction based on location) that includes the entry's content segment 4708. In some implementations, the system queries a service for further details about the content segment. For example, if the content segment is in the place category, the system queries a places Application Program Interface (API) for more information regarding the place. Information from the places API can include the content segment's address, location, reviews, telephone number, operating hours, or other local information. The server may also search using other local API's.
The system can also perform a local search on the relevant entry by using a search mechanism related to the category from the content segment's row in the database of intentions. For example, if the user were to have submitted a query when the user is near a latitude and longitude of (34.0522, −118.2437) at hour 20 on a day similar to 07/19 (see table above), the system can determine “gourmet restaurant” as the relevant entry and run a “places” search for “gourmet restaurant” centered near the user device's coordinates using a search system within the signal based recommender system, or by submitting a search to a search system.
After performing the local search, the system obtains one or more responsive search results. The system selects a search result from the search results. In some implementations, the system selects a specific search result by choosing the top-ranked search result.
In some alternative implementations, the system sends the relevant entry to a search engine. The search engine can show the relevant entry as a search suggestion, e.g., the suggestion can be shown near or in a search field. The system provides information about the selected search result to the user device 4710. In some implementations, the system obtains the information from local API's. For example, if the system searches for “gourmet restaurant,” the system can obtain multiple responsive local search results from an API including information about local businesses. If the selected search result is of a gourmet restaurant called “Country Gourmet Restaurants,” the system can obtain the name, address, phone number, and average reviews of Country Gourmet Restaurant (e.g., from the API) and send the information to the user device.
The storage device 4906 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 4900. In some implementations, storage device 4906 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations.
