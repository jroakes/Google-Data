Definitions
- Getting a potential customer to a business location in order to conduct a sale may be one of the most difficult tasks for a business or advertiser.
- An advertiser may have to offer various inducements, such as coupons, discounts, parking validations, etc., in order to entice customers to the location.
- “brick and mortar” businesses may even be forced to invest in more costly real estate near high-traffic areas as opposed to lower-cost real estate in more isolated locations.
- products may have higher profit margins for the advertiser which justify providing customers with free or low cost transportation (such as rental car agencies).
- the advertiser may still conduct intensive cost analyses and arrange complicated route planning with transit vendors. These factors may create a significant financial burden to a business.
- advertisers In Internet-based commerce, advertisers often compete for “conversions,” or completed consumer transactions. Generally, advertisers may specify a maximum bid for a conversion and are charged each time a customer is directed to the advertiser's web site in order to complete the transaction. This, however, does not take into account (as it may not be required) the cost of transporting the customer to a business location to physically inspect merchandise or services.
- Some offline advertising services also use this conversion-based advertising model by charging businesses for the cost of completed consumer actions, such as a sale, a visit, or providing personal information. Usually, this is accomplished by providing customers with a coupon or other item which is tied to a tracking code that shows how the customer was informed about the store or promotion. Again, these services do not take into account the cost (economic and temporal) of transporting a customer to a business location and place the burden of traveling to the business's location entirely on the customer.
- the present invention relates generally to arranging for free or discounted transportation to an advertiser's business location. More specifically, aspects of the invention involve automatically comparing the cost of transportation and the potential profit from a completed transaction using real-time analysis. For example, the system may consider various factors including a consumer's current location, the consumer's most likely route and form of transportation (such as train, personal car, taxi, rental car, or shared vehicle), the consumer's daily agenda, the price competing advertisers are willing to pay for the customer to be delivered to alternate locations, and other costs. In this regard, the customer's obstacles to entering a business location are reduced while routing and cost calculations are automatically handled based on the demand for the advertiser's goods and potential profit margins.
- the consumer's current location the consumer's most likely route and form of transportation (such as train, personal car, taxi, rental car, or shared vehicle)
- the consumer's daily agenda the price competing advertisers are willing to pay for the customer to be delivered to alternate locations, and other costs.

- FIGS. 1-2 Although only a few computers are depicted in FIGS. 1-2 , it should be appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected computers.
- Each client device may be configured similarly to the server 110 , with a processor, memory and instructions as described above.
- Each client device 160 or 170 may be a personal computer intended for use by a person 191 - 192 , and have all of the components normally used in connection with a personal computer such as a central processing unit (CPU) 162 , memory (e.g., RAM and internal hard drives) storing data 163 and instructions 164 , an electronic display 165 (e.g., a monitor having a screen, a touch-screen, a projector, a television, a computer printer or any other electrical device that is operable to display information), end user input 166 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen or microphone).
- the client device may also include a camera 167 , position component 168 , accelerometer, speakers, a network interface device, a battery power supply 169 or other power source, and all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another.
- the client devices may also include geographic position component 168 , to determine the geographic location and orientation of the device.
- client device 170 may include a GPS receiver to determine the device's latitude, longitude and altitude position. Thus, as the client device changes location, for example by being physically moved, the GPS receiver may determine a new current location.
- the component 168 may also comprise software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the client device 170 , such as signals received at a cell phone's antennas from one or more cell phone towers if the client device is a cell phone. As described below, this information may be transmitted by the client device to the server with the user's permission.
- client devices 160 and 170 may each comprise a full-sized personal computer, they may alternatively comprise mobile devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data, including position information derived from position component 168 , with a server over a network such as the Internet.
- client device 160 may be a wireless-enabled PDA or a cellular phone capable of obtaining information via the Internet.
- the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a BLACKBERRY-type phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cellular phone) or a touch screen (in the case of a PDA or tablet-type PC).
- Data 134 of server 110 may include advertiser data 136 .
- the advertiser data may include various types of information associated with advertisers and their advertisements.
- the advertiser data may include advertisements 137 and associated content such as text, images, video, or incentives (coupons, discounts, sales, credits, etc.) which server 110 may use to display advertisements to users.
- the advertiser data may also include business location data 138 provided by an advertiser.
- This location data may correspond to a showroom or retail space associated with an advertisement.
- the information may include an address, contact information, inventory numbers, parking details, or other relevant features associated with the location.
- Each advertiser may also identify target customer profiles 139 for one or more advertisements. These customer profiles may include preferred demographics, geographic locations (or areas), or behavioral indications of shopping interests. The target customer profiles may be tailored to the needs of the advertiser and the goods or services advertised in a particular advertisement.
- the advertiser may also provide server 110 with bid data 140 .
- the bid data may include, for example, the maximum price an advertiser is willing to pay to have a customer matching a certain profile arrive at a business location and/or take some action, such as a purchase of goods or services.
- the server may also determine the likelihood of a successful advertising campaign based on the size of the eligible consuming public which the server knows may satisfy the profile and use this information to assist the advertiser in selecting reasonable bids. Advertisers may also select multiple types of profile criteria and adjust their bids based on the availability of each criterion. For example, an advertiser may bid $5.00 to reach males, $5.50 to reach females, and reduce bids by 70% during non-business hours.
- Advertisers may also designate bids based on various transportation-based criteria. For example, advertisers may bid based on a current or typical distance of the customer to the business location. An advertiser may select to bid (or to bid more) for customers that are closer to the business location as these customers may live nearby and be more likely to return to the business location. Alternatively, the advertiser may select to bid for customers that are farther away as these customers may be unwilling to travel long distances without having the advertiser subsidize the trip.
- Advertisers may also designate bids based on the type or total cost of transporting the customer to the business location. For example, an advertiser may designate a bid amount and allow the system to select transportation option such as autonomous vehicles or public transportation for the customer that meets the advertiser's goals. Alternatively, the advertiser may designate a bid amount but limit the bid to only public transportation or only taxi services.
- Advertisers may also designate bids based on the amount of time, or the window of time, which the advertiser has to transport the customer to the business location. For example, the advertiser may be more willing to place a higher bid in order to provide customers with relatively short travel time (such as a few minutes or less) to the business location. This higher bid may allow the server to consider faster transportation alternatives, such as by offering autonomous vehicle rides rather than public transportation rides. The advertiser may also place a higher bid for a customer's transportation towards the end of the business hours than for the same customer earlier in the day, for example, as a function of fluctuating sales quotas.
- Advertisers may also designate bids based on the profit margin associated with a customer's interests. For example, an advertiser may select to place a higher bid in order to transport a customer who has indicated an interest in high end retail goods and less to transport a customer who has indicated an interest in less expensive goods as profit margins may be significantly lower.
- Advertisers may also designate bids based on a customer's buying history. For example, advertisers may bid more to have customers which consistently use the transportation service to make purchases as compared to those who appear to travel without actually having made any purchases. These purchases may be tracked, for example, using discount codes, passphrases, badges, or standard advertising conversion modes.
- bidding methods and information described above may be used alone or in combination and may be reported to an advertiser in order to assist the advertiser in the selection of reasonable bid values.
- Advertisers may also specify a maximum budget to be spent over a particular period of time. If based on a maximum budget, the bid value may be inputted manually, or based on a calculation that considers product inventory, likelihood of a sale, and profit data provided by the advertiser.
- the profit data may include, for example, profitability reports and information regarding the likelihood and value to the advertiser of a customer completing a purchase at the business location.
- the advertisers may provide the server with profit data 141 regarding the advertiser's success with a particular advertised product or location. This information may be used to determine reasonable bid values as well as keep track of the advertiser's use of the system.
- the server may also have access to transportation data 143 used to calculate the costs to transport a customer to a particular location.
- the transportation data may include locations and schedules for trains, subways, buses, etc.
- the transportation data may also include the location of vehicle dispatch locations (such as taxi or rental car services), the locations of the vehicles themselves, and estimated travel times to one or more locations.
- the transportation data may also include the location of various autonomous vehicles, for example, computer-controlled vehicles including, but not limited to, cars, trucks, busses, boats, helicopters, etc. available to transport a customer to a particular business location.
- autonomous vehicles as used herein may include vehicles which are fully autonomous, semi-autonomous, or include manual driving modes.
- the server may also receive information from users or customers and store this information as user data 145 .
- the user data 145 may be used to generate user profiles and determine whether a particular user meets an advertiser's target customer profile.
- customers of the service may optionally select to provide the server with information about the customer in order to develop a personal profile for the customer.
- the profile may include information such as the user's age gender, income, and interests.
- the customer may also provider various transportation preferences such as “I only want to take an autonomous vehicle” or “I do not want to use public transportation.”
- the customer may provide the server with access to the user's personal calendar or a personal web site.
- the customer may also input relevant profile information, such as birth date or personal interests, into the customer's computer or phone.
- the service may scan temporary files, such as cookies, on the customer's computer or phone, identify the customer's prior web queries, and identify the platform or operating system the customer is using, in order to identify relevant profile information.
- temporary files such as cookies
- privacy protections are provided for the user data including, for example, filtering of sensitive information, encryption, hashing or filtering of sensitive information to remove personal attributes, time limitations on storage of information, or limitations on data use or sharing.
- Data 134 may also include map data 147 .
- the map data may include detailed information about the length and location of roadways, public transportation stations, stops and routes, locations of buildings and other structures, and images of geographic locations or areas.
- the images may comprise street maps, satellite images, or a combination of these, and may be stored as vectors (particularly with respect to street maps) or bitmaps (particularly with respect to satellite images).
- the map data may also be used by the server to determine a route between an initial location and a destination location.
- the route may include various types of information such as the path of a vehicle or an individual walking and using various transportation methods such as a train, bus, subway, etc.
- the route may also include a total route length, the length of intermediate route segments along the route, an estimated travel time between the initial location and the destination location.
- the route may be used to calculate the costs to transport a customer to a particular location.
- Systems and methods may process locations expressed in different ways, such as latitude/longitude positions, street addresses, street intersections, an x-y coordinate with respect to the edges of a map (such as a pixel position when a user clicks on a map), names of buildings and landmarks, and other information in other reference systems that is capable of identifying a geographic locations (e.g., lot and block numbers on survey maps).
- a location may define a range of the foregoing. Locations may be further translated from one reference system to another.
- the client 160 may access a geocoder to convert a location identified in accordance with one reference system (e.g., a street address such as “1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, Calif.”) into a location identified in accordance with another reference system (e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, ⁇ 122.083939°)).
- a reference system e.g., a street address such as “1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, Calif.”
- another reference system e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, ⁇ 122.083939°)
- the server may receive the advertising data as described above. This information may be used to map the locations of the various business locations. For example, as shown in map 300 of FIG. 3 , the server has mapped two business locations, business location 310 of Business A at map marker A and business location 320 of Business B at map marker B. Each of these businesses and business locations may be associated with an advertiser. These advertisers may request that the server transport customers to the business locations, based on a particular target customer profile and bid and budget structure as described above.
- the server may receive geographic location information from a client device.
- the geographic position component of a customer's client device may periodically determine a current geographic location of the client device. This location may be expressed, for example, as a set of geolocation coordinates.
- the customer's client device may transmit the geographic location coordinates to the server.
- the client device may transmit the current geographic location whenever the customer requests information from the server, such as by entering a map query or web search query.
- the client device may be a stationary computing device, such as a kiosk, and the server may identify the location of the kiosk based on identifying information associated with the kiosk or received from the customer.
- the customer may present a hotel key to the kiosk which may use the information to identify the current geographic location of the customer or retrieve profile information.
- the server may identify a customer's client device at location 410 .
- the server may also identify the customer associated with the client device and the customer's associated user data. For example, the user may enter a user name and password into the user's client device to be transmitted to the server. As another example, a user may perform an identifying gesture detected by sensors on the device, or be recognized passively through a standard identification process such as an image recognition or motion sensing. The server may receive this information and identify the user and the user's associated user data.
- the server may then compare the client device's current location and the customer's user data to the target customer profiles to determine whether the customer falls within one or more advertiser's target customer profile.
- the target customer profile for Business A may require that the customer be located within a certain distance, such as 5 miles, from the business location and be within a given age group, such as 30-50 year olds. If the customer has indicated in his or her profile that he or she is 31 years old and the current location of the client device is 4 miles from business location 310 , the server may determine that the customer satisfies the target customer profile associated with Business A.
- the customer's profile may also indicate his or her job title, purchasing history, clothing size or other characteristic that the server may match to a desirable customer profile for the advertiser.
- the system may use characteristics to exclude a customer from being considered for an offer based on exclusion criteria identified by a business.
- the server may determine whether and what transportation options are available to the customer at the present (or possibly some future) time. For example, as shown in map 500 of FIG. 5 , the server may have access to transportation information which includes the locations and availability of various transportation options proximate to the customer (and the business location). For example, the server may identify public transportation options such as train stations 510 - 12 or bus stops 530 - 32 and the respective schedules of these options. The server may also identify other transportation businesses such as taxi services 520 - 21 or the taxis 540 - 41 , and the availability of these vehicles.
- transportation information which includes the locations and availability of various transportation options proximate to the customer (and the business location).
- the server may identify public transportation options such as train stations 510 - 12 or bus stops 530 - 32 and the respective schedules of these options.
- the server may also identify other transportation businesses such as taxi services 520 - 21 or the taxis 540 - 41 , and the availability of these vehicles.
- taxi services 520 - 21 and taxis 540 - 41 may be associated with semi or fully autonomous vehicles which may be dispatched to a customer in order to transport the customer to the business location.
- the server may operate as a central dispatching service for the taxi or autonomous vehicle service.
- the server may automatically calculate the potential costs of transporting the customer to the business location of the matched target customer profile, taking into consideration transit options available and travel time. For example, the server may calculate a route and estimated travel time from the customer's current location to the business location based on the type of available transportation. The server may then determine the potential fare for a cab from location 410 to business location 310 based upon the route and estimated travel time. The server may also calculate the potential cost of the customer using public transportation or recommend walking routes. The server may also consider weather conditions, and for example, the server may be less likely to recommend walking in the rain.
- this calculation may also consider any preferences included in the customer's user data or the advertiser's bid and budget structure. For example, the customer may select to only take taxis or autonomous vehicles and never to take public transportation. In another example, the advertiser may select to only offer rail transportation because the business is located close to a subway or train station.
- the server then conducts an auction based on the various bid types described above and selects a winning advertiser or advertisers. For example, if there is only one advertiser, the server may determine whether the advertiser's bid would be greater than the estimated cost to transport the customer to the advertiser's business location. In another example, if there are multiple target customer profiles, the server may conduct a real-time auction to select one or more winning advertisers. For example, if a customer satisfies the target customer profiles of both Business A and Business B, but is located closer to business location 310 than business location 320 , the cost to transport the customer may be greater for Business B than for Business A. The server may then select Business A or Business B depending upon the bid values for each advertiser.
- This determination may be based on a plurality of different advertising algorithms or machine learning routines used to select and display Internet advertisements such as those displayed on a web search results page.
- the server may consider the order in which the advertisements are displayed. For example, an advertiser may be required to pay more for a higher display ranking (or being displayed towards the top of a display) when the advertiser's advertisement is displayed.
- the server may offer the customer transportation to the winning advertiser or advertisers' business location based on certain terms.
- the customer may receive an advertisement on the user's mobile computer or phone offering free transportation to and from the business location or transportation rebates upon making a purchase. If there is more than one winning advertiser, the client device may display a second advertisement as well.
- the customer may select a link or button indicating that the customer would like the transportation.
- an advertisement 610 may include information such as a coupon or other incentive, an estimated transport time, and a type of transportation. If the customer is interested in traveling to the business location, the customer may select an option 620 to inform the server of the decision.
- the server may provide the transportation information (directions, etc.) and/or make any necessary arrangements (for example, dispatching a taxi or autonomous vehicle).
- the customer and the dispatch service may schedule time that the customer will be ready to be picked up or a dispatched vehicle will be available to collect the customer.
- the dispatching service may be offered at a kiosk such as kiosk 700 of FIG. 7 .
- the kiosk may operate similarly to a mobile phone or personal computer though may use a different user interface or require different information.
- the customer may enter identifying information at the kiosk and select whether to have an advertiser send an autonomous vehicle to pick up the customer.
- the dispatching service may provide the customer with the location and direction for using nearby transportation, such as public transportation, or dispatch an autonomous vehicle or taxi to the customer.
- the server may also provide additional information regarding transportation options to the client device for display to the customer. For example, the server may determine that public transportation may take 20 minutes to arrive whereas an autonomous vehicle may take 10 minutes to arrive at the business location. This information may be displayed to the customer, for example, at the kiosk or customer's computer in order to allow the customer to decide which transportation to take.
- Flow diagram 800 of FIG. 8 depicts aspects of the process described above.
- the server receives geographic location information associated with a client device. For example, the client device may transmit geolocation coordinates to the server.
- the server accesses user data for a plurality of users. This user data may be submitted by users in order to receive advertisements.
- the server identifies the user (and the user's user data) based on any one of the methods described above.
- the server also accesses a plurality of target customer profiles associated with at least one requirement at block 808 . Each target customer profile is associated with an advertisement. Each advertisement is associated with a business location and a bid value.
- the server identifies an advertisement based on whether the user data associated with the identified user satisfies the at least one requirement (associated with the identified advertisement).
- the server identifies one or more transportation options (such as public transportation, autonomous vehicles, taxis, etc.) for transporting the user to the business location associated with the identified advertisement. For each transportation option, the server determines a cost to transport the user to the business location associated with the identified advertisement at block 814 . The server then selects a transportation option based on the bid value associated with the identified advertiser and the cost value associated with the one or more transportation options at block 816 . The server then transmits the advertisement and the selected transportation option to the client device for display at block 818 .
- transportation options such as public transportation, autonomous vehicles, taxis, etc.
- the server receives a request for the selected transportation option.
- the server arranges the selected transportation option, for example, by dispatching a vehicle or providing instructions for using public transportation.
- the server dispatches an autonomous vehicle, taxi, or other transportation to the customer
- the customer may be required to identify him or herself to the vehicle or vehicle's driver before using the transportation.
- the user may be required to show a driver's license, enter a user name and password upon entering the vehicle, or use an RFID badge or other item to automatically provide his or her user information.
- the customer may use the dispatched transportation to reach the business location.
- the server may charge the advertiser after the occurrence of various events.
- the advertiser may be charged when the advertisement has been displayed, the customer has requested a vehicle to be dispatched, the customer has arrived at the business location, and/or the customer has taken some action such as completing business transaction at the business location.
- Advertisers may also bid on having an autonomous vehicle return to the business location to take the customer home or back to the original pick up location.
- the user may be accompanied by one or more additional passengers.
- the user may provide this information in a profile, but may also provide it in response to being prompted by the client device.
- This information may be used by the server, for example, to identify a target profile as well as determine the types and cost of transporting the user and the passengers to a business location. For instance, a user with two additional passengers would not be able to use a vehicle equipped for only two people. Similarly, it may be more expensive to transport a group of 5 people as it may require a van or two taxies. Thus, the server may take this into consideration when calculating the cost of transporting the passengers as well as selecting advertisers willing to pay for more expensive transportation.
- the user may indicate that he or she is accompanied by one or more children.
- the server may identify business locations appropriate for families.
- the user may identify the server that he or she is accompanied by another adult.
- the server may identify business locations appropriate for adults, for example, “romantic” restaurants.
- a business may specify a number of passengers in a profile or advertisement.
- the business may specify a minimum number of passengers, a maximum number of passengers, or a range.
- a theme park may prefer to display advertisements to users indicating that they are accompanied by one or more children in order to increase revenue.
- a movie theater may offer a discount coupon for users in a carpool. In this case, the movie theater may also bundle the transportation arrangements with ticket purchases so that users are unlikely to lie about the number of passengers.
- a night club may prefer groups in order to have them stay longer or spend more money.
- a retail store may offer a personal discount code to each passenger of a group of passengers when the transportation is arranged. The retail store may track how many of the discount codes are used to determine how many of the passengers actually used the service and purchased goods and/or services.
