- a forwarding interface that resembles the reply interface 436 may be shown. In the forwarding interface, the user can edit the list of recipients for the forward message and edit the forward message.
- a voicemail may be delivered as an attachment to an electronic message such as an email.
- the electronic message to which the voicemail is attached may include a special tag or identifier tagging the electronic message as one with a voicemail attachment.
- the electronic voicemail message data structure 500 may include an voicemail tag or identifier 502 that identifies the message as having a voicemail attachment (i.e., an audio data attachment that contains a voicemail message).
- the voicemail tag 502 is included in the electronic message data 504 , which also includes the headers 506 and the body 508 of the electronic message.
- the data structure 500 also includes the attachment audio file 506 .
- the voicemail tag 502 is one of several types of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message. Labels, including labels automatically assigned by the electronic messaging system (e.g., “Inbox”) and/or user assigned labels (e.g., “vacation”, or “work”), are another type of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message.
- Labels including labels automatically assigned by the electronic messaging system (e.g., “Inbox”) and/or user assigned labels (e.g., “vacation”, or “work”), are another type of metadata that may be included in or otherwise associated with an electronic message.
- the tag 502 tags the particular electronic message to which the tag is added as one that includes a voicemail attachment. Such electronic messages are sometimes herein called electronic voicemail messages.
- an electronic messaging system 104 may treat the message specially.
- the special treatment includes indexing the message such that it is searchable as a voicemail or audio message.
- another special operation performed for messages with a voicemail tag 502 is sending an audio player object along with the message when the message is delivered to a client for display or opening.
- the voicemail tag 502 is not included in the reply or forwarding message, because the original recipient of the electronic voicemail message is not the user to whom the reply or forwarding message is being sent.
- the reply or forwarding message even though it includes the original message with the voicemail, is treated as a normal electronic message that happens to have an audio file attachment.
- FIG. 5B illustrates an exemplary user database 520 , identifying the users of an electronic messaging system.
- the user database 520 may contain a User ID 522 that references a full text and attributes index 524 associated with a particular user.
- the index 524 maps terms and message attributes to messages in a message database 530 .
- a particular Message ID 526 may be associated with a particular Conversation ID 532 in a Message to Conversation Map 5304 .
- Each entry in Message to Conversation Map 534 associates (i.e., maps) a Message ID 526 to a Conversation ID 532 .
- the Conversation ID 532 is an n-bit number. This number uniquely identifies the particular conversation to which the message identified by Message ID 526 belongs. In these embodiments, every conversation in a user's electronic messages account has a distinct Conversation ID.
- a User Conversation Database 538 may be used to identify the other messages associated with a particular conversation. Such a database might be used, for example, when identifying the remainder of the messages included in a conversation where one or more messages had matched a particular search query.
- the User Conversation Database 538 includes a number of Conversation Entries 540 . Each Conversation Entry 540 stores a list of the messages (or other data structure representing the messages) associated with the conversation. All of the messages associated with a respective conversation have the same Conversation ID.
- the set of messages assigned or associated with a respective Conversation ID may include one or more email messages, one or more chat messages, and one or more electronic voicemail messages, all in the same conversation.
- a Conversation Entry 542 may include a linked list of message entries 546 , each message entry corresponding to a particular message in the conversation.
- the linked list might be ordered by, for example, date/time values associated with the messages in the conversation.
- An exemplary message entry 546 includes the Message ID 526 , Header 548 , and Metadata 550 of a particular message.
- the Header 548 may contain all or a portion of a message's header information.
- the Metadata 550 may contain information identifying certain attributes associated with the message. For example, in some embodiments the Metadata 550 of a message identifies the labels (e.g., labels automatically assigned by the electronic message system and/or user defined labels) or message folders associated with the message.
- the Metadata 550 also indicates whether a voicemail tag 502 has been associated with the message.
- the Message ID( 4 ) 526 of a particular entry 552 may be associated with a particular message in the Message Database 530 .
- the message entry 546 does not include the content of the body of the corresponding message 560 .
- the information in the index 524 and the information in a Conversation Entry 542 may be used to assist in associating a new message (e.g., an email message, an electronic voicemail message or a chat message) with a particular conversation, without accessing the Message database 530 .
- a new message e.g., an email message, an electronic voicemail message or a chat message
- attributes identified in the metadata 550 of the message entries for the identified conversation can be applied to the new message, without having to retrieve any messages from the message database.
