Definitions
- the present invention is directed to telephone systems and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for activating telephone services in response to speech.
- Telephones are used to provide a host of services in addition to basic calling services. Such telephone services include services such as repeat dialing and call return where security is not of concern. Telephone services also include banking and financial services where security is of concern.
- Voice controlled dialing systems such as the one described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,165,095 permit a user to place a call verbally without knowing the number of the person being called.
- a user first speaks a command, e.g., the word "call" followed by a destination identifier. Once the command is identified using speaker independent voice recognition techniques, the system accesses speaker dependent or independent templates to recognize the destination identifier. The recognized destination identifier associated with the person making the call is then used to access a data base associated with the caller and to obtain therefrom a telephone number.
- the known system uses both speaker independent and speaker dependent speech recognition.
- Speaker dependent speech recognition uses a computer that has been "trained" to respond to the manner in which a particular person speaks.
- the training involves one person speaking a sound to generate an analog speech input, converting the speech input into signal data, generating a template representing the sound, and indexing the template to appropriate response data, such as a computer instruction to perform an action.
- appropriate response data such as a computer instruction to perform an action.
- input data is compared to the user's set of templates and the best match results in an appropriate response.
- Speaker independent speech recognition uses a computer that stores a composite template or cluster of templates that represent the same sound spoken by a number of different persons.
- the templates are derived from numerous samples of signal data to represent a wide range of pronunciations.
- the present invention is directed to telephone systems and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for activating telephone services in response to speech.
- a directory of names and telephone numbers is maintained for each customer.
- a speaker dependent speech template is created for each name as it is added by a customer to the customer's personal telephone directory.
- the speaker dependent templates are stored in a data base which can be downloaded when a customer initiates a telephone call.
- the present invention permits a user, e.g., customer, to place telephone calls using speech as opposed to telephone numbers without the use of steering words, e.g., the command "call" being spoken before a destination identifier such as the name of an individual to be called. It accomplishes this by interpreting speech which matches a name in a customer's personal directory, absent an additional command, as being an attempt to initiate a call. Thus, upon detecting a match between a spoken name and a name in the customer's directory, the telephone number associated with the name in the customer's personal directory is dialed absent the receipt of an explicit command.
- Identification of the customer for purposes of accessing the customer's personal telephone directory may be achieved using the telephone number of the telephone used to initiate the telephone transaction, by using a calling card number to initiate the telephone call or by a plurality of other known customer identification methods.
- speaker independent templates are used to identify commands, e.g., REDIAL, CALL RETURN, etc., yes/no responses; and/or speaker independent names such as, e.g., home, which may be used by a plurality of customers.
- speaker dependent speech recognition e.g., to identify names in a customer's telephone directory
- speaker independent speech recognition is used to detect, e.g., explicit commands.
- a received utterance which may be a word, e.g., the name John, or a phrase, e.g., Call forwarding to Mary
- the results of the speech recognition steps are analyzed.
- a call is placed to the phone number associated with the recognized name in the customer's personal directory. In this manner, a customer can place a call by simply speaking a name. Placing a call in this manner may be thought of as issuing an "implicit command" to dial since the system of the present invention will interpret a speaker dependent name, in the absence of other commands, as a command to dial the number associated with the name.
- the command is performed unless additional input is required, e.g., a name in the case of call forwarding, or security is of concern, such as in the case of message retrieval where the phone company is providing voice mail services.
- additional input e.g., a name in the case of call forwarding, or security is of concern, such as in the case of message retrieval where the phone company is providing voice mail services.
- security is of concern, a voice verification step is performed and the customer's identity is verified. Accordingly, the present invention provides a flexible system where voice verification is performed on an as needed basis and not necessarily on all calls.
- the system and method of the present invention supports commands which require additional inputs of either a name or another command.
- commands are detected by the speaker independent recognition step, a check is made to determine if the additional information was received as part of the same utterance in which the command was received. If it was, the command is processed accordingly. Otherwise, the needed additional input is requested and processed using speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition in parallel as described above.
- both speech recognition steps may produce possibly valid recognition results which would result in a conflicting interpretation of the command or action to be performed.
- an arbiter is used to analyze the results and determine which course of action, e.g., command, is most likely the correct one. The course of action that is selected by the arbiter that will be followed in the case of potentially conflicting speech recognition results.
- the speech recognition steps produce a confidence value whenever they recognize a name or command.
- the confidence values associated with the outputs of the speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition steps are used together with additional information such as durational models of each word and the statistical probability of each name or command being received.
- the method and apparatus of the present invention permits a user to place a call by speaking a name without the need to first speak a steering word.
- the present invention also provides for call security via the selective application of voice verification in telephone transactions where security is of concern.
- the instruction ⁇ Call forwarding to Mary> can also be spoken as ⁇ Uhm . . . please . . . , I would like to activate call forwarding to . . . uhm . . . Mary, if I may>.

- the application processor 130 is coupled to a database 129, which includes, e.g., a customer list, a set of user dependent speech templates for each customer, a list of telephone numbers, and other information. While the intelligent peripheral 124, for exemplary purposes, is illustrated as including two speech recognizer arrays 126, 128 is to be understood that it may include any number of such arrays.
- each destination identifier for which a speech template is stored in the database 129 there is also stored a recording of the destination identifier and a telephone number associated with the destination identifier.
- the recording is used as part of a confirmation message played back to the customer after a match with a template is detected.
- the telephone number is used to place the call.
- FIG. 2A there is illustrated an exemplary speech recognizer array 200 which may be used as the first and second speech recognizer arrays 126, 128.
- the speech recognizer array comprises a T1 interface 210, first through third voice recognition circuits 204, 206, 208, a DTMF tone generator/receiver circuit 202, a central processing unit 212, a VGA graphics card 214 which is coupled to a monitor, and an Ethernet adapter 216.

- a second bus 220 which is a host computer bus, e.g., an AT-bus is coupled to the T1 interface, first through third voice recognition circuits 204, 206, 208, DTMF generator 202, CPU 212, graphics card 214 and Ethernet adapter 216.
- the T1 interface 210 routes each of the 24 voice channels of the T1 link to one of the three voice recognition circuits 204, 206, 208.
- each voice recognition card 204, 206, 208 handles 8 voice channels.
- the DTMF tone generator/receiver 202 is responsible for generating the DTMF tones required to place a call and for detecting DTMF tones, e.g., *99, representing a specific mode of operation, e.g., directory mode.
- the CPU 212 is responsible for controlling the operation of the various components of the speech recognizer array and the transfer of data to and from the application processor 130 via the Ethernet adapter 216. Operation of the voice recognition circuits 204, 206, 208 will be discussed in detail below.
- the voice recognition circuit 250 comprises a speech sampling and processing circuit 251 which is coupled to the voice bus 220 for receiving speech therefrom.
- the output of the speech sampling and processing circuit 251 is coupled to the inputs of a speaker dependent speech recognition circuit 252 and a speaker independent speech recognition circuit 253.
- the speech recognition circuits 252, 253 are coupled to the data bus 220. via the data bus 220 speech recognition templates can be transferred between the data base 129 and the speech recognition circuits 252, 253 through the use of the application processor 130.
- the outputs of the speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition circuits 252, 253 are coupled to an arbiter 254.
- the arbiter 254 is coupled to a call completion and feature activation circuit 256 by a line 257 and by a voice verification circuit 255. Using this arrangement, voice verification is performed selectively when, for security purposes, it is important to verify the identity of a caller before responding to a particular command.
- the voice recognition circuit 250 may include additional feedback loops and circuits for requesting additional information from a caller as may be required depending on a particular application.
- FIG. 3 the operation of the telephone system 100 will be described from the time a customer take a phone 112, 114 off-hook until the point where the customer speaks.
- telephone system interaction with a customer begins when the customer takes the phone off-hook as represented by block 302. After the phone is taken off-hook system operation progresses to step 304. At this point, the switch 116 sends a dial tone to the customer and the digit receiver 120 is activated.
- step 306 the switch 116 sets up a path from the customer to the intelligent peripheral 124 via either of the first or second T1 links.
- the switch 116 forwards customer identification information, e.g., the customer's telephone number, and a service code to one of the speech recognizer arrays, e.g., the speech recognizer array 126.
- step 308 the speech recognizer array 126 sends the customer's telephone number and service code to the application processor.
- the application processor 130 retrieves customer dependent speech templates and associated customer information from the database 129 using, e.g., the customer's telephone number as an index to the database 129.
- the application processor 130 downloads the retrieved customer dependent speech templates to the speech recognizer array 126.
- Other customer information e.g., the types of or level of service to which the customer subscribes and the status of the customer's account, e.g., active or inactive, may be retrieved and downloaded as well.
- the speech recognizer array 126 Upon receiving the speaker dependent templates from the application processor 130, the speech recognizer array 126, in step 312, signals its readiness to perform speech recognition by removing the dial tone and sending a beep to the customer.
- speaker independent templates for, e.g., explicit commands, may be stored locally in the speech recognizer array 126 or downloaded from, e.g., the database 129. In as much as speaker independent templates are non-speaker dependent, there is no need to download a separate set of speaker independent templates for each individual customer.
- the customer Upon receiving the beep, the customer is expected to speak in order to, e.g., place a call.
- the customer's speaking is represented by step 314.
- the speech is conveyed to the speech recognizer 126 via the switch 116 and a T1 link.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the method of the present invention for processing speech and performing operations in response thereto.
- the flow chart 400 of FIG. 4 comprises a series of function blocks or steps performed in accordance with the present invention.
- the method the present invention combines several speech recognition and speaker verification steps.
- the method of the present invention allows customers to pick up the phone and say a name, e.g., "John”, to call John, or pick up the phone and say a command or function such as "Call return", to activate or have the desired service or function performed.
- VOICE DIALING is an explicit command used to enter a directory mode of operation during which a customer may make modifications to the customer's personal voice dialing directory.
- the command type identifiers are as follows:
- a distinctive feature of the present invention is that speaker independent speech recognition of commands are performed in parallel with speaker dependent recognition of names from the individual customer's personal telephone directory. This results in two different speech recognition processes being performed on the same speech simultaneously.
- a customer may say an utterance from either of the two vocabularies without explicitly indicating which vocabulary is being used.
- Performing both speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition in parallel eliminates the need to use of an explicit command or steering word as required in the prior art systems, to place a call.
- speech processing begins in step 401 with the detection of the receipt of speech by, e.g., the voice recognition circuit 204.
- the received speech is processed prior to performing speech recognition thereon.
- step 402 the received speech, which was previously sampled at, e.g., 8 KHz by the switch 116, is divided into frames every 20 ms with a window of 30 ms.
- 10 LPC-based cepstra, 10 delta-cepstra, energy, and delta-energy are computed for every frame.
- the delta-cepstra are computed with a standard interpolation formula over a 5 frame window.
- all speech features are quantized to 8 bits.
- speaker dependent speech recognition is performed in step 403.
- speaker independent speech recognition is also performed in step 404.
- both speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition are performed as is known in the art, using continuous density hidden Markov models.
- Speech recognition may be performed as described in the article by D. Lubensky, A. Asadi, and J. Naik, "Connected Digit Recognition Using Connectionist Probability Estimators and Mixture-Gaussian Densities", ICSLP-94, Yokohama, Japan, 1994, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.
- recognition is based on whole word models. However, it is also possible to perform speech recognition using any level of sub-word models as well.
- the training required to build the speaker independent word models, i.e., templates, is accomplished in two steps.
- the first step computes a forced path alignment of training utterances.
- the training utterances may be, e.g., the commands set forth in the above table spoken by a plurality of individuals.
- the mixtures of each state, where 4 mixtures per state are used are updated from the alignments and a diagonal covariance matrix is computed for each mixture.
- the system uses speech data collected over a telephone network to train the word models, a 3-state silence model, and an 8 state out of vocabulary (OOV) model which is sometimes referred to as a garbage model.
- OOV 8 state out of vocabulary
- the OOV model is trained on a large amount of telephone speech that does not include the target vocabulary words.
- the speaker independent recognition process is implemented using stochastic grammar built from target words, OOV words, and silence.
- the stochastic grammar is used to determine which word sequences are allowed.
- a Viterbi search with pruning is performed to find the most likely word sequence.
- the distance between the features of the frames and the Gaussian mixtures of the states is computed and used to produce a confidence measure which indicates the likelihood that a match between one of templates representing a modeled command, function or service was successfully found.
- the speaker dependent speech recognition process represented by step 403, involves identifying spoken names which correspond to names represented by templates in the customer's personal calling directory.
- the speaker dependent templates which were previously downloaded from the database 129 are used for this purpose.
- the speaker dependent speech recognition process like the speaker independent speech recognition process, is based on hidden Markov models (HMM) with the use of grammars. It also uses word spotting and out of vocabulary rejection in a completely configurable form.
- HMM hidden Markov models
- a customer may add names or delete names from a speaker dependent directory by using explicit directory maintenance commands and menus to create and delete templates and records as desired.
- HMM speaker dependent name models referred to as templates In order to build HMM speaker dependent name models referred to as templates, in one embodiment, a single Gaussian mixture is used, with pooled covariance, and on-line mean estimation. The models are implemented from left to right, with no skips.
- the speaker dependent speech recognition process uses the same Viterbi search algorithm used for speaker independent speech recognition but with Euclidean distance as a metrics.
- the number of states per HMM model is quantized to 3 levels with, in one embodiment, the maximum number of states allowed being 20.
- speaker dependent garbage models are used for out of vocabulary rejection as well as word spotting. These garbage models are built on-line and, in the exemplary embodiment, modified every time the user's directory of names is changed e.g., during a directory maintenance mode of operation.
- Four garbage models are used in the exemplary embodiment. Three have numbers of states corresponding to the three durational values of the name models. The fourth one is a single state model.
- three single-state background e.g., silence, models, tuned for different background conditions, are used.
- the grammar is shared by both the speech recognition and training process used to generate the templates used for speech recognition. The grammar can be modified by adjusting path probabilities to achieve various levels of word spotting and rejection.
- the system of the present invention seeks a consistent pair of utterances before building a model, and additionally determines if the name is too similar to another name in the customer's directory to reduce the risk that the name will be miss-recognized due to the use of multiple similar names. In order to achieve this, a recognition pass is performed during the training process to asses the system's ability to properly detect the name being added to the directory.
- the result of the speaker dependent speech recognition step 403 and speaker independent speech recognition step 404 is a sentence which comprises one or more descriptive strings, e.g., of a name, command, or both.
- Both speech recognition steps also produce time alignment information relating to the recognized words if the words are spoken in a sentence. This time alignment information is used to determine, in some cases, if arbitration is required. For example, if a name and a command are detected and the time alignment information indicates that they were spoken during the same time interval, as opposed to different time intervals, only the output of one of the speech recognition steps 403, 404 can be correct. In such a case, arbitration is used to decide which output should be used.
- a confidence measure which indicates the likelihood that the results represent the correct identification of a word, name, command or other utterance is also produced as part of the speech recognition steps 403, 404.
- the confidence3 measures thus produced are used to ascertain which speech recognition step most likely produced the correct result when both recognition steps 403, 404 recognize, e.g., one or more words, names, or commands.
- the outputs of both the speaker dependent and speaker independent speech recognition steps 403, 404 are supplied to the input of an arbitration step 406.
- the arbitration step 406 is used to arbitrate between the results of the two speech recognition steps 403, 404 in the event that the both detect a successful match, e.g., corresponding to speech which occurred in the same time interval.
- the level of successful speech recognition depends on the ability of both the speaker dependent speech recognition (SDR) and speaker independent speech recognition (SIR) steps 403, 404 to effectively reject out of vocabulary (OOV) inputs thereby reducing or eliminating the need for arbitration to determine which output should be accepted as the correct one. For example, consider the following three possible outcomes:
- the confidence measures produced by the two speech recognition steps 403, 404 could be used as the sole basis for arbitrating between the results of the speech recognition processes with the output of the speech recognition process which produces the higher confidence measure being selected.
- arbitration schemes may also be employed. Such schemes may use additional information derived from durational modeling of words in the vocabulary as well as the statistic based probability of the occurrence of each command. It is expected that names will be received much more frequently than commands since, at the present time, people tend to primarily use telephones to place calls as opposed to e.g., request services such as call return.
- the arbitration scheme is implemented as a function of: 1) the recognition confidence measure produced by the SDR and SIR steps 403, 404 and 2) durational models of each word of a command and each name built during training.
- the method of the present invention progress to the next level in the process illustrated in FIG. 4.
- the particular step, 418, 407, 416 to which the process proceeds depends on the type of name, command or combination thereof that was detected.
- the branch c2+n1 in FIG. 4 represents progression from the arbitration step to a confirmation step 418.
- the C2+n1 path is followed in the event that a c2 type command and a speaker dependent name are detected together, e.g., when the customer says "FORWARD (MY) CALLS (TO) JOHN", where the words in parenthesis are not required but will not interfere with proper detection of the command and name because of the use of word spotting techniques and/or OOV rejection.
- step 418 the customer is played a confirmation message, e.g., "Do you wish to forward your calls to John?" where the name John is generated by playing back the recording of the name associated in the database 129 with the template that was used to identify the name John in the received speech. A verbal yes/no response is expected.
- the method progresses to step 424 and the call is completed with the customers calls being forwarded to the telephone number in the database 129 associated with the customer's template for the name John.
- step 418 If however, a "no" response is detected in step 418 or no "yes” response is detected within a preselected period of time, the process progresses from step 418 to step 420 in which the customer is prompted for additional input, e.g., the name of the person to whom calls are to be forwarded when step 420 is being performed subsequent to step 418.
- step 406 it is determined that a c2 type command, e.g., a call forwarding command, has been received without the additional input of a name or command required, the process proceeds from step 406 to step 420 where the customer is prompted for the additional input required.
- a c2 type command e.g., a call forwarding command
- step 420 the process proceeds to step 422 where the additional speech input is received and then step 423 where it is processed prior to performing speech recognition thereon.
- SDR and SIR are performed on the processed speech in parallel in steps 408 and 410 in an attempt to detect a name in the customer's personal directory or a command.
- Arbitration step 412 is used to select between the results of the SDR and SIR in the event that both steps 408, 410 result in detecting a possible valid input, e.g., a name or command.
- n1 is taken from step to the confirmation step 418 where confirmation of the command, e.g., call forwarding, and destination, e.g., name, is requested prior to call completion.
- arbitration step 406 it is determined that a type c1 command has been received, e.g., a REPEAT DIALING, CALL RETURN, CANCEL REPEAT DIALING, CANCEL CALL RETURN, or REVIEW command, the process proceeds directly from the arbitration step 406 to feature activation step 426 where the operation associated with the command is performed.
- a type c1 command e.g., a REPEAT DIALING, CALL RETURN, CANCEL REPEAT DIALING, CANCEL CALL RETURN, or REVIEW command
- arbitration step 406 If in arbitration step 406, it is determined that a type n1 phrase, e.g., a speaker dependent name has been received, and a type c2 command has not been received, the process proceeds from the arbitration step 406 to a call completion step 428.
- the call completion step the destination telephone number associated with the speaker dependent name that was detected is dialed and the recording of the name stored in the database 129 is played back to the customer as a confirmation message.
- step 406 If in arbitration step 406, it is determined that a type n2 phrase has been detected, e.g., a speaker independent command such as a banking transaction command or a message retrieval command, the process proceeds to step 416 in which voice verification is performed.
- voice verification Various levels of voice verification may be used depending on the particular function being requested. For example, when a customer is seeking to perform a banking transaction, a higher degree of voice verification may be performed as compared to when a customer is merely seeking to receive voice messages.
- the voice verification performed in step 416 may use any one of a plurality of known voice verification methods.
- the voice verification process uses a fixed text protocol and a voice password which is a digit string of 7-10 digits.
- the enrollment of the voice password is mediated by fixed grammar and speaker independent digit recognition which assures reliable word segmentation.
- Speaker specific voice verification models are generated at the time a customer's phone directory is initially created using the speech segmentation process described above.
- the voice verification step includes speech sampling and processing that is the same as or similar to that performed in step 402 and may include the use of a spoken password.
- voice feature vectors are transformed using discriminate training and principal component analysis in an attempt to produce the maximal separation between known true-speaker and impostor data distributions.
- the speaker's reference model is updated to thereby adapt the customer's reference model to incremental changes in the speaker and the channel coupling the customer to the speech recognition array 126.
- Acceptance decision criteria may also be adapted to individual customers over time to improve the likelihood of a high true user acceptance rate while maintaining a high impostor rejection rate.
- the process progresses to the call completion step 428 and the requested action, e.g., the stored messages are played. If however, the voice verification step 416 indicates that an impostor is attempting to place a call, the call is terminated or other appropriate action is taken.
- the voice verification step 416 is invoked selectively, i.e., only when security or the caller's identity is of concern.
- Such an unobtrusive approach to providing security to telephone transactions may be used in any number of practical applications.
- a telephone banking application some information can be provided to anybody, e.g., a bank may use a speech recognition system to respond to an inquiry Can I get your mortgage rates? without any security concerns.
- voice verification offers a method of providing the required security.
