Make in system available fusion position supplier (FLP) andUpper available location-based service (LS).FLP and LS are ok
In response to determining that GPS signal is disabled and Wi-Fi is activated to navigate.However, existing platform is usually only provided to signal data
Limited access hardly allow to control the processing to the signal from signal source 20 and if there is any control.It is special
Not, existing platform does not provide the control of the sequence to scanning wireless channel, these platforms to application (all in this way apply 124)
The instruction of scanning sequency or the control to scanning channel are not provided.
On platform 120 and other current available platforms, sweep spacing substantially five seconds, scanning was at most spent every time
2.5 the second.During scanning, platform 120 traverses one group of channel (for example, 13 channels in Wi-Fi network) with detection management frame,
And calculate the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the management frame from signal source 20A or another quantitative degree of signal quality
Amount.When platform receives the first management frame from signal source 20A when scanning in 2.5 seconds starts on the first channel, and at last
When from signal source 20B receiving the last one management frame in 2.5 seconds ends of scan on a channel, mobile device 100 can be at this
Interim is displaced significant distance.For example, if mobile device 100 operates in the vehicle advanced with 100km/h, first
Management frame and the last one frame can be received and measure at a distance of the position at substantially 70 meters of intervals.
As a result, platform 120 can mention when an application in application 124 is via 122 launch position of api layer request 150
For location estimation 152, the possible displacement of mobile device introduces significant error in location estimation 152 during scanning.
In a possible embodiment, platform 120 is via the exposure scanning sequency of api layer 122, so that using that can retrieve
The estimation (for example, using dead reckoning) of the speed of mobile device 100 during scanning, determine within the scan period when
It is accurately received the management frame from particular access point, and attempts to mitigate error in view of speed.It selectively, can be flat
The error mitigation for using dead reckoning is realized in platform 120, to improve the accurate of the location estimation 152 returned via api layer 122
Property.
However, as discussed above, dead reckoning is limited by error accumulation.In addition, even if some platform is modified
To provide the instruction of scanning sequency, or expose the additional controls for controlling scanning sequency, it is also desirable to have and be not dependent on platform
The concrete type of software or the geo-location solution of version.
It does not need that special-purpose software is installed on a mobile device 100 in order to provide or otherwise reconfigures mobile device
100 solution, the signal source configuration configuration of system 140 signal source 20A, 20B ... 20N in identical individual channel to upload
Send Wi-Fi management frame.As a result, platform 20 is in the roughly the same time, i.e., the sweeping in same channel during multichannel scanning process
During retouching, from signal source 20A, 20B ... 20N receives Wi-Fi management frame, and calculates the RSSI of these frames.Even if Wi-Fi
The time of time and the scanning reported by platform 120 that management frame is received and measures can separate up to 2.5 seconds, but because
It is collected for the measurement from multiple access points in the roughly the same time, so increasing the overall accuracy of geo-location.
In addition, signal source configuration system 140 modifies the rate that signal source 20 transmits management frame, to solve the latent of shared channel
Overcrowding.According to existing standard, is modulated using direct sequence (DS) and management frame is transmitted with 1mbps.As a result, each access point
Sending each beacon substantially spends 2.5ms or required in-flight time (air time) per second substantially to spend 25ms.This is corresponded to
In the 1/40 of total in-flight time, once multiple access points are added to system 10, this makes frequency spectrum very crowded.Management frame and letter
Both mark abides by CSMA agreement.Assuming that for example 42 access points are transmitted, wherein 20 access points are " visible ", then look for
Chance to available time slot is very small.
It due to discussed above, avoids overcrowding, system is configured according to the signal source of example embodiment
140 configuration signal sources 20 transmit management frame to use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), to reach the speed of 54mpbs.42
Access point is tested it has been shown that in-flight time needed for each beacon/probe response is reduced to substantially 0.15ms.Assuming that institute
42 access points are all " visible ", then find the approximation probability substantially 93% of available transmission time slot.
With reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, experiment has been carried out to be placed in tunnel with the access point that will be similar to that signal source 20, often
40 meters one.Access point is installed in the side in tunnel, substantially 4 meters of height.TL- with Atheros AR9x chipset
WR740N equipment is used as access point.Carry out configuring access point (it is worth noting that, OpenWRT can be with using OpenWRT firmware
Various suitable access points from various manufacturers are used together).Experiment it has been shown that when delivering power is arranged to+
When 20dBm, even if having multipath and poor sighting distance factor, when receiver is located between two neighboring access points, " seeing " -46
Between to -66dBm, when an access point of the receiver in access point it is nearest apart from when, " seeing " -32 to -52dBm it
Between (other two access points correspond to substantially -52 arrive -72dBm signal strengths).By carrying out simply average, ground to RSSI
Reason position error is reduced to less than 16 meters.In addition, error is reduced to less than 10 meters using bluetooth transmitters.
Therefore, the access point of the disclosure is placed in tunnel, and in such manner be configured to transmission beacon or other
Management frame, which allow the mobile mobile device by tunnel to determine its geographical location with enough accuracys.As above
It discusses, access point is configured as (i) and transmits management frame in same communication channel, to eliminate movement when scanning management frame
The needs that equipment switches between the channels, and (ii) transmit management frame using modulation scheme (for example, OFDM), the modulation methods
Case allows to collect all management frames in short time interval (for example, 15ms), and vehicle does not move also in the short time interval
Enough to far to significantly affect positioning accuracy.
Example geo localization method
In order to become apparent from, Fig. 3 shows the flow chart of the exemplary method 200 for carrying out geo-location to mobile device.Example
Such as, method can be implemented in the mobile device 100 of Fig. 2 or the station 22 of Fig. 1.As described above, although with reference to access point discussion
Method 200, it should be understood that, these technologies can be used together with any suitable signal source.
Method 200 starts from frame 202, and wherein the position of a group of access point is retrieved.It is enough for example, access point can define
The set of geo-location is carried out to the mobile device in tunnel.Depending on embodiment, for example, mobile device enter tunnel it
Before, or when honeycomb covering can with when mobile device be traveling at pass through tunnel when, the position of access point can be retrieved.
In frame 204, management frame is received at mobile device from multiple access points on same channel during single scanning,
And in frame 206, the RSSI (or another suitable measurement) of management of computing frame.Then, management frame can be used in mobile device
RSSI value and the position of access point of previous receipt determine the geographical location of mobile device.
Fig. 4 shows the flow chart of the exemplary method 200 for configuring access point.For example, method 200 can match in signal source
It sets in system 140 and is implemented.
In frame 302, multiple access points are placed in the region that satellite-signal is blocked, all in this way along the wall in tunnel
Wall.Then, access point is configured as transmitting management frame (frame 304) on same channel.In frame 306, for access point is configured
Such as using OFDM with relatively high modulation rate, all 52Mbps in this way are transmitted.
Automatically determine the position of signal source
The diagram 350 of Fig. 5 schematically shows the multiple signal source 360A-G statically arranged along path 352, road
Diameter 352 can be the road in another region by tunnel or the covering of limited satellite, and all satellites in this way are by another layer of road
The road of the lower level blocked.Signal source 360A-G can d at least substantially apart be arranged, between adjacent signals source pair
Interval depends on specific setting and changes.As described below, the interval between some adjacent signals sources in adjacent signals source is aobvious
It writes in those of deviation distance d configuration, certain technologies can be used to determine distance d ', d " etc. in signal source configuration system 140.
As more specific example, technical staff can will close on ceiling of the beacon fixed to tunnel, it is intended to keep letter
The interval of the distance between mark d.When known technology personnel use relatively accurate spacer techniques, signal source configures system 140
It can be configured as the hypothesis for realizing each pair of adjacent signals source separation distance d in the 360A-G of adjacent signals source.In addition, signal source
Configuration system 140 can be configured as only for generate signal source 360A-G along the initial estimation of the position in path 352 reality
The now hypothesis.Once additional or improved data are made available by, then signal source configuration system 140, which can adjust, initially estimates
Meter.
Under any circumstance, signal source configuration system 140 can initially not have the position about signal source 360B-360F
Any information.About the signal source 360A and 360G of the respective end for being disposed in path 352, in some scenarios, these
Equipment can be disposed near the two entrances in tunnel.In these cases, it is, for example, possible to use respective GPS positionings to repair
Positive (positioning fixes) relatively easily determines the position of signal source 360A and 360G.
For example, vehicle 370 can be similar to Fig. 1 vehicle 12, including such as stand 22 receiver.Receiver usually can be with
It is to be able to detect, measure the intensity of the wireless signal from signal source 360A-G, and at least partly processing comes from signal source
Any suitable equipment of the wireless signal of 360A-G.Vehicle 370 in exemplary scene shown in Fig. 5 edge on direction 380
Path 352 it is mobile, and the receiver collecting signal data of vehicle 370, signal data instruction come from signal source 360A-G
The Strength Changes as the function of time to induction signal.Then, signal data can be supplied to signal source configuration by receiver
Next the signal data can be used to determine that signal source 360A-G's is opposite first in system 140, signal source configuration system 140
Sequentially.
As more specific example, Fig. 6 shows the receiver in vehicle 370 when advancing on direction 380 along path 352
The signal data that can be collected.Each signal in seven signals shown may include corresponding signal source with number and/or
The identifier of the form of any appropriate combination of character.Peak 400A-G corresponds to the signal from different signal source in the corresponding time
The maximum intensity (for example, RSSI) reached.For example, peak 400A appears in time t1, the reception that is installed in vehicle 370 at this time
Device detects the peak signal from source signal 360A, (in addition to ginseng when this typically occurs in vehicle 370 closest to signal source 360A
Examine the case where Fig. 7 is discussed).At this point, the signal from other signal sources 360B-G is very weak or actually at all undetectable.
In time t2, the receiver being installed in vehicle 370 detects the peak signal (peak from source signal 360B
400B), decline about 20dB from the signal of source signal 360A.At this point, vehicle 370 may very close signal source 360B.It is right
Similar mode is observed that in other signals: receiver observes the peak of the signal strength of a signal source in signal source
The low signal intensity of value and residual signal source.Before receiver reaches some signal source, due to various barriers, interference, more
Diameter etc., the signal strength of signal source are incrementally increased but are not necessarily increased in a manner of " smooth ".Similarly, logical in receiver
It crosses after signal source, signal strength gradually declines.
The sequence that signal source configuration system 140 observes peak-to-peak signal value generally corresponds to vehicle 370 and passes through corresponding signal source
Sequentially.Therefore, signal source configuration system 140 can determine that peak occurs in the following order based on signal data shown in Fig. 6:
400A, 400B ... 400G, corresponding signal identification signal source 360A, 360B ... 360G, and therefore signal source in side
On to 380 along path 352 be arranged as sequence 360A, 360B ... 360G.
According to a kind of embodiment, signal source configuration system 140 is also using determining sequence, and passing through will be along path
352 distance L divided by the interval between N number of signal source quantity: d=L/ (N-1), it is flat between signal source 360A-G to estimate
Equal distance.For example, GIS-Geographic Information System (GIS) data, description can be used by such as Google Maps in signal source configuration system 140
Drawing (mapping) service provided by natural and artificial geographical feature map datum or other are suitable geographical empty
Between data, to obtain distance L.Selectively, especially when path 352 has low curvature, signal source configures system 140 can be with
The positioning amendment of such as GPS signal from signal source 360A and 360G is obtained, signal source 360A and 360G are located at limited defend
The region exterior of star covering, and carry out estimated distance L using two positioning amendments.Then, signal source configuration system 140 can make
With some other instructions of the geometry of the known location and/or path 352 of signal source 360A or 360G, to determine these letters
The respective positions in number source.More specifically, signal source configuration system 140 can be by the way that the displacement vector that length is d to be applied to
The known location of signal source 360A calculates the position of signal source 360B, by the way that the displacement vector that length is d is applied to signal
The known location of source 360B calculates the position etc. of signal source 360C.
As described above, simultaneously each pair of adjacent signals source in the 360A-G of non-adjacent signals source is separated identical distance d, still
The hypothesis may be implemented to generate initial alignment estimation, or when known signal source 360A-G's in signal source configuration system 140
When the separation kept constant during installation, the hypothesis is may be implemented in signal source configuration system 140.
Referring now to Figure 7, in some cases, the signal from signal source 360A-G may be arranged with the vehicle of receiver
Metal roof temporarily block.For certain frequencies of signal, decaying may be particularly significant.Example signal data 420
Corresponding to a signal source in signal source 360A-G.Similar to the signal data of Fig. 6, when vehicle approach signal source, signal
Intensity increase usually at receiver, and when vehicle is far from signal source, the intensity of signal is reduced usually at receiver.
However, dropping to " paddy " 422, reaching the second peak 424, and be progressively decreased here, signal strength reaches first peak 420
Low-level.Paddy 422 likely corresponds to vehicle and is located at the time being installed in below the signal source on tunnel ceiling；Peak 420 can
The time that the signal from signal source passes through vehicle windscreen can be corresponded to；And peak 424 likely corresponds to signal across vehicle
The time of rear window.The factor of the material of the roof of frequency and vehicle depending on such as signal, signal strength in paddy 422
Decline can be with up to 20dB.
Signal source configuration system 140 can automatically generate the approximation 430 of signal data 420, wherein individually infer
Peak 432 occurs substantially in the centre of the time interval between peak 420 and 424.For this purpose, for example, signal source configuration system 140 can be with
Using suitable statistical technique, a curve of the signal strength ascendant trend when vehicle approach signal source is generated, vehicle is worked as in generation
Another curve of signal strength downward trend when far from signal source, and peak 432 is identified as to the intersection point of two curves.Mirror
In these trend, for example, signal source configuration system 140 can determine deduction peak should between peak 420 and 424, rather than
Between peak 424 and peak 440.
Additionally or alternatively, signal source configuration system 140 can determine the candidate peak of a pair at such as peak 420 and 424
Whether substantially separated by vehicle by the duration that signal source is spent.For example, it is assumed that the receiver in vehicle is with some incidence
" see " that the point of signal is started again at receiver by rear window by windshield and see that the distance between the point of signal is in angle
30m, for the vehicle advanced with 100km/h, peak 420 and 424 should substantially separate one second.Therefore, in view of the speed of vehicle, letter
Number source configuration system 140 can check whether the time interval between candidate peak seems that (this again can be with base in the reasonable scope
Estimate in the positioning amendment of signal source 360A and 360G and timestamp).
Referring again to FIGS. 6, the receiver in the vehicle 370 obtains the positioning amendment of signal source 360A and 360G and corresponding
When timestamp, signal source configure system 140 can by by distance L divided by the difference between two timestamps, to determine signal source
The average speed v of vehicle between 360A and 360Gavg.When signal source 360B-F unevenly separates rather than with length for d's
When constant interval separates, signal source configures system 140 can be by by previously determined average speed vavgMultiplied by reaching some peak
The time it takes amount, and distance (or more generally, displacement arrow of the calculating relative to the known location of the entrance in such as tunnel
Amount), to determine the position of signal source.
In some embodiments, signal source configuration system 140 can also illustrate the speed of the vehicle moved along path 352
Degree variation.Some tunnel long enoughs are to generate the significant changes of the speed of vehicle, and the difference of traffic or road quality may
Lead to the larger change of speed.For example, Fig. 8 show signal source 360A, 360B, 360C that the receiver in vehicle can be collected and
The highly simplified signal data of 360D.In this scenario, receiver sees that the signal 450A from signal source 360A is higher than threshold
Value level 460 persistently has certain time to measure tA.Threshold level 460 can be by experimental setup, but threshold under any circumstance
Value level 460 is significantly higher than noise level all to improve accuracy.In other embodiments, receiver is without using any specific
Threshold value, but the opposite variation of analyte signal intensity.Receiver see signal 450C from signal source 360C and 360D and
450D persistently has roughly the same time quantum.However, when receiver sees that signal 450B persistently has longer from signal source 360B
Area of a room tB.If it is known that signal source 360A-G is transmitted with similar power level, this is typical, then time quantum tAAnd tBBetween
These variations may be difference due to speed.
Assuming that signal 450A-D is transmitted by same powerful transmitter, signal source configures system 140 can be by institute in Fig. 8
The signal data shown is construed to indicate the speed v for the different piece in path 352A-vD, wherein vAIt is receiver in time tA
The speed of period movement, vBIt is receiver in time tBThe speed etc. of period movement.In this case, vA≈vC≈vD, and vA/
vB≈tB/tA.It is worth noting that, these estimations are not dependent on the actual location of signal source relative to each other, but it is only dependent upon
It is exposed to the duration of the signal of a certain intensity.Once having determined that respective velocity amplitude vA-vD, signal source configuration system
140 can improve the estimation of the position of signal source.
In order to become apparent from, Fig. 9 schematically shows how signal source configuration system 140 comes from view of the car speed of variation
The estimation of dynamic ground correction signal source position.According to initial estimation 520, which can be used begs for reference to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7
The average speed of the technology of opinion and vehicle generates, and signal source is to 500/502 and 502/504 separation distance d, signal source pair
504/506 and 506/508 separates longer distance d ', and signal source separates shorter distance d " to 508/510 and 510/512.?
In the scene, signal source configures system 140 and considers that signal of the receiver detection from some signal source in vehicle is higher than some
The time quantum of the intensity of threshold value.Line chart 530 shows the duration as the function of time that receiver is exposed to signal source, with the second
For unit.
According to line chart 530, receiver measures sufficiently high intensity substantially 12 seconds of the signal from signal source 500-504,
From signal source 506 and 508 substantially 18 seconds, and come from signal source 510 and 512 substantially 8 seconds.If signal source is with roughly the same
Power level transmission, then line chart 530 indicate vehicle slow down near signal source 506 and 508 and in signal source 510 and 512
Nearby accelerate.Therefore, instead of calculating the single average speed in the entire path between signal source 500 and 512, signal source configuration system
System 140 can determine the physical segment average speed value v of the section corresponding to signal source 500-5041, correspond to signal source 506 and 508
Section v2, and the v of the section corresponding to signal source 510 and 5123.More specifically, using the timestamp information in signal data,
Signal source configuration system 140 can determine that receiver is exposed to the substantially duration of corresponding signal source 500-512, also, make
With positioning amendment, another instruction of survey data or endpoint, to determine length L, so that v1t1+v2t2+v3t3=L, wherein t1It is
Receiver is with speed v1Travel through the time quantum of signal source 500-504, t2It is receiver with speed v2Travel through signal source
506 and 508 time quantum and t3It is receiver with speed v3Travel through the time quantum of signal source 510 and 512.
Once it is determined that value v1、v2And v3, signal source, which configures system 140, can more accurately determine the position of signal source.Example
It such as, is d=P by calculating displacementi+v1(tp-ti), signal source configuration system 140 can calculate and in time tiThe signal of arrival
The known location P in source 500iThe position of relevant signal source 504, wherein the peak-to-peak signal intensity of observation or the deduction of signal source 504
In time tpOccur.In the exemplary scene, signal source configures the adjustment initial estimation 520 of system 140 and estimates 540 to generate,
All adjacent signals sources in estimation 540 in the 500-512 of adjacent signals source are to separation distance d.Certainly, in other scenes, just
Estimation of beginning can indicate constant interval d, and consider that velocity variations indicate different interval d, d ' estimation etc..
In some scenes, signal source configuration system 140 can also use the vehicle by being wherein disposed with receiver to be reported
The speed and/or acceleration information of announcement.For example, the accessible mileometer of smart phone and other vehicle sensors, and by vehicle
Sensing data is reported together with signal strength measurement configures system 140 to signal source.When the data are available, signal source
The accuracy that configuration system 140 can be estimated by improving signal source in conjunction with additional signal data.
The accuracy of positioning signal source is improved in order to use techniques discussed above, and signal source configures system 140 can be with
The signal data from multiple receivers is collected using crowdsourcing.Then, signal source configuration system 140 can be implemented any suitable
Statistical method, by techniques discussed above be applied to signal data.For example, signal source configuration system 140 can such as lead to
It crosses and average (in a manner of non-weighting or weighting) is carried out to data, eliminate exceptional value, depend on reliability level as data distribution
Different weights (for example, the receiver for being equipped with more robust chipset may be more acurrate in measuring signal intensity)
Deng to combine the data from multiple receivers.In addition, in some cases, signal source configuration system 140, which can analyze, to be come from
The signal data of some receiver, to determine that receiver is operated in open car or conventional truck, and if necessary
Infer the peak in signal strength.
In addition, in some embodiments, signal source configuration system 140 can be configured as the feature for also illustrating signal source
Variation.Such as with reference to Fig. 9, in some cases, the variation of signal source visibility may be due to one in signal source 500-512
A little signal sources are due to hardware, battery or other factors, in higher power significantly, or on the contrary, are in significantly more
Low power.In addition, the physical configuration in tunnel can cause when signal source 500-512 is the beacon being arranged in tunnel
Signal reaches the variation of the degree of some regions.Signal source configuration system 140 can be collected at any time from multiple receivers
Signal data to create " brief introduction (profile) " for individual signal source, and comes further correction signal source using these brief introductions
Position estimation.
For example, the signal data of multiple receivers and multiple signal sources can be organized into Two-Dimensional Moment in order to generate brief introduction
Battle array, wherein column correspond to signal source and row corresponds to receiver.Signal source configuration system 140 can handle column data with determination
The attribute of particular signal source, and weight appropriate is generated in positioning signal source and/or in subsequent location receivers.As
More specific example, signal source 500-512 may be implemented as the beacon that the instruction of delivering power is transmitted in management frame.Signal
Delivering power instruction can be used to calculate correction factor used for positioning, because it is expected that with lower in source configuration system 140
The beacon of power transmission " will be heard " the shorter period.It typically results in twice it has been observed that delivering power increases 6dB and covers
Lid (for example, by that can be defined with the region for being higher than the threshold value RSSI value reception signal that some is fixed), and accordingly lead to two
The time quantum that beacon again is heard.
Brief introduction is further related to, for example, the feature of some signal source can change at any time due to barrier or battery consumption
Become, and corresponding brief introduction can seem how to operate in specific time with indication signal source.Therefore, brief introduction can indicate to come from
The signal in some source is weakened due to possible barrier, and receiver is allowed correspondingly to adjust calculating.More generally, believe
Number source configuration system 140 can determine the one or more features of signal source, can be adjusted during geo-location.
Although discussing above-mentioned example with specific reference to the signal source 360A-G of the signal source 500-512 or Fig. 5 of Fig. 9,
It should be understood that each technology usually in these technologies can be applied to various suitable signal sources, signal source be can wrap
Include the example signal source of Fig. 1,5 or 9.
Referring now to Figure 10, being used to determine the example side in the geographical location of the signal source in the region of limited satellite covering
Method 550 can be configured in system 140 or another suitable system in signal source and is implemented.Method 550 can be with any one
Or a variety of suitable programming languages are implemented as one group of instruction, group instruction is stored in non-transitory computer-readable medium
And it can be performed by one or more processors.
Method 550 starts from frame 552, wherein obtaining signal data from one or more receivers, which is connect
The path received in the region that device is covered along limited satellite is moved, for example, on the road by tunnel.As discussed above
, signal data can may include such as signal with indication signal intensity change with the time, and in some embodiments
The information of signal source identifier and the delivering power setting in source.In addition, in some embodiments, once have determined that signal
The position in source, location information can be sent to corresponding signal source, for subsequent transmission.
Next, determining the relative ranks for the signal source being arranged along path using signal data in frame 554.For
This, as above with reference to Fig. 6 is discussed to Fig. 8, the peak value of different signal source can be identified, and wherein the relative time at peak is corresponding
Sequence in receiver approach signal source.In frame 556, positioning amendment and the timestamp of path end points can receive.For example, being located at
The signal source of tunnel portal can be manually configured on the internet browser GPS locator, or can be placed on known survey location, or
Person can obtain GPS positioning amendment in real time.
In frame 558, when additional information is collected, the relative ranks of the determination of signal source can be by permanently or temporary
For approximate location.For example, if be implemented with the hypothesis of spaced at regular intervals signal source, using the position of endpoint with determination
The distance between endpoint, and the distance is obtained into the displacement relative to known location divided by the quantity in M signal source, believe
The apparent position in number source can be determined.Using car speed, the brief introduction and other technologies discussed above of individual signal source,
The estimation of the position of signal source can be further improved.
In frame 560, the position of the determination of signal source can be used to move through signal source to then along same paths
Receiver carry out geo-location.The constantly improve of the estimation of source location can also be with the reception that uses currently available estimation
The positioning of device concurrently occurs.For example, movement can be used by the vehicle in tunnel and can request to position with beacon, while will also
The signal strength measurement of the vehicle contributes to the signal data collection used in source location determines.
Carry out automatically configuring access point using RTT measurement
Referring now to Figure 11, example station 600A-E is operated as transmitter and receiver, and it is configured with past
Time (RTT) measurement is returned to automatically determine their position.For example, the management frame of these stations exchange such as beacon frame, and
RTT is measured to determine distance d1-d4.As the substitution of RTT measurement, other suitable measurements are can be used in the 600A-E that stands, and use this
Measurement can determine the distance between a pair of of station.For example, station 600A-E can be used known delivering power, rssi measurement, with
And RSSI is predicted with the model of the loss of distance, to estimate the distance at other stations.
It is schematically shown by the correspondence range of the signal of station 600A-E transmission by circle 610A-E.The half of circle 610A-E
Diameter is usually similar, but the purpose of the technology for the disclosure, needs not be identical.As shown in Figure 11, stand 600A
It " can hear " 600B that stands, the 600B that stands can listen the 600A and 600C that arrives at a station, and the 600C that stands can listen arrive at a station 600B, 600D and 600E,
The 600D that stands can listen arrive at a station 600B, 600C and 600E, and station 600E that can listen the 600C and 600D that arrives at a station.The 600A-E that stands can make
The distance of one or more neighbor stations is estimated with the one, two or more signal from other stations.In addition, when can be with
Described using one-dimensional fundamental form along path station 600A-E arrangement (that is, with path substantially the same distance not
Same position, all in this way on the ceiling in tunnel) when, the 600A-E that stands can also determine theirs using the instruction of geometry
Position.
