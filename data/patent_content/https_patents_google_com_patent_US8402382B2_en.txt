Definitions
- the present invention relates to methods of organizing and visualizing display objects within virtual environments.
- the present invention relates to interaction and visualization techniques for organizing display objects within virtual environments.
- a workspace in the physical world typically has piles of documents, binders and other objects arranged in a way that provides considerable subtle information to the owner. For example, items are often casually placed but their spatial position and orientation are usually meaningful. Closer items can indicate urgency, and piles of items are “automatically” ordered chronologically because new items are typically placed on top.
- This casual organization prevalent in the real world, differs greatly from the GUI desktop which forces users to immediately file their documents into a rigid hierarchy. Filing typically requires more effort than piling and has been shown to have other negative effects such as encouraging premature storage of low value documents, or retaining useless documents because of the effort that went into filing them.
- Piling as an organizing strategy has several advantages over filing. (Whittaker, S. & Hirschberg, J. (2001), The character, value, and management of personal paper archives, ACM Trans on CHI, 8(2), p. 150-170.) Piling is lightweight, casual, involves less overhead, and is easier to maintain than filing. Piles serve as visual reminders and increased availability of recent information. Pilers more frequently access their piles than filers accessed their file archives. Pilers archives may also be smaller, which can be attributed to piled information being easier to discard. Filers reluctantly discard information due to the effort put into initially filing it. Filers also prematurely filed documents later deemed to be of little or no value. In addition, sometimes more than one filing category applies, or an existing category is forgotten and a new one created.
- piling did not scale well and information was difficult to find once the number of piles grew large. Taken to excess, piling can take over every surface in an office. Despite the advantages of piling, there remains little technological support for piling in today's GUI desktops.
- DynaPadTM's “open” pile representation laid out entire collections of photos side-byside on a zoomable Pad++TM based workspace.
- This representation avoids occlusion of stacked items with each other, but results in higher visual load and greater screen real-estate requirements. The latter issue is mitigated because of infinite canvas.
- “Open” piles also aim to enhance remindability through visibility of all sub-objects, although this diminishes when the workspace is zoomed out and thumbnails become small.
- the alternative stack representation is in the spirit of familiar real-world piles and does not require a zoomable interface.
- the linearly ordered piles support fluid sorting and re-ordering in place without the need for additional tools.
- Denoue et al. disclosed using real-time simulated cloth texture-mapped as fliers and pinned up to virtual bulletin board that blow in the wind. (Denoue, L., Nelson, L., & Churchill, E. (2003), A fast, interactive 3D paper-flier metaphor for digital bulletin boards, UIST, p. 169-172.)
- Tossing as a window moving technique has also been disclosed.

- U.S. Pat. No. 5,303,388 to Kreitman et al. describes manipulable icons that are represented as three-dimensional objects with different data on each side that a user can manipulate. A user is therefore required to manually rotate icons to view the additional information.
- representing information on every side of the object constrain the potential shape of the object in order to maintain readability of each of the sides. Representing information on each side of an icon can also waste screen real estate as there may not be any relevant information to display for particular objects.
- U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,838,326 and 5,847,709 to Card et al. describes a “flick gesture” to move documents around to different components of an electronic workspace.
- the system is limited because it allows the documents to be tossed to finite areas only.
- “Flick gestures” in the cardinal directions are mapped to one-to-one onto specific workspace areas. This limits the expressive range and number of places documents may be moved with this technique.
- time-based gesture detection has inherent problems in recognition resulting in inaccuracy and false positives.
- U.S. Pat. No. 6,915,489 to Gargi discloses a system that stacks images diagonally and allows moving the mouse in a direction to browse them at a disjoint screen location.
- This diagonal arrangement with disjoint secondary-image requires a large amount of screen real estate and does not scale well to a very large number of items.
- the diagonal layout also does not efficiently use the space to the top-right or bottom-left of the diagonal arrangement of images. Also, this stacking technique occludes much of the images with the ones on top of it.
- U.S. Pat. No. 6,907,580 to Michelman et al. describes a moveable user interface element containing displayed options for further manipulation of a selected object.
- user interface elements are triggered by point-and-click interaction, which breaks user flow and is not continuous.
- U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,613,101 and 6,243,724 to Mander et al. discloses a mode-based piling approach to document organization. Gestures and interaction techniques were disclosed for browsing and manipulating piles and “casual organization” on a desktop. However, mode-based interaction techniques are known to be problematic as users often forget what mode they are in or that they need to switch. In addition, their approach uses idiosyncratic gestures which are prone to imperfect recognition and requiring memorization are used to trigger interaction. Also, some of the techniques disclosed are in isolation and not integrated with each other. For instance, sorting piles required a special mode with its own interface inside a dialog box, and is not integrated with the main display.
- the present invention provides an improved method, system and computer program product for organizing and visualizing display objects within a virtual environment.
- the present invention is a method for organizing and visualizing display objects in a virtual environment comprising: displaying the display objects in the virtual environment, the display objects representing one or more collections of data; and enabling real-time user interaction with the display objects in the virtual environment, wherein the user interaction with the display objects in the virtual environment is defined by pre-determined mechanics rules.
- the pre-determined mechanics rules are in essence computationally simulated physics implemented as an interface for enriched user interaction with display objects, e.g., file icons on a virtual desktop.
- a virtual environment with simulated mechanics is advantageous as it allows objects to be dragged and tossed around with the feel of realistic characteristics such as friction and mass, and objects can collide and displace others. Interactions feel more continuous, analog, natural and realistic to the user, rather than the discrete, rigid, mechnical style imposed by digital computing. This allows users to use the strategies they employ in the real world to both implicitly and explicitly convey information about the objects they own.
- the present invention also supports the casual organization of information in a manner where users are not forced to commit to categorization, such as the immediate naming and filing of documents. In this regard, users' spatial memory and knowledge of how things move physically in the real world is leveraged.
- piles are used as an organizational entity for desktop display objects.
- piles represent an ordered sequence display objects.
- piles can be used to convey playlists in a media context.
- fluid interaction techniques are used for committing actions associated with desktop objects.
- the present invention provides for the integration of interaction and visualization techniques into a coherent interface that provides for the easy selection of multiple objects, distinguishing objects, enhanced interaction and realism of objects, and enhanced browsing techniques, among other things.
- a computer program product of the present invention in one aspect thereof, is best understood as a computer application or computer applications that when loaded on a computer is operable to facilitate the interaction and visualization techniques described above.

- FIG. 18 illustrates viewing networked users virtual environments.
- the present invention provides an improved method, system and computer program product for organizing and visualizing display objects within a virtual environment.
- the present invention utilizes computationally simulated mechanics to enrich user interaction with display objects within a virtual environment, e.g., on a virtual desktop where the user manipulates and organizes icons representing their documents, images, audio, web pages, web content, products in an online store, services in an online store, videos, software programs, file system directories, among other things.
- display objects what is meant is a virtual object, such as an icon, that represents one or more collections of data.
- a collection of data can be named, i.e. a file, and can be comprised of data of any sort: text, documents, audio, images, web content, products in an online store, services in an online store, videos, software programs, file system directories, etc.
- a virtual environment with simulated mechanics allows objects to be dragged and tossed around with the feel of realistic characteristics such as friction and mass, and objects can collide and displace others, all according to pre-determined mechanics rules.
- Adding mechanics to the desktop makes the interaction feel more continuous and analog, rather, natural and realistic than the discrete, rigid, mechanical style imposed by digital computing.
- This allows users to use the strategies they employ in the real world to both implicitly and explicitly convey information about the objects they own.
- the implementation of mechanics in a virtual environment also supports the casual organization of information in a manner where users are not forced to commit to categorization, such as the immediate naming and filing of documents. In this regard, users' spatial memory and knowledge of how things move physically in the real world is leveraged.
- the present invention can be implemented in either two dimensional or three dimensional virtual environments. Three dimensions, from the perspective of a user viewing a virtual desktop on a computer screen, for example, is preferred because there are more options in terms of organization.
- piles are used as an organizational entity for display objects. Advanced piling techniques are described below.
- fluid interaction techniques are implemented for committing actions associated with the display objects, such as piling or unpiling.
- Advanced interaction techniques are described below.
- a pen or a touch screen or touch pad is preferred as a primary input device because it enhances the feeling of realism and directness of manipulation since objects being acted upon are visible directly under the pen tip or finger stroke.
- these techniques also readily apply to a mouse, trackball, other touch-sensitive surfaces or various other input devices, as would be readily appreciated by a person of skill in the art.
- An aspect of the present invention is to provide documents that feel like tangible physical objects.
- display objects representing documents can be combined with added mechanics properties such as those of paper. This empowers users to organize their virtual desktops in more casual, subtle and expressive ways as they do in their real workspaces.
- storage devices could be represented by display objects that represent their physical form factors and mass. This enhances the tangibility of the object.
- the present invention is adapted for use with the new generation of touch-based computer input devices, such as pen-based devices or touch-sensitive screens. On these devices there is often no keyboard is available for triggering interactions. Fluid interaction that avoids excessive point-and-click interaction is preferred when applicable, as is exploiting the pressure sensing capabilities of the pen while avoiding designs that are problematic for pen interaction such as small clicking targets, double clicking and clicking with the right-mouse button.
- Discoverable, Learnable Interface After learning a small set of initial basic interaction techniques, a user should be able to discover how to do more complex interactions on their own. Unlike many gestural interfaces, it is preferable to avoid requiring the user to memorize a large gesture vocabulary before they can use the system effectively.
- the present invention employs existing discoverable techniques that foster smooth transitions from novice to expert behaviour.
- self-revealing interaction techniques are designed by using appropriate visual cues, and support transient easily reversible actions.
- the present invention employs smooth slow-in and slow-out transitions for every visual change in data representation. It is established that is easier for users to maintain a mental model of the data across smooth transitions and less time is spent comprehending the new data presentation.
- the simulation of mechanics rules can be achieved using the PhysXTM Software Development Kit (SDK), for example.
- SDK Software Development Kit
- the PhysXTM SDK is provided by the AGEIA Corporation, maker of the PhysXTM Physics Processing Unit (PPU). PPU's are dedicated hardware that handle mechanics rules calculations required by the PhysXTM SDK, freeing the CPU for other tasks.
- PhysXTM SDK provides a rigid body dynamics solver facilitating collision detection and response, frictional forces, simulated springs, mass response, spring simulation, cloth simulation, etc.
- Display objects e.g., file icons
- Display objects are represented by oriented bounding boxes to the PhysXTM SDK, which for each timestep returns an updated position and orientation for each object, according to the forces in the simulation and the rules of mechanics.
- User input generates appropriate forces on interacted objects which in turn effect other objects in the system.
- a simulated gravitational force keeps objects on the ground.
- mechanics simulation to a virtual environment (e.g., the computer desktop) makes it more lively, and offers increased degrees-of-freedom for more expressiveness than a traditional GUI desktop where icons are kept axis-aligned and have little familiarity to their physical counterparts.
- This physical simulation has a positive and subtle effect on object placement and appearance. For example, if a few display objects are casually tossed to a corner they will collide and begin to accumulate. Their messy appearance subtly affords an unorganized state, without the user having to explicitly specify it.
- the present invention contemplates a variety of particular implementations.
- the present invention could be bundled or integrated with current operating systems such as Microsoft WINDOWSTM or Macintosh OS XTM as replacement or add-on to the built-in desktop with far more capabilities. It is noted that it is possible to incorporate only a subset of the functionality of the present invention to enhance current desktops. This allows leveraging these techniques while maintaining a more familiar interface to the user. For instance, in Microsoft WINDOWSTM the users desktop may remain the same but when a directory is browsed, the contents of the window may optionally be browsed using the techniques disclosed here, amongst the other techniques of browsing a directory contents (e.g., List view, Icon view, Details view, etc.).
- Microsoft WINDOWSTM the users desktop may remain the same but when a directory is browsed, the contents of the window may optionally be browsed using the techniques disclosed here, amongst the other techniques of browsing a directory contents (e.g., List view, Icon view, Details view, etc.).
- 3D graphics required to implement the present invention could be achieved by a system-level drawing library with built-in support for hardware accelerated rendering of 3D graphics, such as the recent Windows Presentation Foundation in Microsoft WINDOWSTM or Quartz Extreme in Macintosh OS XTM.
- a hardware accelerated 3D graphics library such as OpenGLTM or DirectXTM.
- TabletPC optimized versions of Microsoft WINDOWSTM would greatly benefit from the pen-centric interaction techniques, since current TabletPC's simply use the version of windows designed to be driven by a mouse, making interaction cumbersome and awkward.
- a stand-alone deployment of one or more aspects of the present invention could be released installed on top of and integrated with current operating systems. Such an application could be used in addition to or in replacement of the current desktop.
- a desktop in accordance with the present invention could be populated by the display objects from users previous desktop file system directory and changes made on the enhanced desktop in accordance with the present invention would be reflected in the file system.
- Objects could be bi-directionally moved to and from existing windows and applications to the desktop in accordance with the present invention with drag-and-drop.
- activating objects (files or folders) in the desktop interface in accordance with the present invention could launch their appropriate viewer applications.
- the present invention can be applied to any implementation having a graphic user interface where advance interaction with display objects is desirable, and is not limited to just personal computers.
- PDAs personal digital assistants
- mobile phones mobile phones
- BLACKBERRYTM BLACKBERRYTM
- What are required are a display means, an input device, and a suitable computing means to implement mechanics rules and other interaction and visualization techniques.
- client web-enabled client-server and peer to peer systems are contemplated.
- a web-based embodiment of the present invention would be operable to enable the mechanics and organization techniques functionality to a client computer through the Internet.
- Peer to peer connections of any virtual environment client implementation is also contemplated by the present invention
- the present invention contemplates making increased use of document meta-data and enhanced visualization of display object attributes.
- file size is mapped to mass or volume or friction index of the display object's representation within the virtual environment.
- Other physical properties could be used as cues for conveying content information. For example, larger files might move slower because they feel ‘heavier’ or older files appear dog-eared to show their wear.
- Other physical phenomena could be employed to guide the designs.
- objects could be modeled as sheets of paper that can be folded in interesting ways to convey information or draped over other objects. It would be also useful to be able to pin something to the desktop like you could to the walls. PressureLock and tear away techniques (described below) could be used to pin and unpin display objects.
- Gravitational fields that surround display objects can also be used to attract other similar display objects (e.g., of the same file format) situated nearby within the virtual environment. For instance, a pile full of photos would have a greater pull on a photo being tossed by it than a neighbouring pile of spreadsheets. A gravitational field implementation would also support the escape velocity to allow display objects to be tossed beyond piles that may attract it.
- Another extension of the physical metaphor includes using a magnet to gather like icons from the desktop. For instance, a video magnet could be used to attract video files from a large unorganized heap of documents while maintaining context. Multiple magnets could be used in conjunction to see spatial relationships.
- the landmarks and layout of the desk greatly inform how display objects will be organized. For example, walls can have notes posted on them or shelves will be used to store documents.
- a desktop interface in accordance with the present invention can incorporate this in a number of ways.
- the layout of user's desk can be digitally replicated, or offer virtual templates of standard physical desk configurations to increase user familiarity with the system.
- variations to the desktop's layout could be made to aid in organization, such as permanent shelves, or recessed/raised areas for storage.
- multiple workspaces can exist within a single plane, which when zoomed out could facilitate the transfer of documents between users by tossing them to the desired workspace.
- these multiple workspaces could be used by a single-user to management and organization of different tasks.
- BusTopTM is used herein to describe a computer product in accordance with the present invention, according to one example embodiment.
- BumpTopTM provides users with a perspective “21 ⁇ 2D” view onto a planar desktop surface tilted 25 degrees with respect to the camera, as illustrated in FIG. 1 . This angle is preferred over a top-down perspective view (which resembles a flat desktop users are accustomed to) because users may find it difficult to distinguish the depths of piles and confused them with single objects.
- motion is constrained to the desktop by the walls enclosing it.
- the wall corners provide a place for documents to pile up on top of each other and act as a landscape feature that could aid in cognitive grouping of documents.
- the user can also enable the use of the screen boundaries as walls, off of which display objects will bump and collide.
- the desktop texture has a number of circles which act as “passive landmarks” that could aid in visually separating groups of display objects.
- users are free to place documents anywhere on the surface.
- Files e.g., documents, text, images, videos
- display objects whose geometry is a 3D cube squashed on one axis, and is texture-mapped on all sides so that when vertically stacked there is an indication of its type. Being able to discern information from icon edges supports a pile browsing behaviour that occurs in the real world called edge browsing. Also, non-zero depth is necessary for the bounding volumes used in the collision detection. Textual labels are optionally presented on top of the display objects.
- Mechanics-based movement of objects is simulated with rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and frictional forces. When objects collide they bump against and displace one another in a physically realistic fashion. A simulated gravitational force keeps objects on the ground.
- the introduction of mechanics simulation to a desktop environment makes the desktop more lively, and offers increased degrees-of-freedom for potentially more expressiveness than a traditional GUI desktop where icons are kept axis-aligned and have little resemblance to their physical counterparts.
- This physical simulation has a positive and subtle effect on object placement and appearance. For example, if a few documents are casually tossed to a corner they will collide and begin to accumulate. Their messy appearance subtly affords an unorganized state, without the user having to explicitly specify it.
- BumpTopTM enables casual organization of documents as one would on the surface a real, physical desk furniture, using piling rather than explicit filing as the primary organizational style.
- interaction and visualization techniques are utilized implicitly and explicitly for creating, manipulating and organizing piles and display objects within the piles.
- An input means such as a mouse, or preferably a pressure-sensitive pen with a single barrel button operating on a TabletPC, allows the user to interact with the display objects in the virtual environment.
- the pen by default allows users to move and or toss objects by touching and then dragging or flicking them with the pen in a manner similar to how one might use a finger to manipulate a bunch of lightweight items on a physical surface.
- a spring is attached from the point on the display object the user first clicked on, to the current cursor position. This allows for the free form, natural, realistic intuitive movement and tossing of display objects. More complex interactions require additional techniques.
- the interaction of display objects can be triggered by a technique called LassoMenu that combines selection, command invocation, and parameter adjustment in one fluid stroke, as illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- Users select display objects in the typical “lasso” fashion of drawing a path that encircles them.
- a semitransparent circle is placed at the beginning of the lasso stroke. The minimum distance is in proportion to the size of the semitransparent circle.
- buttons are presented with a control menu, a marking menu variant in which the user first selects a menu item via a simple stroke and then can choose to smoothly move the pen in a 2D fashion to adjust the value of an associated parameter.
- the LassoMenu avoids the pigtail gesture that some users found difficult and was less preferred than the handle technique in the prior art.
- the LassoMenu is more fluid than the known handle techniques which interrupts the stroke by requiring the pen to be lifted for the marking menu to appear.
- the unobtrusive semi-transparent blue circle indicates additional functionality, and the user is not penalized for simply exploring it as lifting the pen up before they leave the blue circle does nothing.
- the inclusion of a control menu enables the fluid transition from novice to expert functionality in that novice users can browse the menu visually to identify and select the desired items while experts who have performed the same selection numerous times in the past can simply make the stroke in the appropriate direction without visually attending to the menu itself.
- the LassoMenu can, if desired, be used smoothly in combination with existing techniques like the handle and pigtail. Using the pigtail with the LassoMenu allows for command invocation without closing the lasso stroke. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that while we describe much of the interaction in the invention as being triggered by the LassoMenu, it may be be invoked by traditional mechanisms instead as well (ie, keyboard keys, menu option, etc.), without departing from the scope of the invention.
- Another benefit of the spring is that it allows a quick flick of an object to toss it across the screen.
- the display object will naturally decelerate due to friction and will bump and displace objects in its path appropriately. The quicker the flick, the further and more forcefully the object will travel.
- Multiple objects or piles are moved and tossed in a similar fashion.
- Selection springs allow the drag or toss of one document to tug along the other documents in the selection while maintaining their relative spatial positioning to each other. These springs are released when documents are deselected by clicking a vacant area of the desktop or starting a new selection.
- the pen or touch input can also be used to ruffle through and nudge objects aside as if it had actual physical geometry in the workspace. In the case of a pen, this is accomplished by holding down the pen barrel button while moving it on or above the screen surface. It is noted that accidental triggering has been known to occur with use of the barrel button though new pen designs which move the button further up on the pen minimize this. Alternatively the functionality can be triggered by a different mouse button or keyboard modifier key.
- the objects in accordance with the present invention behave as if they had certain physical properties. They are moveable, rigid, bouncy, and toss-able. These properties enable a more physically realistic environment and afford users to organize their virtual objects in more expressive ways.
- Piles are created by lassoing around a group of display objects, then crossing the ‘create pile’ icon that appears at the group's centroid.
- This technique is called Lasso'n'Cross ( FIG. 3 ). This technique allows users to fluidly select and pile objects in one stroke. Novice users will typically wait until they notice the icon before completing the stroke, but as they practice making the stroke over successive invocations, they transition seamlessly to expert behaviour where the stroke is made without waiting for the icon to appear. Lasso'n'Cross also supports undo, allowing users to undo and redo the pile creation by consecutively re-crossing the icon. Undoing can be thought of as “un-crossing the initial cross” since the stroke is undone by making it backwards.
- Lasso'n'Cross is an improvement over similar pen-based gestures combining selection and a single action in prior art, such as a delete gesture that is triggered if the end of the stroke is inside the closed lasso. It is advantageous because it supports undo and eases the requirement of remembering a gesture by facilitating discovery amongst novices.
- the user can choose to tidy them, create a messy pile, or create a tidy pile out of them.
- the option is determined by the distance between the end points of the stroke drawn after “Tidy/Make Pile” has been selected in the LassoMenu.
- the option selected in order of shortest to longest stroke is as follows: (1) tidy documents by tightening up their poses but do not create a pile; (2) create a Messy pile; and (3) create a Tidy pile, shown in FIG. 4 .
- These options are ranges on a continuum of stroke distances and selecting in between these ranges specifies the degree of the particular option.
- the document poses are updated live and the user can “scrub” to create the desired arrangement. Visual feedback during the scrub is provided by icons that appear at the range edges. That is, the points at which a messy pile or tidy pile will be created.
- a messy pile integrates some of the objects' messy pose information by interpolating between the messy and tidy arrangements of a pile. Instead of arbitrarily displacing display objects in the pile to achieve a messy appearance, the messy pile concept incorporates meaningful spatial information from the unpiled state.
- a user first lassos two or more objects on a virtual desktop in order to select them ( 2 ).
- the user can create a pigtail gesture ( 4 ), which in turn invokes a command requesting whether the user would like to tidy or make a pile ( 14 ).
- the pigtail gesture is not created after lassoing, the user may also optionally use the Lasso'n'Cross technique which allows fluid selection and piling of the objects in one stroke ( 6 ). If so, a tidy pile is created ( 12 ), but can be uncreated if the user uncrosses the Lasso'n'Cross gesture ( 10 ).
- the objects are released from the lasso, allowing the user to lasso other objects ( 2 ). If after lassoing objects the user does neither the pigtail gesture nor the Lasso'n'Cross ( 8 ), the LassoMenu is entered ( 16 ). The user is then presented with the “Tidy/Make Pile” option ( 14 ) which, as stated above, is determined by the distance between the end points of the stroke drawn after “Tidy/Make Pile” has been selected in the Lasso Menu 5 ( 16 ). If the stroke length is passed the “make tidy pile” threshold ( 16 ), then a pile is created ( 12 ). If the stroke length is not passed the “no pile” threshold ( 18 ), then no pile is created (A). If the stroke length is passed the “no pile” threshold ( 18 ), then the objects are tidied ( 20 ).
- pile widgets When the pen hovers over a pile, pile widgets ( FIG. 4 d ) are revealed allowing the user to trigger various browsing techniques of the pile's contents ( FIG. 5 ).
- the Fan-Out widget spreads pile display objects like a deck of cards on the user-drawn path, allowing pile contents to be viewed in parallel ( FIG. 5 f ).
- Leafing through pile contents much like one flips through pages of a book is accomplished by scrubbing the Leafer widget ( FIG. 5 b ).
- the Compression-Browse widget compresses display objects on one axis to reveal the display objects underneath, without moving display objects ( FIG. 5 c ).
- the standard grid layout is also offered ( FIG.
- the Messy/Tidy widget is like the inverse of the “Tidy/Make Pile” pile creation functionality described above. Seeing how piled objects were originally strewn about the desktop may aid recall of pile purpose or content ( FIG. 5 d ). Scrubbing this widget interpolates between the messy and tidy poses and at the extreme messy pose an icon appears indicating the pile will be broken.
- Another view of piled contents is the Detailed List View. In this view display objects are vertically arranged in a line, with further textual information about the display object (i.e., in the case of files the file name, creation date and file size) displayed to the objects right-hand side ( FIG. 13 ).
- Widgets also act as crossing targets for the novel Drag'n'Cross technique for precise insertion of objects into a pile, as described later. All transitions between browsing styles are animated smoothly.
- the LassoMenu may be used to trigger browsing of unpiled objects. For example, it may be useful to temporarily view casually strewn objects in a grid layout to see occluded objects. Compression-browse would similarly reveal occluded display objects without disturbing display objects.
- a collection of one or more display objects may be automatically piled into several piles according to information regarding the display object ( FIG. 15 ) (i.e., date the file was last modified, the first letter of the file name).
- FIG. 15 the display object
- selecting a small number of sub-piles to represent the categories works best, such as 2 to 5 depending on how varied the collections data is.
- the pile browsing techniques described above may further be used to allow further exploration of the display objects. Sub-piles are smoothly animated as little as necessary to create room for the browsed piles contents ( FIG. 14 ).
- Exploding Piles functionality of the present invention, offering a way of visually searching pile contents regionally. Once Exploding Piles is invoked with the LassoMenu, piles are smoothly exploded into a grid view on hover. Moving the pen away collapses piles back to their original state. Exploding Piles exploits the rough spatial memory a user might have about what they're looking for. For example, if it is known a display object is in one of the piles in the top-right of your workspace you can inspect them by pointing at them.
- PressureLock When users push very hard with the pen and reach the maximum pressure level, it acts as a trigger dubbed PressureLock which is used, for example, to lock a pile down into a specific browsing layout or pinning objects to the wall. Pushing the pen hard on the screen surface for pinning evokes similar actions in the real world.
- a circular pressure cursor with an inner circle that increases in size with the current pressure level ( FIG. 6 ).
- the pressure level reaches its maximum, the color intensifies and the outline turns into a bright white to indicate a PressureLock has occurred.
- a PressureLock is possible it is indicated by the outer ring turning a hollow white, enabling discovery amongst novice users.
- a pressure-based confirmation of a preview with the pen-up before maximum pressure is reached being equivalent to an undo.
- Another technique for adding to a pile allows display objects can be dragged on top of a pile that will highlight indicating that they will be added to the top on pen up. If the user drags an object to a pile and dwells, the pile is temporarily pushed apart allowing for precise insertion of that object into any location within the pile. Scrubbing the pen along the side of the pile varies the insertion point.
- the present invention provides a more pen-centric interaction technique called Drag'n'Cross ( FIG. 8 ). While dragging objects, users can cross through a pile widget to use one of the browsing techniques for specific insertion. For example, if you drag an object and cross the Leafer widget, the object will be inserted at the point that you had leafed to before lifting the pen. After precise insertion, added objects slightly stick out of the pile in the direction they were added from. This indicates the recent insertion and reminds users that further organization may be necessary. To tidy the pile again, the user can simply adjust the Messy widget.
- Elements of the two paper processing strategies can be blended: piling and hierarchical filing.
- users can merge any combination of piles and objects into a new pile, using the same techniques employed to create a ‘flat’ pile out of just objects: LassoMenu or Lasso'n'Cross.
- the new hierarchical pile stores all information regarding the sub-piles and includes display objects sticking out in sub-piles. If the hierarchical pile is broken, sub-piles are restored in their original positions with changes, like display object deletions, folded through. When the hierarchical pile is browsed with one of the techniques described below, the sub-piles are seen as piles in the laid out version ( FIG. 16 a ).
- the present invention supports similar functionality to emphasize, distinguish and indicate separation of piled display objects.
- Display objects in a locked down pile can be re-oriented from the LassoMenu.
- groups of display objects can be re-positioned so they stick out ( FIG. 9 ).
- the pile smoothly collapses back to its piled state so it can be seen in context. Dragging moves objects parallel to the plane the pile sits in, to avoid changing pile order. If the objects are dragged so far that they no longer overlap any part of the pile, they are pulled out of the pile and become the active dragged selection.
- a user first crosses or selects a pile widget ( 30 ).
- the Lasso Menu is invoked on the pile ( 36 ), providing a further means of a selecting a browsing method ( 38 ).
- PressureLock 40
- PressureLock 40
- the pile contents are manipulated with the LassoMenu ( 46 ).
- Objects can be shifted ( 48 ) by moving the cursor which alters the object's position in the pile ( 50 ).
- Objects can be sorted be size ( 52 ), and subsets can also be sorted ( 54 ). Objects can be sorted be type ( 56 ), and subsets can also be sorted ( 58 ). One or more objects can be deleted ( 60 ), or subsets deleted ( 62 ). Objects can also be moved and reoriented ( 64 ), using the cursor ( 60 ).
- Frequently accessed display objects are usually moved to the top of their piles, leaving less relevant material at the bottom due to repeated re-referencing. This is facilitated in the present invention by supporting easy removal and casual addition to the top of piles via tossing.
- the physical properties of paper include being thin, light, porous, opaque and flexible. Further, these properties afford different human actions including folding, crumpling, creasing, and pinning.
- Our invention supports several manipulations that physical paper affords, in line with an aspect of the present invention comprising Tangible, Realistic Display Objects. This is supported by freeform creasing of a corner or folding of a document ( FIG. 1 ). To escalate a document to even greater importance, it can be pinned up to a wall, or by using PressureLock to create a springy joint. To remove it a user simply pulls the document off the wall. Another technique is locking the rotation of objects to make them standup on end ( FIG. 10 ), despite collisions. This is accomplished with a LassoMenu triggered rotation and PressureLock once the desired rotation is specified. Further, and in combination with all of the previous techniques, objects may be resized. Object density remains constant so bigger icons have more mass while reducing size reduces mass. Bigger documents are not only more visually noticeable but behave as though they are more important, displacing smaller display objects when moved and being difficult to move when bumped by smaller, lighter display objects.
- FIG. 1 To de-emphasize display objects a user can crumple them up ( FIG. 1 ).
- This aspect provides an in-between state for display objects whose utility is questionable but are not quite ready for deletion. Crumpling is done from the LassoMenu which specifies a 2D parameter for distorting the object mesh. For example, a long quick stroke results in a tightly crumpled document.
- flash screen that contains the program or services branding information, amongst other things.
- Paper-like attributes are appropriate for display objects representing content that in the real world is often found on paper. Such display objects include documents, text, photographs, emails, web pages, etc. For other data types, such as media representing audio or video, other attributes are appropriate.
- media display objects as consumer media products such as DVDs or CDs.
- the unactivated media display object appears with similar proportions to those in FIG. 1 .
- One animation for further exploring the display object's contents is the flipping open of the virtual cover of the display object ( FIGS. 17 a , 17 b ). For media display objects this is visually familiar to opening a CD case.
- an object which resembles a compact disc that is also texture-mapped with a relevant image smoothly rises from the “case” and spins if the media display object is played ( FIG. 17 c ).
- a duplicate of a display object is made, its duplicate can drop from the sky on top of or close to the source display object. In this case location for the drop is automatically determined by the duplication command.
- Current web browsers such as Mozilla FIREFOXTM and Microsoft INTERNET EXPLORERTM 7.0 allow multiple webpages to be browsed simultaneously using “tabs”. When a new tab is created in these interfaces it is placed in a one dimensional row of the existing tabs. In our invention, the tab would “drop from the sky” into the virtual environment, and could be organized as any other display object. This allows users to use three dimensional spatial memory and mechanics rules to enhance organization and management of display objects.
- This technique may further be extended for collections of data that become available to the computing environment.
- a display object representing the proportions and appearance of the physical form factor of the data collection can “Drop from the Sky” into the virtual environment.
- a display object representing the proportions and appearance of the physical form factor of the data collection can “Drop from the Sky” into the virtual environment.
- these data collections could be any type of collection of data. For example, connecting an external USB storage device to the computing environment, or networked files residing on a remote machine to which a connection was just made.
- the user may toss it towards the general direction of the data collection display object and it will be added according to the tossing algorithm provided for adding to a pile provided above.
- Users of multiple networked virtual environments may visualize the contents of other user's virtual environments that are connected via network.
- each user may specify a subset of display objects to make visible to other networked users, or rules for determining how which display objects to share with other networked users on their remotely displayed virtual environment. (i.e. display object icons may be visible while filenames are obscured to enhance privacy).
- display object icons may be visible while filenames are obscured to enhance privacy).
- tossing can be used as an interaction technique to transfer files between these networked virtual environments using the algorithms described above.
- the camera can zoom out of the users personal environment to a view such as that presented in FIG. 18 .
- the networked virtual environments can exist in a plane, and may be re-arranged according to mechanics rules as other display objects in the system.
- search query When executing a search query, display objects representing the search results will “drop from the sky” into the virtual environment, as described above. This enhances the physicality and tangibility of the search. Results can further be organized in the same flexible ways as other display objects in the invention.
- the search query could be executed on any combination of information sources. For example, the users local hard disk, the internet's webpages, photographs, audio, videos, etc.
- popular search engines such as GOOGLETM or YAHOOTM typically represent search results as a linear listing of short text-based summaries.
- Our invention allows the results of a web search to be browsed in parallel as thubmanils of the webpage texture mapped onto display objects in the virtual environment. Browsing visual results in parallel enables better user performance of finding the information the are looking for due to increased informational bandwidth, and use of spatial memory to facilitate the organization, management and sense-making of search results.
- search result meta-data such as relevance to mechanics properties of the display object. For example, more relevant search objects are represented as slightly larger and heavier than those that are less relevant.
- group of related search results we can present the group of related search results as piles. In these piles the top element would the original result from the search query. These piles can then be browsed using the techniques described above. The pile representation also allows the user to visualize how much related content is available.
- Our invention supports enhanced techniques for tagging display objects.
- Display objects may be tossed around to create loose arrangements of the display objects.
- Tossing is advantageous because the mouse needs to travel less distance to toss an object, since it need not move exactly to a desired point, instead a general direction can be specified.
- tossing is more casual and as such encourages facilitates loose arrangements to be created before a high level structure of the information may be known.
- Toss'n'Tag can be activated which detects white space between display objects and allows tag's for each grouping to be specified.
- the user may choose to associate spatial regions with specific tag(s) before beginning to toss things. These regions can partially overlap since tags are not mutually exclusive.
- regions If the regions fully overlap they are collapsed into a single region with multiple tags.
- the regions can be defined by encircling a region and then invoking the LassoMenu and selecting “Create Tag Region”.
- Yet another way to tag documents includes creating tags that are visualized and interated as other display objects in the system. They can then be tossed at other display objects to tag them. When tags are piled they can be tossed as a group.
- the physical simulation can sometimes prove disruptive, and occasionally it can be disabled. For example, when display objects are in a messy or tidy pile and if physics are enabled, the collision detection of perfectly touching display objects can cause numerical instability, jittering and unnecessary movement by piled display objects. Also, dragged icons can knock over piles.
- un-restricted mechanics allows six degrees of freedom in the potential positions of objects. This added freedom and expressiveness also affords more ways to “make a mess”. Therefore, in a further aspect of the present invention, all display objects can remain axis-aligned. Collisions are no longer physically accurate but objects are easily readable remaining properly oriented, more closely resembling modem GUI desktops. In this mode the desktop seems aesthetically tidier but looks and feels mechanical ( FIG. 10 ). Alternatively, a small amount of off-axis rotation can be allowed to make the appearance less rigid while maintaining readability and preventing objects from becoming too messy. We allow a fixed number of degrees of rotation about the axis that is normal to the virtual environment's desktop surface.
- BumpTopTM runs in real-time on a Toshiba M200 TabletPC with a 1.6 Ghz CPU, 1 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GeForceTM FX Go 5200 graphics card.
- the example, the software is written with C++, OpenGL and GLUT.
- the mechanics e.g., the rigid body dynamics, physical simulation and collision detection rules, are provided by the AGEIA PhysXTM SDK.
