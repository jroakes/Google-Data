Definitions
- This specification relates to ranking search results for queries.
- search engines identify resources such as web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content, for example, as search results that are responsive to a user query and present the results to the user.
- Such search engines typically rank search results so that they are ordered by degree of relevance to the user query. The quality of the ranking can depend on the type, precision, and accuracy of data that is used to score the resources.
- This specification describes technologies relating to ranking search results for queries, particularly for ranking image search results.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of calculating a visual similarity score for one or more pairs of images in a plurality of images based on visual features of images in each of the one or more pairs; building a graph of images by linking each of one or more images in the plurality of images to one or more nearest neighbor images based on the visual similarity scores of the image pairs that include the image; associating a respective score with each of one or more images in the graph based on data indicative of user behavior relative to the image as a search result for a query; and determining a new score for each of one or more images in the graph based on the respective score of the image, and the respective scores of one or more nearest neighbors to the image as weighted by their visual similarity to the image.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the method further includes ranking each of one or more images in the plurality of images according to the image's new score.
- the user behavior is selection of the image.
- Calculating a visual similarity score for one or more pairs of images includes extracting one or more features from visual content of a first image, and the method further includes identifying one or more k nearest neighbor images based on a distance measure between the first image and each of the one or more k nearest neighbor images.
- the distance measure is a combination of basic distances from multiple visual features.
- the distance measure is based on a joint equal contribution (JEC).
- JEC joint equal contribution
- the weight is calculated by passing the distance measure through a non-linear function.
- c i , new ⁇ * ⁇ j ⁇ i ⁇ ( W ij * c j , current ) + ( 1 - ⁇ ) * c i , current , where c i,current is a current score for the first image, c j,current is a current score for the first nearest neighbor image represented by node j, c i,new is the new score for the first image, W ij , is the normalized weight that represents the distance measure between the first image represented by node i and the first nearest neighbor image represented by node j, and ⁇ is a determined parameter.
- a computer readable medium for storing data that includes a graph of images, each of one or more nodes in the graph representing a different image from a plurality of images, one or more nodes linked to one or more nearest neighbor nodes based on a visual similarity between images represented by the linked nodes; where a new score is associated with each of one or more images in the graph based on a respective score of the image, and respective scores of one or more nearest neighbors to the image as weighted by their visual similarity to the image, and where the respective score of the image is based on data indicative of user behavior relative to the image as a search result for a query.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and methods.
- Linked nodes are connected by edges, where the edges are associated with weights that represent distance measures of the visual similarity between images represented by the linked nodes.
- the new scores are expressed as:
- c i , new ⁇ * ⁇ j ⁇ i ⁇ ( W ij * c j , current ) + ( 1 - ⁇ ) * c i , current , where c i,current is a current score for the image, c j,current is a current score for a nearest neighbor image represented by nearest neighbor node j, c i,new is the new score for the image, W ij is a normalized weight that represents the distance measure between the image represented by node i and the nearest neighbor image represented by node j, and ⁇ is a determined parameter.
- the systems and techniques for ranking a first resource based on content and data indicative of user behavior relative to the first resource and a second resource as a search result for a query are scalable to a large number of queries (e.g., millions of queries), thereby increasing the flexibility and coverage of a search.
- the systems and techniques described in this specification can be used for ranking resources that are not associated with data indicative of user behavior or do not have sufficient context (e.g., annotations) to provide an accurate score, thereby further increasing the flexibility and coverage of the search. For example, an amount of data available to score a particular resource is increased, thereby reducing effects of noise in a subset of data that was previously available to score the particular resource.
- FIG. 1A illustrates an example web page including image search results displayed according to a first order.
- FIG. 1B illustrates the example web page of FIG. 1A including the image search results displayed according to a second order.
- FIG. 2 includes an example search system.
- FIG. 3 shows an example diffusion module
- FIG. 4 shows an example process for scoring images based on visual content and data indicative of user behavior.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example graph that includes nodes representing images.
- FIG. 1A illustrates an example web page 1000 a including image search results displayed according to a first order.
- the web page 1000 a includes a query 1004 a , “soccer ball,” entered in a search text field 1002 and a group of image search results 1010 , 1020 , 1040 , 1050 , 1060 , and 1070 returned from a search engine in response to the query 1004 a .
- Each image search result for a particular image can include a label 1021 for the particular image from a resource, a selectable link 1022 to the resource, and a thumbnail image 1023 of the particular image.
- the thumbnail image 1023 can also be selected to access the resource.
- the web page 1000 a can also include user interface elements for submitting queries for searches within an image corpus (e.g., “Search Images” button 1006 ) and for submitting queries for searches within a web page corpus (e.g., “Search the Web” button 1008 ).
- an image corpus e.g., “Search Images” button 1006
- a web page corpus e.g., “Search the Web” button 1008
- the first order in which the image search results are displayed in FIG. 1A illustrates an example where the data used to score and rank images can be inaccurate.
- the data can be indicative of user behavior relative to an image being a search result for a query.
- the user behavior is selection of the image.
- Each selection of a presented document reference such as an image, for example, is recorded as a “click” for the document in connection with the query.
- a timer can be used to track how long a user views or “dwells” on the document. For example, a longer time spent dwelling on a document (i.e., a long click) can indicate that a user found the document to be relevant for the query.
- a brief period viewing a document i.e., a short click
- the click data is a count of clicks of all types (e.g., long, medium, short) for a particular query and document combination.
- the click data includes a count of each click type (e.g., long, medium, short) for a particular query and document combination.
- Aggregated click data from queries for a given document can be used to rank or enhance a ranking of that document.
- a quantity of result statistics can be a weighted average of the count of long clicks for a given document and query pair.
- a search engine or other process creates a record in a model database for documents that are selected by users in response to a query.
- Each record within the model e.g., a tuple ⁇ document, query, data>, is at least a combination of a query submitted by users, a document reference selected by users in response to that query, and an aggregation of click data for all users that select the document reference in response to the query.
- the aggregated click data is viewed as an indication of document relevance.
- model data is locale-specific (e.g., country, state, etc.) or language-specific. Other extensions of model data are possible.
- thumbnail image 1023 of image search result 1020 shows a soccer player, e.g., a world-renowned soccer player. Users searching for “soccer ball” may be distracted by an image of a popular soccer player and may select the image even though it is not relevant to their query or original search intent. Users may also spend a relatively long amount of time viewing the document such that a medium click or long click is recorded. As a result, the click data associated with the image may include a relatively high count of long clicks.
- the score for the image of the soccer player may indicate that the image is more relevant to the query 1004 a “soccer ball” than other images (e.g., images corresponding to image search results 1010 , 1040 , 1050 , and 1060 ) which, in reality, may be more relevant to the query 1004 a.
- FIG. 1B illustrates the example web page 1000 a of FIG. 1A including the image search results displayed according to a second order.
- the initial ranking of the image search results, as represented by the first order in FIG. 1A are modified such that similar images are ranked closer to each other.
- the scores of the images can be generated based on data indicative of user behavior relative to one or more similar images as a search result for the query, as described below.
- image search results 1020 and 1070 which both include images of soccer players, are ranked closer to each other.
- FIG. 2 includes an example search system 2014 , specifically for providing search results relevant to submitted search queries as can be implemented in the Internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 2014 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a client device 2004 e.g., a personal computer, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant, a mobile audio or video player, a game console, or a combination of one or more of them.
- the client 2004 can be a computer coupled to the search system 2014 through a local area network (LAN), e.g., an enterprise intranet, or a wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the client device 2004 will generally include a memory 2006 , e.g., random access memory (RAM), and one or more processors 2008 .
- RAM random access memory
- Users 2002 submit queries to a search engine 2030 within a search system 2014 .
- queries include text-based queries, speech signals, touch screen gestures, non-touch gestures, motion gestures, image-based queries, or video-based queries.
- Each query 2010 is transmitted through one or more wired or wireless networks to the search system 2014 .
- the search system 2014 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 2014 includes an index database 2022 and a search engine 2030 .
- the search system 2014 responds to the query 2010 by generating search results 2028 , which are transmitted through the network to the client device 2004 in a form that can be presented to the user 2002 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 2004 .
- the search engine 2030 When the query 2010 is received by the search engine 2030 , the search engine 2030 identifies relevant resources.
- the search engine 2030 will generally include an indexing module 2020 that actively searches a corpus of resources, e.g., web pages, images, blogs, databases, or news articles on an intranet or the Internet, to index the resources found in that corpus, and stores index information for the resources in an index database 2022 .
- This index database 2022 is used to identify resources that match the query 2010 .
- the search engine 2030 will also generally include a ranking module 2052 (or other software) to rank the resources related to the user query 2010 .
- ranking of the resources is performed using conventional techniques that determine an information retrieval score (also referred to as a “score”) for indexed resources based on a given query. Other ranking techniques are possible.
- the information retrieval score is modified by a diffusion module 2060 as described below.
- the diffusion module 2060 can generate a scaling weight, e.g., a multiplier, used to modify the information retrieval score to produce a final score.
- the search engine 2030 can transmit the search results 2028 through the network to the client device 2004 for presentation to the user 2002 .
- the web page 1000 a can be displayed in a browser on the client device 2004 .
- the client device 2004 can transmit the query 1004 a to the search system 2014 .
- the search system 2014 can generate the image search results 1010 , 1020 , 1040 , 1050 , 1060 , and 1070 , in a manner as described with reference to FIGS. 3-5 , and transmit the results to the client device 2004 .
- FIG. 3 shows an example diffusion module 2060 .
- the diffusion module 2060 includes a feature extraction submodule 2062 , graphing submodule 2064 , and scoring submodule 2066 .
- Other implementations are possible.
- the graphing submodule 2064 could be a component separate from the diffusion module 2060 , e.g., the search engine 2030 could include a distinct graphing module.
- the components of the diffusion module 2060 can be communicatively coupled to one or more of each other. Though the components identified in the diffusion module 2060 are described as being logically separate or distinct, one or more of the components of the diffusion module 2060 may be combined or further divided.
- the feature extraction submodule 2062 identifies features of images.
- the features can be local, global, or combinations thereof, and can include, for example, color (e.g., hue, saturation, and value), texture, or other graphical attributes of an image.
- the features are represented by vectors in a multi-dimensional feature space and a similarity or distance measure between a pair of vectors is represented by a distance between each feature vector.
- the distance measure can be a Euclidean distance or a non-Euclidean distance, e.g., L1 similarity measures, K-L divergence, and compositions of any general, basic distances from multiple features such as color, texture, and object features of each image.
- a k nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is used to identify k nearest neighbors for each image based on the identified features, where k is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to a total number of nodes in a graph.
- Other algorithms for determining nearest neighbors are possible.
- k can be different for each node. For example, k can equal 10 for a first node that represents a first image, and k can equal 2 for a second node that represents a second image.
- the graphing submodule 2064 generates the graph based on the distance measures for the images.
- the graph includes nodes that represent each image and edges or links that connect the nodes based on the distance measure determined by the feature extraction submodule 2062 .
- the scoring submodule 2066 uses the graph to score the images.
- the scoring submodule 2066 diffuses information associated with each node to the node's k nearest neighbors using linear neighborhood weighting, as described in further detail below with respect to FIGS. 4-5 .
- the scores can be provided to the ranking module 2052 in order to rank the images.
- FIG. 4 shows an example process 4000 for scoring images based on visual content and data indicative of user behavior.
- the process 4000 includes calculating 4010 a visual similarity score for one or more pairs of images in a plurality of images based on visual features of images in each of the one or more pairs.
- scoring submodule 2066 can calculate the visual similarity score.
- the features are features related to graphical attributes of the images. Other implementations are possible.
- the features can be text-based image annotations or other context, such as a Uniform Resource Locator identifying the location of the image.
- a nearest neighbor is defined based on a measure of similarity between the features of a pair of images.
- global features are extracted from a first image and a second image.
- a distance measure is calculated based on the extracted global features.
- the distance measure can be derived as an average of the distances between the global features, and the average can be based on a substantially equal contribution from each distance between a global feature.
- the distance measure is referred to as a Joint Equal Contribution (JEC). Additional details regarding defining the distance measure using JEC can be found, for example, in Makadia et al., A New Baseline for Image Annotation , European Conference on Computer Vision 2008 (ECCV 2008 ), October 2008. Other implementations are possible.
- SIFT scale-invariant feature transform
- the process 4000 also includes building 4020 a graph of images by linking each of one or more images in the plurality of images to one or more nearest neighbor images based on the visual similarity scores of the image pairs that include the image.
- distance measures between images in pairs of images are used to generate a graph that shows the visual similarity between the images.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example graph 5000 that includes nodes ( 5010 , 5020 , 5030 , 5040 , 5050 , 5060 , 5070 , and 5080 ) representing images.
- node 5020 is linked to nodes 5010 , 5030 , 5040 , 5050 , and 5070 .
- the connection between linked nodes is related to a weight representing a similarity between the visual content of images represented by a pair of linked nodes.
- the distance measure between a pair of linked nodes is further processed to produce a weight representing a similarity measure.
- the distance measure is passed through a linear or non-linear function, e.g., a Gaussian function, to produce the weight.
- the link is represented on the graph 5000 by an edge, e.g., edge 5004 .
- the edge 5004 directly connects the node 5020 to node 5050 .
- Other edges connect node 5020 to other nearest neighbor nodes.
- the edge is related with a weight that represents the similarity between a pair of linked nodes.
- the edges between nodes can have a single direction, or the edges can be bi-directional.
- the edges can be bi-directional.
- the graph includes an edge between node i and node j that indicates that node i is a neighbor of node j and that node j is a neighbor of node i.
- the edges when the edges are bi-directional, one or more nodes in the graph can be connected with more than k nearest neighbors.
- the process 4000 includes associating a respective score with each of one or more images in the graph based on data indicative of user behavior relative to the image as a search result for a query.
- scoring submodule 2066 calculates a respective score for each of the one or more images, based on conventional techniques, techniques described below, or combinations thereof.
- the process 4000 also includes determining 4040 a new score for each of one or more images in the graph based on the respective score of the image, and the respective scores of one or more nearest neighbors to the image as weighted by their visual similarity to the image.
- Step 4040 is an example of a diffusion process.
- the diffusion module 2060 receives a group of pre-ranked images, e.g., 1,000 or more images ranked by the ranking module 2052 as responsive to a particular query.
- the diffusion module 2052 modifies the ranking of the images as described below.
- the diffusion module 2060 can receive or obtain a group of unranked images.
- At least one image in the group of the unranked images has associated data, e.g., text annotation, click data, or other image metadata that can be used to score the image.
- at least one image can have an associated click fraction, e.g., click data representing a relationship between a number of selections of a first received image as a search result for the query and aggregated click data related to the query.
- the diffusion module 2060 can “diffuse” the data associated with one or more images to other images in the group that may or may not have associated data that can be used to score each respective other image.
- an initial score for each image is generated. For example, if an image does not have associated scoring data, its score is set to zero. In some implementations, images with associated scoring data are identified. The initial score for the images are modified based on the associated scoring data. For example, if an image has associated scoring data, its score is set to a non-zero value s (e.g., 0 ⁇ s ⁇ 1) based on its associated scoring data. Then, a final score for the image is generated based on a combination of the initial score for the image, and the initial scores for the images represented by the one or more nearest neighbor nodes weighted by their visual similarity to the image.
- s e.g., 0 ⁇ s ⁇ 1
- the initial score of each of the one or more nearest neighbor nodes are calculated based on its own nearest neighbor nodes. Therefore, as will be described in further detail below with respect to performing multiple iterations of the calculations until convergence of the final scores, the scores of each image can be based on initial scores for all the images in the graph.
- filtering is performed to identify scoring data that is not used during the diffusion process. Images with an associated score less than a threshold value are not used to generate the final score. A score that is less than the threshold value can be set to zero.
- nodes 5010 , 5020 , 5030 , and 5070 each represent a different image with associated scoring data.
- node 5060 represents an image that is not associated with scoring data.
- the initial score for the image represented by node 5060 is set to zero, and the scores for the images represented by nodes 5010 , 5020 , 5030 , and 5070 are calculated based on scoring data associated with each respective node.
- a final score is generated for the image associated with node 5070 based on a combination of the initial score for the image represented by node 5070 , and the initial scores for the images represented by nodes 5010 , 5020 , 5030 , and 5060 .
- the combining is performed using a linear combination of weighted, initial scores associated with the node and one or more of its nearest neighbors.
- the weights that are related to each of the edges that connect the given node to its k nearest neighbors can be normalized such that the weights sum to one.
- the score of the nearest neighbor is modified (e.g., multiplied) by the weight. The sum of the modified scores associated with the nearest neighbors is combined with the score of the given node.
- the combination is a convex combination.
- the convex combination is expressed as:
- c i , new ⁇ * ⁇ j ⁇ i ⁇ ( W ij * c j , current ) + ( 1 - ⁇ ) * c i , current , where c i,current is a current score for an image represented by the given node, c j,current is a current score for an image represented by a nearest neighbor node j, c i,new is the intermediate score for the represented image, W ij is the normalized weight related to the correlation between the represented node i and the nearest neighbor node j, and ⁇ is a determined parameter, e.g., where 0 ⁇ 1.
- the vector C is used to rank the images.
- diffusion module 2060 provides vector C to ranking module 2052 .
- Ranking module 2052 ranks the images, for example, by sorting the scores in vector C in descending order. The image with the highest corresponding score would ideally be the most relevant image in the group of images returned for a query.
- weights can be normalized using parameters such as non-dimensional ratios of errors, residuals, means, or standard deviations.
- non-linear combinations can be used to combine the score.
- the weights that are related to the edges that connect node 5070 to its nearest neighbor nodes 5010 , 5020 , 5030 , and 5060 are normalized.
