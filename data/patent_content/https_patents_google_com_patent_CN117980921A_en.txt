Description
Technical Field
The present description relates to analysis of content item distribution policies.
Background
The client device may use an application (e.g., web browser, local application) to access a content platform (e.g., a search platform, social media platform, or another platform hosting content). The content platform may display digital components (discrete units of digital content or digital information, such as video clips, audio clips, multimedia clips, images, text, or another content unit) that may be provided by one or more content sources/platforms within an application launched on the client device.
Modification of digital component dispensing criteria (which directs the selection and dispensing of digital components) may have a positive or (sometimes) negative impact on the quality of the dispensing of the digital components for various reasons, such as improving the selection of the digital components. If the digital component distribution criteria that directs the distribution of data is not altered, a method may be implemented that analyzes the distribution of digital components to client devices located in different geographic locations that will be observed by in contrast predicting the distribution of digital components.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the operations of: obtaining data for quantifying digital component distribution in a first locale during a first predetermined period of time based on digital component distribution criteria; obtaining data for quantifying distribution of digital components in a second locale during a first predetermined period of time; generating a machine learning model configured to: predicting a first result of quantizing the digital component distribution in the first locale based on a correlation between quantizing the digital component distribution data in the first locale during the first predetermined period of time and quantizing the digital component distribution data in the second locale during the first predetermined period of time; obtaining data for quantifying distribution of digital components in the first locale during a second predetermined period of time; predicting a second result of the prediction of the digital component distribution in the first region during a second predetermined period of time using the machine learning model; comparing the predicted second result during the second predetermined time period with data distributed by the digital component in the first region quantified during the second predetermined time period; and adjusting the digital component distribution criteria for the first region based on the comparison.
The method may include: generating predictive data using the machine learning model, the predictive data quantifying digital component distribution in the second locale during a second predetermined period of time; comparing the data distributed by the digital components in the second locale quantized during the second predetermined period with the predicted data distributed by the digital components in the second locale quantized during the second predetermined period; and adjusting the digital component distribution standard of the second region.
The method may include the first predetermined period of time being a period of time prior to altering the one or more digital component distribution criteria.
The method may include generating a machine learning model, including: the machine learning model is trained using data distributed by digital components in a first locale during a first predetermined period of time and data distributed by digital components in a second locale during the first predetermined period of time.
The method may include the second predetermined period of time being a period of time after altering the one or more digital component distribution criteria.
The method may include comparing data distributed by quantizing digital components in the first region during a second predetermined time period with predicted data distributed by quantizing digital components in the first region during the second predetermined time period, the comparing comprising: the data distributed by the digital components in the first locale during the second predetermined period is subtracted from the predicted data distributed by the digital components in the first locale during the second predetermined period.
The method may include the first region being different from the one or more second regions.
The method may include the machine learning model being a time series model.
The method may include the time series model being a multivariate bayesian state space model.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. The distribution of the digital components is subject to one or more distribution criteria and altering these distribution criteria directly affects how the digital components are distributed to the client devices. Existing techniques (such as a/B testing) to evaluate such changes in the distribution criteria are both costly and time consuming, as only a portion of the population is subject to the modified distribution criteria in order to obtain performance data for the modified distribution criteria. This is then compared to performance data of another part of the population for which the distribution criteria have not been altered. This evaluation technique is not accurate because only a portion of the population is affected by variations in the distribution criteria. Rather, the techniques and methods described in this specification may be used to generate machine learning models to predict the performance of existing distribution standards. In some embodiments, the method allows for altering the distribution criteria of the entire community and comparing the distribution performance of the digital components of the entire community under the altered and unaltered distribution criteria.
In some embodiments, the methods described in this specification do not require retraining a machine learning model to predict the performance of digital component distribution in different geographic areas, thereby saving time and valuable computing resources. Instead, a machine learning model may be trained to predict the performance of digital component distribution across all geographic areas while taking into account any correlation that may exist between the performance of different geographic areas.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
This document covers methods, systems, apparatus, and computer readable media for facilitating analysis of the validity of, and will be observed with, changing digital component distribution criteria by in fact predicting distribution of digital components to client devices located in a plurality of geographic locations if the digital component distribution criteria that directs the distribution of the digital components are not changed.
The phrase "digital component" as used herein refers to a discrete unit of digital content or digital information (e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, a multimedia clip, an image, text, or another unit of content). The digital components may be electronically stored in the physical storage device as a single file or collection of files, and the digital components may take the form of video files, audio files, multimedia files, image files, or text files, and include advertising information such that the advertisements are one type of digital component.
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for content distribution. As described in more detail below, users are exposed to various online content in environment 100, and the techniques discussed herein may determine the incremental effect of each of these exposures on the user performing a specified target action.
The example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Network 102 connects content server 104, client device 106, digital component server 108, and digital component distribution system 110 (also referred to as a component distribution system).
An electronic document is data that presents a set of content at a client device 106. Examples of electronic documents include web pages, word processing documents, portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, search result pages, and feed sources. A local application (e.g., an "app"), such as an application installed on a mobile, tablet, or desktop computing device, is also an example of an electronic document. The content server 104 may provide the electronic document to the user device 106. For example, the content server 104 may include a server hosting a publisher website. In this example, the client device 106 may initiate a request for a given publisher web page, and the content server 104 hosting the given publisher web page may respond to the request by sending machine-executable instructions that initiate presentation of the given web page at the client device 106.
In another example, the content server 104 may include an application server from which the client device 106 may download applications. In this example, the client device 106 may download files needed to install the application at the client device 106, and then execute the downloaded application locally. The application may present organic content, such as content specified by a developer of the application, and in some cases may also present one or more digital components (e.g., content created/distributed by a third party) that are obtained from digital component server 108 and inserted into the application as the application is executed at client device 106.
The electronic document may include various contents. For example, the electronic document may include static content (e.g., text or other specified content) within the electronic document itself and/or that does not change over time. The electronic document may also include dynamic content that may change over time or on a per request basis. For example, a publisher of a given electronic document may maintain a data source for populating portions of the electronic document. In this example, the given electronic document may include a tag or script that causes the user device 106 to request content from the data source when the client device 106 processes (e.g., renders or executes) the given electronic document. The client device 106 integrates the content obtained from the data source into a given electronic document to create a composite electronic document that includes the content obtained from the data source.
In some cases, a given electronic document may include a digital component tag or digital component script that references digital component distribution system 110. In these cases, when the client device 106 processes a given electronic document, the client device 106 executes a digital component tag or digital component script. Execution of the digital component tags or digital component scripts configures the client device 106 to generate a request for the digital component 112 (referred to as a "component request") that is transmitted over the network 102 to the digital component distribution system 110. For example, a digital component tag or digital component script may enable the user device 106 to generate a packetized data request including a header and payload data. Component request 112 can include event data specifying characteristics such as a name (or network location) of a server from which the digital component is requested, a name (or network location) of a requesting device (e.g., user device 106), and/or information that digital component distribution system 110 can use to select one or more digital components provided in response to the request. User device 106 transmits component request 112 over network 102 (e.g., a telecommunications network) to a server of digital component distribution system 110.
Component request 112 can include event data specifying other event characteristics such as location characteristics of the requested electronic document and the electronic document that can present the digital component. For example, the digital component distribution system 110 may be provided with event data specifying a reference (e.g., a URL) to an electronic document (e.g., a web page) that is to present the digital component, available locations of the electronic document that are available for presenting the digital component, the size of the available locations, and/or the type of media that is eligible for presentation in those locations. Similarly, event data specifying keywords associated with an electronic document ("document keywords") or entities referenced by the electronic document (e.g., people, places, or things) may also be included in the component request 112 (e.g., as payload data) and provided to the digital component distribution system 110 in order to identify digital components that are eligible for presentation with the electronic document. The event data may also include search queries submitted from the user device 106 to obtain a page of search results, and/or data specifying search results and/or text, audible, or other visual content included in the search results.
Component request 112 can also include event data related to other information, such as information that a user of the user device has provided, geographic information indicating the state or region in which the component request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the digital component is to be displayed (e.g., time of day of the component request, day of week of the component request, type of device in which the digital component is to be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device). For example, the component request 112 may be transmitted over a packet network, and the component request 112 itself may be formatted as packet data with a header and payload data. The header may specify the destination of the packet and the payload data may include any of the information discussed above.
Component distribution system 110, including one or more digital component distribution servers, selects digital components to be presented with a given electronic document in response to receiving component request 112 and/or using information included in component request 112. In some embodiments, the digital components are selected in less than one second to avoid errors that may be caused by delayed selection of the digital components. For example, a delay in providing a digital component in response to the component request 112 may result in a page load error at the user device 106, or result in portions of the electronic document not being filled even after other portions of the electronic document are rendered at the client device 106. Further, as the delay in providing the digital components to the client device 106 increases, the electronic document is likely to no longer be presented at the client device 106 when the digital components are delivered to the client device 106, thereby negatively affecting the user's experience with the electronic document. Further, for example, if the electronic document is no longer presented at the client device 106 at the time the digital component is provided, delays in providing the digital component may result in delivery failure of the digital component.
To facilitate searching for electronic documents, the environment 100 may include a search system 150 that identifies electronic documents by crawling (crawling) and indexing (e.g., indexing based on crawled content of the electronic documents) the electronic documents. The data about the electronic document may be indexed based on the electronic document associated with the data. The indexed copy and optionally the cached copy of the electronic document are stored in a search index 152 (e.g., in a hardware storage device). The data associated with the electronic document is data representing content included in the electronic document and/or metadata of the electronic document.
Client device 106 may submit a search query to search system 150 over network 102. In response, the search system 150 accesses the search index 152 to identify electronic documents relevant to the search query. The search system 150 identifies electronic documents in the form of search results and returns the search results to the client device 106 in a search results page. The search results are data generated by the search system 150 that identifies electronic documents responsive to (e.g., relevant to) the particular search query and that includes an active link (e.g., a hypertext link) that causes the client device to request data from a specified location in response to user interaction with the search results. Example search results may include a web page title, a portion of a text segment or image extracted from a web page, and a URL of the web page. Another example search result may include a title of the downloadable application, a text segment describing the downloadable application, an image depicting a user interface of the downloadable application, and/or a URL of a location from which the application may be downloaded to the client device 106. Another example search result may include a title of the streaming media, a text segment describing the streaming media, an image depicting the streaming media content, and/or a URL of a location from which the streaming media may be downloaded to the client device 106. Like other electronic documents, the search results page may include one or more slots in which digital components (e.g., advertisements, video clips, audio clips, images, or other digital components) may be presented.
In some implementations, the digital component distribution system 110 is implemented in a distributed computing system, for example, that includes a server and a collection 114 of multiple computing devices that are interconnected and that identify and distribute digital components in response to component requests 112. The set 114 of multiple computing devices operate together to identify a set of digital components from a corpus of millions of available digital components that are eligible for presentation in an electronic document.
In some implementations, digital component distribution system 110 implements different techniques to select and distribute digital components. For example, the digital components may include corresponding distribution parameters based on one or more distribution criteria that facilitate (e.g., regulate or limit) selection, distribution, and transmission of the corresponding digital components. For example, the distribution parameters may facilitate the transmission of the digital component by requiring the component request to include at least one criterion that matches (e.g., exactly matches or has some pre-specified level of similarity) one of the distribution parameters of the digital component.
In another example, the distribution parameters for a particular digital component may include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by terms specified in the electronic document, document keywords, or component request 112) in order for the digital component to qualify for presentation. The distribution parameters may also require that the component request 112 include information specifying a particular geographic region (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that the component request 112 originate from a particular type of client device 106 (e.g., mobile device or tablet device) in order for the component item to qualify for presentation. The distribution parameters may also specify a qualification value (e.g., a rank, score, or some other specified value) that is used to evaluate the qualification of the selected/distributed/transmitted component item (e.g., other available digital components), as discussed in more detail below. In some cases, the asset value may be based on an amount that will be submitted when a particular event is attributed to a digital component item (e.g., a presentation of a digital component).
The identification of qualified digital components may be partitioned into a plurality of tasks 117a through 117c, which are then distributed among computing devices within the collection 114 of computing devices. For example, different computing devices in the collection 114 may each analyze different digital components to identify various digital components having distribution parameters that match the information included in the component request 112. In some implementations, each given computing device in the collection 114 can analyze a different data dimension (or set of dimensions) and communicate (e.g., transmit) the analysis results (Res 1-Res 3) 118 a-118 c back to the digital component distribution system 110. For example, the results 118 a-118 c provided by each computing device in the collection 114 may identify a subset of digital component items that qualify for distribution in response to a component request and/or a subset of digital components having particular distribution parameters. For example, identifying a subset of digital components may include comparing event data to distribution parameters and identifying a subset of digital components having distribution parameters that match at least some features of the event data.
The digital component distribution system 110 aggregates results 118a through 118c received from the collection 114 of multiple computing devices and uses information associated with the aggregated results to select one or more digital components to be provided in response to the component request 112. For example, the digital component distribution system 110 may select a set of winning digital components (one or more digital components) based on the results of one or more digital component evaluation processes. In turn, the digital component distribution system 110 may generate and transmit reply data 120 (e.g., digital data representing a reply) over the network 102, the reply data 120 enabling the client device 106 to integrate the set of winning digital components into the given electronic document such that the set of winning digital components are presented on a display of the client device 106 along with the content of the electronic document.
In some implementations, the client device 106 executes instructions included in the reply data 120 that configure and enable the client device 106 to obtain the set of winning digital components from the one or more digital component servers 108. For example, the instructions in reply data 120 may include a network location (e.g., a URL) and a script that causes client device 106 to transmit a Server Request (SR) 121 to digital component server 108 to obtain a given winning digital component from digital component server 108. In response to the server request 121, the digital component server 108 will identify the given winning digital component specified in the server request 121 and transmit digital component data 122 (DI data) to the client device 106, the digital component data 122 (DI data) presenting the given winning digital component in the electronic document at the client device 106.
In some cases, the distribution parameters of the digital component distribution may include user characteristics, such as demographic information, user interests, and/or other information that may be used to personalize the user's online experience. In some cases, these features and/or information about the user of the client device 106 are readily available. For example, a content platform such as content server 104 or search system 150 may allow a user to register with the content platform by providing such user information. In another example, the content platform may use cookies to identify client devices that may store information about user online activity and/or user characteristics.
In some implementations, digital component distribution system 110 may alter one or more digital component distribution criteria (from now on, simply referred to as distribution criteria) by altering one or more digital component distribution parameters. For example, assume that existing distribution criteria may set the selection and distribution of digital components based on a set of keywords provided by digital component server 108. When a user of the client device 106 provides a search query to the search system 150, the search system 150 may communicate with the digital component distribution system 110 to select digital components by comparing keywords of the search query to a set of keywords associated with the digital components from the digital component server 108. In such cases, the digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may alter a set of keywords by adding more keywords in the set of keywords to expand the selection criteria of the digital component based on the altered set of keywords, thereby altering the distribution criteria. In another case, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may alter the distribution criteria by removing and/or replacing keywords in a set of keywords in order to limit the selection criteria of the digital components.
Digital component distribution system 110 may be configured to monitor the performance of distributing digital components to client devices 106. Since altering the distribution criteria is a critical decision for digital component distribution system 110 and digital component server 108, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may perform an analysis to determine the effectiveness of altering the distribution criteria. For example, the performance of the digital component distribution may be based on an impression count (e.g., the number of times the digital component is presented on the client device 106) or an interaction count (e.g., a click count indicating the number of times the presented digital component is clicked by a user of the client device 106). Other parameters of the measured performance may be based on the geographic location of the client device 106 presenting the digital component, the type of client device 106 presenting the digital component, and so forth.
These techniques of measuring digital component distribution performance are acceptable when measuring performance over different time periods. For example, the above-mentioned techniques may be used to compare how well (or how bad) a digital component was distributed during a first time period (e.g., july) and a second time period (e.g., august). However, such a comparison is not possible if digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) alters the distribution criteria of the digital components. This will be further explained with reference to fig. 2.
Fig. 2 is a graph 200 illustrating an example of the effect of altering one or more distribution criteria. FIG. 2 depicts an interaction count, such as a number of clicks, received from a user of the client device 106 in response to the presentation of a digital component on the client device 106. In other words, FIG. 2 shows the change in the number of clicks received from the user of the client device 106 between time intervals t0-t 2.
As shown in graph 200 and referring to solid line 210, the number of clicks at time t0 is r0. The number of clicks changes over time, where at time t1, the number of clicks is r1. The distribution of the digital components during time intervals t0 and t1 is according to preset distribution criteria. Further, in this example, at time t1, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) alters the distribution criteria, thereby altering the distribution of the digital components. In this example, it can be seen that at time t2, the number of clicks has reached r3.
In such cases, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may want to know the distribution performance of digital components under the influence of the altered distribution criteria. For example, the digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may want to know how well (or how bad) the distribution of digital components performed under the influence of the altered distribution criteria when compared to the performance of the preset distribution criteria. For example, assuming that the digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) does not change the preset distribution criteria at time t1, and that the distribution of digital components will continue according to the preset distribution criteria, the number of clicks at time t2 is r2 (see dashed line 220). The difference in the number of clicks r3-r2 will indicate how well (or difference) the modified distribution criteria performed. For example, if the value of r3-r2 is positive, the digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may determine that the modified distribution criteria perform better than the preset distribution criteria. Similarly, if the value of r3-r2 is negative, the digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may determine that the modified distribution criteria perform worse than the preset distribution criteria.
As shown in the above examples, evaluating the performance of the modified distribution standard requires the performance data of the modified distribution standard and the performance data of the preset distribution standard. It is not possible to perform such an evaluation because after changing the distribution criteria the only observable data is the performance of the changed distribution criteria, i.e. the number of clicks received after changing the preset distribution criteria. To evaluate the performance, the digital component distribution system 110 may include an evaluation device 130, the evaluation device 130 being configured to predict the performance of the distribution of the digital component that would be observed if the preset distribution criteria were not altered. The following description relates to techniques and methods implemented by the evaluation device 130.
In some implementations, the evaluation means 130 can evaluate the performance of the distribution criteria based on the performance of the distribution criteria in another group, such as the performance of client devices located in another geographic region or regions. In such embodiments, the evaluation apparatus 130 may consider any correlation that may exist between the performance of the distribution criteria among different groups (such as among groups of client devices, each group being located in a different geographic location). For example, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) may alter the distribution criteria of a first geographic area (also referred to as a first region) such as new york and a second geographic area (also referred to as a second region) such as san francisco. Since new york and san francisco are metropolitan areas of the united states, there may be a potential correlation between the distribution of digital components for each city, regardless of the distribution criteria. In this example, digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) may use historical data of the performance of the distribution criteria of new york and san francisco to predict the performance of the distribution of digital components that would be observed if the distribution criteria of new york or san francisco were not altered. Although the above examples and the following description have been explained with reference to two geographic regions, the techniques and methods may be implemented in any number of geographic regions. The techniques and methods may also be used in scenarios where one or more features may be used to divide client devices 106 into multiple groups. Such as different time intervals of client devices 106 or different types of client devices 106. Indeed, these techniques and methods may be used in scenarios other than digital component distribution. For example, the techniques and methods may be used to evaluate stock market activity after one or more stock market policy changes.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 is configured to obtain historical data quantifying distribution of digital components in the first locale during a first predetermined period of time. Referring to the graph depicted in fig. 2, the first predetermined period of time is a period of time t0-t1 prior to changing the preset dispensing criteria. For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) has preset distribution criteria for a first region such as new york. The evaluation means 130 may obtain historical data indicating the number of clicks (or times) received from users of client devices 106 located in the new york area where digital components were distributed according to preset distribution criteria. The historical data may be in the form of a time series in which each sample indicates a time interval within a first predetermined period of time and the number of clicks received within that time interval.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 is further configured to obtain historical data quantifying the distribution of the digital components in the second locale during the first predetermined period of time. For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) has preset distribution criteria for a second region such as san francisco. The evaluation means 130 may obtain historical data indicating the number of clicks (or times) received from users of client devices 106 located in the new york area, where the digital components were distributed according to preset distribution criteria.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 can implement a machine learning model to predict the performance of the altered distribution criteria. The machine learning model may be any model deemed necessary by a system administrator. In this example, the machine learning model is a time series model that is trained based on historical data distributed by quantifying digital components in the first region and the second region during a first predetermined period of time. For example, the evaluation device 130 may use historical data of new york and san francisco to create a training data set such that each training sample of the training data set is time stamped along with the performance of the digital component distribution of new york and san francisco. Formally, the training data set is a time seriesRepresenting a vector representing the performance of the preset distribution criteria in N geographic locations at time t. For further explanation, element/>Indicating the performance of the distribution of the digital component at time t at the nth geographic location. Suffix 0 indicates that the performance of the digital component distribution is based on unmodified distribution criteria.
In some implementations, the time series model implemented by the evaluation device 130 is a multivariate bayesian state space model. In some implementations, the multivariate bayesian state space model can take the following form:
Wherein equation (1) is called the observation equation, which relates the vector at time t Associated with a vector α t of unobserved potential states, equation (2) is referred to as a transition equation defining how the potential states evolve over time.
Model matrixAnd/>Including values typically set to 0 and 1. /(I)Is an N x M matrix, where M corresponds to the number of hidden states of the Bayesian state space model,/>Is an M x M conversion matrix, and/>Is an mxp control matrix. Equation 1 also defines a zero-mean random normal disturbance vector e t based on the nxn covariance matrix H t, and equation 2 defines a zero-mean random normal disturbance vector η t based on the P x P covariance matrix Q t. Equations 1 and 2 also use the kronecker product/>The bayesian state space model is generalized over N geographic locations, where I N is an nxn identity matrix, allowing the bayesian state space model to share information such as any correlation that may exist between the performance of distribution criteria in different geographic locations.
The multivariate bayesian state space model described using equations (1) and (2) also includes trend components, seasonal components, and regression components. In general, trend components are described using a first order local level model as described below:
Wherein the desired level is According to having an NxN covariance matrix/>Is evolved over time. With respect to equations (1) and (2), the first order local level model may be set/>Z *＝[1],H＝Hμ T*＝[1],R* = [1] and/>And is generated as a multivariate bayesian state space model.
In general, a second order local linear model is more suitable for modeling trends that exhibit linear performance increases over a short period of time, and can be expressed as follows:
Wherein, Via an NxN covariance matrix/>The random walk has a slope that varies with time. Regarding equations (1) and (2), the second-order local linear model can be expressed by the following settings:
in general, the regression component of the state space model may be expressed as
Wherein,Is a column vector of regression coefficients. With respect to equations 1 and 2, the regression component may be represented as a state space model as follows:
H＝Hβ (14)
T*＝IK (15)
R*＝IK (16)
As described above, evaluating the performance of the modified distribution standard requires performance data indicative of the distribution of the digital components under the modified distribution standard and the preset distribution standard. In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 is configured to obtain data quantifying performance of the distribution criteria in the first group (e.g., the first region) during the second predetermined period of time. For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 108) has changed the distribution criteria for a first region (e.g., new york) at some point in time. After the distribution criteria are changed, distribution of the digital components occurs in new york based on the changed distribution criteria, and the evaluation device 130 collects data indicating the performance of the changed distribution criteria. Referring to the example provided in fig. 2, t1-t2 are time periods after the distribution criteria are changed, and are referred to as second predetermined time periods. In some embodiments, the data quantifying the performance of the distribution criteria in the first region may be time series data indicating the performance of each time interval in the second predetermined time period. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined period t1-t2 is 48 hours, data quantifying the performance of the distribution criteria may be recorded at intervals of hours, thereby generating a time series comprising 48 time stamp samples. Other time intervals may be used instead.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 can use a machine learning model to predict performance of the preset distribution criteria for one or more of the N geographic regions over the second predetermined period of time. For example, if the preset dispensing criteria have not been altered within the second predetermined time period t1-t2, the evaluation device 130 may use a machine learning model to predict the dispensing performance of the digital component. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined period t1-t2 is 48 hours, the data of the preset dispensing standard performance may be predictively quantized at the intervals of hours, thereby generating a time series including 48 time stamp samples. Other time intervals may be used instead.
In some embodiments, after predicting the performance of the preset distribution criteria for one or more of the N geographic regions within the second predetermined time period, the evaluation device 130 may compare the predicted performance of the preset distribution criteria in the first region with the recorded performance of the modified distribution criteria in the first region to determine the validity of the modified distribution criteria. For example, if the recording performance of the modified distribution criteria in the first region includes a greater (or lesser) number of defined actions than the predicted performance of the preset distribution criteria for a particular time interval, the evaluation means 130 may determine that the modified distribution criteria perform better than the preset distribution criteria for the particular time interval. For example, assume that the second predetermined period of time is 48 hours after the preset dispensing criteria is changed. The evaluation means 130 may predict the performance of the pre-set dispensing criteria occurrence (e.g. the number of clicks) for each of the 48 one-hour time intervals and also record the actual performance of the altered dispensing criteria occurrence (e.g. the number of actual clicks) for each of those one-hour time intervals. The evaluation means 130 may compare the respective performance of each of the 48 one-hour time intervals to determine whether the modified dispensing criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset dispensing criteria in each one-hour time interval. For example, if the actual performance of the modified dispensing criteria includes a recorded number of clicks for a particular time interval, and the recorded number of clicks is greater than the predicted number of clicks for the preset dispensing criteria during the same time interval, the evaluation means 130 may determine that the modified dispensing criteria performs better than the preset dispensing criteria during that time interval. In contrast, if the predicted performance of the preset dispensing criteria includes a predicted number of clicks for a particular time interval and the predicted number of clicks is greater than the recorded number of clicks of the modified dispensing criteria during the same time interval, the evaluation means 130 may determine that the modified dispensing criteria does not perform as well as the preset dispensing criteria for the particular time interval. In some embodiments, the evaluation means 130 may calculate the cumulative performance of the distribution criteria and the preset distribution criteria modified over all time intervals in the second predetermined time period. For example, the evaluation means 130 may calculate a sum of the performance of each of the 48 one-hour time intervals over the second predetermined period of time and compare the cumulative performance of the modified dispensing criteria with the cumulative performance of the preset dispensing criteria to determine whether the modified dispensing criteria performed better (or worse) than the preset dispensing criteria throughout the second predetermined period of time.
In some embodiments, the evaluation device 130 may also quantify how well (or how bad) the modified dispensing criteria perform compared to the preset dispensing criteria. For example, the evaluation device 130 may compare the performance of the modified distribution standard with the performance of the preset distribution standard based on the respective components (components) of the trend and the season. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined time period t1-t2 is 48 hours and the time interval is 1 hour, data quantifying the performance of the preset dispensing criteria may be predicted for each hour, thereby generating a time sequence comprising 48 time stamp samples. By summing the predicted performance of 48 time-stamped samples, the evaluation device 130 can calculate the predicted cumulative performance of the preset distribution criteria. Similarly, the evaluation means 130 may calculate the cumulative performance of the modified distribution criteria. The evaluation means 130 may then compare the cumulative performance to determine if the modified distribution criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset distribution criteria.
In some implementations, after determining whether the altered distribution criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset distribution criteria, the evaluation device 130 can inform the system administrator about its findings and suggestions to modify or maintain the changes made to the preset distribution criteria at time t 1. For example, if the evaluation means 130 determines that the modified distribution criteria performs worse than the preset distribution criteria, the evaluation means 130 may suggest to roll back the modified distribution criteria to the preset distribution criteria. In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 can also recommend one or more changes to the modified distribution criteria based on the predicted distribution criteria and the performance of the modified distribution criteria. For example, the evaluation device 130 may identify one or more settings in the modified dispensing criteria, which, if changed, may improve the performance of the modified dispensing criteria.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 can use a machine learning model to evaluate distribution performance of digital components under a distribution standard that is altered in a second group (e.g., a second region) that is different from the first group (e.g., the first region). As described above, the evaluation device 130 may use a machine learning model to predict the performance of the preset distribution criteria for each of the N geographic regions including the first region and the one or more second regions over the second predetermined period of time. For example, a machine learning model may be used to predict performance of preset distribution criteria for new york and san francisco.
The evaluation means 130 may record data to quantify the distribution of the digital components in the second region during the second predetermined period of time and compare the predicted performance of the preset distribution criteria in the second region with the recorded performance of the modified distribution criteria in the second region to determine the validity of the modified distribution criteria. For example, the evaluation device 130 may use a machine learning model to predict the performance of the preset dispensing criteria of san francisco during time intervals t1-t2 based on the preset dispensing criteria, and also record the performance of the altered dispensing criteria of san francisco during time intervals t1-t 2. After comparing the performance, the evaluation means 130 may determine whether the modified distribution criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset distribution criteria. Based on this determination, the evaluation means 130 may suggest to roll back the modified distribution criteria to the preset distribution criteria. In some embodiments, the evaluation means 130 may suggest modifications or keep the changes made to the preset distribution criteria at time t 1. FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for evaluating performance of distribution criteria based on performance of the distribution criteria in other groups, such as other geographic regions. For example, the operations of process 300 may be implemented by evaluation device 130. The operations of process 300 may also be implemented as instructions stored in one or more computer-readable media, which may be non-transitory, and execution of the instructions by one or more data processing apparatus may cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform the operations of process 300.
The evaluation device 130 obtains data that quantifies the distribution of digital components in a first group (e.g., a first locale) during a first predetermined period of time (310). For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) has preset distribution criteria for a first region such as new york. The evaluation means 130 may obtain historical data indicating the number of clicks (or times) received from users of client devices 106 located in the new york area where digital components were distributed according to preset distribution criteria. The historical data may be in the form of a time series in which each sample indicates a time interval within a first predetermined period of time and the number of clicks received within that time interval.
The evaluation device 130 obtains data that quantifies the distribution of digital components in a second group (e.g., a second locale) during a first predetermined period of time (320). For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) has preset distribution criteria for a second region such as san francisco. The evaluation means 130 may obtain historical data indicating the number of clicks (or times) received from a user of a client device 106 located in san francisco, where the digital components are distributed according to preset distribution criteria.
The evaluation device 130 generates a machine learning model configured to predictively quantify a first result of the digital component distribution in the first group (330). Evaluating the performance of the modified distribution standard requires the performance data of the modified distribution standard and the performance data of the preset distribution standard. As explained herein, performing such an evaluation is not possible because after changing the distribution criteria, the only observable data is the performance of the changed distribution criteria, e.g., the number of clicks received after changing the preset distribution criteria. To evaluate performance in accordance with the present disclosure, the evaluation device 130 may be configured to predict performance of the distribution of the digital component that would be observed if the preset distribution criteria were not altered.
To predict the performance of the altered distribution criteria, the evaluation device 130 may implement a machine learning model. The time series model is trained using data indicative of the performance of the distribution of the digital components of the N geographic locations over a first predetermined period of time. For example, the machine learning model is a multiple bayesian time series model (explained with reference to equations 1 through 17) that is trained based on historical data distributed by digital components in a first set (e.g., a first region) and a second set (e.g., a second region) quantified during a first predetermined period of time. For example, the evaluation device 130 may use historical data of new york and san francisco to obtain a training data set such that each training sample of the training data set is time stamped along with the performance of the digital component distribution of new york and san francisco.

The time series model is trained using data indicative of the performance of the distribution of the digital components of the N geographic locations over a first predetermined period of time. For example, the machine learning model is a multiple bayesian time series model (explained with reference to equations 1 through 17) that is trained based on historical data distributed by digital components in a first set (e.g., a first region) and a second set (e.g., a second region) quantified during a first predetermined period of time. For example, the evaluation device 130 may use historical data of new york and san francisco to obtain a training data set such that each training sample of the training data set is time stamped along with the performance of the digital component distribution of new york and san francisco.
The evaluation device 130 obtains data that quantifies the distribution of digital components in the first set during a second predetermined period of time (340). For example, assume that digital component distribution system 110 (or digital component server 104) changed the distribution criteria for the first region (e.g., new york) at point in time t 1. After the distribution criteria are changed, distribution of the digital components occurs in new york based on the changed distribution criteria, and the evaluation device 130 collects data indicating the performance of the changed distribution criteria. Referring to the example provided in fig. 2, t1-t2 are time periods after the distribution criteria are changed, and are referred to as second predetermined time periods. The data quantifying the performance of the distribution criteria in the first region may be time series data indicating the performance of each time interval in the second predetermined time period. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined time period t1-t2 is 48 hours, data quantifying the performance of the distribution criteria may be recorded for each hour, thereby generating a time series comprising 48 time stamp samples.
The evaluation device 130 uses the machine learning model to predict a second result of quantifying the digital component distribution in the first set during a second predetermined period of time (350). For example, if the preset distribution criteria have not been altered within the second predetermined time period t1-t2, the evaluation device 130 may use a machine learning model to predict the distribution performance of the digital components in the first region, e.g., new york. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined time period t1-t2 is 48 hours, the data of the preset dispensing standard performance may be predicted to be quantized for each hour, thereby generating a time series including 48 time stamp samples.
The evaluation means then compares (360) the predicted second result during the second predetermined period of time with the actual second result during the second predetermined period of time. For example, after predicting the performance of the preset distribution criteria for each of the N geographical areas within the second predetermined time period, the evaluation device 130 may compare the predicted performance of the preset distribution criteria in the first area with the recorded performance of the modified distribution criteria in the first area to determine the validity of the modified distribution criteria. For example, assume that the second predetermined period of time is 48 hours after the preset dispensing criteria is changed. The evaluation means 130 may predict the performance of the preset dispensing criteria for each of the 48 one-hour time intervals and also record the performance of the modified dispensing criteria for each of these one-hour time intervals. The evaluation means 130 may compare the respective performance of each of the 48 one-hour time intervals to determine whether the modified dispensing criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset dispensing criteria in each one-hour time interval. For example, if the performance (such as the number of clicks recorded for a time interval) is greater than the predicted number of clicks, the evaluation device 130 may determine that the modified distribution criteria for that time interval perform better than the preset distribution criteria. In contrast, if the predicted performance of the preset distribution criterion is greater than the recorded performance of the modified distribution criterion for the specific time interval, the evaluation means 130 may determine that the performance of the modified distribution criterion is not as good at the specific time interval as the preset distribution criterion. In some embodiments, the evaluation means 130 may calculate the cumulative performance of the distribution criteria and the preset distribution criteria modified over all time intervals in the second predetermined time period. For example, the evaluation means 130 may calculate a sum of the performance of each of the 48 one-hour time intervals over the second predetermined period of time and compare the cumulative performance of the modified dispensing criteria with the cumulative performance of the preset dispensing criteria to determine whether the modified dispensing criteria performed better (or worse) than the preset dispensing criteria throughout the second predetermined period of time.
In some embodiments, the evaluation device 130 may quantify how well (or how bad) the modified dispensing criteria perform compared to the preset dispensing criteria. For example, the evaluation means 130 may compare the performance of the modified distribution criteria with the performance of the preset distribution criteria based on the various components of trend and seasonal. For example, if the distribution performance of the digital component shows a trend of increasing under both the preset distribution standard and the modified distribution standard, the evaluation means 130 may use the trend of increasing under the preset distribution standard and the modified distribution standard to determine how much the modified distribution standard performs better (or worse) than the preset distribution standard. For example, if the trend during the first predetermined period of time shows an average increase of 1000 clicks per time interval and an average increase of 800 clicks per time interval in the second predetermined period of time, the evaluation means 130 may determine that the preset dispensing criteria perform better than the modified dispensing criteria. As another example, the evaluation device 130 may use the magnitudes of seasonal variations in the performance of the preset and modified distribution criteria to determine which distribution criteria perform better than another distribution criteria.
In another embodiment, the evaluation means 130 may calculate the cumulative performance of the distribution criteria and the preset distribution criteria modified over all time intervals in the second predetermined period of time. For example, if the duration of the second predetermined time period t1-t2 is 48 hours, the data of the preset dispensing standard performance may be predicted to be quantized for each hour, thereby generating a time series including 48 time stamp samples. By summing the predicted performance of 48 time-stamped samples, the evaluation device 130 can calculate the predicted cumulative performance of the preset distribution criteria. Similarly, the evaluation means 130 may calculate the cumulative performance of the modified distribution criteria. The evaluation means 130 may then compare the cumulative performance to determine if the modified distribution criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset distribution criteria.
The evaluation device 130 adjusts or maintains the digital component distribution criteria for the first region based on the comparison (370). After determining whether the altered distribution criteria perform better (or worse) than the preset distribution criteria, the evaluation device 130 may inform the system administrator about its findings and suggestions to modify or maintain the changes made to the preset distribution criteria at time t 1. For example, if the evaluation means 130 determines that the modified distribution criteria performs worse than the preset distribution criteria, the evaluation means 130 may suggest to roll back the modified distribution criteria to the preset distribution criteria. In some implementations, the evaluation device 130 can also recommend one or more changes to the modified distribution criteria based on the predicted distribution criteria and the performance of the modified distribution criteria. For example, the evaluation device 130 may identify one or more settings in the modified dispensing criteria, which, if changed, may improve the performance of the modified dispensing criteria.

A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. The computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output.

Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Typically, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Furthermore, a computer may be embedded in another device, such as a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive), to name a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and storage devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disk; CD-ROM and DVD-ROM discs.

Other types of devices may also be used to provide for interaction with a user; for example, feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback, such as visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. Further, the computer may interact with the user by sending and receiving documents to and from the device used by the user; for example, in response to a request received from a web browser, a web page is sent to the web browser on the user's client device.

The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include local area networks ("LANs") and wide area networks ("WANs"), internetworks (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
The computing system may include clients and servers. The client and server are typically remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, the server transmits data (e.g., HTML pages) to the client device (e.g., for the purpose of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., results of user interactions) may be received at the server from the client device.
