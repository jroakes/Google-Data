Definitions
- This patent specification relates to systems and methods for detecting gesture events with a hazard detection system. More particularly, this patent specification relates to systems and methods for detecting patterns in data that potentially represent gesture events.
- Hazard detection systems such as smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, combination smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, as well as systems for detecting other dangerous conditions have been used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings for safety considerations. When these systems detect the presence of a dangerous condition, they often sound an audible alarm. The alarm is often characterized as having an extremely loud or ear piercing sound, and can be unpleasant or very uncomfortable to a human listener. Some hazard detectors may permit a user to press a button located on the cover of the unit, sometimes termed a hush button or temporary silence button, when they know an alarm to be caused by a non-emergency situation, such as smoke from cooking.
- the audible alarm noise is temporarily silenced for a predetermined interval of time, such as in the range of four to ten minutes, during which the user has an opportunity to address the situation, such as by opening a window, without being required to endure the ear-piercing sound of the alarm. If the condition persists at the end of the predetermined interval of time, then the audible alarm noise resumes.
- the hazard detector unit is mounted high on a wall or on a ceiling that is out of the reach of the user, leading many users to seek out a ladder, chair, or broomstick in order to press the hush button or temporary silence button, which can lead to inconvenient, impractical, and/or unsafe scenarios.
- Other issues arise as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art in view of the instant disclosure.
- Hazard detection systems and methods according to embodiments described herein are operative to enable a user to interface with the hazard detection system by performing a touchless gesture.
- the touchless gesture can be performed in a vicinity of the hazard detection system without requiring the user to physically touch the hazard detection system. This enables the user to interact with the hazard detection system even if it is out of reach.
- the hazard detection system can detect gestures and perform an appropriate action responsive to the detected gesture.
- the hazard detection system can silence its audible alarm in response to a detected gesture.
- the hazard detection system can pre-emptively turn off its audible alarm in response to a detected gesture. For example, a user may wish to pre-emptively prevent an audible alarm from sounding if she is performing an activity (e.g., cooking) that may result in an alarm event, but an alarm event that is not necessarily warranted.
- Gestures can be detected using gesture detection circuitry and methods according to various embodiments.
- the gesture detection circuitry can use one more sensors to detect one or more objects that may be performing a gesture.
- gestures can be detected using a motion detector such as a passive infrared sensor.
- gestures can be detected using a motion detector in combination with one or more ultrasonic sensors.
- a method for processing a gesture to alter a state of a hazard detection system may be provided.
- the method can include confirming presence of a least one object in at least one ultrasonic detection field, processing passive infrared (PIR) data being received while the at least one object is confirmed present in the at least one ultrasonic detection field.
- PIR passive infrared
- the processing can determine determining whether a periodic pattern exists in a sample set of the PIR data.
- the method can include selectively altering a state of the hazard detection system when at least one periodic pattern is determined to exist.
- a hazard detection system in another embodiment, can include at least one hazard detection sensor, circuitry operative to sound an audible alarm in response to a hazard event detected by the at least one hazard detection sensor, a passive infrared (PIR) sensor that detects movement of at least one object, and control circuitry.
- the control circuitry may be operative to receive data acquired by the PIR sensor, and use a shape matching algorithm to determine if a gesture event exists in the received data.
- a method for detecting a user gesture can be implemented by a hazard detection system and can include receiving passive infrared red (PIR) signals from a PIR sensor, and selecting a window, wherein the window defines a sample set of received PIR signals used to detect gesture events.
- the method can include calculating a non-wave score for the sample set, calculating a wave score for the sample set, scaling the non-wave score by a constant, and determining whether a difference between the scaled non-wave score and the wave score exceeds a threshold, wherein when the difference exceeds the threshold, a gesture pattern is detected in the sample set.

- thermostat 112 can wirelessly communicate with and cooperates with thermostat 110 for improved control of HVAC system 120 .
- Thermostat 112 can provide additional temperature data indicative of its location within enclosure 100 , provide additional occupancy information, or provide another user interface for the user (e.g., to adjust a temperature setpoint).
- Hazard detection systems 105 and 107 can communicate with thermostat 110 or thermostat 112 via a wired or wireless link.

One of the power consumption modes corresponds to the lowest quantity of power consumption, and another power consumption mode corresponds to the highest quantity of power consumption, and all other power consumption modes fall somewhere between the lowest and the highest quantities of power consumption. Examples of power consumption modes can include an Idle mode, a Log Update mode, a Software Update mode, an Alarm mode, a Pre-Alarm mode, a Hush mode, and a Night Light mode.
- FIG. 2 shows an illustrative block diagram of hazard detection system 205 being used in an illustrative enclosure 200 in accordance with some embodiments.
- FIG. 2 also shows optional hazard detection system 207 and router 222 .
- Hazard detection systems 205 and 207 can be similar to hazard detection systems 105 and 107 in FIG. 1
- enclosure 200 can be similar to enclosure 100 in FIG. 1
- router 222 can be similar to router 122 in FIG. 1 .
- Hazard detection system 205 can include several components, including system processor 210 , high-power wireless communications circuitry 212 and antenna, low-power wireless communications circuitry 214 and antenna, non-volatile memory 216 , speaker 218 , sensors 220 , which can include one or more safety sensors 221 and one or more non-safety sensors 222 , safety processor 230 , alarm 234 , power source 240 , power conversion circuitry 242 , high quality power circuitry 243 , and power gating circuitry 244 .
- Hazard detection system 205 is operative to provide failsafe safety detection features and user interface features using circuit topology and power budgeting methods that minimize power consumption.
- the components of system 205 and an exemplary circuit topology are discussed in connection with FIGS. 2 and 3 , and methods and circuitry for detecting gestures are discussed in connection with FIGS. 4-25 .
- Hazard detection system 205 can use a bifurcated processor circuit topology for handling the features of system 205 .
- Both system processor 210 and safety processor 230 can exist on the same circuit board within system 205 , but perform different tasks.
- System processor 210 is a larger more capable processor that can consume more power than safety processor 230 . That is, when both processors 210 and 230 are active, processor 210 consumes more power than processor 230 . Similarly, when both processors are inactive, processor 210 still consumes more power than processor 230 .
- System processor 210 can be operative to process user interface features and monitor interface sensors 220 .
- processor 210 can direct wireless data traffic on both high and low power wireless communications circuitry 212 and 214 , access non-volatile memory 216 , communicate with processor 230 , and cause audio to be emitted from speaker 218 .
- processor 210 can monitor interface sensors 220 to determine whether any actions need to be taken (e.g., shut off a blaring alarm in response to a user detected action to hush the alarm).
- Safety processor 230 can be operative to handle safety related tasks of system 205 , or other types of tasks that involve monitoring environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, smoke, carbon monoxide, movement, light intensity, etc.) exterior to the hazard detection system 205 .
- Safety processor 230 can poll one or more of sensors 220 and activate alarm 234 when one or more of sensors 220 indicate a hazard event is detected.
- Processor 230 can operate independently of processor 210 and can activate alarm 234 regardless of what state processor 210 is in. For example, if processor 210 is performing an active function (e.g., performing a WiFi update) or is shut down due to power constraints, processor 230 can activate alarm 234 when a hazard event is detected.
- the software running on processor 230 may be permanently fixed and may never be updated via a software or firmware update after system 205 leaves the factory.
- processor 230 is a less power consuming processor. Thus by using processor 230 in lieu of processor 210 to monitor a subset of sensors 220 yields a power savings. If processor 210 were to constantly monitor sensors 220 , the power savings may not be realized. In addition to the power savings realized by using processor 230 for monitoring the subset of sensors 220 , bifurcating the processors also ensures that the safety monitoring and core alarming features of system 205 will operate regardless of whether processor 210 is functioning.
- system processor 210 may comprise a relatively high-powered processor such as Freescale Semiconductor K60 Microcontroller, while safety processor 230 may comprise a relatively low-powered processor such as a Freescale Semiconductor KL15 Microcontroller.
- hazard detection system 205 entails a judiciously architected functional overlay of system processor 210 and safety processor 230 , with system processor 210 performing selected higher-level, advanced functions that may not have been conventionally associated with hazard detection units (for example: more advanced user interface and communications functions; various computationally-intensive algorithms to sense patterns in user behavior or patterns in ambient conditions; algorithms for governing, for example, the brightness of an LED night light as a function of ambient brightness levels; algorithms for governing, for example, the sound level of an onboard speaker for home intercom functionality; algorithms for governing, for example, the issuance of voice commands to users; algorithms for uploading logged data to a central server; algorithms for establishing network membership; algorithms for facilitating updates to the programmed functionality of one or more elements of the hazard detection system 205 such as the safety processor 230 , the high power wireless communications circuitry 212 , the low power wireless communications circuitry 214 , the system processor 210 itself, etc., and so forth), and with safety processor 230 performing the more
- system processor 210 may consume on the order of 18 mW when it is in a relatively high-power active state and performing one or more of its assigned advanced functionalities, whereas safety processor 230 may only consume on the order of 0.05 mW when it is performing its basic monitoring functionalities.
- system processor 210 may consume only on the order of 0.005 mW when in a relatively low-power inactive state, and the advanced functions that it performs are judiciously selected and timed such the system processor is in the relatively high power active state only about 0.05% of the time, and spends the rest of the time in the relatively low-power inactive state.
- Safety processor 230 while only requiring an average power draw of 0.05 mW when it is performing its basic monitoring functionalities, should of course be performing its basic monitoring functionalities 100% of the time.
- the judiciously architected functional overlay of system processor 210 and safety processor 230 is designed such that hazard detection system 205 can perform basic monitoring and shriek/buzzer alarming for hazard conditions even in the event that system processor 210 is inactivated or incapacitated, by virtue of the ongoing operation of safety processor 230 .
- system processor 210 is configured and programmed to provide many different capabilities for making hazard detection unit 205 an appealing, desirable, updatable, easy-to-use, intelligent, network-connected sensing and communications node for enhancing the smart-home environment
- its functionalities are advantageously provided in the sense of an overlay or adjunct to the core safety operations governed by safety processor 230 , such that even in the event there are operational issues or problems with system processor 210 and its advanced functionalities, the underlying safety-related purpose and functionality of hazard detector 205 by virtue of the operation of safety processor 230 will continue on, with or without system processor 210 and its advanced functionalities.
- High power wireless communications circuitry 212 can be, for example, a Wi-Fi module capable of communicating according to any of the 802.11 protocols.
- circuitry 212 may be implemented using Broadcom part number BCM43362, available in a module from Murata.
- circuitry 212 can operate in a low power “sleep” state or a high power “active” state.
- when system 205 is in an Idle mode circuitry 212 can be in the “sleep” state.
- circuitry 212 can be in an active state.
- high power circuitry 212 may communicate with router 222 so that a message can be sent to a remote server or device.
- Low power wireless communications circuitry 214 can be a low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) module or a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to a 802.15.4 protocol.
- circuitry 214 can be part number EM357 SoC available from Silicon Laboratories.
- circuitry 214 can operate in a relatively low power “listen” state or a relatively high power “transmit” state.
- WiFi update, or software update modes circuitry 214 can be in the “listen” state.
- circuitry 214 can transmit data so that the low power wireless communications circuitry in system 207 can receive data indicating that system 205 is alarming.
- Power savings is also realized because in order for low power circuitry 214 to continually listen for data transmitted from other low power circuitry, circuitry 214 must constantly be operating in its “listening” state. This state consumes power, and although it may consume more power than high power circuitry 212 operating in its sleep state, the power saved versus having to periodically activate high power circuitry 214 is substantial. When high power circuitry 212 is in its active state and low power circuitry 214 is in its transmit state, high power circuitry 212 consumes substantially more power than low power circuitry 214 .
- low power wireless communications circuitry 214 can be characterized by its relatively low power consumption and its ability to wirelessly communicate according to a first protocol characterized by relatively low data rates
- high power wireless communications circuitry 212 can be characterized by its relatively high power consumption and its ability to wirelessly communicate according to a second protocol characterized by relatively high data rates.
- the second protocol can have a much more complicated modulation than the first protocol.
- low power wireless communications circuitry 214 may be a mesh network compatible module that does not require an access point or a router in order to communicate to devices in a network.
- Mesh network compatibility includes provisions that enable mesh network compatible modules to keep track of other nearby mesh network compatible modules so that data can be passed through neighboring modules.
- Mesh network compatibility is essentially the hallmark of the 802.15.4 protocol.
- high power wireless communications circuitry 212 is not a mesh network compatible module and requires an access point or router in order to communicate to devices in a network. Thus, if a first device having circuitry 212 wants to communicate data to another device having circuitry 212 , the first device has to communicate with the router, which then transmits the data to the second device.
- circuitry 212 can perform device-to-device communication using a Wi-Fi Direct communications protocol.

- One or more of sensors 220 may be exclusively monitored by one of system processor 210 and safety processor 230 .
- monitoring a sensor refers to a processor's ability to acquire data from that monitored sensor. That is, one particular processor may be responsible for acquiring sensor data, and possibly storing it in a sensor log, but once the data is acquired, it can be made available to another processor either in the form of logged data or real-time data.

- safety sensors 221 include only those sensors necessary for detecting a hazardous condition. For example, if the hazardous condition includes smoke and fire, then the safety sensors would only include a smoke sensor and at least one heat sensor. Other sensors, such as non-safety sensors, could be included as part of system 205 , but would not be needed to detect smoke or fire. As another example, if the hazardous condition includes carbon monoxide, then the safety sensor would be a carbon monoxide sensor, and no other sensor would be needed to perform this task.
- hazard detection system 205 can be a combination smoke, fire, and carbon monoxide alarm system.

- safety processor 230 does not need any of the data acquired from non-safety sensor 222 to perform its hazard monitoring and alerting functions, the non-safety sensor data can be utilized to provide enhanced hazard system 205 functionality.
- Alarm 234 can be any suitable alarm that alerts users in the vicinity of system 205 of the presence of a hazard condition. Alarm 234 can also be activated during testing scenarios. Alarm 234 can be a piezo-electric buzzer, for example.
- Power source 240 can supply power to enable operation of system 205 and can include any suitable source of energy.
- Embodiments discussed herein can include AC line powered, battery powered, a combination of AC line powered with a battery backup, and externally supplied DC power (e.g., USB supplied power).
- Embodiments that use AC line power, AC line power with battery backup, or externally supplied DC power may be subject to different power conservation constraints than battery only embodiments.
- Battery powered embodiments are designed to manage power consumption of its finite energy supply such that hazard detection system 205 operates for a minimum period of time. In some embodiments, the minimum period of time can be one (1) year, three (3) years or seven (7) years.
- the minimum period of time can be at least seven (7) years, eight (8) years, nine (9) years, or ten (10) years.
- Line powered embodiments are not as constrained because their energy supply is virtually unlimited.
- Line powered with battery backup embodiments may employ power conservation methods to prolong the life of the backup battery.
- power source 240 can include one or more batteries or a battery pack.
- the batteries can be constructed from different compositions (e.g., alkaline or lithium iron disulfide) and different end-user configurations (e.g., permanent, user replaceable, or non-user replaceable) can be used.

Multiple instances of power conversion circuitry 242 may be used to provide the different power levels needed for the components within system 205 . One or more instances of power conversion circuitry 242 can be operative to convert a signal supplied by power source 240 to a different signal. Such instances of power conversion circuitry 242 can exist in the form of buck converters or boost converters. For example, alarm 234 may require a higher operating voltage than high power wireless communications circuitry 212 , which may require a higher operating voltage than processor 210 , such that all required voltages are different the voltage supplied by power source 240 . Thus, as can be appreciated in this example, at least three different instances of power conversion circuitry 242 are required.
- High quality power circuitry 243 is operative to condition a signal supplied from a particular instance of power conversion circuitry 242 (e.g., a buck converter) to another signal.

- certain components may be provided with “higher” quality power than other components. For example, certain safety sensors such as smoke detectors and CO sensors may require a relatively stable voltage in order to operate properly.
- Power gating circuitry 244 can be used to selectively couple and de-couple components from a power bus. De-coupling a component from a power bus insures that the component does not incur any quiescent current loss, and therefore can extend battery life beyond that which it would be if the component were not so de-coupled from the power bus. Power uating circuitry 244 can be a switch such as, for example, a MOSFET transistor. Even though a component is de-coupled from a power bus and does not incur any current loss, the power gating circuitry itself may consume a finite amount of power. This finite power consumption, however, is less than the quiescent power loss of the component.
- hazard detection system 205 is described as having two separate processors, system processor 210 and safety processor 230 , which may provide certain advantages as described hereinabove and hereinbelow, including advantages with regard to power consumption as well as with regard to survivability of core safety monitoring and alarming in the event of advanced feature provision issues, it is not outside the scope of the present teachings for one or more of the various embodiments discussed herein to be executed by one processor or by more than two processors.

There may be instances in which power converting circuitry 340 and 342 are not always ON, such as when the system 300 undergoes a full power-cycle reset. This way, power supplied on power busses 341 and 343 is always available to downstream components.

- Safety processor 330 can further manage power consumption by selectively enabling power converting circuitry 346 .
- Processor 330 can enable or disable circuitry 346 by applying the appropriate signal to control node 358 .
- Processor 330 can enable circuitry 346 when a hazard event is detected, and once circuitry 346 is enabled, alarm 334 is operative to sounds its alarm. When no hazard event is detected or there is no need for alarm 334 to be active, processor 330 can disable circuitry 346 . Disabling circuitry 346 saves power lost during the operation of circuitry 346 and as well as power that would otherwise be consumed by alarm 334 .

- FIG. 4B shows a side view of system 400
- FIG. 4C shows a cross-sectional view of system 400 taken along line C-C of FIG. 4A
- FIG. 4D shows a cross-sectional view of system 400 taken along line D-D of
- detection system 400 includes four sensors located at different locations in or on a housing.
- the sensors can include PIR sensor 410 , ultrasonic sensor 420 , ultrasonic sensor 422 , button 440 , and an ambient light sensor (not shown).
- PIR sensor 410 and ultrasonic sensor 420 can be located in a relatively centered location within system 400 . Both sensors 410 and 420 are also positioned at or near the top surface of system 400 , and in some embodiments may extend beyond a plane that defines the top surface. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4C , PIR sensor 410 may extend beyond the top surface plane. As another example, as illustrated in FIG. 4D , ultrasonic sensor 420 may be positioned substantially co-planer with the top surface.
- Ultrasonic sensor 422 can be positioned near an edge of system 400 (as shown) or elsewhere on system 400 .
- sensor 422 can be positioned adjacent to sensor 422 .
- sensor 422 may also be positioned at or near the top surface of system 400 , and in some embodiments may extend beyond a plane that defines the top surface.
- sensor 422 may be positioned substantially co-planer with the top surface.
- Button 440 can be positioned anywhere on hazard system 400 such that a user can depress it.
- button 440 can be recessed within a boundary of hazard system 400 .
- FIG. 4E shows an illustrative cross-sectional view of hazard system 400 taken along line E-E of FIG. 4A .
- This view shows sensors 410 , 420 , and 422 and the respective detection fields 411 , 421 , and 423 .
- Detection fields 411 , 421 , and 423 illustrate each sensor's “field of view” for detecting one or more stationary or moving objects.
- the size and shape of each sensor's “field of view” can be different.
- PIR sensor 410 can have a relatively omnipresent detection field and ultrasonic sensors 420 and 422 can have relatively focused detection fields.
- detection field 411 can encompass both detection fields 421 and 423 .
- Detection fields 421 and 423 may or may not overlap each other, but each field can be configured to monitor a different field of view.
- detection field 421 can be centered on an axis that is perpendicular to the top surface of hazard system 400
- detection field 423 can be centered on an axis that is not perpendicular to the top surface of hazard system 400 .
- the center axes of detection field 421 and detection field 423 are not parallel to each other.
- ultrasonic sensors 420 and 422 can be alternately sampled to avoid interference among detection fields 421 and 423 .
- the ultrasonic sensor provides a relatively focused field of view by emitting high frequency sound waves and monitoring for echoes that are received back from any objects within its field of view
- the infrared sensor provides a relatively unfocused field of view, which can encompass all or a portion of the ultrasonic sensor's field of view, by monitoring energy being emitted from objects in its field of view.
- the ultrasonic sensor can provide “presence” detection and the infrared sensor can provide “input processing” detection. While the infrared sensor can detect movement of one or more objects anywhere within its field of view, the detection methodology can decide whether to process an infrared detected moving object as an “input” based on whether the ultrasonic sensor senses the “presence” of that moving object. Thus, in one embodiment, the detection methodology can selectively filter out infrared detected moving objects if the ultrasonic sensor does not detect the presence of the moving object. This can reduce or completely eliminate false positives.
- the infrared sensor may detect movement of an object within its field of view, but if that same object is not detected by the ultrasonic sensor, the detection methodology can ignore that detected moving object and not process it as an input. As another example, if the infrared sensor detects movement of an object, and that same object is detected by the ultrasonic sensor, the detection methodology may process it as an input
- the ultrasound-plus-IR detection methodology can be used in many different applications.
- the detection methodology according to various embodiments can be used to process inputs in response to one or more objects moving relatively far away (e.g., a few meters) from the input processing system.
- the detection methodology can be used to process inputs in response to one or more objects moving relatively close (e.g., a few feet) to the input processing system.
- the input processing system can recognize different movement patterns or gestures. Each recognized movement pattern may cause a particular action to be performed. It is understood that the particular action taken depends on the design of system using the ultrasound-plus-IR detection methodology.
- an up and down movement pattern may correspond to a scrolling UI interface action.
- a left to right movement pattern may correspond to a page turning UI interface action.
- a waving motion pattern may correspond to a silence the alarm interface action.
- a stereo system may adjust the volume responsive to the relative distance between two hands; as the distance between the hands increases, the volume increases.
- the ultrasound-plus-IR detection methodology is a specific example of a ultrasound-plus-radiation detection methodology according to embodiments herein.
- Ultrasound-plus-radiation detection methodologies can use an ultrasonic sensor and another sensor that monitors any type of radiation, particularly, non-ionizing radiation.
- Other embodiments that leverage ultrasonic sensors can incorporate use of an optical sensor (e.g., camera).
- Such embodiments can employ the ultrasound-plus-image detection methodology, where the ultrasonic sensor is used for presence detection, and the image is used for processing inputs.

- Hazard detection system 500 can be the same for both FIGS. 5A and 5B , and thus various aspects described in connection with one FIG. can apply to the other FIG.
- the detection fields and their respective field of view angles and center axis positions can be the same for both FIGS.
- FIG. 5B is where hazard detection system 500 is mounted. In FIG. 5A , it is mounted to a ceiling (or other object that is substantially parallel to the ground), and in FIG. 5B , it is mounted to a wall (or other object that is substantially perpendicular to the ground). Enclosure 500 can include ceiling 512 , walls 514 and 516 , and floor 518 .
- PIR detection field 520 Three different detection fields are shown: PIR detection field 520 , ultrasonic detection field 530 , and ultrasonic detection field 540 .
- Each detection field shows a series of dashed lines that represent each field's outer bounds.
- PIR detection field 520 can stem from a PIR sensor (not shown), and ultrasonic detection fields 530 and 540 can stem from ultrasonic sensors (not shown).
- the fields appear to be two-dimensional, it is understood that the fields occupy a three-dimensional space.
- PIR detection field 520 can occupy a vast majority of enclosure 510 due to its relatively large, wide angle field of view.
- PIR detection field 520 can have field of view angle, A, as shown.
- Ultrasonic detection fields 530 and 540 can each occupy a minority of enclosure 510 due to their relatively small, narrow angle fields of view.
- detection fields 530 and 540 can have field of view angles, B 1 and C 1 , respectively as shown.
- the value of angle A can be greater than the values of angles B 1 and C 1
- the values of angles B 1 and C 1 can be the same or different.
- Detection fields 530 and 540 are shown with respective center axes 531 and 541 .
- Detection field 520 can have a center axis, but it is not shown to avoid overcrowding the FIG.
- the center axes of detection fields 520 and 530 can be co-planer or co-axial, but the center axes of detection fields 530 and 540 are neither co-planer nor co-axial.
- the positions of the center axes with respect to reference plane 501 vary. As shown, an angle of B 2 exists between center axis 531 and reference plane 501 , and an angle of C 2 exists between center axis 541 and reference plane 501 . Angle B 2 can be greater than angle C 2 .
- angles B 2 and C 2 can be selected to maximize the potential for the ultrasonic sensors (not shown) to detect the presence of one or more moving or stationary objects, regardless of how hazard detection system 500 is mounted.
- angle B 2 for detection field 530
- angle C 2 for detection field 540
- angle B 2 can range from 80-100 degrees
- angle C 2 can range from 5 to 80 degrees. It is understood that any suitable angle can be selected for angles B 2 and C 2 , respectively.
- angle B 2 can range from 90 to 180 degrees and angle C 2 can range from 0 to 90 degrees.
- angle C 2 can be 45 degrees and angle B 2 can be 135 degrees.
- center axis 531 is substantially perpendicular to wall 514 , and as a result detection field 530 projects in a direction substantially perpendicular to wall 514 .
- detection field 530 may not be ideally suited for detecting an object (e.g., a person attempting to gesture hush an audible alarm). This may be because the person is not tall enough to reach detection field 530 .
- Detection field 540 which is directed downwards towards floor 518 , may be better suited for detecting the object. This may be because the person will eventually enter detection field 540 regardless of how tall he or she is. Thus, in wall mounted applications, objects detected in detection field 540 may take precedence over any objects detected in detection field 530 .
- detection field 530 may take precedence over objects detected in detection field 540 .
- center axis 531 is substantially perpendicular to ceiling 518 , and as a result detection field 530 projects directly towards floor 518 , regardless of how high the ceiling is with respect to the floor.
- Detection field 540 is also directed downwards to the floor, but not as directly as detection field 530 .
- detection field 540 may be cast too far away from hazard detection system 500 to effectively detect an object (e.g., a person attempting to gesture hush an audible alarm).
- detection field 530 may be better suited for detecting an object in ceiling mounted applications.
- hazard detection system 500 can selectively enable and disable one or more of its ultrasonic sensors. For example, system 500 can disable an ultrasonic sensor based on how it is mounted. System 500 can have an orientation sensor contained therein such as, for example, a multi-axis accelerometer, for determining its mounted orientation. If system 500 is wall mounted, it can disable the sensor casting detection field 530 . If system 500 is ceiling mounted, it can disable the sensor casting detection field 540 .
- angles B 2 and C 2 are permanently fixed. In another embodiment, one or more of angles B 2 and C 2 are adjustable.
- one or more of the ultrasonic sensors (not shown) can be pivoted about a rotation axis to change the angle of its central axis with respect to reference plane 501 .

- FIGS. 6A-6D show illustrative snapshots in time in which a person uses a gesture to silence an audible alarm in accordance with an embodiment
- FIG. 7 shows an illustrative timing diagram of various components of a hazard detection system in accordance with an embodiment.
- the snapshots of FIGS. 6A-6D can correspond to times, t 1 -t 4 , respectively, of FIG. 7 .
- Any suitable hazard detection system in accordance with an embodiment can be used, but for convenience and ease of discussion, hazard detection system 500 of FIG. 5A is referenced in connection with FIGS. 6A-6D and FIG. 7 . Accordingly, as already discussed above, system 500 can cast detection fields 520 , 530 , and 540 as shown.
- the hazard detection system can include, among other components, a PIR sensor, two ultrasonic sensors, an alarm, a speaker, and one or more hazard detection sensors.
- FIG. 7 shows timing waveforms for alarm event 702 , PIR sensor sample rate 704 , ultrasonic sensor enable 705 , first ultrasonic sensor object detection waveform 706 , second ultrasonic sensor object detection waveform 708 , PIR gesture detection waveform 710 , speaker output 712 , and audible alarm output 714 .
- Alarm event 702 can indicate whether the hazard detection system senses a condition that triggers an alarm event. For example, if the hazard detection system senses smoke, alarm event 702 can transition from low to high (as it does at time t 1 ).
- PIR sample rate 704 indicates the rate at which PIR data is sampled.
- Ultrasonic sensor enable 705 indicates whether the ultrasonic sensors are enabled.
- ultrasonic sensors can be power gated off when not in use.
- Ultrasonic sensor object detection waveforms 706 and 708 can indicate whether an ultrasonic sensor detects an object.
- Waveform 706 can correspond to objects detected in detection field 540
- waveform 708 can correspond to objects detected in detection field 530 .
- PIR gesture detection waveform indicates whether a gesture is recognized within detection field 520 .
- Speaker output 712 indicates whether the speaker is playing back a message, and audible alarm output 714 indicates whether the alarm is sounding.
- the waveforms for alarm event 702 , ultrasonic sensor enable 705 , first and second ultrasonic sensor detection waveforms 706 and 708 , PIR gesture detection waveform 710 , speaker output 712 , and audible alarm output 714 are all LOW.
- the ultrasonic sensors can be power gated off.
- power gating circuitry 364 can be OPEN so that ultrasonic sensors 320 are OFF.
- PIR sample rate 704 is set at a first sample rate.
- alarm event 702 goes HIGH, which can cause the alarm to sound.
- Audible alarm output 714 goes HIGH at time, t 1 .
- Ultrasonic sensor enable 705 goes HIGH, thereby powering ON the ultrasonic sensors.
- PIR sample rate 704 may change from the first sample rate to a second sample rate, where the second sample rate has a higher frequency than the first.
- hazard detection system 500 is sounding its alarm as indicated by the “buzz, buzz, buzz” emanating therefrom.
- Person 600 is shown at location 601 , which is within detection field 520 but outside of detection fields 530 and 540 .
- person 600 moves from location 601 to location 602 , which is within detection field 520 but outside of detection fields 530 and 540 . Because person 600 is moving within detection field 520 , the movement may be detected by the PIR sensor. This is shown as the step change in PIR gesture detection waveform 710 at time, t 2 . Even though the PIR sensor detects a gesture (e.g., movement of person 600 ) within detection field 520 this does not silence the alarm.
- a gesture e.g., movement of person 600
- the ultrasonic sensor monitoring that field may sense the presence of person 600 . This is shown in ultrasonic sensor object detection waveform 708 , which transitions from LOW to HIGH at time, t 3 .
- the speaker may playback a message. As shown in FIG. 6C , the message is “wave to hush alarm.” Any suitable message can be played back, in any language. The beginning of the speaker message playback is shown in FIG.
- a visual indicator (e.g., LED 328 of FIG. 3 ), not shown, may be presented when person 600 is detected as present within detection field 530 .
- the visual indicator may light up or rapidly blink when person 600 is within detection field 530 .
- the audio and/or visual indicator can inform the occupant that the hazard detection system is ready to detect and process any gestures that the occupant may perform.
- the audio and/or visual indicator may provide useful feedback to the occupant so that occupant knows when to perform gesture motions (e.g., because if the occupant performs a gesture outside of detection field 530 or detection field 540 , the hazard detection system may ignore the occupant's gesture).
- person 600 can wave one or more arms while in position 603 .
- the hazard detection system can silence the audible alarm.
- FIG. 6D the “buzz, buzz, buzz” sound is gone.
- PIR gesture detection waveform 710 shows that a gesture is detected at time, t 4 .
- the simultaneous detection of the gesture by the PIR sensor and the presence of person 600 within ultrasonic detection field 530 can cause the hazard detection system to silence its alarm. This is shown at time, t 4 , when audible alarm output 714 transitions from HIGH to LOW.
- Alarm event 702 is still HIGH at time, t 4 , thus the alarm may sound again after a predetermined period of time elapses and alarm event 702 is still HIGH.
- a visual indicator may be presented to indicate that the alarm has been hushed.
- an audible message may be played back to indicate that the alarm has been hushed.
- the audible message can specify which alarm is hushed. For example, if the alarm is a smoke alarm, the audible message can specify that the smoke alarm has been hushed. As another example, if the alarm is a self-test, the audible message can specify that the self-test has been hushed. In addition, the audible message can specify for how long the alarm will be hushed. For example, the audible message may say that “The smoke alarm will be silent for five minutes.”
- FIG. 8 shows an illustrative detection field for PIR sensor 800 in accordance with an embodiment.
- PIR sensor 800 can cast multiple subfields 810 a - i to define detection field 802 and can provide an output in the form of raw data when the object moves from one subfield to another. For example, if an object moves from subfield 810 e to subfield 810 f , sensor 800 will detect the movement of the object provide it as part of its raw data output.
- the raw data outputted by sensor 800 may not correspond to an actual physical measurement (e.g., Joules), but may correspond to a combined infrared delta seen by subfields 810 a - i within a given time window.
- the raw data output may be filtered to eliminate ambient infrared noise.
- the raw data output of PIR sensor 800 may be filtered by a low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency at 3 Hz. Illustrative examples of filtered PIR outputs are shown in FIGS. 9A-9D .
- FIGS. 9A-9D several different illustrative graphs showing PIR sensor data are shown.
- the continuous raw data received from the PIR sensor or the filtered PIR data may be processed by a segmentation algorithm.
- the segmentation algorithm ascertains amplitude and period statistics of detected motion, and it may be these statistics that are used by a gesture detection algorithm to determine whether a gesture event motion has been detected.
- Each graph shows magnitude of the combined infrared delta versus time. The magnitude can be a function of how much mass is detected moving from one subfield to another, and the frequency of detected motion can be a function of how fast the object is moving.
- FIG. 9A illustrates a graph in which no movement is being detected by a PIR sensor. As shown, waveform 910 is flat.
- FIG. 9B illustrates waveform 920 , which can represent one mass unit (e.g., one arm) moving at a “normal” speed. As shown, waveform 920 has period T, and amplitude A.

- 2 A e.g., which is twice that of the amplitude generated by a single mass unit
- FIG. 10 shows illustrative waveforms of raw and filtered PIR data in accordance with an embodiment.
- the x-axis shows a sample number and the y-axis shows energy delta measured by the PIR sensor.
- Waveform 1010 may be a raw PIR data waveform and waveform 1020 may be a filtered PIR data waveform.
- Waveform 1020 can include inflection points 1021 , 1022 , 1023 , and 1024 .
- An inflection point can occur when the slope of a waveform changes from positive to negative or from negative to positive.
- the inflection points shown in FIG. 10 exist when the slope of waveform 1020 changes from positive to negative.
- the inflection points can define the boundaries of detected motion events (e.g., a detected wave motion).
- waveform 1020 includes detection motion event 1030 , which is bounded by inflection points 1021 and 1022 , detected motion event 1040 , which is bounded by inflection points 1022 and 1023 , and detected motion event 1050 , which is bounded by inflection points 1023 and 1024 .

- FIG. 11 shows an illustrative state machine 1100 for calibrating detection sensors and for detecting a motion event according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the right hand side of the FIG. generally refers to the calibration aspect of state machine 1100 and the left hand side generally refers to the motion detection aspect of state machine 1100 .
- state machine 1100 reference will be made to FIGS. 12 and 13 to aid in the description of various embodiments.
- State machine 1100 can be implemented in any suitable system such as a personal computing device, a security system, or a hazard detection system. The system operates according to its design criteria and from time to time, may cause state machine 1100 to change states.
- state machine 1100 When the system does not require any action of state machine 1100 , state machine 1100 is in OFF state 1102 , which can represent a state in which the sensors are not being used to detect a motion event and are not being calibrated. In some embodiments, state machine 1100 is preferably in OFF state 1102 the majority of its operational life to minimize power consumption.
- the system may require a calibration.
- the calibration can define a baseline from which various detectors can accurately interpret data being received from one or more sensors.
- a presence detector in order to determine presence of an object and the distance of that object from the system, a presence detector may need to be calibrated.
- a presence detector can use one or more ultrasonic sensors to determine whether an object (such as a user) is present within a predetermined vicinity (e.g., detection field 530 of FIG. 5A ) of the system.
- the presence detector can create a “static” environment model of that predetermined vicinity by determining what objects exist in that space. Thus, the static environmental model represents what the presence detector “sees” when no object is attempting a gesture.
- the presence detector can compare “real-time” sensor data to the static model in order to determine whether a “new” object is present.
- the static model can further enable the presence detector to detect “new” objects even if they are not moving within the predetermined vicinity.
- state machine 1100 can transition to calibration paused state 1112 .
- State 1112 can represent a condition in which calibration has not yet begun or in which calibration has been postponed because there has been recent movement as detected by movement detector 1114 .
- Movement detector 1114 can use a PIR sensor, for example, and is discussed in more detail below. If movement detector 1114 detects movement, the state machine can revert to calibration paused state 1112 . If no movement is detected, the state machine can proceed to calibrating state 1116 . In state 1116 , one or more ultrasonic sensors can generate the static environmental model. When calibration is complete (at step 1118 ), the state machine can proceed to OFF state 1102 .
- the model can be defined by a matrix of distances detected in the detection field of each ultrasonic sensor (e.g., ultrasonic sensors 320 of FIG. 3 ).
- the matrix discretizes the detected distances into separate buckets that are populated with counts, and it is the counts of these buckets that define the static environment model.
- the matrix can be an n ⁇ m matrix defined by R ij s , where S is a particular ultrasonic sensor, i is the index of a distance bucket (db i ), and j is the index of the sample. A total of m samples may be taken, m is an integer.
- m can be 100.
- a sampling size of one hundred can be achieved by calibrating each ultrasonic sensor for 10 seconds at a 10 hertz sampling rate.
- multiple ultrasonic sensors can exist in the system.
- ultrasonic sensor, S can be sensor 420 or 422 .
- Each distance bucket (db i ) represents a particular distance that can be detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
- the distance buckets can range in distance from a minimum distance to a maximum distance, and each bucket can be separated by a predetermined resolution.
- the minimum distance can be about 660 mm and the maximum distance bucket can be about 3333 mm, and the resolution can be about 60 mm.
- the first distance bucket (db 1 ) can exist at 660 mm
- the second (db 2 ) can exist at 720 mm
- the third (db 3 ) can exist at 780 mm, and so on such that the last distance bucket exists at 3333 mm.
- R ij s is the number of distances that are within a predefined proximity of distance bucket (db i ) observed on iteration j by ultrasonic sensor, S.
- an observed distance (d) can exist within a particular distance bucket if (db i ) ⁇ 30 ⁇ d ⁇ (db i )+30.
- the +/ ⁇ 30 values can define the boundaries of the predefined proximity for each distance bucket. For example, assume i is 5 and j is 12 and db 5 is 1000 mm, and further assume that ultrasonic sensor. S, detected distances (d) at 990 mm and 1013 mm at sample iteration 12. As a result, R 5,12 s is 2.
- Each ultrasonic sensor is calibrated and is assigned its own R model.
- an R model is calibrated for ultrasonic sensors 420 and 422 .
- two additional arrays can be defined: r S and q S .
- r S is an array containing the means for each distance bucket.
- q S is an array containing the variances for each distance bucket.
- Relatively large values found in this array can indicate objects are intermittently seen or are difficult to detect.
- the edge of a desk, a ceiling fan, or a piece of acoustically-absorbent material are examples of objects that may yield a relatively large variance. Knowledge of which distances are noisy can better enable a presence detector to avoid false detection of a “new” object.
- FIG. 12 shows illustrative diagrams 1200 and 1210 that may form the calibration basis of two different ultrasonic sensors according to an example scenario.
- diagram 1200 can include r S waveform 1201 , which may correspond to the mean values associated with a first ultrasonic sensor (e.g., sensor 420 ).
- Diagram 1210 can include r S waveform 1211 may correspond to the mean values associate with a second ultrasonic sensor (e.g., sensor 422 ).
- the x-axis shows distance (in feet) and the y-axis represents the mean values.
- the spikes which are labeled as 1202 - 1205 in diagram 1200 and as 1212 - 1214 in diagram 1210 , can represent detected objects. For example, in diagram 1200 , objects are detected at distances of approximately 3.9 feet, 5.4 feet, 7.8 feet, and 9.4 feet.
- state machine 1100 may transition to NO activity state 1122 , as shown.
- NO activity state 1122 can represent a state in which no movement has been detected and no user is currently present.
- state machine 1100 is in state 1122 , the ultrasonic sensors are not used and can be powered off.
- movement detector 1124 e.g., a detector that uses PIR sensor data
- state machine 1100 may remain in NO activity state 1122 .
- Movement detector 1124 can leverage the PIR sensor data segmentation process to compare the amplitude (e.g., y amplitude ) of each detected motion event to a threshold. If the amplitude meets or exceeds the threshold, movement detector 1124 may conclude that some object has moved within the field of view of the PIR sensor. In some embodiments, movement detector 1124 is the same as movement detector 1114 . If movement detector 1124 does detect motion, state machine 1100 may transition to motion detected state 1126 .
- Motion detected state 1126 can represent a state in which a radiation sensing sensor such as a PIR sensor or an optical sensor has detected motion of at least one object, but there has not yet been any confirmation that that object is present within a predefined vicinity of the system.
- Presence detector 1128 may verify whether an object is present within a vicinity of the system. Presence detector 1128 may construct a “dynamic” model based on real-time ultrasonic sensor data and compare to the static model in order to determine whether a “new” object is present. If no presence is detected, the state machine may revert back to motion detector 1124 . If presence is detected, the state machine may proceed to Object present state 1130 .
- Object present state 1130 can represent that an object is present within a predefined vicinity of the system. When the system is in object present state 1130 , it may provide an audible message and/or visual cue to inform the occupant that he or she is currently being detected as present and that the system is ready to receive a gesture input from the occupant. Presentation of the audible message and/or visual cue can assist the occupant in positioning him or herself within an appropriate field of view of the hazard detection system so that the system is better able to discern whether the occupant is implementing a gesture.
- the dynamic environment model may embody many of the same elements as that used by the calibration engine to create the static environment model.
- This model can be defined by a matrix of distances detected in the detection field of each ultrasonic sensor (e.g., ultrasonic sensors 320 of FIG. 3 ).
- the matrix discretizes the detected distances into separate buckets that are populated with counts, and it is the counts of these buckets that define the dynamic environment model.
- the matrix can be an n ⁇ m matrix defined by D ij s , where S is a particular ultrasonic sensor, i is the index of a distance bucket (db i ), and j is the index of the sample.
- a total of m samples may be taken, and m is an integer. For example, in one embodiment, in can be 20.
- a sampling size of twenty can net a two (2) second sampling window at a 10 hertz sampling rate.
- a D matrix is maintained for each one of the multiple ultrasonic sensors that exist in the system. Each D matrix is updated with new sensor data and old data can be discarded.
- the distance buckets (db i ) used in the D matrices can be the same as the distance buckets used in the R matrices (discussed above).
- D ij s is the number of distances that are within a predefined proximity of distance bucket (db i ) observed on iteration j by ultrasonic sensor, S.
- the predefined proximity can be bounded by the same constraints as the R matrices.
- an observed distance (d) can exist within a particular distance bucket if (db i ) ⁇ 30 ⁇ d ⁇ (db i )+30.
- presence detector 1128 can determine confidence values (c i S ) for each distance bucket.
- the confidence value can represent confidence that a detected distance has exceeded the expected variance for a particular distance bucket. If c i S exceeds a predetermined “new object” variance threshold then presence detector 1128 can conclude that a new object is present at the distance location of distance bucket (db i ) of ultrasonic sensor, S.
- the predetermined variance threshold can be tuned to obtained a desired specificity/sensitivity balance for presence detector 1128 . For example, increasing the threshold can decrease sensitivity and increase specificity, and decreasing the threshold can increase sensitivity and decrease specificity.
- FIG. 13 shows illustrative waveform diagrams 1300 and 1310 according to an example scenario.
- Both diagrams 1300 and 1310 include calibration waveforms and real-time data waveforms for two different ultrasonic sensors.
- diagram 1300 includes r S waveform 1201 (the same waveform as shown in FIG. 12 ) and real-time data waveform 1301 associated with a first ultrasonic sensor.
- Real-time data waveform 1301 can be the mean of the real-time observed distances, such as d i S described above.
- Diagram 1310 includes r S waveform 1211 (the same waveform as shown in FIG. 12 ) and real-time data waveform 1311 associated with a second ultrasonic sensor. A comparison between waveforms 1211 and 1311 indicates that a new object may exist at presence distance 1320 , which is shown to have a distance of 9.3 feet.
- gesture detector 1132 can determine whether a user is performing a gesture. That is, gesture detector 1132 can be utilized when state machine 1100 has progressed from motion detected state 1126 to object present state 1130 . Gesture detector 1132 can evaluate data processed by motion detector 1124 and/or presence detector 1128 when making a determination whether the user is performing a gesture. In one embodiment, gesture detector 1132 may apply a set of criteria to a predetermined number of recently received motion detection events. For example, the predetermined number of can be the last two, three, or four received motion events.
- the predetermined number is three, then all three motion events must satisfy the criteria in order for gesture detector 1132 to recognize those three motion events as a user generated gesture.
- the predetermined number of can be selected based on desired sensitivity and specificity parameters of gesture detector 1132 . For example, as the predetermined number increases, this can decrease sensitivity and increase specificity. Conversely, as the predetermined number decreases, this can increase sensitivity and decrease specificity.
- the criteria may be applied to each motion event individually and some criteria may be applied to the combination of the motion events.
- the criteria can include a motion event duration time limit. Thus, if the period of a motion event (e.g., t period ) exceeds the motion event duration time limit, then that motion event may be disqualified as being a gesture.
- the criteria may specify a range of periods that each motion event's period must fall within.
- the criteria can specify a range of amplitudes within which the motion event's amplitude (e.g., y amplitude ) must be in order to quality as a gesture event. The range of amplitudes may vary based on the presence distance, u, defined above.
- the criteria can apply a standard deviation threshold to the amplitudes of each motion event.
- the amplitude of each motion event must be within a predetermined number of standard deviations of an average amplitude of the combined motion events.
- the criteria can also apply variance thresholds to the motion events.
- the variance of periods must be less than a predetermined variance threshold.
- gesture detector 1132 can recognize multiple different gestures.
- gesture detector 1132 does not recognize a gesture, the state machine can revert back to presence detector 1128 . If a gesture is recognized, the state machine may proceed to gesture recognized state 1134 . Once state machine 1100 reaches state 1134 , the system may take appropriate action responsive to the confirmation that a gesture is recognized. For example, in the hazard detection system context, a recognized gesture may result in silencing of a loud sounding alarm or result in ceasing playback of a pre-alarm message. The state machine may proceed to OFF state 1102 after it reaches state 1134 , as shown.
- the distance resolution can be a tunable parameter that can alter the sensitivity and specificity of presence detector 1128 and the calibration thereof.
- the distance resolution defines the distance buckets.
- An increase in resolution can increase specificity and can decrease sensitivity. For example, by increasing the resolution, a new object can be detected at more precise distances and thus may be less likely to be obstructed by objects in the ambient environment, but the new object may be falsely detected due to a relatively low number of samples in each distance bucket.
- a decrease in resolution can decrease specificity and can increase sensitivity. For example, by decreasing the resolution, the sample size can be increased to provide more robust statistics that enhances the confidence factor of whether a new object is present, but objects in the ambient environment may tend to interfere.
- the variance threshold for qualifying new objects as being present can be tuned to obtain a desired sensitivity/specificity balance. As discussed above, the variance threshold is the threshold compared to the confidence value at different distances. The variance threshold can be a tunable parameter that can alter the sensitivity and specificity parameters of presence detector 1128 .
- FIGS. 14A-14C show an illustrative process for operating a hazard detection system with gesture hush capability in accordance with an embodiment.
- This process can be implemented, for example, in a hazard detection system that includes at least one hazard sensor, alarm generation circuitry, PIR sensor, and at least one ultrasonic sensor.
- the hazard detection system can be system 200 , 300 , 400 , or 500 as discussed above.
- data is received from at least one hazard detection sensor.
- the data can be obtained from one or more of sensors (e.g., ALS sensor 322 , temperature and humidity sensor 323 , smoke detector 324 , CO sensor 325 , and thermistors 326 ).
- the sensor data can be analyzed to determine whether a pre-alarm event or alarm event exists in the vicinity of the hazard system.
- a Pre-alarm event can be characterized as having similar sensor data as an alarm event, but does not have the same magnitude as that which would cause an alarm event.
- pre-alarm event may exhibit data qualities that surpasses a first threshold (which is sufficient to trigger a pre-alarm event) but is less than a second threshold (which is sufficient to trigger an alarm event).
- An alarm event may exhibit data qualities that equal or surpass the second threshold, and in some embodiments, may even surpass a third threshold, which is higher than the second threshold.
- the alarm event can be categorized as a hushable alarm event or a non-hushable alarm event.
- a hushable alarm event is one in which an audible alarm can be silenced (e.g., by pressing a button on the hazard system or by performing a gesture hush in a vicinity of the system), and a non-hushable alarm event is one in which an audible alarm cannot be silenced.
- a hushable alarm event may exhibit data qualities that equal or exceed the second threshold but are less than the third threshold.
- a non-hushable alarm event may exhibit data qualities that equal or exceed the third threshold. Different categorization of alarm events may be needed to satisfy requirements of different jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, if the data qualities exceed the third threshold, the audible alarm cannot be turned off.
- step 1410 a determination is made whether the sensor data for the at least one hazard detection sensor exceeds a first threshold but not a second threshold. If the determination is NO, the process can proceed to step 1415 , which then reverts the process back to step 1402 . If the determination is YES, the hazard detection system can enter into a pre-alarm mode, and the process proceeds to step 1412 of FIG. 14B .
- a pre-alarm recording can be played back.
- the pre-alarm recording can be any suitable message that can be played through a speaker of the hazard detection system.
- the pre-alarm recording can be an informative message indicating that an alarm is imminent.
- the pre-alarm may also instruct a user to perform a gesture event to prevent the hazard system from sounding its audible alarm in the event the sensor data is received that indicates the presence of an alarm event.
- sensor data acquired from at least one object detection sensor is monitored.
- the monitored sensor data can include data obtained from a PIR sensor, one or more ultrasonic sensors, or any other radiation detecting sensor or image capturing sensor.
- playback of the pre-alarm recording can cease. In some embodiments, another recorded message can be played back in response to a detected gesture event. The other message can inform the user, for example, that the gesture event has been recognized and that the audible alarm will be temporarily disabled.
- an audible alarm is pre-emptively silenced in the event the sensor data for the at least one hazard detection sensor exceeds a second threshold but not a third threshold.
- step 1417 the process can proceed to step 1415 , which returns the process back to step 1402 .
- step 1410 if the determination at step 1410 is NO, the process can proceed to step 1420 .
- step 1420 a determination is made whether the sensor data for the at least one hazard detection sensor exceeds the second threshold but not a third threshold. If the determination is YES, the hazard detection system can enter into a hushable alarm mode, and the process can proceed to step 1422 of FIG. 10C .
- an audible alarm is sounded.
- the audible alarm can, for example, be relatively loud and pulse at regular intervals.
- sensor data acquired from at least one object detection sensor is monitored.
- the monitored sensor data can include data obtained from a PIR sensor, one or more ultrasonic sensors, or any other motion detecting sensor.
- step 1424 a determination is made as to whether the monitored data indicates a gesture event has been performed. If the determination is NO, the process can proceed to step 1425 , which then reverts the process back to step 1402 . If the determination is YES, the process proceeds to step 1426 .
- the audible alarm can be silenced. In some embodiments, the audible alarm can be silenced for a predetermined period of time, regardless of the hazard detection sensor readings. In other embodiments, the audible alarm can be silenced for a predetermined period of time, but can be sounded on demand based on hazard detection sensor readings. After step 1426 , the process can proceed to step 1425 .
- step 1430 a determination is made whether the sensor data for the at least one hazard detection sensor exceeds the third threshold. If the determination is YES, the hazard detection system can enter into a non-hushable alarm mode, and the process can proceed to step 1432 . At step 1432 , an audible alarm can be sounded for an indefinite period of time or at least until the sensor data for the at least one hazard detection sensor drops below the third threshold. If the determination is NO at step 1430 , the process can proceed back to step 1402 .
- steps 1410 , 1420 , 1430 are merely illustrative and that any suitable conditions can be used to determine whether a pre-alarm event or alarm event exists.
- any suitable conditions can be used to determine whether a pre-alarm event or alarm event exists.
- various conditions for determining when pre-alarm and alarm events exist can be found be found in commonly assigned U.S. Publication No. 2015/0022367.
- FIG. 15 shows an illustrative process in which a hazard detection system silences an audible alarm in response to monitoring a gesture in accordance with an embodiment.
- an audible alarm is emitted in response to a detected hazard event.
- the detected hazard event can be the presence of smoke in the vicinity of the hazard detection system.
- the audible alarm can be emitted by audio generation circuitry, such as alarm 334 of FIG. 3 .
- a recording can be played back that provides instructions on how to at least temporarily silence the audible alarm.
- a pre-recorded message can be played through speaker 318 of FIG. 3 .
- the recording can be played back if the hazard detection system detects motion. For example, if a motion detection sensor, such as a PIR sensor, detects motion within its field of view, this may trigger playback of the recording. As another example, playback of the recording may be triggered if an ultrasonic sensor detects presence of an object within its field of view.
- an object is detected moving in a vicinity of the hazard detection system in accordance with the instructions of the recording.
- one or more object detecting sensors may detect the object moving within their respective fields of view.
- data acquired from these sensors can indicate that a gesture event was detected.
- the gesture event may be any suitable movement or combination of movements.
- the gesture event can be a waving motion of one or two arms.
- the audible alarm is at least temporarily silenced in response to detecting the object moving in accordance with the instructions of the recording.
- the audible alarm is turned OFF in response to an affirmative command by a user.
- the audible alarm may remain OFF for a predetermined period of time before being reactivated, at which time the user may have to commence another gesture event to silence it.
- FIG. 16 show an illustrative process for operating a hazard detection system equipped with at least one ultrasonic sensor in accordance with an embodiment.
- alarm generation circuitry can be activated to emit an audible alarm.
- the audible alarm can be activated, for example, in response to data received by one or more hazard detection sensors.
- at least one ultrasonic detection field can be monitored for presence of at least one object.
- the ultrasonic detection field can be detection field 530 of FIG. 5A or FIG. 6D .
- a determination is made whether the at least one object is moving in accordance with a gesture while the at least one object is present in the at least one ultrasonic detection field.
- the moving arms of person 600 in FIG. 6D can be an object moving in accordance with a gesture while within ultrasonic detection field 530 .
- the alarm generation circuitry is deactivated to cease emitting the audible alarm when it is determined that the at least one object is moving in accordance with the gesture while the at least one object is present in the at least one ultrasonic detection field.
- the moving object and the object present within an ultrasonic field can be the same or different.
- the body of person 600 may be present and stationary within detection field 530 , but the arms can be moving in and out of detection field 530 .
- the presence of the body can be sufficient to satisfy the presence requirement within an ultrasonic field, and the movement of the arms can be sufficient to satisfy the gesture movement.
- FIG. 17 show an illustrative process for operating a hazard detection system equipped with a PIR sensor and at least one ultrasonic sensor in accordance with an embodiment.
- an audible alarm can be emitted in response to a hazard event detected by the at least one hazard detection sensor.
- sensor data can be received from a passive infrared (PIR) sensor.
- PIR passive infrared
- the PIR sensor has a relatively wide field of view for detecting movement of at least one object.
- sensor data is received from at least one ultrasonic sensor, each ultrasonic sensor having a relatively narrow field of view for detecting presence of the at least one object. The narrow field of view is less than the wide field of view.
- step 1708 data acquired by the PIR sensor and the at least one ultrasonic sensor can be processed.
- the data can be processed, for example, by control circuitry (e.g., system processor 310 ).
- control circuitry e.g., system processor 310
- the control circuitry can analyze the amplitude and period of waveforms in the processed data. Examples of these waveforms are discussed above in connection with FIGS. 9A-9D .
- the audible alarm ceases to sound when the gesture hush event is determined to exist.
- a first distance bucket can exist between 1 foot and 1.2 feet, the next can exist between 1.2 feet and 1.4 feet, and the next can exist between 1.4 feet and 1.6 feet, and so on until the last bucket reaches 10 feet.
- a count is added to both adjacent distance buckets. For example, if an object is detected within distance bucket X, a count is added to distance bucket X, and a count is added to distance buckets X ⁇ 1 and X+1. Adding counts to adjacent distance buckets can account for variances in ultrasonic sensor's ability to detect objects at different distances.
- a filter can be applied to it to generate a binary matrix for each sensor.
- the binary matrix represents whether an object exists at each distance bucket for the entire range of distances.
- An object may be considered to exist at a particular distance bucket if the number of counts in that bucket meet or exceed a threshold set by the filter.
- a binary “1” may be stored in the binary matrix corresponding to that distance bucket. If the number of counts for a given bucket does not meet or exceed the threshold, that bucket is stored as a binary “0.”
- This filter threshold can help eliminate any noise that may be present in the histogram.
- the filter can ensure that the binary 1s assigned to various distance buckets in the matrix are indicative of a higher likelihood than not, that an object is present at those distances.
- An exemplary calibration matrix 1801 is shown in FIG. 18 , where C represents a binary calibration matrix for one of the ultrasonic sensors. As shown, matrix 1801 has n different distance buckets, as indicated by db 1 , db 2 , db 3 and so on until db n . Each position in matrix 1801 corresponds to a different distance bucket. A “1” indicates an object is present at that distance bucket, and a “0” indicates no object is present at that distance bucket.
- a calibration matrix can be obtained for each ultrasonic sensor at regular intervals (e.g., once a day).
- a real-time binary sensor matrix can be generated for each ultrasonic sensor.
- the same criteria used for generating the calibration matrix may be used for generating a sensor matrix.
- An exemplary real-time sensor matrix 1811 is shown in FIG. 18 , where S represents a real-time binary sensor matrix for one of the ultrasonic sensors. As shown, matrix 1811 includes the same number of distance buckets as matrix 1801 and each position in matrix 1811 is populated with either a “1” or “0” depending on whether an object is detected as present.
- a comparison between matrix 1801 and matrix 1811 indicates whether any new objects have been added or any old objects have been lost.
- An object is added if the real-time sensor matrix indicates the presence of an object at a particular distance bucket that did not exist in the calibration matrix. For example, in comparing db 2 of both matrices, a new object is added because a “1” now exists in matrix 1811 , whereas in calibration matrix 1801 , no object previously existed at that distance bucket. An object is lost if it exists as a present object in the calibration matrix, but is no longer detected as present in the real-time sensor matrix. Comparing db 7 of both matrices, an old object is lost because matrix 1801 previously detected the presence of an object, but according to matrix 1811 , that object is no longer present. For example, whereas during calibration the sensor may have detected a wall at db 7 , but during usage, the presence of a user may prevent the sensor from seeing that wall.
- the result of the comparison between matrices 1801 and 1811 can indicate whether an object is present. Any suitable formula or criteria can be used to determine whether an object is present within an ultrasonic sensor's field of view. For example, in one embodiment, an object can be considered present if the number of newly added objects is equal to or greater than a first predetermined number (e.g., two), or if the number of newly added objects is equal to or greater than a second predetermined number (e.g., one) and the number of lost objects is equal to or greater than a third predetermined number (e.g., one). Referring briefly to FIG. 11 , if the comparison between matrices 1801 and 1811 indicates that an object is present at step 1128 , then the state machine of FIG. 11 can transition to object present state 1130 .
- a first predetermined number e.g., two
- a second predetermined number e.g., one
- a third predetermined number e.g., one
- different criteria can be used for one or more of the ultrasonic sensors. For example, if the hazard detection device is mounted on the ceiling, a first set of criteria may be used. However, if the hazard detection device is mounted to a wall, a second set of criteria may be used. A ceiling mounted device may require less stringent criteria than a wall mounted device. These different criteria can be used in different stages of the state machine of FIG. 11 . In some embodiments, the device can determine how it is mounted based on accelerometer data, if it is equipped with an accelerometer. If there no accelerometer or other device that indicates device orientation, the device can infer how it is mounted based on data obtained from its ultrasonic sensors.
- the angled ultrasonic sensor e.g., sensor 423
- a relatively large percentage of present objects e.g., more than 60%, more than 70%, or more than 80%
- both the straight and angled sensors e.g., sensors 421 and 423
- the straight and angled sensors are detecting objects in approximate equal percentages, then it can be inferred that the device is mounted to the ceiling.
- gesture detector 1132 may need to know which ultrasonic sensor is detecting the presence of the object. This determination can be made dynamically by calculating which sensor has the largest number of distance changes. The number of distance changes can be calculated by adding the number of newly added objects to the number of objects lost. For example, referring to matrices 1801 and 1811 of FIG. 18 , the number of distance changes for that particular ultrasonic sensor is 2, since there is one added object and one lost object. If, for example, the number of distance changes for the other ultrasonic sensor (not shown) is one, then the ultrasonic sensor associated with matrices 1801 and 1811 may be deemed as the actual sensor sensing presence of the object. When a sensor is chosen as the “correct” sensor, the state machine may stick with this sensor for determining whether a gesture is detected at step 1132 until it no longer sees the object.
- the state machine may use a distance settling algorithm to reduce potential for false positives.
- the distance settling algorithm may be able to determine periods of time when an occupant is detected within a field of view of an ultrasonic sensor, and is not moving closer to or away from the hazard detection device. For example, the distance settling algorithm can discern when an occupant enters a room containing the hazard detection system, when the user stops moving towards or away from the hazard detection system, and when the user exits the room. In order to minimize or prevent false positives, it may be desirable to ignore PIR gesture motions unless the occupant is relatively still.
- any PIR gesture motions may be ignored.
- this motion may be processed as a potential gesture motion.
- Waveform 1901 can represent distances detected by one of the ultrasonic sensors over time.
- waveform 1901 may be based on data obtained from the ultrasonic sensor determined to be detecting presence of the object.
- Waveform 1901 can be generated by ascertaining the closest distance added during each sample period. As shown, at time, t 1 , a new distance is added at a relatively far distance away from the sensor (shown as d 1 ), but as time progresses, the new distances added appear as decreasing distances to the sensor, until it the distances settle out around d 2 .
- An occupant may have walked into a room between times t 1 and t 2 and stopped moving towards or away from the sensor between times t 2 and t 3 .
- the user may be moving his or her arms or hands between times t 2 and t 3 .
- the occupant may have walked out of the room because the new added distances increase in distance away from the sensor.
- the distance settling algorithm may generate a derivative waveform 1911 , as shown in FIG. 19B , based on the closest distance sampling described above in connection with FIG. 19A .
- Derivative waveform 1911 may be represented by an absolute value of the differences of waveform 1901 .
- the peaks of waveform 1911 correspond to the relatively large distance changes between times t 1 and t 2 , and between times t 3 and t 4 .
- the flat portion of waveform 1911 corresponds to the relatively unchanging portion of waveform 1901 .
- the distance settling algorithm can impose threshold 1913 on waveform 1911 to determine when the occupant is settled or not.
- waveform 1911 exceeds threshold 1913 , then it can be considered that the occupant is not settled and no gesture processing inputs will be processed while waveform 1911 is considered not settled. Thus, as shown, since waveform 1911 exceeds threshold 1913 between times t 1 and t 2 , and again between times t 3 and t 4 , no gesture inputs may be considered within these timeframes. Thus, even if the PIR sensor is detecting a waving motion between either times t 1 and t 2 or times t 3 and t 4 , these PIR sensor readings may be discarded. However, if the PIR sensor is detecting motion between times t 2 and t 3 , for example, the PIR sensor data obtained during this time period may be used by a gesture detection algorithm.
- the gesture detection algorithm (such as the algorithm processed at step 1132 of FIG. 11 ) can analyze PIR sensor data during settled periods, as determined by the distance settling algorithm, to determine whether a gesture motion (e.g., a wave) exists in the PIR sensor data.
- the PIR sensor data may be analyzed by first determining the peaks in the PIR sensor data. Peaks can be ascertained using, for example, a slope change detection method or a zero-cross detection method. In the slope change detection method, changes from positive to negative slope can mark a max of a peak, and changes from negative to positive can mark a minimum of a peak. If desired, hysteresis can be built into the slope change detector to ignore sudden and abrupt slope changes.
- the zero-cross method an average value of the PIR sensor data is obtained, and compared to the raw PIR sensor data. Zero crosses occur when the average value of PIR sensor data intersects with the raw PIR sensor data. The amplitude and period of the PIR sensor data can be obtained from the zero crosses.
- the slope change detector may more applicable, whereas in other applications, the zero-cross detector may be more applicable. For example, since wave-like gesture motions are fairly consistent—thereby producing a relatively non-noisy signal—the slope change detector may be the more suitable detector for detecting waves. However, when the PIR data is relatively noisy, the zero cross detector may be the more suitable detector for detecting motions in the PIR data.
- FIG. 20 shows an illustrative gesture waveform 2001 , which may represent a wave gesture.
- Waveform 2001 has amplitude A 1 and period P 1 . If the amplitude and period of the waveform meet predefined criteria, then the amplitude and period of that waveform are stored in a rolling buffer of wave gestures.
- the predefined criteria can define the lower and upper bounds for the amplitude and the lower and upper bounds of the period.
- FIG. 21 shows illustrative buffer 2101 .
- the rolling buffer of wave gestures can store a fixed number of waves. For example, as shown in buffer 2101 , four waves are stored.
- each new wave satisfying the predefined criteria is obtained, it is rolled into the buffer. If the buffer is full, the new wave can push out an old wave. This way, the buffer stores the newest waves satisfying the criteria. If no new waves satisfying the predefined criteria are received within a predetermined period of time, the buffer is cleared.
- Pw 1 can be a comparison between wave 1 , which includes A 1 and P 1 , and wave 2 , which includes A 2 and P 2 .
- Pw 2 can a comparison between wave 2 , which includes A 2 and P 2 , and wave 3 , which includes A 3 and P 3 .
- Pw 3 can a comparison between wave 3 , which includes A 3 and P 3 , and wave 4 , which includes A 4 and P 4 . If desired, a pairwise combination can be made between wave 1 and wave 3 , or between wave 2 and wave 4 .
- the average amplitude and average period of two waves may be applied to a set of conditions.
- the conditions can specify upper and lower bounds of the average amplitude and upper and lower bounds of the average period. If the average amplitude and average period of the pair wise combination meet the conditions, the two waves may be considered to be a matched wave pair. In some embodiments, one matched wave pair may be sufficient to qualify as a detected wave gesture. In other embodiments, two or more matched wave pairs may be required in order for the PIR sensor data to qualify as a detected wave gesture. It is understood that the pair wise comparison can be made with settled and unsettled PIR data, and that the gesture detection algorithm according to various embodiments can decide how best to use the settled and unsettled factors in evaluating the PIR data.
- the shape matching algorithm may be implemented at the gesture detection step 1132 of FIG. 11 , and as its name implies, it searches for repetitive pattern shapes across successive periods to determine whether the PIR sensor is capturing a wave event.
- the shape matching algorithm can do this by slicing the PIR waveform into several windows, analyzing the waveform pattern in each window, and determining whether periodic matching patterns occur within that window. If a sufficient number of matching patterns are detected, then it may be inferred that a wave event is detected.
- the algorithm calculates a difference between a scaled “non-wave” score and a “wave” score and compares that difference to a threshold.
- the shape matching algorithm can be expressed by the following equation: ⁇ c 1 ⁇ c 2 >t (1) where ⁇ is a weighting factor used to scale C 1 , C 1 is the score of a non-wave within a window of samples, W (not shown), C 2 is the score of a wave within the same window of samples, W, and t is the threshold for determining whether a pattern match is detected.
- the window, W includes a fixed number of samples that are used to compute C 1 and C 2 .
- the size of the window can be changed to adjust the number of samples used to compute C 1 and C 2 .
- the values selected for ⁇ and t and may depend on the size of W. For example, a larger sized W may result in a higher t, whereas a smaller sized W may result in a lower t.
- the formula in equation 1 may represent a simplified statistical expression of whether a wave pattern is detected.
- the Cl and C 2 terms may each represent a score based on a negative log of a probability function, where the probability function of Cl is mathematically related to a non-wave probability (illustratively shown by equation 2) and the probability function of C 2 is mathematically related to a wave probability (illustratively shown by equation 3).
- the probability functions of equations 2 and 3 may each resemble a likelihood function.
- equation 2 may describe the probability a particular sequence of samples is observed given that the source of samples is not a wave
- equation 3 may describe the probability a particular sequence of samples is observed given that the source of samples is a wave.
- Equations 2 and 3 can by simplified by taking the negative logarithm of each probability function, thereby eliminating the exponential terms.
- C 1 and C 2 may also be mathematically related to a negative log likelihood function.
- the C 1 and C 2 used in equation 1 may not be strictly represented by either the probability function or the negative log likelihood function because equation 1 uses the weighting factor, ⁇ , and the threshold, t, to “absorb” and simplify all other constant terms (e.g., ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 ) from which equation 1 is derived.
- the values selected for ⁇ and t may be chosen to optimize the performance of the shape matching algorithm.
- the non-wave score, Cl, and wave score, C 2 are both calculated using the same window of samples, W.
- the non-wave score, Cl represents a probability that the samples within the sample size, W, are not part of a wave. This calculation is the sum of the square of the differential between successive samples within the sample size. This calculation can be expressed by the following equation: ⁇ i ⁇ w( ⁇ x i ⁇ x i ⁇ 1 ) 2 (4) where W is the sample size, ⁇ x i is the difference between the current sample, xi, and the previous sample, x i ⁇ 1 , and ⁇ x i ⁇ 1 is the difference between the previous sample, x i ⁇ 1 and two samples prior, x i ⁇ 2 .
- each score calculation represents whether the current sample “appeared” where it was expected to be.
- a relatively low non-wave score (C 1 ) may be interpreted that, under an assumption for the given set of samples, that the user is not waving.
- FIG. 22 illustrates a timing diagram of a PIR waveform 2202 . As shown, x i is expected to be the location shown, based on the location of prior samples in waveform 2202 . If the samples appear to be occurring where they are expected to be (e.g., shown as the expected location for x i ), then the probability that the PIR samples represent a non-wave may be relatively LOW and as a result, the calculated score may be relatively HIGH.
- the probability that the PIR samples represent a non-wave are relatively HIGH, and as a result, the calculated score may be relatively LOW.
- the wave score, C 2 represents a probability that the samples within the sample size, W, are part of a wave. This calculation is the sum of the square of the differential between a current sample and (the current sample one lambda ago, where lambda is a period of a wave). In other words, each wave score calculation represents whether a wave exists at a periodic interval, where the period is represented by lambda, ⁇ .
- the calculation can be expressed by the following equation: ⁇ i ⁇ w( ⁇ x i ⁇ x i ⁇ ) 2 (5) where W is the sample size, ⁇ x i is the difference between the current sample, xi, and the previous sample, x i ⁇ 1 , and ⁇ x i ⁇ is the difference between the sample one lambda ago, x i ⁇ , and the prior sample one lambda ago, x i ⁇ 1 .
- a relatively low wave score (C 2 ) may be interpreted that, under an assumption for the given set of samples, that the user is waving.
- FIG. 23 shows an illustrative waveform of PIR waveform 2302 .
- the result calculates the score of whether ⁇ x i resembles ⁇ x i ⁇ for period, ⁇ .
- ⁇ x i closely resembles ⁇ x i ⁇ .
- the probability that a wave exists for period, ⁇ is HIGH, and the resulting value of the wave probability calculation for x i is LOW.
- the probability that a wave exists is LOW, and the resulting value of the wave score calculation is HIGH.
- Equation 1 specifies that it is the balance between C 1 and C 2 (along with ⁇ and t) that determines whether a wave pattern is detected. That is, the shape matching algorithm compares C 1 and C 2 to each other and does not evaluate each of C 1 and C 2 independently to determine whether a pattern is detected. For example, assume a sequence of samples were all the same (a flatlined sensor). In such a sequence, the C 2 wave score would be zero, and since lower values mean higher likelihood, this could be interpreted to indicate that the probability of wave was high. However, as equation 1 specifies, it is the balance between the C 1 and C 2 terms (and ⁇ and t) that dictates whether a wave pattern is detected, because the C 1 non-wave score would also be zero for the same sequence. Thus, irrespective of ⁇ , the non-wave score may have to higher than the wave score in order for the shape matching algorithm to detect a wave pattern.
- the shape matching algorithm may calculate a wave score, C 2 , for several different waving periods.
- the shape matching algorithm may calculate C 2 for waving periods ranging between ⁇ min and ⁇ max .
- FIG. 24 shows an illustrative PIR waveform 2402 sampling within window W, and several different waving periods. Any suitable number of waving periods may be used to calculate a corresponding number of wave scores, C 2 .
- FIG. 24 has waving periods, ⁇ min , ⁇ min+1 , ⁇ min+2 , and ⁇ max , each of which start at position (i).
- the shape matching algorithm may calculate a wave score for each of the multiple waving periods to find a best fit match with a user's actual wave. After the wave scores for all waving periods are calculated, the shape matching algorithm may select the smallest calculated score for use in equation 1, as the smallest calculated number represents the best match.
- the user's actual wave may not have a constant period. That is, when the user is waving, the movements may have the same approximate wave motion, but each wave is not exactly the same.
- the shape matching algorithm can take these variations into account by incorporating tolerance factors for each ⁇ period calculation. This way, the shape matching algorithm can detect period pattern matches even though they are not exactly the same.
- a C 2 that takes the variations into account may be expressed by equation 6: ⁇ i ⁇ wmin s ⁇ [ ⁇ , ⁇ ] ( ⁇ x i ⁇ x i ⁇ +s) 2 (6) where the variable s represents the “slack” that varies over the range of ⁇ min and ⁇ max . After each C 2 is calculated according to equation 6, the smallest calculated C 2 is chosen for use in equation 1.
- FIG. 25 shows an illustrative flowchart of steps that may be executed by a shape matching algorithm according to an embodiment. These steps may be executed, for example, after it is determined a user is present by analyzing ultrasonic data. As another example, these steps may be performed in step 1132 of FIG. 11 .
- PIR signals may be received from a PIR sensor.
- the PIR sensor may be PIR sensor 327 of FIG. 3 .
- a window of PIR samples can be selected for wave event evaluation.
- the size of the window may vary to include a desired sample set of PIR signals. In some embodiments, the size of each window used may be the same for each successive wave event evaluation.
- the size of the windows may vary from one wave event evaluation to the next.
- a first window may include X samples
- a second window may include Y samples, where Y is greater than X.
- a sequence of windows may include any combination of windows (e.g., five instances of a first window, followed by three instances of a second window, followed by five instances of the first window, and so on).
- the windows for successive wave event calculations may or may not overlap.
- a non-overlapping wave event calculation may include an exclusive sample set. That is, the samples used for each calculation are used only for that calculation and no other samples.
- Overlapping wave events can use non-exclusive sample sets. That is, the same sample may be used by more than one wave event calculation. Computational overhead may increase when calculating wave events for overlapping windows.
- a non-wave score for the sample set may be calculated.
- the shape matching algorithm may use equation 4 to calculate the non-wave score.
- a wave score may also be calculated for the same sample set, at step 2508 .
- the shape matching algorithm may use equation 5 or 6 to calculate the wave score.
- the non-wave score may be scaled by a constant, ⁇ , which may have a value based on a number of factors, including, for example, the size of the window.
- a determination may be made as to whether a difference between the scaled non-wave score and the wave score exceed a threshold, t.
- This determination can be represented by equation 1, as discussed above.
- the threshold, t may be based on any suitable number of factors, including the value of the scaling constant, ⁇ , and the size of the window. If the determination at step 2512 is YES, a wave detection counter may be increased, as indicated by step 2514 . If the determination at step 2512 is NO, a miss counter may be incremented (as indicated at step 2515 ). At step 2516 , a determination is made whether the miss counter exceeds a miss threshold.
- the wave detection counter may be reset (as indicated by step 2517 ), and the process loops back to step 2502 , where the shape matching algorithm evaluates wave detection for another sample set of data. If the determination at step 2516 is NO, the process may loop back to step 2502 . Continuing on to step 2518 , a determination is made as to whether the wave detection counter exceeds a wave count threshold. If the determination is NO, the process loops back to step 2502 . If the determination is YES, a wave may be detected, as indicated by step 2520 .
- the embodiments described herein with respect to a hazard detection system may also be used in any system or device where it is desired to maintain sensing and monitoring of other events while updating the operational capabilities of one of more components of that system or device.
- the other events can include events that are not necessarily tied to hazards such as smoke, CO, and heat, but can include motion detection, sound detection, and the like. Events reported by remote devices may also be taken into account.
- security device such as window and door sensor, and motion detection sensors that provide feedback to a system may quality as other events.
- the processes described with respect to FIGS. 1-25 may each be implemented by software, but may also be implemented in hardware, firmware, or any combination of software, hardware, and firmware. They each may also be embodied as machine- or computer-readable code recorded on a machine- or computer-readable medium.
