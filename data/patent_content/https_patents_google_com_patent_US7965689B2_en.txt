Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to fast cell search, and in particular to a method and apparatus for fast identification of a service cell or sector during initial or periodic access, or handover in a mobile communication system.
- the geographical coverage area is divided into many cells, each of which is served by a base station (BS). Each cell can also be further divided into a number of sectors.
- BS base station
- Each cell can also be further divided into a number of sectors.
- MS mobile station
- the ability to quickly identify a BS to do initial registration or handover is important for reducing the processing complexity and thus lowering the power consumption.
- the cell search function is often performed based on a cell-specific reference signal (or preamble) transmitted periodically.
- a straightforward method is to do an exhaustive search by trying to detect each reference signal and then determine the best BS.
- the reference sequences should allow good channel estimation to all the users within its service area, which is often obtained through a correlation process with the reference of the desired cell.
- a good cross correlation between reference signals is important to minimize the interference effect on channel estimation to the desired cell.
- the cross-correlation between two sequences is a sequence itself corresponding to different relative shifts.
- the cross-correlation at shift-d is defined as the result of summing over all entries after an element-wise multiplication between a sequence and another sequence that is conjugated and shifted by d entries with respect to the first sequence.
- “Good” cross correlation means that the cross correlation values at all shifts are as even as possible so that after correlating with the desired reference sequence, the interference can be evenly distributed and thus the desired channel can be estimated more reliably.
- Minimization of the maximal cross-correlation values at all shifts, which is reached when they are all equal, is refer to as “optimal” cross correlation. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for a fast cell search technique that utilizes a reference sequence having good cross correlation and good auto-correlation.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of communication system 100 that utilizes reference transmissions.
- Communication system 100 utilizes an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) protocol; however in alternate embodiments communication system 100 may utilize other digital cellular communication system protocols such as a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system protocol, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system protocol, a Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) system protocol or a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system protocol, or various combinations thereof.
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access
- FDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access
- SDMA Spatial Division Multiple Access
- TDMA Time Division Multiple Access
- communication system 100 includes base unit 101 and 102 , and remote unit 103 .
- a base unit or a remote unit may also be referred to more generally as a communication unit.
- the remote units may also be referred to as mobile units.
- a base unit comprises a transmit and receive unit that serves a number of remote units within a sector.
- the entire physical area served by the communication network may be divided into cells, and each cell may comprise one or more sectors.
- multiple antennas are used to serve each sector to provide various advanced communication modes (e.g., adaptive beamforming, transmit diversity, transmit SDMA, and multiple stream transmission, etc.)
- These base units within a sector may be highly integrated and may share various hardware and software components.
- Base units 101 and 102 transmit downlink communication signals 104 and 105 to serving remote units on at least a portion of the same resources (time, frequency, or both).
- Remote unit 103 communicates with one or more base units 101 and 102 via uplink communication signal 106 .
- a communication unit that is transmitting may be referred to as a source communication unit.
- a communication unit that is receiving may be referred to as a destination or target communication unit.
- FIG. 1 While only two base units and a single remote unit are illustrated in FIG. 1 , one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that typical communication systems comprise many base units in simultaneous communication with many remote units. It should also be noted that while the present invention is described primarily for the case of downlink transmission from multiple base units to multiple remote units for simplicity, the invention is also applicable to uplink transmissions from multiple remote units to multiple base units. It is contemplated that network elements within communication system 100 are configured in well known manners with processors, memories, instruction sets, and the like, which operate in any suitable manner to perform the function set forth herein.
- base units 101 and 102 transmit reference sequences at known time intervals as part of their downlink transmissions.
- Remote unit 103 knowing the set of sequences that different cells can use and the time interval, utilizes this information in cell search and channel estimation.
- Such a reference transmission scheme is illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- downlink transmissions 200 from base units 101 and 102 typically comprise reference sequence 201 followed by remaining transmission 202 .
- the same or a different sequence can show up one or multiple times during the remaining transmission 202 .
- each base unit within communication system 100 comprises reference channel circuitry 107 that transmits one or more reference sequences along with data channel circuitry 108 transmitting data.
- FIG. 2 shows reference sequence 201 existing at the beginning of a transmission
- the reference channel circuitry may include reference sequence 201 anywhere within downlink transmission 200 , and additionally may be transmitted on a separate channel.
- Remaining transmission 202 typically comprises transmissions such as, but not limited to, sending information that the receiver needs to know before performing demodulation/decoding (so called control information) and actual information targeted to the user (user data).
- communication system 100 utilizes reference sequences constructed from distinct “classes” of chirp sequences with optimal cyclic cross-correlation although in alternate embodiments of the present invention other sequences may be used instead.
- the time domain reference signal is an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbol that is based on N-point FFT.
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
- the spacing of these reference subcarriers is preferably equal (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc. in subcarrier(s)).
- the final reference sequences transmitted in time domain can be cyclically extended where the cyclic extension is typically longer than the expected maximum delay spread of the channel (L D ).
- the final sequence sent has a length equal to the sum of N and the cyclic extension length L CP .
- the cyclic extension can comprise a prefix, postfix, or a combination of a prefix and a postfix.
- the cyclic extension is an inherent part of the OFDM communication system.
- the inserted cyclic prefix makes the ordinary auto- or cross-correlation appear as a cyclic correlation at any shift that ranges from 0 to L CP . If no cyclic prefix is inserted, the ordinary correlation is approximately equal to the cyclic correlation if the shift is much smaller than the reference sequence length.
- the construction of the frequency domain reference sequences depends on at least two factors, namely, a desired number of reference sequences needed in a network (K) and a desired reference length (N p ).
- the number of reference sequences available that has the optimal cyclic cross-correlation is P ⁇ 1 where P is the smallest prime factor of N p other than “1” after factoring N p into the product of two or more prime numbers including “1”.
- the maximum value that P can be is N p ⁇ 1 when N p is a prime number.
- N p is not a prime number
- the number of reference sequences often will be smaller than the desired number K.
- the reference sequence will be constructed by starting with a sequence whose length N G is a prime number and then performing modifications. In the preferred embodiment, one of the following two modifications is used:
- N G ⁇ 1 sequences that has ideal auto correlation and optimal cross correlation.
- N G does not need to be a prime number as long as the smallest prime factor of N G excluding “1” is larger than K.
- GCL sequences are utilized for constructing reference sequences.
- a u ⁇ ( k ) exp ⁇ ( - j ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ( k + 1 ) / 2 + qk N G ) , ( 2 )
- N G -point DFT Discrete Fourier Transform
- IDFT inverse DFT
- the member sequences of the new set also have optimal cyclic cross-correlation and ideal autocorrelation, regardless of whether or not the new set can be represented in the form of (1) and (2).
- sequences formed by applying a matrix transformation on the GCL sequences also have optimal cyclic cross-correlation and ideal autocorrelation as long as the matrix transformation is unitary.
- the N G -point DFT/IDFT operation is equivalent to a size-N G matrix transformation where the matrix is an N G by N G unitary matrix.
- sequences formed based on unitary transformations performed on the GCL sequences still fall within the scope of the invention, because the final sequences are still constructed from GCL sequences. That is, the final sequences are substantially based on (but are not necessarily equal to) the GCL sequences.
- N G is a prime number
- the cross-correlation between any two sequences of distinct “class” is optimal and there will N G ⁇ 1 sequences (“classes”) in the set (see properties below).
- the modified reference sequence can be referred to as nearly-optimal reference sequences that are constructed from GCL sequences.
- the original GCL sequences have the following cross correlation property:
- the reference sequences have a lower peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) than the PAPR of data signals that are also transmitted by a communication unit.
- PAPR peak-to-average ratio
- the low PAPR property of the reference signal enables reference channel circuitry 107 to transmit the reference signal with a higher power than the data in order to provide improved signal-to-noise/interference ratio on the reference signal received by another communication unit, thereby providing improved channel estimation, synchronization, etc.
- Each communication unit may use one or multiple reference sequences any number of times in any transmission interval or a communication unit may use different sequences at different times in a transmission frame. Additionally, each communication unit can be assigned a different reference sequence from the set of K reference sequences that were designed to have nearly-optimal auto correlation and cross correlation properties. One or more communication units may also use one reference sequence at the same time. For example where multiple communication units are used for multiple antennas, the same sequence can be used for each signal transmitted form each antenna. However, the actual signals may be the results of different functions of the same assigned sequence. Examples of the functions applied are circular shifting of the sequence, rotating the phase of the sequence elements, etc.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing the assignment of reference codes to various base units within communication system 100 .
- the logic flow begins at step 301 where a number of needed reference sequences (K), desired reference length (N p ) and a candidate length (N G ) of each reference sequence are determined. Based on N p and N G , the reference sequences are computed (step 303 ). As discussed above, in one embodiment of the present invention the reference sequences are constructed from the Generalized Chirp-Like (GCL) sequences of length N p , with each GCL sequence being defined as shown in equation (1). Finally, at step 305 , the reference sequences are assigned to base units within communication system 100 . It should be noted that each base unit may receive more than one reference sequence from the K available reference sequences.
- GCL Generalized Chirp-Like
- a first base unit is assigned a first reference sequence taken from a group of sequences while a second base unit is assigned a differing reference sequence from the group of sequences.
- the same reference sequence can be assigned to the second base (then a cell can be identified by the combination of the sequence index and the subcarrier offset used).
- reference channel circuitry within each base unit will transmit the reference sequence as part of an overall strategy for coherent demodulation.
- each remote unit within communication with the base units will receive the reference sequence and utilize the reference sequence for many functions, such as channel estimation as part of a strategy for coherent demodulation of the received signal.
- This section shows how cell search can benefit from the above-described reference sequence design. While the detailed description uses an OFDM system with the elements of a sequence being mapped onto OFDM subcarriers for transmission, the invention is also applicable to other configurations, such as a single carrier system where the elements of a sequence are mapped onto different symbol periods or chip periods in the time domain.
- the class index (or sequence index) information “u” is carried in the differential-based vectors.
- the prominent frequency component “u” can be detected which correspond to the indices of the reference sequences.
- the peak position (say n max ) of ⁇ z(n) ⁇ gives information about u, i.e., the mapping between the identified prominent frequency component at n max to a corresponding transmitted sequence index is determined as
- This equation embodies a known, predetermined mapping scheme between the identified prominent frequency component of the sequence and the sequence index.
- the sequence index corresponds with a cell ID for a cell that is the source of the received reference sequence based on the transmitted sequence index.
- the invention is robust to timing and frequency errors because a certain timing or frequency error will not change the frequency component of that differential-based vector.
- the reference sequence is present on a set of subcarriers of an OFDM signal, and each differential-based value is computed between different pairs of subcarriers.
- analyzing/processing the differential-based values to identify a prominent frequency component comprises taking a forward/inverse discrete Fourier transform of at least the differential-based values and identifying a peak in the output of the transform.
- the prominent frequency component can be identified by the location of a peak in the magnitudes of the FFT output.
- Conventional peak detection methods can be used, such as comparing the magnitudes of the samples out of the FFT to a threshold. If there are multiple sequences received, multiple peaks will show up.
- the values “u” used in the system are closely spaced (e.g., adjacent), it is possible for noise or interference to cause the peak to occur close to but not at the same location as was expected for the index “u”.
- By searching in the vicinity of the peak we can identify more than one candidate sequence index for further checking (such as over multiple reference signal transmission periods). For example, results over multiple reference signal transmission periods can be combined, compared, majority voted, etc. to help identify the value or values of “u” that are being received.
- the differential-based vector of the GCL sequences carries the class index information that can be easily detected from the frequency component of the differential-based vector (refer to (6)).
- the differential-based vector may also be obtained from two transmitted OFDM symbols, where each OFDM symbol comprises a plurality of reference subcarriers in frequency. In the first symbol, the sequence ⁇ S G (m) ⁇ is transmitted on the reference subcarriers. In the second symbol, a shifted version of the same sequence ⁇ S G (m) ⁇ may be applied on the same sets of subcarriers (e.g., shifted by one position to denote as ⁇ S G (m+1) ⁇ . Then, a differential vector can be derived from pairs of the frequency data at these two symbols, for each reference subcarrier. Assuming the channel does not change drastically over two OFDM symbol times, the differential vector can be similarly approximated by (6).
- the shifted sequence in the second symbol may occupy subcarriers that are neighbor to the subcarriers used in the first symbol, not necessarily the exactly same subcarriers.
- the two symbols need not be adjacent to each other. In essence, as long as the channel variation between the two frequency-time locations does not change too fast, the differential vector can approximate the differential of sequence reasonably well. The class index can then be detected easily.
- shifting by one position is the preferred implementation, shifting by two positions can also be used, noting the fact that
- FIG. 4 shows a flow chart of the fast cell search method (base station identification) within a communication unit 103 .
- the logic flow begins at step 401 where a reference sequence is received and differential-based value between each of a plurality of pairs of elements of the received signal is computed. As discussed above, the differential-based vector computed approximate the phase ramp information shown in (6).
- the differential-based vector is analyzed/processed to identify one or more prominent frequency components. Finally, the location of the identified frequency components will be mapped to a corresponding index of the transmitted sequence (step 403 ) and corresponding base station identity.
- the sequence index corresponds with a cell ID that is the source of the received signal.

- the transmitted sequence indices map to a particular base station that is the source of the received signal.
- FIG. 6 shows a flowchart for the case of detecting multiple sequences using the method of cancellation to improve the reliability of detecting the indices of weak sequences.
- Step 601 estimates a channel response related to the first known reference sequence (e.g., the first known reference sequence can be used a pilot to estimate the channel, or other known pilots may be used for channel estimation).
- Step 603 reconstructs and remove the portion of the received signal due to the first known sequence and the estimated channel response to provide a modified received reference sequence (e.g., the portion of the received signal due to the first reference signal can be computed and subtracted).
- Step 605 computes a differential-based value between each of a plurality of pairs of elements of the modified received reference sequence.
- Step 607 analyzes/processes the differential-based values to identify a prominent frequency component.
- Step 609 identifies the index of the second reference sequence based on the prominent frequency component.
- FIG. 7 shows a flowchart for an additional embodiment of the invention.
- a communication unit such as a mobile unit receives a reference sequence transmitted by a source communication unit (such as a BS), wherein the sequence transmitted by the source communication unit has a phase ramp characteristic corresponding to a sequence index used by the source communication unit (for example, the phase ramp characteristic of a GCL-based reference signal of a particular index can be derived from equation 2).
- the received reference sequence is analyzed/processed to extract its phase ramp characteristic, and in step 705 , the extracted phase ramp characteristic is used as a basis for determining the sequence index, and hence the transmitter of the signal. For example, each sequence index “u” in equation 2 has its own phase ramp characteristic.
- FIG. 8 is a block diagram of a remote unit.
- the remote unit comprises differential-based value calculation circuitry 801 to compute differential-based values between each of a plurality of pairs of elements of the reference sequence.
- Analyzing/processing circuitry 802 is included for analyzing/processing the differential-based values to identify a prominent frequency component.

Mapping circuitry 803 additionally identifies a base station based on the transmitted sequence index.

- k=0, 1, . . . NG−1 are the indices of the entries in a sequence,
- q=any integer.
Each class of GCL sequence can have infinite number of sequences depending on the particular choice of q and b, but only one sequence out of each class is used to construct one reference sequence. Notice that each class index “u” produces a different phase ramp characteristic over the elements of the sequence (i.e., over the “k” values).
Z(m)=Y(m)*conj(Y(m+1)),m=1, . . ., N p−1, (3)
- where “conj( )” denotes conjugation;
- Z(m) is the “differential-based” value computed from the mth and (1+m)th reference subcarriers;
- Y(m) is the frequency domain data at the mth reference subcarrier;
- m is the index of the reference subcarrier; and
- Np is the length of the reference sequence.
Z(m)=Y(m)/Y(m+1),m=1, . . . , N p−1, (4)
or
Z(m)=Y(m)/Y(m+1)/abs(Y(m)/Y(m+1)),m=1, N p−1, (5)
where “abs( )” denotes the absolute value. Each of these example methods for obtaining differential-based values provides information about the phase difference between input values, and some provide signal amplitude information as well, which can be helpful in fading channel conditions.
{z(n)}=IFFT T({Z(m)}),m=1, . . . , N p−1, n=1, . . . ,T. (7)
The peak position (say nmax) of {z(n)} gives information about u, i.e., the mapping between the identified prominent frequency component at nmax to a corresponding transmitted sequence index is determined as
-
- The scrambling code for S-SCH is pseudo random sequence such as PN sequence;
- The scrambling code index for S-SCH1 is a cell common scrambling code, in other words, a scrambling code used only by a particular cell;
- The scrambling code index for S-SCH2 is determined based on the S-SCH1 sequence index; and
- The number of the scrambling codes for S-SCH2 is same as number of S-SCH1 sequences.
