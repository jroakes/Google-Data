Embodiment
As described below, ASR engine can make the region (such as room) residing for language based on user in building (family of such as user), speech recognition modeling is partial to, or selects diverse speech recognition modeling.This can relate to some features.The first, client device is between floors installed and/or responder system is used to the position estimating them when user moves between floors and makes language.The second, during the training stage, ASR engine use location independent voice model of cognition performs speech recognition, and collects transcribing of language from throughout each position of building.3rd, transcribe and can be used to generate position related voice model of cognition, this position related voice model of cognition can be used to perform speech recognition subsequently.In some respects, can combine to generate the position related voice model of cognition be polymerized by from multiple user and/or transcribing of multiple building.Such as, transcribing of the multiple language be in or near the kitchen being positioned at each building can be combined to generate kitchen special sound model of cognition.
As used in the disclosure, position related voice model of cognition is the model being partial to the theme relevant to the given area of building, word, noise and/or acoustic feature (signature).The region used in the disclosure refers to the funtion part (such as kitchen, dining room, bedroom, parlor, toilet, office) of building.In different buildings, the region (such as kitchen) of identical type can be of different sizes and acoustic characteristic (such as reverberation), but can the noise characteristic of share similar and vocabulary.Such as, the kitchen in an apartment, Room may have different acoustic characteristics compared with the kitchen in large single-family housing, but still can have common noise and semantic topic.Therefore, the position correlation model be associated to cooking area can comprise the word relevant with the noise (such as microwave oven, blender, dishwasher etc.) of cooking theme and/or the most often find in kitchen with food.Position independent voice model of cognition is the model of any specific region not being partial to house.
In addition, in the disclosure, the phrase that people says is called as language.Generally speaking, language can comprise one or more word.Language can represent any voice communication type, such as (such as in order to operate domestic automation system) voice-based instruction, order or action, voice-based search inquiry, oral account (dictation), conversational system or use the voice through transcribing or call any other input of the software application using the voice through transcribing to perform an action.
Fig. 1 a shows the example system 100 generating position related voice model of cognition and use location related voice model of cognition execution speech recognition.Fig. 1 a also show the data flow of speech recognition when performing in processor system 102.With reference to Fig. 1 a, the generality first described for performing audio recognition method describes, and then provides more detailed description.
Initially, in fig 1 a, when user 102 is arranged in parlor 120, user 102 makes language 104 (i.e. " apple and spices ").Such as, user 102 can have domestic automation system, this domestic automation system controls the entertainment systems comprising music player (such as MP3 player) in parlor, and user 102 can intend broadcasting and be called " collection of choice " special edition of " apple & spices " band.In response to this language, language 104 is encoded into audio signal by client device 106, and obtains position mark by the signal detected from radio transponder 112.Audio signal and position mark (such as the identifier of radio transponder 112) are then sent to treatment system 108 via network 110 by client device 106.Treatment system 108 performs the ASR engine 116 that have received position mark and audio signal.
Assuming that ASR engine 116 is trained, position determines that assembly 130 access location marks, and obtains the estimated position of user 102 when saying language.In the present embodiment, because position determines that assembly 130 receives the identifier of radio transponder 110 (being associated with parlor), therefore position determines that assembly 130 can export the estimated position corresponding with parlor 120.Then this estimated position is output to acoustic model maker 134 and language model maker 140.The position associated acoustic models be associated with region, parlor selected by acoustic model maker 134 from the set 136 of acoustic model.The position relational language model 142b be also associated with region, parlor selected by language model maker 140 from the set 142 of language model.
Then ASR engine 116 uses selected acoustic model 132 and language model 138 audio signal corresponding to language 104 to be converted to and transcribes.In this case, the language model for parlor 142b comprises phrase " apple & spices ", and ASR engine 116 is identified as the optimum Match for language 104.Such as, language model 142b in parlor can pass through user media storehouse (such as film, music, TV programme, video-game etc.) and programmes.It should be noted that word " apple " and " spices " are also in the language model for kitchen 142a, this may cause ambiguity when not adding contextual information.Advantageously, because ASR engine 116 makes the selection position-based of language model mark, this shows when saying language, and user 102 is in parlor 120 instead of in kitchen 122, so ASR engine 116 easily can solve ambiguity.
Finally, ASR engine 116 can be passed on via output precision 144 and transcribe " apple & spices ".Such as, output precision 144 can provide the interface going to the media player control program performed on processor system 108, and media player can be made conversely to wait in line " collection of choice of apple & spices " special edition for playback.
In more detail, user 102 is arranged in the building (such as in the family of user) with multiple region (such as parlor 120 and kitchen 122).When in parlor 102, user 102 says (such as " apple and spices ") in language 104 to client device 106.Client device 106 is under control of the user and can by network request and the electronic equipment receiving resource.Client device (its example comprises the equipment of Fig. 1 a and 1b) can comprise one or more treatment facility, and can be or comprise mobile phone (such as smart phone), laptop computer, handheld computer, flat computer, the network equipment, camera, strengthen GPRS (EGPRS) mobile phone, media player, navigator, electronic mail equipment, wearable computer, game console, interactive or so-called " intelligence " TV, or the combination of two or more these data processing equipments any or other data processing equipments.
User 102 can record language 104, such as by pressing client device 106 on button initiated before speaking talk with, say this, language, and then release mobile device on button.In another example, client device 106 can be activated by the language of speaker.In another example, user can select the user interface on client device 106 to control (such as microphone icon) before saying language.As another example, microphone can be activated before user speaks, or can be in " opening (always on) all the time " state, allowed user not need manual actuation microphone just can speak.Such as, client device can use continuous record buffer.
Then client device 106 converts the language 104 of user to a series of audio signal (such as sample or waveform), this audio signal can be such as two seconds (or more) fragment of relative high quality audio frequency (such as 16kHz lossless audio).Such as, client device 106 can create audio files or data flow when recording language.In addition, in response to receiving language 104, client device 106 initiates the process of the position mark in the region in order to obtain the building be uttered for wherein language.The position mark of disclosure indication is the data of the relative possibility that index signal obtains from ad-hoc location.
In some implementations, the example such as illustrated in fig 1 a, position mark can for describing the data (such as radio transponder identifier and signal strength signal intensity) of the radio signal sent from radio transponder, and this radio signal received by the client device of the specific region being arranged in building.Such as, as described below, radio transponder 130 can be positioned in the regional of building.Radio transponder can be any suitable short range radio system, such as bluetooth, near-field communication (NFC) or WiFi.
Radio transponder can be installed in the regional of building, and is then associated with the respective regions in building.Such as, radio transponder 112 can be associated with region, parlor 120, and radio transponder 114 can be associated with cooking area 122.Can use any suitable means that radio transponder is associated with the zones of different of building.Such as, treatment system 108 can provide interface, each radio transponder can be labeled as in the room (such as kitchen, parlor, bedroom, office, dining room, bathroom) being in particular category to make user.In some implementations, treatment system 108 can present network interface, and by network interface, user can carry out via web browser alternately.In other respects, can via the graphical user interface access processor system 108 on client device 106, the Mobile solution that this graphical user interface such as performs on a client device.
Once language 104 is encoded into audio signal by client device 106, and obtain the position mark in the region be used in the wherein building that is uttered of language, audio signal and position mark are just sent to treatment system 108 via network 110 by client device.In some implementations, client device 106 can set up the communication session with treatment system 108, and during session, audio signal and position mark is sent to treatment system 108.In alternative implementation, client device 106 periodically (such as every 30 seconds, every 1 minute, every 5 minutes) obtains and sends position mark, and no matter whether receives language.In other implementations, client device 106 can send position mark when client device 106 recognizes change, this Change Example in this way client device detects: the radio transponder identifier that (i) is new, (ii) relative signal intensity of radio transponder changes, or (iii) radio transponder has stopped being detected.In such implementation, the change of position mark can show that client 106 has been repositioned onto the zones of different in building.
Treatment system 108 receives the audio signal corresponding with language and position mark, and this audio signal and position mark are for performing speech recognition and/or training position related voice model of cognition.Treatment system 108 can be one or more computing equipment (such as comprising the server of one or more processor and computer-readable recording medium), and this computing equipment uses ASR engine 116 that speech conversion is become text, and other abilities.ASR engine 116 can be larded speech with literary allusions this input/output of software simulating for processed voice.Such as, ASR engine 116 can be the software code in such as storehouse, platform, software development kit or object.
Treatment system 108 can be physically located in the building identical with user 102 or remotely locate.Therefore network 110 can comprise one or more network.Network can provide communication under various modes or protocols, such as global system for mobile communications (GSM) voice call, Short Message Service (SMS), enhancing messenger service (EMS), MMS (Multimedia Message Service) (MMS) message, code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) (WCDMA), CDMA2000, general packet radio (GPRS) or one or more TV or cable system, and other.Such as, communication can be occurred by radio-frequency (RF) transceiver.In addition, such as bluetooth, WiFi or other such transceiver generation junction services can be used.In addition, in some implementations, one in the treatment system 108 described by the disclosure, several or all functions can perform by client device 106.
ASR engine 116 can operate in training mode and operator scheme two kinds of patterns.In training mode, ASR engine 116:(i) use location (such as without the deflection) speech recognition modeling that has nothing to do performs speech recognition; (ii) collect make language transcribe the data relevant with the position wherein making language, train position related voice model of cognition.In operator scheme, ASR engine 116 uses housebroken position related voice model of cognition to perform speech recognition.But in some implementations, ASR engine 116 continues training position related voice model of cognition in operator scheme.ASR engine 116 can be determined to operate in which pattern based on some inputs.Such as, user 102 can be prompted as carrying out preference pattern via the interface with treatment system 108.Alternatively or additionally, ASR engine 116 can comprise predetermined threshold for switching between modes (word identified of the given number in the language of the given number in such as given area or given area).In some implementations, the external trainer data that can trigger ASR engine 116 switch mode can be provided to ASR engine 116.Such as, ASR engine 116 can receive housebroken position related voice model of cognition from application server, and the position related voice model of cognition from multiple building and user assembled by this application server.
ASR engine 116 comprises for performing voice to text conversion and the multiple assembly (such as software module or storehouse) of training position related voice model of cognition.Specifically, assembly 130 is determined in the position that ASR engine 116 comprises client device 106 position estimated when making language 104.Position determines that estimated position is exported to acoustic model maker 134 and language model maker 140 by assembly 130.During training mode, the language for other room various types of collected by acoustic model maker 134, upgrades the set 136 of acoustic model.In addition, acoustic model maker 134 can provide position to have nothing to do acoustic model for execution speech recognition.During operator scheme, acoustic model maker 134 generates position associated acoustic models 132 according to the set 136 of acoustic model.During training mode, the language for other room various types of collected by language model maker 140, upgrades the set 142 of language model.In addition, language model maker 140 can provide position to have nothing to do acoustic model for execution speech recognition.During operator scheme, language model maker 140 generates position relational language model 140 according to the set 142 of language model.ASR engine 116 uses acoustic model 132 and language model 138 to transcribe the audio signal from language 104 to be converted to.Then output precision 144 exports and transcribes, such as, export another assembly (such as domestic automation system) of client device 106 or treatment system 108 to.
In more detail, position determines that assembly 130 position-based mark (signal such as found from radio transponder) estimates the position of the client device 106 when making language.Such as, client device 106 may detect radio transponder 112, therefore position mark can comprise corresponding radio transponder identifier (such as " transponder 1 "), in some implementations, also can be the signal strength signal intensity (such as-60dBm) of radio transponder.Therefore, position determines that assembly 130 can determine that client device 106 is in region, parlor 120 when language 104 is uttered.
In some implementations, client device 106 may detect more than one transponder, and the signal weighting from multiple transponder can be come estimated position.Such as, client device 106 may detect the signal from two radio transponders, and determines the signal strength signal intensity (such as received signal strength indicator device (RSSI)) of received signal.The position mark of description two signals can be sent to treatment system 108 by client device 106, and treatment system 108 can utilize the relative mistake between signal strength signal intensity to estimate the position of the client device 106 when making language.
Such as, assuming that client device 106 detects the signal from radio transponder 112 and radio transponder 114.Client device 106 can determine that the signal from radio transponder 112 has the RSSI of-60dBm, and has the RSSI of-63dBm from the signal of radio transponder 114.Because the signal intensity ratio of radio transponder 112 is from the many 3dB of signal of radio transponder 114, therefore this shows it is two dual intensities of the signal from radio transponder 114 from the signal of radio transponder 112, and transponder 112 may than transponder 114 closer to client device 106.Therefore, position determines that the position (such as cooking area 122) that the weight ratio of the position (such as region, parlor 120) that assembly 130 can make to be associated with transponder 112 is associated with transponder 114 is heavy.The probability that these weights can be uttered in the region be associated corresponding to this language or possibility.Therefore, use the weighting based on relative signal intensity, position mark can show that the possibility in the region 67% that wherein language is uttered is parlor, and the possibility of 33% is kitchen.Following table 1 shows the position mark according to this example.
Table 1
Position determines that then the output of assembly 130 can be used for generating statistical model for performing speech recognition, or is used for training utterance model of cognition.Generally speaking, ASR engine 116 Using statistics model carrys out processed voice.ASR engine 116 can use acoustic model 132 for audio signal to generate sub-word sequence.Such as, acoustic model may be implemented as hidden Markov model (HMM) or gauss hybrid models (GMM).In some respects, as described below, ASR engine 116 can use and mark by acoustic model maker 134 position-based the composite acoustic model generated.To describe in more detail below, acoustic model maker 134 is assemblies that receiving position determination assembly 130 exports, and it generates acoustic model according to acoustic model 136 storehouse, and exports acoustic model and use for ASR engine 116.In training mode, acoustic model maker 134 can train position associated acoustic models.
ASR engine 116 uses sub-word sequence from acoustic model 132 as the input to language model 138.Language model 138 processes sub-word sequence to determine one or more words of the sub-word sequence of optimum Match.Such as, sub-word sequence and the vocabulary be included in language model 138 can compare by ASR engine 116.In some respects, as described below, ASR engine 116 can use and mark by language model maker 140 position-based the compound language model generated.To describe in more detail below, language model maker 140 is assemblies of the output of receiving position determination assembly 130, and it is according to the set production language model of language model 142a, 142b, and output language model uses for ASR engine 116.In training mode, language model maker 140 can train position relational language model.
Once ASR engine 116 generates transcribing of language 104, output precision 144 just routes to suitable system by transcribing.In some implementations, output precision 144 can send it back client device 106 by transcribing.In other implementations, output precision 144 can will transcribe another assembly being sent to and performing in treatment system 108, such as, domestic automation system, voice-based search service, oral account application, text processing application or use voice through transcribing or call any other application of the software application using the voice through transcribing to perform an action.In some implementations, transcribing of the language of speaker can be submitted to search service by output precision 144.Search service carrys out recognition resource by the resource captured or on index website, content publisher provides.Index can be carried out to the data about resource based on the resource that data are corresponding with it.Such as, in response to search inquiry, coupling input keyword resource through index and can be retrieved through the copy of high-speed cache and be output alternatively.
With reference to figure 1b, in some implementations, the position of user 102 when microphone array instead of radio transponder can be used to determine to say language.Exemplarily, in the system 150 of Fig. 1 b, when user 102 is arranged in parlor 120, user 102 makes language 104 (i.e. " apple and spices ").But the speech detection equipment 160 be arranged in parlor 120 detects language 104, instead of client device is used to detect language.Speech detection equipment 160 converts language 104 to audio signal, and then, audio signal and position mark (the such as identifier of speech detection equipment 160 and/or the sound pressure level of language) are sent to treatment system 108 via network 110 by it.Treatment system 108 is performing ASR engine 116, ASR engine 116 and is converting language 104 to " collection of choice of apple & spices " corresponding voice command as carried out operating above.

User 102 can initiate language 104, such as, before speaking, initiate dialogue by the button on pressing speech detection equipment 160,162, say language, then release-push.In another example, speech detection equipment 160 can be activated by the language of speaker.In another example, microphone can be spoken user and is activated, or can be in " opening all the time " state, does not need manual actuation microphone just can speak to allow user.Such as, client device can use continuous print record buffer.
Speech detection equipment 160,162 converts the language 104 of user to a series of audio signal (such as sample or waveform), this series of audio signal can be such as two seconds (or more) fragment of relative high quality audio frequency (such as 16kHz lossless audio).Such as, speech detection equipment 160,162 can create audio files or data flow when recording language.
In addition, in response to receiving language 104, speech detection equipment 160,162 obtains position mark.Position mark can comprise the data of the identifier describing speech detection equipment, and/or the sound pressure level (such as dB re 20 μ PaRMS) of the language received at speech detection equipment place.Such as, assuming that speech detection equipment 160 detects that sound pressure level is the language 104 of 60dB.Assuming that speech detection equipment 162 also detects language 104, but sound pressure level is 57dB.Because the sound pressure level at speech detection equipment 160 place 3dB more than the sound pressure level at speech detection equipment 162 place, this shows that the sound pressure level at speech detection equipment 160 place is two dual intensities of the sound pressure level at speech detection equipment 162 place, and show, language 104 may be made closer to speech detection equipment 160 compared with speech detection equipment 162.Therefore, position determines that the position (such as cooking area 122) that the weight ratio of the position (such as region, parlor 120) that assembly 130 can make to be associated with speech detection equipment 160 is associated with speech detection equipment 162 is heavy.The probability that these weights can be uttered in associated area corresponding to language or possibility.Therefore, use the weighting based on relative sound pressure levels, position mark can show that the possibility in the region 67% of language is parlor, and the possibility of 33% is kitchen.Following table 2 shows the position mark according to this example.
Table 2
In some implementations, language itself can be used, instead of use the identifier of radio transponder or speech detection equipment to be used as position mark.Such as, client device 106 or speech detection equipment 160,162 can generate the audio signal corresponding to language 104, and send it to treatment system 108.ASR engine 116 may generate one or more candidate transcription of language 104 by independent voice model of cognition in use location subsequently.Then, the phrase in candidate transcription and one or more positions relational language model can compare by ASR engine 116.The region be associated with best match position relational language model can be used as the estimated position making language 104 subsequently.Such as, if transcribing of use location independent voice model is " apple & spices ", and this phrase is only found in the language model of kitchen, then position can be confirmed as kitchen.If phrase is found in multiple language model, the probability that then location estimation can occur based on word is weighted the region be associated, to generate through location estimation (such as 33% kitchen of weighting, 67% parlor), or the region be associated with the language model having maximum probability for this word can be selected as estimated position.
Fig. 2 shows the assembly generating and obtain the sample ASR engine for the position associated acoustic models used in speech recognition.Specifically, this assembly comprises position-based mark provides the position of estimated position to determine assembly 130 to acoustic model maker 134.Acoustic model maker 134 uses estimated position to select from the set 136 of acoustic model or generate acoustic model, or, in training mode, the acoustic model in the set 136 of training acoustic model.The set 136 of acoustic model stores position associated acoustic models, comprises kitchen acoustic model 208, office's acoustic model 210, bedroom acoustic model 212 and parlor acoustic model 214.
As mentioned above, client device or speech detection equipment provide position mark to treatment system 108, and treatment system 108 stores data in suitable memory.Position determines that the position mark 202 stored accessed by assembly 130, and where is generated estimated position by making between floors for the language be associated.Specifically, construction zone mapper component 204 (such as software library or function) resolves position mark to generate estimated position.Estimated position can for language in various classification room by the form of the possibility made or probability.Estimated position can be output in any suitable data structure, such as, and object or one group of variable.
Such as, assumed position mark only comprises (such as radio transponder and/or speech detection equipment) identifier.Then, building mapper 204 can generate the estimated position in building based on the region be associated with identifier.Therefore, if position mark comprises the identifier of the radio transponder 112 be associated with region, parlor 120, then estimated position may be 1.0 parlors.
Assumed position mark comprises two identifiers.The region that built-up area domain mapping 204 can be associated with identifier based on interpolation then generates the estimated position in building.Therefore, if position mark comprises the identifier for the radio transponder 112 be associated with region, parlor 120, and the identifier of radio transponder 114 for being associated with cooking area 122, then estimated position may be 0.5 parlor and 0.5 kitchen.
Further assumed position mark comprises two identifiers and corresponding signal strength signal intensity (RSSI at such as radio transponder place or the sound pressure level at speech detection equipment place).The region that construction zone mapper 204 can be associated based on interpolation and identifier generates the estimated position in building together with the weighting based on relative signal intensity.Therefore, if position mark comprises the identifier of radio transponder 112 for being associated with region, parlor 120 and the RSSI of-60dBm, and for the identifier of radio transponder 114 that is associated with cooking area 122 and the RSSI of-63dBm, then estimated position may be 0.67 parlor and 0.33 kitchen.Notice based on signal strength signal intensity, this determines that the example of estimated position is for illustrative purposes, and implementation can comprise the accuracy more coming improved estimator position through fine setting and meticulous model.In addition, although describe only from two source receiving position marks for exemplary purpose, in implementation, position mark can receive from the source of any number.
After receiving estimated position, acoustic model maker 134 performs and depends on that ASR engine 116 still carries out the operation operated in operator scheme in training mode.In training mode, acoustic model maker 134 receives training data (audio signal of language such as being associated with position mark), and trains the one or more acoustic models be stored in the set 136 of acoustic model.In addition, acoustic model maker provide position have nothing to do acoustic model for execution speech recognition in use.In operator scheme, acoustic model maker 134 obtains (such as select or generate) position associated acoustic models based on estimated position and uses in execution speech recognition.
The set 136 of acoustic model can be stored in file structure (such as NFS) or database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB) in, or can be processed in any other suitable data structure of system 108 access.In some implementations, treatment system 108 can store via network service and access the set 136 of the acoustic model stored, network service such as declarative state transitions (REST) form service.
Acoustic model in set 136 can be filled with the housebroken acoustic model before mated with the various acoustic spaces that user runs into usually at first.In training mode, acoustic model maker 134 receives the audio signal be associated with language, and makes the determination of the acoustic model stored before whether corresponding acoustic space mates.Analyzing audio signal can provide the information of the acoustic characteristic about surrounding space.Those characteristics can comprise the size in room, noise source and reverberation characteristic, and noise source is such as ventilation duct or exterior window.
If acoustic space does not mate with the acoustic model stored before, then acoustic model maker 134 can initialization also adaptive new acoustic model.Based on the size of surrounding space, acoustic model maker 134 can also adjust acoustic model to consider reverberation.Various method can be used to complete this adjustment, comprise the self adaptation that uses a model, such as, maximum likelihood for known target linearly returns.Target conversion can estimated when this position runs into before, or can infer from the reverberation time joined with space correlation.Once position is by modeling fully, then acoustic model maker 134 stores acoustic model in the set of acoustic model 136.
In operator scheme, when ASR engine 116 performs speech recognition, the position associated acoustic models identified by location estimation selected by acoustic model maker 134.Such as, if it is probably the region wherein making language that location estimation identifies parlor 120 and kitchen 122, then, acoustic model maker 134 selects parlor acoustic model 214 and kitchen acoustic model 208.
Then, acoustic model maker 134 uses selected position associated acoustic models to generate acoustic model.Specifically, composite acoustic model 220 can be associated with one or more basic acoustic model 222, basis acoustic model 222 is corresponding to the acoustic model be stored in the set 136 of acoustic model, and the contact between composite acoustic model 220 and basic acoustic model 222 can be weighted.In some implementations, the summation from the weight of the contact of a composite acoustic model can be 1 or be normalized to 1.
Acoustic model maker 134 can use any suitable technology to merge basic acoustic model to form composite acoustic model.Such as, assuming that the set of hidden Markov model (HMM) that comprises Gaussian Profile and be associated of each acoustic model.Acoustic model maker 134 can use the weight based on estimated position, generates composite acoustic model by mapping Gaussian Profile and HMM.Therefore, if estimated position is 0.67 parlor and 0.33 kitchen, then can map Gaussian Profile and HMM to generate composite acoustic model, this composite acoustic model has the Gaussian Profile and HMM that weight is the parlor acoustic model 214 of 67%, and weight is Gaussian Profile and the HMM of the kitchen acoustic model 208 of 33%.
Although should be appreciated that and show composite acoustic model 220, basic acoustic model 222 and the given number contacted and configuration, other numbers and configuration are also feasible.Such as, enough composite acoustic models 220 can be there is, make the associated composite acoustic model 220 of each combination tool through weighting of basic acoustic model 222.In some instances, composite acoustic model can be associated with more or less basic acoustic model 222.In some implementations, contact weights different between composite acoustic model 220 and basic acoustic model 222 can be there is, such as positive integer, probability or dimension distance (W in such as space-time, X, Y, Z value).
In some implementations, composite acoustic model 220 can be created as required, such as, when receiving the location estimation not corresponding with the acoustic model stored before.Composite acoustic model 220 can by sustainable existence in the addressable memory construction of acoustic model maker 134 by being stored in.In some implementations, multiple possible composite acoustic model 220 can by pre-generatmg.Such as, this when pretreatment time is available, and/or can be used when expection has during little basic acoustic model 222.
Fig. 3 a and 3b shows and generates and obtain the assembly of position relational language model for the sample ASR engine used in speech recognition.Specifically, assembly 130 is determined in the position that this assembly comprises the estimated position providing position-based to mark to language model maker 140.Language model maker 140 uses estimated position to select or production language model from the set 142 of language model, or, in training mode, the language model in the set 142 of train language model.
In fig. 3 a, the set memory location relational language model of language model 142, comprises kitchen language model 142a, parlor language model 142b, office language model 142c and bedroom language model 142d.As shown in the figure, kitchen language model 142a comprises to food and cooks relevant word, such as " mixer ", " apple " and " baking box "; Parlor language model 142b comprises the media word relevant with amusement, such as " TV ", " film " and " music "; Office language model 142c comprises the relevant word of office, such as " mail ", " fax " and " oral account "; Such as, and bedroom language model 142d comprises the relevant word of sleep, " alarm clock ", " sleep " and " light ".
In fig 3b, the set 142 of language model stores kernel language model 160 and the various theme particular language model 162,164,166 relevant respectively to network browsing, media and food.Each theme can be associated with one or more region, and one or more theme particular language model in kernel language model and theme particular language model can be used to generate compound language model.As shown in the figure, the general word that kernel language model 160 comprises with building control, such as " light ", " air-conditioning " and " heating " are associated, network browsing language model 162 comprises such as the word of " shopping ", " news " and " famous person "; And medias selection model 164 comprises such as the word of " TV ", " film " and " music "; And food language model 166 comprises such as the word of " puffed rice ", " apple " and " baking box ".
As mentioned above, position determines that assembly 130 provides estimated position.After receiving estimated position, language model maker 140 depends on that ASR engine 116 still carries out operation in training mode and carrys out executable operations in operator scheme.In training mode, language model maker 140 receives training data (what such as use the position free language model be associated with position mark to make transcribes), and trains the one or more language models be stored in the set 142 of language model.In addition, language model maker provides position free language model to use in execution speech recognition.In operator scheme, language model maker 140 obtains (such as select or generate) position relational language model based on estimated position and uses in execution speech recognition.
The set 142 of language model can be stored in file structure (such as MySQL in (such as NFS) or database, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB), or can be processed system 108 access any other suitable data structure in.In some implementations, treatment system 108 can store via network service and access the set 142 of the language model stored, network service such as declarative state transitions (REST) form service.
Language model in set 142 can with comprise the everyday words corresponding with the classification of room or theme before the language model of training fill.Such as, third party's network service can combine from transcribing in multiple user and/or multiple building, thus generates the polymerization site relational language model in the room (such as kitchen, parlor, office, bedroom) being used for potential classification.In addition, can have by reference to user for the language model in some classification rooms in perhaps product fill.Such as, the language model of the room class for having media player (such as parlor or bedroom) filled in ASR engine 116 theme may accessed from the media library (such as film, music, TV programme, video-game etc.) of user.Similar technology may be used for filling the specific language model of theme.In training mode, what language model maker 140 reception was associated with estimated position transcribes, and uses from the word of transcribing to train corresponding position relational language model and/or theme particular language model.
With reference to the example system of figure 3a, in operator scheme, the position relational language model identified by location estimation selected by language model maker 140.Such as, if location estimation identifies parlor 120 and kitchen 122 probably for making the region of language, then parlor language model 142a and kitchen language model 142b selected by language model maker 140.
Then, language model maker 140 uses selected position relational language model generation language model.Specifically, compound language model 320 can be associated with one or more basic language model 322, basic language model 322 is corresponding to the language model be stored in the set 140 of language model, and the contact between compound language model 320 and basic language model 322 can be weighted.In some instances, the summation from the weight of the contact of a compound language model can be 1 or can be normalized to 1.

In the second step, language model maker 140 uses selected region particular language model to generate position related compound language model, and region particular language model is identified in the location estimation determining assembly 130 from position.Specifically, compound language model 330 can be associated with the one or more regions particular language model 332 be generated in a first step.Contact between compound language model 330 and region particular language model 332 can be weighted.In some instances, the summation from the weight of the contact of a compound language model can be 1 or be normalized to 1.
Although show compound language model 330, region particular language model 332, theme particular language model 334 and the given number contacted and configuration, other numbers and configuration are also feasible.Such as, enough compound language models 330 can be there is, each combination through weighting of region particular language model 332 is had and the compound language model 330 contacted.In some instances, compound language model can be associated with more or less region particular language model 332.In some instances, contact weights different between compound language model 330 and region particular language model 332 can be there is, such as positive integer, probability or dimension distance (W in such as space-time, X, Y, Z value).
In some implementations, compound language model 330 can be created as required, such as, when receiving the location estimation not corresponding with the language model stored before.Compound language model 330 can by sustainable existence in the addressable memory construction of language model maker 140 by being stored in.In some implementations, multiple possible compound language model 330 can by pre-generatmg.Such as, this be used in pretreatment time available time, and/or when expection has during little region particular language model 332 and used.
Language model maker 140 can use any suitable technology combined language model.Such as, assuming that each language model comprises the counting (such as frequency) be associated of word and each word.Language model maker 140 can use counting consolidation strategy, such as maximum a posteriori (MAP) self adaptation.Such counting consolidation strategy can generate the Probability p (w|h) of word, as shown in formula (1) below:
In formula (1), hw is the N unit syntax ending in the word w with context h, c1 (hw) and c2 (hw) is respectively the counting of hw in the first and second language models, and x controls the constant of each language model corpus to the contribution of the language model of combination.
Alternatively, language model maker 140 can use language model joint strategy generating compound language model.This can generate the probability of word, in formula (2) below, p (w): p (w)=max (xp has been shown
1(w), (1-x) p
2(w)) (2)
In formula (2), p
1(w) and p
2w () is respectively the probability of w in first and second language model, x controls the constant of each language model corpus to the contribution of the language model of combination.
