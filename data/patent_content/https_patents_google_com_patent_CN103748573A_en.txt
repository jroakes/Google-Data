In some embodiments, (the location advertising data 214 that provided by Advertisement Server B210 comprise mutual trace data, the code section that utilizes it to follow the trail of user interactions), it is used for following the trail of and the user interactions of selected advertisement by Advertisement Server B210.For example, Advertisement Server B210 can win card code section in location advertising data 214, in response to the user interactions of selected advertisement, the resource (resource that for example, the advertiser of advertisement links advertisement with it) that this code section links with it in the selected advertisement of request makes subscriber equipment 106 be redirected to Advertisement Server B210 before.The mutual trace data of Advertisement Server B210 also can be included in ad content request 216, and/or as described below with Advertisement Server D218(or another Advertisement Server) ad content of the selected advertisement that provides comprises.
In response to receiving ad content request 216, Advertisement Server D218 locates the ad content of selected advertisement.For example, Advertisement Server D218 can be used the identifier access that is included in ad content request 216 or queries ad content-data storage 222 with acquisition ad content 220.And then Advertisement Server D218 provides ad content 220 to subscriber equipment 106.Provide to the ad content 220 of subscriber equipment 106 and can comprise code section, in response to the user interactions of advertisement, this code section makes subscriber equipment propose for example, request for this advertisement resource associated therewith (another resource that, gray webpage or ad content 220 are quoted) of prize.For example, ad content 220 can be specified the URL that the advertiser of selected advertisement webpage is provided, to make as described in more detail below, in response to the request of initiating with the user interactions of selected advertisement for webpage.
In some embodiments, Advertisement Server D218 comprises mutual trace data together with ad content 220, and it is used for following the trail of and the user interactions of selected advertisement by Advertisement Server D218.For example, Advertisement Server D218 can comprise code section at ad content 220, in response to the user interactions of selected advertisement, this advertisement part makes subscriber equipment be redirected to Advertisement Server D218.Advertisement Server D218 can also comprise the mutual trace data for Advertisement Server B210 together with ad content 220.Therefore, as described in more detail below, provide to the ad content 220 of subscriber equipment 106 and can comprise the mutual trace data for Advertisement Server B210 and Advertisement Server D218, with make in response to the user interactions of selected advertisement, subscriber equipment 106 is redirected to Advertisement Server D218 and Advertisement Server B210 before at directed publisher's server (or another server) that can obtain the resource that selected advertisement links with it from it.
Fig. 2 B is redirected and the block diagram of the sample data flow process 250 that (for example, the click of user to advertisement) follows the trail of to user interactions for using repeatedly.Data flow 250 submits interaction data 252 as start to Advertisement Server D218 using subscriber equipment 106 when user clicks in selected advertisement.To Advertisement Server D218, submitting to interaction data 252 for example can be included in the mutual trace data providing in the ad content 220 of subscriber equipment by Advertisement Server D218 is caused.
Be redirected data 254 and for example can subscriber equipment 106 be directed to Advertisement Server B210 based on the mutual trace data of (or providing with it) in location advertising data 214 is provided.Subscriber equipment 106 is by interaction data 252(or other data) provide to Advertisement Server B210 with make Advertisement Server B210 notified with the user interactions of selected advertisement.The user interactions of Advertisement Server B210 record and selected advertisement.For example, Advertisement Server B210 can be stored in interaction data 252 and/or the information relevant to subscriber equipment 106 in the data storage such as advertisement data store 212.And then Advertisement Server B210 can provide and be redirected data 256 to subscriber equipment 106.
Be redirected data 256 and subscriber equipment 106 can be directed to destination server 258, it can provide the resource being associated with advertisement (webpage that for example, advertiser is linked advertisement with it) to subscriber equipment 106.Alternatively, be redirected data 256 and can subscriber equipment 106 be redirected to Additional servers (for example, the Additional servers of the user interactions of tracking and selected advertisement) before subscriber equipment 106 is redirected to destination server 258.In response to being redirected to destination server 258, subscriber equipment can be by interaction data 252(or its part) be committed to destination server 258.
When carrying out Ad Track according to data flow 250, subscriber equipment 106 can be through being repeatedly redirected before arriving the landing page being associated with selected advertisement.Redirected number and order can be different with the redirected number shown in this instantiation procedure and order.But, for being repeatedly redirected of subscriber equipment 106, can increase time delay, this needs user to wait for that the longer time sees the landing page, and has increased because the communication between equipment on network stops or inaccurate or expired destination locations link and being redirected the chance that occurs fracture in chain.
Fig. 3 is for reducing the block diagram for the sample data flow process 300 to the redirected number of following the trail of with the user interactions of content item.Data flow 300 with subscriber equipment 106 in response to submitting interaction data 252 and starting with the user interactions of selected advertisement to Advertisement Server D218.In response to receiving interaction data 252, Advertisement Server D218(for example, receives the Advertisement Server of ad content for receiving the first server of interaction data 252 and/or subscriber equipment from it) to subscriber equipment 106, send and be redirected data 302.Be redirected data 302 subscriber equipment 106 is directed to the webpage that destination server 258 is associated with selected advertisement with request.No matter whether other Advertisement Server (or other data processing equipment) is to following the trail of with the user interactions of selected advertisement, be redirected data 302 all and do not require that subscriber equipment for example, was redirected through other Advertisement Server (, Advertisement Server B210) before requested webpage.Therefore, subscriber equipment 106 only single after being redirected, be provided to asked webpage.
Advertisement Server D218 is by being used the unique and/or encrypted identifier being associated with selected advertisement to identify subscriber equipment 106 to Advertisement Server B210S.This unique identifier can be for example the identifier being provided when asking selected advertisement by Advertisement Server B210.For example, Advertisement Server B210 can provide unique identifier to Advertisement Server D218 when thinking that subscriber equipment 106 provides location advertising data, such as the cipher key values pair retaining in the URL by being included in ad content request.The combination of the numerical value of the cipher key values retaining as described in more detail below, to unique id that can be for example the key of sign Advertisement Server B210 and given ad server B 210 generate for current ad-request.And then Advertisement Server D218 can identify this cipher key values pair retaining in URL, and based on URL comprise retained cipher key values to and to Advertisement Server B210 report user interactions.
In some embodiments, Advertisement Server B210 for each selected advertisement (for example, with each ad-request and/or each user's basis) generate different unique identifiers, to make each selected advertisement and to select each request of selected advertisement to be able to identified based on this unique identifier for it.Therefore, when user and advertisement are carried out mutual and Advertisement Server D218 while providing to Advertisement Server B210 the unique identifier being associated with advertisement, which advertisement Advertisement Server B210 identifies in clicked, and for which request search advertisements, and therefore which user and advertisement are carried out alternately.Therefore, without the unique identifier generating at Advertisement Server B210, comprise user totem information.
Alternatively or additionally, Advertisement Server B210 and Advertisement Server D218 follow the trail of and the user interactions (or other content item) of advertisement with cookie exchange system, still need less (for example, only once) to be redirected simultaneously.For example, the database that can set up shared unique identifier (for example, anonymity and encrypted identifier) is to promote user interactions to follow the trail of.Sharing the exclusive user identifier of server that the database of unique identifier can create shared unique identifier and server each server matches, so that proper particular advertisement server is while receiving shared unique identifier from another Advertisement Server, particular advertisement server can identify the exclusive user identifier of server that particular advertisement server has created for subscriber equipment.In some embodiments, shared unique identifier can be the cookie identifier (for example, hash user-specific identifier) of cookie and/or the encrypted form of cookie, and encryption key keeps maintaining secrecy.
For the use of cookie exchange system is described, suppose that Advertisement Server D218 receives interaction data, the exclusive cookie of server being generated by Advertisement Server D218 before this interaction data comprises.In this example, Advertisement Server D218 provides interaction data and shared unique identifier (for example, encrypting cookie) with the user interactions with selected advertisement to Advertisement Server B210 notice to Advertisement Server B210.Therefore, Advertisement Server D218, without included information in the exclusive cookie of server is provided to Advertisement Server B210, has protected privacy of user thus.
In something real mode, Advertisement Server B210 can provide the cookie(of encrypted form or the suitable subset of the information that provided by cookie to Advertisement Server D218).The cookie of encrypted form can be used as identifier, but Advertisement Server D218 and Advertisement Server B210 are without location identifier.On the contrary, Advertisement Server D218 can, when the user interactions of generation and selected advertisement, provide the cookie of encrypted form to Advertisement Server B210.Advertisement Server B210 can receive the cookie of encrypted form and it is decrypted to obtain cookie itself.Advertisement Server B210 can record and user's interaction data with this cookie subsequently.
