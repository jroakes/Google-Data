- the one or more attributes may comprise at least one of a title associated with the media content an artist associated with the media content, notes associated with the media content, a composer associated with the media content, a producer associated with the media content, a category associated with the media content, a type number associated with the media content, an advertiser number associated with the media content, and user-defined eastern information.
- the method may comprise generating a graphical user interface (GUI) comprising one or more fields.
- the query may correspond to information contained in the one or more fields of the GUI.
- the GUI may comprise one or more options for accessing the specific media content.
- Enabling the broadcast station to access the specific media content may comprise receiving a selection corresponding to the one or more options, and instructing a broadcast station that stores the specific media content to provide the specific media content to the broadcast station that issued the query.
- the one or more options may comprise an option to obtain the specific media content immediately, and an option to obtain the media content at a predefined time.
- the media content may comprise music from a family of broadcast stations or any other media asset.
- the media content may be stored in one or more repositories that are communicatively coupled to the network.
- the broadcast stations may be radio stations.
- the method may be performed at one or more computer systems that are separate from the families of broadcast stations.
- this patent application also describes a method of sharing media content among families of broadcast stations, which comprises receiving information relating to media content for families of broadcast stations, storing the information such that the information is accessible to at least one of the families of broadcast stations via a computer network, and receiving a query for specific media content from a broadcast station that is a member of a first family of broadcast stations.
- the specific media content may be associated with a second family of broadcast stations that is different from the first family.
- the method may also comprise searching the information in accordance with the query to identify a location of the specific media content, obtaining the specific media content from the location, and providing the specific media content to the broadcast station.
- the method may also include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.
- the method may comprise generating a GUI comprising one or more fields.
- the query may correspond to information contained in the one or more fields of the GUI.

- Audio content may be inventoried and categorized for the communication system 100 in several ways (e.g., by keyword, price, vendor, last played, etc.).
- radio stations can use the communication system 100 and may wish to have access to inventoried media content to schedule music, advertisement, and/or any other type of media asset on their stations.
- radio stations may use the communication system 100 to share media content. For example, a program director at one radio station may search for and download a song or an advertisement (ad) stored at another radio station.
- the radio stations, the broadcasting hub, or a combination of the two may use the media content inventory information and other data to un-schedule current programming, and reschedule new programming that may be more suitable (e.g., suitable in terms of content, price, or other criteria) in a particular time slot.
- a radio station may receive a last minute ad at a higher price (e.g., cost per thousand (CPM)) than other previously received advertisements, and can “bump” (or pre-empt) a currently scheduled advertisement in favor of the higher priced advertisement.
- CPM cost per thousand
- a radio station may receive a new popular song that is deemed worthy of interrupting current programming for immediate play.
- communication system 100 may allow radio stations to share audio clips of historical significance, such as a press conference describing a new invention that promises to change the world.
- the communication system 100 includes a network 102 to communicatively couple third-party data sources 104 , at least one subscriber 106 , at least one regional broadcast studio 108 (e.g., radio station), and a broadcasting hub 110 .
- at least one regional broadcast studio 108 may be further communicatively coupled to at least one radio transmitter 112 .
- the network 102 includes the Internet.
- the network 102 can be any network, such as a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network (VPN).

- third-party data may indicate the categories of music that are likely to attract listeners in particular areas.
- Third-party data may categorize music by type (e.g., rock, classical, jazz) and language (e.g., English, Spanish, French).
- third-party data may include the weather forecast, current weather conditions, or news events such as stock prices, sports scores, data from a syndicated data feed such as an RSS feed, or any other data relevant to a party's desire to play music or an advertisement.
- information or data is received or collected directly by the broadcasting hub 110 rather than from third-party sources 104 . Regardless of the source, the broadcasting hub 110 can use the information in evaluating whether criteria are met for playing music or an advertisement.
- the subscriber 106 is also communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 110 . This allows the subscriber 106 to purchase, schedule, and upload music and advertising spots using, e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI), of the broadcasting hub 110 .
- Subscriber 106 may access hub 110 via a connection to the network 102 .
- the connection to network 102 may be any connection that allows access to hub 110 .
- subscriber 106 may access hub 110 using TCP/IP and a dial-up connection over a modem, or a dedicated connection that provides constant access.
- the broadcasting hub 110 may have a unique HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address, a unique File Transfer Protocol (FTP) address, or any other addressing scheme that allows subscriber 106 to identify hub 110 .
- HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
- FTP File Transfer Protocol
- Subscribers 106 can include music warehouses, advertisers, agencies, stations, or any other entity that interacts with the broadcasting hub 110 . In some implementations, subscribers 106 have an account with the broadcasting hub 110 and are charged a fee for use of the broadcasting hub 110 . In other implementations, subscribers 106 can access the broadcasting hub 110 free of charge.
- a regional broadcast studio 108 can include a traffic system 114 .
- the traffic system 114 may schedule radio advertisements based on an advertiser request. For example, the traffic system 114 may receive a request to schedule the play of a particular advertisement in three assigned time slots each day during the weekdays of Monday through Friday.
- the traffic system 114 can store the advertisements as media content 116 .
- the traffic system 114 can store the schedules and/or instructions for playing the advertisements as playlists 118 .
- the media content 116 and the playlists 118 can be stored at regional broadcast studio 108 .
- the regional broadcast studio 108 can also include a programming system 120 that produces and describes the overall broadcast content on a radio station.
- the programming system 120 can be monitored automatically via a network, such as network 102 , and may fee communicatively coupled to the traffic system 114 .
- a program director at a radio station can use the programming system 120 to access media content 116 and playlists 118 .
- the regional broadcast studio 108 can also include an automation system 122 .
- the automation system 122 enables automatic handling (e.g., producing, storing, sending, receiving) of media content 116 and playlists 118 .
- the automation system 122 can be distributed to include a local portion that is associated with a regional broadcast studio 108 and a remote portion that is associated with broadcasting hub 110 .
- the automation system 122 may be communicatively coupled to the traffic system 114 and the programming system 120 .
- the regional broadcast studio 108 can also include a multi-station media controller 124 .
- the regional broadcast studio 108 may use the controller 124 to share media content between one or more other radio stations.
- the multi-station media controller 124 may be communicatively coupled to systems 114 , 120 and 122 .
- the multi-station media controller 124 can include a media content finder application 126 .
- the application 126 can allow a user (e.g., a program director) to search for and download media content 116 that maybe stored remotely, such as at another radio station.
- the regional broadcast studio 108 is communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 110 , such that the broadcasting hub 110 is capable of forwarding audio advertisements and musical (or other) content to the regional broadcast studio 108 for play.
- the subscriber 106 is capable of submitting media content 116 to the broadcasting hub 110 .
- the media content 116 can include music and advertisements for play along with specific criteria for the play of that music and/or advertisement, and the broadcasting hub 110 can forward the media content to a regional broadcast studio 108 for play as appropriate.
- the playlists 118 and media content 116 can be stored locally at the regional broadcast station 108 .
- a broadcasting company may own several radio stations throughout the world, such as in multiple cities throughout North America and other continents.
- the broadcasting company may want to share media content (or media assets) among these radio stations even though the stations are geographically distributed. For instance, while some radio stations may be in the same city (and perhaps the same building), sharing media content between two remote radio stations (e.g., in different cities) may be desired.
- the broadcasting company may own and/or operate four radio stations in Los Angeles (LA), three in Miami, five in Chicago, two in Toronto, and several more worldwide. If the broadcasting company's Los Angeles radio stations are housed in the same building, they may be considered part of the same media “family.” Radio stations in the same family can share resources, such as common information technology (IT) infrastructures and IT support staff. The radio stations in the same family can be connected to each other (and to the data they share) via a LAN, WAN or other network.
- a radio station family may include, but is not limited to, stations within a same market, within a same city, or within a same physical space (e.g., building). Accordingly, one type of radio station family includes radio stations that are within a predefined geographic area or areas.
- radio content can include, for example, media content (e.g., audio files), programming schedules, advertisements, search catalogs, and push content (described below).
- the search catalogs can be associated with searching the family's local media content as well as media content of remote families owned and/or operated by the same broadcasting company.
- the push content can be associated with media content that one radio station family may transmit (e.g., by pre-defined business scenarios) to the broadcasting company's other radio families. Searching and sharing content can occur, for example, among radio families that have established a “friendship”, such as families owned and/or operated by the same broadcasting company that may desire to share media content (e.g., music and ads).
- the program director may type in the name of the artist or group (e.g., “Chip Davis” or “Mannheim Steamroller”) and initiate the search.
- the system may search media content (e.g., database of songs) of the local Los Angeles radio station family to which the radio station belongs.
- the particular databases or repositories searched can include the media content of the radio stations within the family (e.g., those sharing common storage facilities in the same building).
- the program director may widen the search to include radio families within the same radio station family friendship.
- the search can be executed against the media content of Miami, Chicago, Toronto and other locations that are part of the same radio station family friendship.
- searching the databases or repositories of the other families in the friendship may occur automatically, or the widened search may be triggered explicitly by the program director.
- the program director may elect to download the file.
- downloading the file may include an initial step of verifying that the program director and/or the associated radio station family has the appropriate “rights” to download the file. Verification can include, for example, authorization of the requesting radio station family (e.g., is the family included in the friendship?) and specific musical piece-related access, such as rights based on copyright or royalty agreements. If rights to the particular media asset are verified, downloading can occur, such as via the Internet.
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary illustration of a system 200 for sharing media content within radio families and between radio station families.
- the implementation depicted in system 200 includes radio station family A 202 a and radio station family B 202 b .
- each of the radio families 202 a and 202 b can include one or more radio stations 204 housed in the same building or complex of buildings, such as buildings in Los Angeles and Chicago housing separate radio families in each city. There may be multiple radio families in a particular city, each housed in a different part of the city.
- the radio families 202 a and 202 b can be owned, for example, by the same broadcasting company.
- the system 200 can be used for sharing media content among radio stations and/or radio families owned by different broadcasting companies, such as through reciprocal or paid arrangements for sharing media content.
- radio station family A 202 a and radio station family B 202 b are shown communicatively coupled via the network 102 to the media content finder application 126 .
- the application 126 can allow radio families 202 a and 202 b to share media content 116 with each other. For example, if radio station family A 202 a is located in Los Angeles, the media content 116 stored and used by radio stations 204 in family 202 a can be shared with radio station family B 202 b (e.g., in Chicago). At the same time, media content 116 stored and used by radio stations 204 in radio station family B 202 b (e.g., in Chicago) can be shared with radio station family A 202 a in Los Angeles.
- the media content finder application 126 can also allow radio families 202 a and 202 b to share media content 116 with other radio families not depicted in FIG. 2 , such as radio families in Miami and Toronto.
- some or all of the media content 116 used by the radio families 202 a and 202 b can be stored remotely, such as at a central media content repository (e.g., a broadcasting hub) or clearinghouse accessible via the network 102 .
- the media content finder application 126 can be used to locate media assets stored remotely, such as in one or more remote locations worldwide (e.g., another radio station family).
- the media content finder application 126 can be hosted on a radio station family's computer system, such as on the hardware within the common computer network shared by radio stations in the same building.
- the content is stored on a computer of a radio station within a family.
- the “intelligence” used by the application 126 to share media content can reside entirely on the radio station family's computer system.
- Other families in the friendship can have similar software on their computer systems. In this way, a radio station family in the friendship can have local software that facilitates searching and sharing of media content with other families in the friendship. For example, the Los Angeles and Chicago radio families can search and share media content, such as a Chicago-stored song requested by the Los Angeles radio station family.
- the software used for sharing media content among radio families can be hosted on a centralized system, such as at a server accessible via the Internet or at the broadcasting hub.
- a radio station family may, for example, simply connect to the Internet and register as a member of a family friendship. Other families within the same friendship can register in a similar way.
- the request and processing can be handled entirely by the centralized system. Having the media asset sharing software entirely hosted on the Internet can eliminate the need for computer infrastructure (e.g., hardware, IT support staff etc.) at the radio station family.
- software for sharing media content among radio station families can be hosted partly on the family's computer network and partly in a central system.
- sharing media content can, for example, exploit efficiencies that may derive from family-to-family sharing without using a central system.
- such a system may still use centralized processing for some sharing functions and family-to-family processing for other sharing functions, depending on, for example, predicted transfer speeds.
- different types of family friendships may exist among a broadcast company's radio families.
- the system may be configured to represent families having one or more classical music stations as sharing a “classical” friendship.
- radio stations that normally air Spanish language music maybe members of a “Spanish” family friendship.
- Different friendships can be named explicitly for easy reference by station personnel, or they may be represented implicitly, for example, by the data that defines the families.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary implementation of the system 200 of FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 3 provides detail for the media content finder application 126 .
- the media content finder application 126 includes (or uses) a storage software module 302 , a search software module 304 , an authentication software module 306 , an encryption software module 308 , a push software module 310 , a media content index file 312 , a saved searches file 314 , and a family friendships file 316 . It is noted that the functionality provided by these elements need not be separated as shown (e.g., by software module), but rather maybe implemented using any software and/or hardware architecture.
- the elements 302 - 316 included in (or used by) the application 126 can be communicatively coupled, such as by a network (e.g., LAN or WAN) located at the central location that houses the application 126 .
- the application 126 may be distributed, executing at more than one location, such as to manage media content on a “hubbed” basis.
- portions of the computer software of software modules 302 - 310 may be housed within the computer systems of the radio families 202 a and 202 b .
- the software modules 302 - 310 may be entirely resident within the application 126 , or they may invoke commercial software or services available over the network 102 or at any other location.
- the storage software module 302 can receive and store information (e.g., metadata) about media content that is stored at the radio families. For example, when a radio station 204 in radio station family A 202 a stores music or advertisements as media content 116 , the family 202 a can transmit corresponding metadata to the media content finder application 126 .
- the metadata may include the name of the song, the artist's name, the type of music (e.g., rock, classical, jazz), the song's length, the language in which the song is recorded, the radio station family that stores the media content, the date of recording, the date that the media is stored at the radio station, and or other notes.
- Other metadata may identify a composer, a producer, a category, a type number, an advertiser number, and other user-defined custom metadata.
- the metadata may include the name of the advertiser, the length of the ad, the date the ad was created or received, and the scheduled broadcast times for the ad.
- Indexes based on the metadata for music and ads can be stored in the media content index file 312 .
- Such an index file 312 can allow radio stations 204 to search for media content stored at other radio families. For example, terms in a search query can be used as potential matches against fields in the metadata upon which the index file 312 is based.
- the storage software module 302 can store actual media content 116 .
- some radio families may not store all of their media content locally.
- media content that is likely to be needed by several radio families in a radio friendship can be stored at a central location.
- the search software module 304 can receive a search query and identify media content matching the query or that matches the query to a predefined degree.
- the search software module 304 can identify the media family that stores the data. For example, a radio station 204 at the radio station family A 202 a may submit a query for a specific piece of music.
- the query may be entered in an interface 320 a (e.g., including one or more GUI screens) and transmitted to the application 126 via the network 102 .
- the search software module 304 can use terms in the search query to access the media content index 312 .
- Matching entries in the index 312 can be used to formulate a result set that is transmitted to the radio station 204 via the network 102 .
- the result set can identify the locations (e.g., specific radio families) in which the media content 116 is stored.
- the result set can automatically include the media content requested in the query.
- users of application 126 may fee able to configure the search software module 304 to send a link to the media content, to automatically send the media content itself, depending on various pre-defined parameters, or to instruct the user to issue a specific request to download the media content.
- the user may request to download the media content immediately or at a predefined time in the future.
- the search software module 304 can employ saved searches 314 .
- User queries may be stored in the saved searches file 314 over time as queries are received from radio stations 204 .
- a list of saved searches may be provided to a user (e,g., a program director) at a radio station in drop-down lists displayable in interfaces 320 a or 320 b , such as in GUI screens.
- the saved searches file 314 can be stored at the radio families. For example, radio station family B 202 b can have local saved searches 314 for media content search queries it has issued over time.
- saved searches 314 can include templates that a user (e.g., a program director) can quickly customize to build a query.
- a template may allow the user to complete (and save) a query simply by filling in a few parameters, such as the name of a musician or song title.
- a template for finding a specific new (e.g., less than a month old) song at any Spanish language radio station may be completed by the user simply by filling in the song title (e.g., without having to specify date ranges or languages).
- the search software module 304 can be used to crawl media content 116 stored at radio stations 204 in one or more radio station families. Crawling the media content can be used to pre-populate the media content index file 312 if, for example, the media content finder application 126 is installed after media content 116 already exists at radio families. Crawling can also be used to verity the index file 312 or to reconstruct the index file 312 (e.g., for disaster recovery).
- the authentication software module 306 can allow the application 126 to ensure that it is communicating with radio families within radio stations under its control. For example, when a radio station 204 in radio station family A 202 a sends a query to the application 126 , the authentication software module 306 can authenticate the request. For instance, the authentication software module 306 can compare information about the query's originator with information in a family friendships file 316 .
- the family friendships file 316 can provide detailed information about the radio families and their associated radio stations, including radio station family identifiers that can be used for authentication. In some implementations, the family friendships file 316 can also include information that specifies protocols between the radio families, such as specific hours of operation or preferred times for sending or receiving media content.
- the encryption software module 308 can provide security for exchanging media content among radio stations. For example, using shared encryption, media content 116 shared by radio station family A 202 a can be encrypted before it is transmitted across the network 102 . In some implementations, some of the functionality of the encryption software module 308 can reside at the radio station families. For example, radio station families 202 a and 202 b can each have an encryption software module 308 for encrypting media content they transmit, and for decrypting media content they receive.
- the push software module 310 can automatically send specific media content to radio stations.
- one of the radio station families may have a radio station 204 that has facilities (e.g., translators and recording studios) for creating Spanish language versions of popular songs.
- facilities e.g., translators and recording studios
- a broadcasting company with several radio station families may have a procedure in place for creating the Spanish versions of songs at a single radio station, then “pushing” the media content to other radio stations.
- a radio station 204 in radio station family A 202 a creates the Spanish version of a particular song. After the song is stored locally in media content 116 , the radio station family A 202 a also transmits metadata corresponding to the Spanish song to the application 126 . Upon receipt of the metadata, the storage software module 302 updates the media content index file 312 . At the same time, the storage software module 302 accesses the family friendships file 316 and determines that the media content it just received can be automatically pushed to other Spanish language radio stations. The application 126 then invokes the push software module 310 to push the Spanish song to other radio families, such as to radio station family B 202 b if it has one or more Spanish radio stations 204 .
- pushed media content can be reviewed by a radio station family before it is stored locally.
- radio station family A 202 a may use the interlace 320 a to screen media content pushed to it from other radio families, such as from radio station family B 202 b .
- radio station family B 202 b may use the interface 320 b to screen media content pushed to it from radio station family A 202 a .
- pushed media content awaiting screening can be held by the application 126 (e.g., at the Internet site hosting the application 126 ).
- pushed media content awaiting screening can be stored at the radio families until it is screened.
- a user in one family may use a different user interface (e.g., other than media content search screens) to initiate a transfer (e.g., push) of a specified media asset from one family to another.
- a user at radio station family A 202 a may identify a piece of music that the user believes radio station family B 202 b may want.
- the interface such as an interface that displays new media content processed for the day, the user can select the specific media content and push the specific media content to other families (e.g., radio station family B 202 b ).
- the receiving system can automatically check pre-defined rules to determine if the incoming media asset must be held for screening.
- the predefined rules may specify that screening is to occur for certain types of music (e.g., classical or rap) or for media content from specific radio families (e.g., radio family A 202 a ). If a particular media asset is held for screening, then the media asset can be quarantined until a user at the receiving family approves the media asset. Such approval can occur, for example, through the use of one or more user interface screens.
- the approver may manually manipulate the metadata of an incoming media asset.
- the program director at radio station family B 202 b may receive pushed content from radio station family A 202 A, such as a Spanish jazz song that is categorized as jazz.
- the user may wish to change the metadata, such as to further classify the song as a Spanish language song.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary user interface (UI) 400 , which is generated by application 126 , and which used to search media content of radio stations within radio families.
- the user interface includes various search fields that allow a user to specify parameters for a search.

- FIG. 5 is an exemplary flow diagram for a method 500 of sharing media content among one or more radio station families.
- the method 500 can begin when a radio station (e.g., of radio family A) transmits media content information to be stored ( 502 ).
- a radio station e.g., of radio family A
- one of me radio stations 204 in radio station family A 202 a may store music or ads as media content 116 and transmit metadata corresponding to the media content information to the media content finder application 126 .
- metadata associated with the song e.g., the song title and other fields/attributes
- the media content information is received ( 504 ) from one of the radio stations in the family.
- the storage software module 302 can receive the metadata corresponding to the media content stored at the radio station family A 202 a , such as the Mannheim Steamroller song.
- the media content information is stored ( 506 ) such that the media content information is accessible to at least some of the families of radio stations via a computer network. For example, if a song or ad is stored locally as media content 116 at radio families 202 a or 202 b , the metadata corresponding to the song or ad can be stored in the media content index 312 . Indexes in the media content index 312 can make it possible for radio stations to search for other radio families' media content information, such as metadata (e.g., song title, artist, etc.) relating to songs by Mannheim Steamroller. As additional instances of media content information are stored over time, storage software module 302 can make the corresponding updates to the media content index 312 (steps 502 - 506 ).
- metadata e.g., song title, artist, etc.
- a query can be sent ( 508 ).
- a user e.g., a program director
- the radio station family B 202 b may send a query for a song (e.g., a specific song by Mannheim Steamroller) previously stored by a radio station 204 at radio station family A 202 a .
- the query can he entered by the user via interface 320 b (e.g., 400 —see FIG. 4 ).
- the user may instead select from a collection of previously-entered queries obtained from the saved searches 314 and displayed in the interface 320 b , such as in a pull-down list.
- the user may select and submit a previously used query, such as one that lists Mannheim Steamroller songs recently stored by other radio families.
- the user may optionally modify a saved query before it is submitted.
- the query from the radio station for the specific media content is received ( 510 ) by the media content finder application.
- the application 126 can receive a query from a radio station 204 in media family B 202 b .
- the query can be from a program director trying to locate a specific song by Mannheim Steamroller that may have been stored by a radio station in another radio station family.
- the query can be received in the search software module 304 .
- Stored media content information is searched to identify the specific media content ( 512 ) that is the subject of the query.
- Application 126 enables the radio station to access ( 514 ) the specific media content, provided that the specific media content is identified among the stored media content information. For example, when the search software module 304 identifies media content matching the user's query, the application 126 can provide the user with access to the corresponding media content. Specifically, the application 126 can send to the user a link to the Mannheim Steamroller song stored in media content 116 at radio station family A 202 a . The link may appear as a hyperlink displayed in the user's interlace 320 b . In some implementations, providing access to the media content may include sending the actual media content to the user.
- the application 126 may obtain the media content wherever it is stored (e.g., in radio station family A 202 a ) and transmit a copy of the media content via the network 102 to the user at a radio station 204 in radio station family B 202 b .
- application 126 may instruct a radio station in radio station family A 202 a to send the media content directly (e.g., to push the media content) to a radio station in radio station family B 202 b.
- the radio station that requested the specific media content receives the media content ( 516 ).
- the user who initiated the query for the specific media content e.g., a song by Mannheim Steamroller
- the download may be initiated by clicking on a hyperlink displayed with the Mannheim Steamroller song title in the user's interface 320 b .
- the download may occur via the network 102 .
- the download can occur directly between radio families.
- a copy of the audio content for the Mannheim Steamroller song stored in media content 116 in radio station family A 202 a can be transmitted (e.g., pushed) to the media content 116 in radio station family B 202 b (e.g., in response to instructions from media content finder application 126 ).
- the media content may be routed though the Web site or clearinghouse that hosts the application 126 .
- the media content index 312 can be updated to indicate another location at which the media content is stored. In this way, a user searching for a specific song (or ad) can discover that the song (or ad) is already available locally in media content 116 .
