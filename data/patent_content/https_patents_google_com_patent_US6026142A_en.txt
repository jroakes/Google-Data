Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of computer image processing of computer tomography (CT) images and, more particularly, to the problem of detecting the boundaries of objects appearing in such images.
- CT computer tomography
- Objects of interest in an X-ray computed tomography (CT) image are typically identified by applying image processing algorithms directly to the CT image.
- image processing algorithms known as a segmentation algorithms, detect objects of interest by identifying the boundaries of these objects (or equivalently by identifying the pixels belonging to each object).
- An alternative method of detecting objects in a CT image is to directly process the two-dimensional (2D) projection data from which the two-dimensional CT image is subsequently reconstructed.
- each ray generated by the CT scanner produces a single point in the projection image
- each ray generated by the CT scanner that is tangent to a convex object being scanned will appear as an edge in the projection image
- each point in the projection image corresponds to a line segment in the CT image that is reconstructed from the projection image.
- This method applies constraints that are imposed by the geometry of the CT scanner and the scanning process. This method is applicable for the detection of the boundaries of convex objects, and the convex sections of the boundaries of concave objects, in CT images.
- Thirion recognized the problem of the inconsistencies that are introduced during edge-detection of the projection data.
- the proposed solution works by removing inconsistencies in the order that they are detected.
- As Thirion notes page 18 of INRIA research report 1463 cited above, while this method has the advantage of being fast, it has the disadvantage that it can produce inaccurate results.
- Pixel A picture element. The basic element in a two-dimensional digital (2D) picture.
- Image A rectangular 2D digital picture. Each pixel in the image is identified by a pair of integers (x,y), where x and y are the column and row locations of the pixel respectively. (We shall use the terms “slice” and “image” interchangeably in describing the present invention).
- Image segmentation The process of identifying objects of interest in an image.
- Edge An edge is a point in an image at the transition between two regions having markedly disparate pixel values.
- Segmented object A object of interest in an image identified by the process of segmentation.
- a view consists of a set of rays produced by a CT scanner with the x-ray tube in a fixed position.
- Sinogram In its standard mode of operation, a CT scanner collects a set S of views while the CT table is held in a fixed position. The views in the set S are acquired at different positions of the x-ray tube as it rotates around the table. A sinogram consist of all the projection data (or a processed version thereof) in a single set S of views.
- each data point in a sinogram corresponds to a single ray traveling from the x-ray source to the detector, we can represent a sinogram as a 2D image, where each pixel is uniquely identified by the ordered pair of integers (r,v) where v is the view containing this ray, and r is the number of the ray within view v.
- r,v the ordered pair of integers
- a scout image is a 2D digital X-ray produced when a CT machine scans a collection of objects while the X-ray tube is held in a fixed position, and the CT table, together with the objects, is moved.
- CT X-ray computer tomography

- CT images 130 produced by a computed tomography scanner 105.
- a patient 120 is scanned by the CT scanner 105, collecting projection data 135 from the CT input/output (I/O) unit 110, from which is created a set of two-dimensional CT images 130.
- This process of creating the images 130 is known as image reconstruction from projections.
- the CT images 130 contain cross-sectional details of the scene that was scanned, which typically includes the patient 120.
- the CT images 130 and the related CT projection data 135 are input to a computer 150 and, optionally, stored on an external storage medium 155.
- the computer 150 may be, for example, an IBM RS/6000 workstation running AIX, IBM's version of the UMX operating system, and the external storage medium 155 may be, for example, a disk storage system connected to the computer.
- the computer 150 includes a central processing unit (CPU) 152 and memory 151.
- a boundary-detection program 140 stored in memory 151 running on CPU 152 of the computer 150 reads in the CT images 130 and projection data 135, and computes the boundary 160.
- FIG. 2 shows a flow chart of the boundary-detection program 140 shown in FIG. 1.
- the CT image is processed as follows.
- the sinogram (i.e., projection) data is read into the computer in function block 200, as is the CT image in function block 210.
- function block 220 the high-contrast sinogram edges are detected.
- each of these high-contrast sinogram edges corresponds to a line in the CT image that is tangent to an object boundary.
- These boundary tangent lines are then computed in function block 230.
- these tangent lines are each assigned a value of merit that quantifies how consistent the tangent line is with the other tangent lines. (We shall describe this notion of consistency in more detail in the following sections of this document.)
- the tangent lines are ranked according to the value of merit, which is then used in function block 250 to produce, from the set of all tangent lines, a subset of consistent tangents.
- the desired object boundary is computed from the subset of consistent tangents.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the method of detecting sinogram edges (function block 220 of FIG. 2).
- the projection data (which form a 2D image) are read in function block 320, and an edge-detector algorithm is applied to this projection image in function block 340, using prior art image processing techniques (see, for example, Computer Vision by Ballard and Brown, Prentice Hall, 1982).
- a region REG is identified in process block 330 that completely encloses the object of interest in the CT image input in function block 310. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, one way that this region can be identified is manually by a human operator by tracing the outline of region REG on top of the CT image on the computer monitor.
- region REG induces a set of constraints on the possible edge locations in the sinogram image that correspond to points of the object boundary. These edge constraints can be easily derived, using prior art methods, from REG and the CT scanning geometry input at function block 315. (In general, such a region REG can always be identified in the type of CT image that we consider in the preferred embodiment of this invention, even if the precise location of the object boundary is corrupted by noise. In the event that the CT image is so corrupted by noise as to make it impossible to find such a region REG, the method described in FIG. 3 can still applied, with steps 330 and 350 being skipped. The method will still work correctly when these two steps are skipped, although the process will be slower, since the function of steps 330 and 350 is to speed up computation).
- the constraints in function blocks 350 and 360 are used to select, from edge data computed in function block 340, the required edges pairs in function block 370. If these constraints are not adequate on their own to uniquely identify the required edges pairs, a further selection step is required to do this. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, this additional step is performed manually by a human operator.
- FIGS. 4 and 5 are referred to for the description of the details of the process of computing tangent lines from sinogra rn edges (i.e., function block 230 in FIG. 2).
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing the method used to derive the line segment corresponding to a given sinogram pixel.
- the accompanying drawing in FIG. 5 shows the scanning geometry related to computing this line segment.
- block 410 shows the sinogram edge input data
- a is the azimuth angle of the X-ray source at view v.
- Block 420 shows the CT scanner geometry input data
- a is to distance from X-ray source to the origin (i.e., the length of line PO in FIG. 5);
- b is to distance from X-ray source to the detector (i.e., the length of line PC in FIG. 5);
- r c is the ray number of the central ray (i.e., the ray along line PC in FIG. 5);
- ⁇ is the angle between successive rays in the view.
- ⁇ the angle between lines PC and PQ in FIG. 5, is computed.
- the 2 ⁇ 2 rotation matrix R is initialized.
- the 2 ⁇ 2 matrix M is initialized.
- the coordinates of the endpoints of line segment PQ are computed.
- process block steps 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, and 460 (FIG. 4) is applied to every sinogram edge. This completes the computation of all boundary tangents (process block 420 of FIG. 4).
- (L 1 ,R 1 ), (L 2 ,R 2 ), (L 3 ,R 3 ), and (L 4 ,R 4 ) are four pairs of tangent lines obtained from scanning a convex object with scan views acquired at points P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , P 4 .
- L i lies on the left side of the scanned object. Therefore, we call each such L i a left tangent.
- R i a right tangent.
- both the left and right tangents sets are consistent tangent sets (in the sense that we defined the term consistent previously). Therefore the desired object boundary could be calculated simply as follows:
- the intersection of two polygons can be done using prior art algorithms, for example, J. O'Rourke, Computational Geometry in C, Cambridge University Press, 1994).
- FIG. 7A shows a set of consistent tangents.
- the tangents T i are those line segments emanating from the (X-ray) source points P i that lie on circle C i .
- These T i are left tangents; that is, when looking from points P i towards the center of their common circle, all these tangent lines lie on the left of some convex object.
- This convex object is guaranteed to lie within the shaded polygonal area bounded by these tangents (and this object's boundary can be determined as described previously, and as illustrated in FIGS. 6A to 6D).
- the Intersection Ordering This is the ordering imposed by the set of distances between (i) P 0 , and (ii) the set of intersection points ⁇ I 5 , I 6 , I 7 , I 1 , I 2 , I 3 , I 4 ⁇ . If we order by decreasing distance, the ordering imposed is (T 5 , T 6 , T 7 , T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 ).
- the Circle Ordering This is the counter-clockwise ordering around circle C of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ . This is a cyclic ordering, and can therefore be expressed in a number of ways, for example, (T 5 , T 6 , T 7 , T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 ).
- a tangent T 0 is consistent with the set of tangents ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , . . . , T m ⁇ , if the two orderings of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , . . . , T m ⁇ , as described above, that is the intersection ordering, and the circle ordering, are equal. Note that in the example shown in FIG.
- FIG. 7B shows an example where T 0 is not consistent with the set of tangents ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ .
- T 0 is no longer consistent with the tangents ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ .
- an inconsistent set of tangents cannot define the boundary of a convex object (or in fact of a concave object). To see this, ignore tangent T 2 for the moment.
- the coherence between a single tangent T0, and set oftangents ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ , is defined to be equal to the size of the largest subset of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ with which T 0 is consistent. For example, in FIG.
- T 7B the coherence between T 0 and ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ is 6, since T 0 is consistent with ⁇ T 1 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ (and also, for example, with ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 ⁇ ).
- the computation of coherence involves finding the longest common subsequence in the intersection ordering and the circle ordering of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ . This can be done by anyone versed in the art of computer algorithms, using know methods, (see, for example, page 319 of the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al., published by McGraw-Hill, 1990).
- coherence is a measure of how close T 0 and ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ are to being consistent. Note that when T 0 is consistent with ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ , their coherence will equal m (the size of set ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ ).
- FIG. 8 shows a flow-chart that describes the process of resolving an inconsistent set of tangents S (block 700), to produce a consistent subset C (blocks 745 or 760).
- m is set to the current size of S.
- a counter k that is used to index the elements of S is initialized.
- R k is set to the value the coherence between T k (the k th element in S) and S- ⁇ T k ⁇ .
- k is incremented by 1.
- decision block 730 k is compared with m, and if k is smaller, the process loops back to block 710; otherwise, the process continues with block 735 in which we compute R j , the smallest member of ⁇ R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , . . . , R m ⁇ ).
- R j the smallest member of ⁇ R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , . . . , R m ⁇ ).
- R j the smallest member of ⁇ R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , . . . , R m ⁇ .
- decision block 740 we test whether R j is equal to (m-1), and if it is, this means that S has been resolved, and is now consistent, and the process terminates in block 745. If the test in decision block 740 is false, then S is still inconsistent.
- function block 750 the tangent with the lowest coherence removed from S, and m is reduced by 1.
- decision block 755 we test if m is less than three, and if it not, the process loops back to block 710. On the other hand, if m is less than three, S contains two tangents only, which are not sufficient to define the boundary on an object. We therefore consider S to be un-resolvable, and terminate in block 760, by setting C to be the empty set.
- ⁇ Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y r ⁇ is the largest subset of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ with which T 0 is consistent
- each Z i is incompatible with T 0
- the incompatibility of a tangent is defined to be equal to the total number of other tangents with which it is incompatibility.
- FIG. 9 shows a flowchart of the second method for resolving an inconsistent set of tangents. Like the first method described previously, it repeatedly removes a tangent from a set of inconsistent tangents until a consistent subset is obtained. The basic difference between the two methods is that in this second method the we repeatedly remove the tangent with maximum incompatibility (as opposed to minimum coherence).
- m is set to the current size of S.
- a counter k that is used to index the elements of S is initialized.
- T k is set to the k th element of S. Then the incompatibility counts are reset in function block 820.
- Y is set to the largest subset of S- ⁇ T k ⁇ that is consistent with Tk, and in function block 830, Z is set to S-Y- ⁇ T k ⁇ for each T i in Z.
- k is incremented by 1.
- decision block 840 k is compared with m, and if k is smaller, the process loops back to block 810; otherwise, the process continues with block 845 in which we compute R j , the smallest member of ⁇ R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , . . . , R m ⁇ ).
- decision block 850 we test whether R j is equal to (m-1), and if it is, this means that S has been resolved, and is now consistent, and the process terminates in block 855. If the test in decision block 850 is false, then S is still inconsistent.
- function block 860 the tangent with the lowest coherence removed from S, and m is reduced by 1.
- decision block 865 we test if m is less than three, and if it not, the process loops back to block 810. On the other hand, if m is less than three, S contains two tangents only, which are not sufficient to define the boundary on an object. We therefore consider S to be un-resolvable, and terminate in block 870, by setting C to be the empty set.
- the computation of incompatibility involves finding the longest common subsequence in the intersection ordering and the circle ordering of ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , . . . , T m ⁇ .
- T 0 tangents are visited in an order specified by the circle ordering (T 1 , T 2 , . . . , T m ), and their intersection with T 0 is determined.
- a counter is initialized to zero. Each time an intersection falls outside the circle C 2 , the counter is incremented. Each time the intersection falls inside the circle C 2 , the counter is reset to zero. Once the counter reaches a pre-defined threshold value (based on the amount of tolerance allowed for noise), no further tangents are visited.
- the method then visits tangents in an order specified by the reverse circle ordering, i.e., (T m , T m-1 , . . . , T 1 ).
- the counter is initialized to zero, and the process is repeated, i.e., the intersection of each tangent with T 0 is determined until the counter again reaches the pre-defined threshold value.
- FIG. 11 shows an example of this process, with a threshold value of two.
- the set of intersections between T 0 and ⁇ T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 ⁇ are computed in order. Then the process stops since two consecutive intersections lying outside C 2 have been detected.
