- a communication system 100 includes one or more user equipment (UEs) 101 communicating with a network equipment (or network element), such as a base station 103 , which is part of an access network (e.g., WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), 3GPP LTE (or E-UTRAN or 3.9G), etc.).
- the communication system 100 is compliant with a 3GPP LTE architecture. Under the 3GPP LTE architecture (as shown in FIGS. 6A-6D ), base station 103 is denoted as an enhanced Node B (eNB).
- the UE 101 can be any type of mobile stations, such as handsets, terminals, stations, units, devices, or any type of interface to the user (such as “wearable” circuitry, etc.).
- the UE 101 includes a transceiver 105 and an antenna system 107 that couples to the transceiver 105 to receive or transmit signals from the base station 103 .
- the antenna system 107 can include one or more antennas (of which only one is shown).
- the base station 103 can employ one or more antennas 109 for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals.
- the base station 103 employs a transceiver 111 , which transmits information over a downlink (DL) to the UE 101 .
- DL downlink
- the base station 103 uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Divisional Multiplexing) as a downlink (DL) transmission scheme and a single-carrier transmission (e.g., SC-FDMA (Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access) with cyclic prefix for the uplink (UL) transmission scheme.
- SC-FDMA can be realized also using DFT-S-OFDM principle, which is detailed in 3GGP TR 25.814, entitled “Physical Layer Aspects for Evolved UTRA,” v.1.5.0, May 2006 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).
- SC-FDMA also referred to as Multi-User-SC-FDMA, allows multiple users to transmit simultaneously on different sub-bands.
- the communication system 100 employs a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique to increase the air interference throughput and spectrum efficiency.
- Acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) signaling is part of HARQ, for connecting a transmitter and a receiver, to enable the fast L1 (Layer 1 or Physical Layer) retransmission.
- the UE 101 and the base station 103 include acknowledgement signaling logic 1113 and 115 to determine occurrence of transmission errors and to notify the source of the transmission of the errors, according to the HARQ mechanism.
- the system 100 addresses the uplink (UL) ACK/NACK in downlink (DL) transmission, particularly for LTE TDD system, and thus, is provided with an efficient, lower-overhead and robust acknowledgement signaling approach.
- ACK/NACK signaling requires sufficient robustness to avoid neither retransmitting successfully received data packet nor transmitting new data packet before successful receipt the on-the-air old data packet.
- the frequency of ACK/NACK transmission to the designated receiver is very high (e.g., up to 1000 Hz), thus, transmission efficiency of ACK/NACK is desired to minimize the signaling overhead.
- the system 100 utilizes an acknowledgement signaling scheme that provides transmission efficiency, as detailed in FIGS. 2A-2C .
- FIGS. 2A-2C are flowcharts of processes for providing efficient acknowledgment signaling, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- the acknowledgment signaling processes are explained with respect to the system of FIG. 1 .
- a predetermined number of acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement (AN) channels is designated for corresponding transmission channels. This assignment of AN channels can be performed by the base station 103 using acknowledgement signaling logic 115 .
- a certain number of UL ACK/NACK (AN) channels can be defined in L1 downlink control signaling per each radio frame or duplex space, wherein each UL ACK/NACK channel is corresponded with one UL subframe transmission of a UL share data channel.
- AN UL ACK/NACK
- a message is generated for indicating a mapping of the AN channels to the transmission channels. This message is then transmitted, as in step 205 , to the UE 101 .
- a control message is received by the UE 101 , wherein the message specifies a mapping of AN channels to transmission channels, per step 211 .
- the UE 101 has data to transmit, and thus, is assigned one of the transmission channels to carry the data.
- the data is transmitted over the one or more transmission channels; the UE 101 then monitors the corresponding AN channels for acknowledgement signaling. Thereafter, the UE 101 receives, as in step 215 , appropriate acknowledgement signaling in response to the data that was transmitted.
- FIG. 2C shows an example of how the above processes are performed.
- the system 100 (specifically, the BS 103 , for example) defines, as in step 221 , a number of UL AN channels in downlink control signal for each radio frame or a duplex space.
- a number of UL ACK/NACK (AN) channels is predefined in a layer 1 (L1 or physical layer) downlink control signaling per each radio frame or duplex space.
- Each UL AN channel supports transmission of ACK/NACK bits for the corresponding one of the UL subframe.
- the UE 101 obtains position of UL AN channels, per step 223 . If the system 100 provides an implicit allocation for the AN channels (as determined in step 225 ), then, per step 227 , the system 100 determines the AN channel based on the UL subframe. However, if the system 100 does not provide for implicit allocation, a signaling message is transmitted for conveying the position of the UL AN channels within the downlink, as in step 229 .
- the UE 101 can learn of its UL ACK/NACK bit(s) in the DL by a predefined implicit resource allocation or through use of minimal signaling overhead. Because there can be multiple UL and DL subframes in one TDD frame or one duplex space, and multiple scheduled UE in one UL subframe, the implicit allocation can be viewed in two parts. First, the time position of the ACK/NACK corresponding to the data transmission in the ith UL subframe; and second, multiplexing of ACK/NACKs for different UEs that transmitted UL data in the ith UL subframe.
- a predefined mapping can be designated to indicate on which DL subframe to transmit the ACK for the data in the ith UL subframes.
- the AN channels are mapped on a one-to-one (unique) basis to different UL subframes.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B are diagrams showing exemplary systems providing schedule signaling timing/logic for frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD), respectively.
- FDD frequency division duplex
- TDD time division duplex
- DL scheduling signaling operates in similar manner for both FDD and TDD configurations 301 and 303 .
- TDD operates differently in the UL—i.e., UL grant signaling entries in any of DL transmission time interval (TTI) may be allocated to any one of UL TTI to the targeted UE.
- TTI transmission time interval
- each UL grant signaling entry covers only one TTI, while the TDD system may provide UL grant signaling entries greater than one TTI, when the DL TTI is less than the UL TTI.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are diagrams showing exemplary systems for FDD uplink (UL) acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) timing and TDD UL ACK/NACK timing, respectively.
- UL uplink
- ACK/NACK acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment
- TDD UL ACK/NACK timing TDD UL ACK/NACK timing
- ID user equipment identifier
- MIMO Multiple Input Multiple Output
- the FDD UL ACK/NACK timing of the FDD system 401 is rather straightforward.
- TDD time division duplex
- FIGS. 2A-2C minimize the UL ACK/NACK bit (e.g., as low as 1 or 2 bits per UE (depending on MIMO deployment)) as well as maintain good robustness in the TDD system, particularly when the number of UL subframes is more than the number of DL subframes in a radio frame.
- the UL ACK/NACK bit e.g., as low as 1 or 2 bits per UE (depending on MIMO deployment)
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of exemplary TDD UL ACK/NACK channels in the downlink, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the acknowledgment signaling approach addresses UL ACK/NACK transmission in a TDD system. Assuming there are m UL subframes in every radio frame 501 , the base station 103 defines m UL AN channels 503 in downlink control signaling in that radio frame 501 . These m UL AN channels 503 can be pre-allocated in one or a few of all or all downlink subframes; the position of these m UL AN channels 503 can be static, semi-static, or even dynamic depending on the overall LTE system requirement.
- RRC radio resource control
- BCH broadcast channel
- Cat0 radio or semi-static or dynamic
- Each UL AN channel 503 can transmit UL ACK/NACK bits for the scheduled UE 101 in previous known subframe (TTI) by, for instance, various reliable and efficient known methods. Additionally, the timing requirement can be specified such that the needed processing time defines the smallest/shortest duration until an ACK/NACK can be transmitted. In the LTE example, this smallest/shortest duration can be a value (e.g., 1 ms) that satisfies the processing time and fits into numerology (for instance, ⁇ 400 ⁇ s is acceptable for decoding the longest Turbo code block). As shown, it is observed that AN-3 can be mapped only into DL subframe-2, but not DL subframe-1 because processing time is insufficient.
- the ACK-NACK in the same DL subframe can multiplexed using various standard techniques (e.g., frequency division multiplexing, code division multiplexing, or a hybrid scheme), and the UE 101 can determine the exact position within one AN channel by indexing the UE 101 within an AN channel. It is contemplated that other techniques can be employed as well.
- various standard techniques e.g., frequency division multiplexing, code division multiplexing, or a hybrid scheme
- a base station in subframe k, informs a terminal (e.g., UE-n) of the UL radio resources assignment using x-th L1/L2 control channel; and in subframe k+t, the base station transits UL AN to the UE-n using the x-th radio resources in AN channel (x-th sub-carrier set or x-th code).
- the above acknowledgement signaling approach provides an efficient and robust technique that minimizes the required bits for UL ACK/NACK transmission in DL down to the least, i.e., 1 bit per user equipment. Also, the approach is flexible and consistent to support a variety of downlink/uplink configuration scenarios in a TDD system, and an UL AN channel structure for other non-dynamic scheduled user equipment. Further, the approach provides the flexibility of maintaining UL AN channel position in the TDD system, i.e. not necessarily to have UL AN channel in each of DL subframe or have only one UL AN channel in each of DL subframe. This may leave more room for a UL scheduler and UL transmission, and may potentially benefit the round trip delay in the TDD system.

- Radio communication systems, such as a wireless data networks (e.g., Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, spread spectrum systems (such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks, etc.), provide users with the convenience of mobility along with a rich set of services and features. This convenience has spawned significant adoption by an ever growing number of consumers as an accepted mode of communication for business and personal uses. To promote greater adoption, the telecommunication industry, from manufacturers to service providers, has agreed at great expense and effort to develop standards for communication protocols that underlie the various services and features.

-
FIG. 1 is a diagram of a communication system capable of providing efficient acknowledgment signaling, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. As shown, acommunication system 100 includes one or more user equipment (UEs) 101 communicating with a network equipment (or network element), such as abase station 103, which is part of an access network (e.g., WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), 3GPP LTE (or E-UTRAN or 3.9G), etc.). By way of example, thecommunication system 100 is compliant with a 3GPP LTE architecture. Under the 3GPP LTE architecture (as shown inFIGS. 6A-6D ),base station 103 is denoted as an enhanced Node B (eNB). The UE 101 can be any type of mobile stations, such as handsets, terminals, stations, units, devices, or any type of interface to the user (such as “wearable” circuitry, etc.). - The UE 101 includes a
transceiver 105 and anantenna system 107 that couples to thetransceiver 105 to receive or transmit signals from thebase station 103. Theantenna system 107 can include one or more antennas (of which only one is shown). Accordingly, thebase station 103 can employ one ormore antennas 109 for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals. As with the UE 101, thebase station 103 employs atransceiver 111, which transmits information over a downlink (DL) to the UE 101. - The
base station 103, in an exemplary embodiment, uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Divisional Multiplexing) as a downlink (DL) transmission scheme and a single-carrier transmission (e.g., SC-FDMA (Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access) with cyclic prefix for the uplink (UL) transmission scheme. SC-FDMA can be realized also using DFT-S-OFDM principle, which is detailed in 3GGP TR 25.814, entitled “Physical Layer Aspects for Evolved UTRA,” v.1.5.0, May 2006 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). SC-FDMA, also referred to as Multi-User-SC-FDMA, allows multiple users to transmit simultaneously on different sub-bands. - In one embodiment, the
communication system 100 employs a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique to increase the air interference throughput and spectrum efficiency. Acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) signaling is part of HARQ, for connecting a transmitter and a receiver, to enable the fast L1 (Layer 1 or Physical Layer) retransmission. As such, the UE 101 and thebase station 103 includeacknowledgement signaling logic 1113 and 115 to determine occurrence of transmission errors and to notify the source of the transmission of the errors, according to the HARQ mechanism. In one embodiment, thesystem 100 addresses the uplink (UL) ACK/NACK in downlink (DL) transmission, particularly for LTE TDD system, and thus, is provided with an efficient, lower-overhead and robust acknowledgement signaling approach. - ACK/NACK signaling requires sufficient robustness to avoid neither retransmitting successfully received data packet nor transmitting new data packet before successful receipt the on-the-air old data packet. On the other hand, due to fast L1 retransmission, the frequency of ACK/NACK transmission to the designated receiver is very high (e.g., up to 1000 Hz), thus, transmission efficiency of ACK/NACK is desired to minimize the signaling overhead. The
system 100, according to one embodiment, utilizes an acknowledgement signaling scheme that provides transmission efficiency, as detailed inFIGS. 2A-2C . -
FIGS. 2A-2C are flowcharts of processes for providing efficient acknowledgment signaling, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, the acknowledgment signaling processes are explained with respect to the system ofFIG. 1 . As shown inFIG. 2A , instep 201, a predetermined number of acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement (AN) channels is designated for corresponding transmission channels. This assignment of AN channels can be performed by thebase station 103 usingacknowledgement signaling logic 115. By way of example, a certain number of UL ACK/NACK (AN) channels can be defined in L1 downlink control signaling per each radio frame or duplex space, wherein each UL ACK/NACK channel is corresponded with one UL subframe transmission of a UL share data channel. Instep 203, a message is generated for indicating a mapping of the AN channels to the transmission channels. This message is then transmitted, as instep 205, to theUE 101. - On the receiver side (as shown in
FIG. 2B ), a control message is received by theUE 101, wherein the message specifies a mapping of AN channels to transmission channels, perstep 211. In this example, theUE 101 has data to transmit, and thus, is assigned one of the transmission channels to carry the data. Instep 213, the data is transmitted over the one or more transmission channels; theUE 101 then monitors the corresponding AN channels for acknowledgement signaling. Thereafter, theUE 101 receives, as instep 215, appropriate acknowledgement signaling in response to the data that was transmitted. -
FIG. 2C shows an example of how the above processes are performed. Under this scenario, the system 100 (specifically, theBS 103, for example) defines, as instep 221, a number of UL AN channels in downlink control signal for each radio frame or a duplex space. For example, a number of UL ACK/NACK (AN) channels is predefined in a layer 1 (L1 or physical layer) downlink control signaling per each radio frame or duplex space. Each UL AN channel supports transmission of ACK/NACK bits for the corresponding one of the UL subframe. - The
UE 101 obtains position of UL AN channels, perstep 223. If thesystem 100 provides an implicit allocation for the AN channels (as determined in step 225), then, perstep 227, thesystem 100 determines the AN channel based on the UL subframe. However, if thesystem 100 does not provide for implicit allocation, a signaling message is transmitted for conveying the position of the UL AN channels within the downlink, as instep 229. - In the context of a TDD system, the
UE 101 can learn of its UL ACK/NACK bit(s) in the DL by a predefined implicit resource allocation or through use of minimal signaling overhead. Because there can be multiple UL and DL subframes in one TDD frame or one duplex space, and multiple scheduled UE in one UL subframe, the implicit allocation can be viewed in two parts. First, the time position of the ACK/NACK corresponding to the data transmission in the ith UL subframe; and second, multiplexing of ACK/NACKs for different UEs that transmitted UL data in the ith UL subframe. - A predefined mapping can be designated to indicate on which DL subframe to transmit the ACK for the data in the ith UL subframes. In an exemplary embodiment, the AN channels are mapped on a one-to-one (unique) basis to different UL subframes. Thus, as long as the
UE 101 knows which UL subframe it is transmitting UL data packet (theUE 101 should know already before it gets ready to receive the ACK/NACK), theUE 101 will know uniquely which AN channel it should listen for. WhenUE 101 is transmitting data in multiple UL subframe, theUE 101 will then listen for multiple AN channels for its ACK/NACK bits. - To appreciate the above processes, it is instructive to examine other mechanisms for acknowledgment signaling.
-
FIGS. 3A and 3B are diagrams showing exemplary systems providing schedule signaling timing/logic for frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD), respectively. As shown, in one duplex space (5 ms in the example) DL scheduling signaling operates in similar manner for both FDD andTDD configurations -
FIGS. 4A and 4B are diagrams showing exemplary systems for FDD uplink (UL) acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) timing and TDD UL ACK/NACK timing, respectively. One conventional acknowledgement signaling mechanism involves the use of a user equipment identifier (ID). It is noted that attaching the user equipment ID as the destination identity to ACK/NACK bits is clearly inefficient because the ACK/NACK signal typically has only one or two bit per user equipment depending on the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) scheme that is employed, while the UE ID must be longer than that ACK/NACK bit, e.g. in LTE the UE-ID is assumed to be 16-bit signature. Therefore (because of the increase in overhead), indicating the destination without signaling the UE ID is desirable for efficient ACK/NACK transmission and improving the ACK/NACK bit error rate—i.e., robustness. - As seen in
FIG. 4A , the FDD UL ACK/NACK timing of theFDD system 401 is rather straightforward. However, in the time division duplex (TDD)system 403, there is frequently more than one UL subframe transmission that requires multiple UL ACK/NACK in the DL transmission (as shown inFIG. 4B ). Besides UE-ID, this raises additional time-domain dimension of the ACK/NACK signal's destination identity. - Also, other conventional approaches, in the case of TDD, can result in time-domain ambiguity when transmitting UL ACK/NACK in the DL subframe.
- By contrast, the processes of
FIGS. 2A-2C minimize the UL ACK/NACK bit (e.g., as low as 1 or 2 bits per UE (depending on MIMO deployment)) as well as maintain good robustness in the TDD system, particularly when the number of UL subframes is more than the number of DL subframes in a radio frame. -
FIG. 5 is a diagram of exemplary TDD UL ACK/NACK channels in the downlink, according to an embodiment of the invention. In this example, the acknowledgment signaling approach, according to certain embodiments, addresses UL ACK/NACK transmission in a TDD system. Assuming there are m UL subframes in everyradio frame 501, thebase station 103 defines m UL ANchannels 503 in downlink control signaling in thatradio frame 501. These m UL ANchannels 503 can be pre-allocated in one or a few of all or all downlink subframes; the position of these m UL ANchannels 503 can be static, semi-static, or even dynamic depending on the overall LTE system requirement. The position of these m UL ANchannels 503, in an exemplary embodiment, is signaled or broadcasted to all UE via radio resource control (RRC) signaling (static or semi-static), broadcast channel (BCH) signaling (static or semi-static or dynamic), or Cat0 signaling (static or semi-static or dynamic). - Each
UL AN channel 503 can transmit UL ACK/NACK bits for the scheduledUE 101 in previous known subframe (TTI) by, for instance, various reliable and efficient known methods. Additionally, the timing requirement can be specified such that the needed processing time defines the smallest/shortest duration until an ACK/NACK can be transmitted. In the LTE example, this smallest/shortest duration can be a value (e.g., 1 ms) that satisfies the processing time and fits into numerology (for instance, ˜400 μs is acceptable for decoding the longest Turbo code block). As shown, it is observed that AN-3 can be mapped only into DL subframe-2, but not DL subframe-1 because processing time is insufficient. - Furthermore, the ACK-NACK in the same DL subframe can multiplexed using various standard techniques (e.g., frequency division multiplexing, code division multiplexing, or a hybrid scheme), and the
UE 101 can determine the exact position within one AN channel by indexing theUE 101 within an AN channel. It is contemplated that other techniques can be employed as well. Under these approaches, a base station (e.g., base station 103), in subframe k, informs a terminal (e.g., UE-n) of the UL radio resources assignment using x-th L1/L2 control channel; and in subframe k+t, the base station transits UL AN to the UE-n using the x-th radio resources in AN channel (x-th sub-carrier set or x-th code). - The above acknowledgement signaling approach provides an efficient and robust technique that minimizes the required bits for UL ACK/NACK transmission in DL down to the least, i.e., 1 bit per user equipment. Also, the approach is flexible and consistent to support a variety of downlink/uplink configuration scenarios in a TDD system, and an UL AN channel structure for other non-dynamic scheduled user equipment. Further, the approach provides the flexibility of maintaining UL AN channel position in the TDD system, i.e. not necessarily to have UL AN channel in each of DL subframe or have only one UL AN channel in each of DL subframe. This may leave more room for a UL scheduler and UL transmission, and may potentially benefit the round trip delay in the TDD system.

FIGS. 6A-6D are diagrams of communication systems having exemplary LTE architectures, in which the system ofFIG. 1A can operate, according to various exemplary embodiments of the invention. By way of example (shown inFIG. 1 ), the base station and the UE can communicate insystem 600 using any access scheme, such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) or Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) or a combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, both uplink and downlink can utilize WCDMA. In another exemplary embodiment, uplink utilizes SC-FDMA, while downlink utilizes OFDMA. - The MME (Mobile Management Entity)/
Serving Gateways 601 are connected to the eNBs in a full or partial mesh configuration using tunneling over a packet transport network (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) network) 603. Exemplary functions of the MME/Serving GW 601 include distribution of paging messages to the eNBs, IP header compression, termination of U-plane packets for paging reasons, and switching of U-plane for support of UE mobility. Since theGWs 601 serve as a gateway to external networks, e.g., the Internet orprivate networks 603, theGWs 601 include an Access, Authorization and Accounting system (AAA) 605 to securely determine the identity and privileges of a user and to track each user's activities. Namely, theMME Serving Gateway 601 is the key control-node for the LTE access-network and is responsible for idle mode UE tracking and paging procedure including retransmissions. Also, theMME 601 is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is responsible for selecting the SGW (Serving Gateway) for a UE at the initial attach and at time of intra-LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. - A more detailed description of the LTE interface is provided in 3GPP TR 25.813, entitled “E-UTRA and E-UTRAN: Radio Interface Protocol Aspects,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- In
FIG. 6B , acommunication system 602 supports GERAN (GSM/EDGE radio access) 604, andUTRAN 606 based access networks,E-UTRAN 612 and non-3GPP (not shown) based access networks, and is more fully described in TR 23.882, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A key feature of this system is the separation of the network entity that performs control-plane functionality (MME 608) from the network entity that performs bearer-plane functionality (Serving Gateway 610) with a well defined open interface between them S11. SinceE-UTRAN 612 provides higher bandwidths to enable new services as well as to improve existing ones, separation ofMME 608 from ServingGateway 610 implies that ServingGateway 610 can be based on a platform optimized for signaling transactions. This scheme enables selection of more cost-effective platforms for, as well as independent scaling of, each of these two elements. Service providers can also select optimized topological locations of ServingGateways 610 within the network independent of the locations ofMMEs 608 in order to reduce optimized bandwidth latencies and avoid concentrated points of failure. - The basic architecture of the
system 602 contains following network elements. As seen inFIG. 6B , the E-UTRAN (e.g., eNB) 612 interfaces with UE via LTE-Uu. TheE-UTRAN 612 supports LTE air interface and includes functions for radio resource control (RRC) functionality corresponding to thecontrol plane MME 608. The E-UTRAN 612 also performs a variety of functions including radio resource management, admission control, scheduling, enforcement of negotiated uplink (UL) QoS (Quality of Service), cell information broadcast, ciphering/deciphering of user, compression/decompression of downlink and uplink user plane packet headers and Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP). - The
MME 608, as a key control node, is responsible for managingmobility UE 101 identifies and security parameters and paging procedure including retransmissions. TheMME 608 is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is also responsible for choosingServing Gateway 610 for the UE.MME 608 functions include Non Access Stratum (NAS) signaling and related security.MME 608 checks the authorization of theUE 101 to camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces UE roaming restrictions. TheMME 608 also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at theMME 608 from the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) 614. The principles of PLMN selection in E-UTRA are based on the 3GPP PLMN selection principles. Cell selection can be required on transition from MME_DETACHED to EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED. The cell selection can be achieved when the UE NAS identifies a selected PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. TheUE 101 searches the E-UTRA frequency bands and for each carrier frequency identifies the strongest cell. TheUE 101 also reads cell system information broadcast to identify its PLMNs. Further, theUE 101 seeks to identify a suitable cell; if it is not able to identify a suitable cell, it seeks to identify an acceptable cell. When a suitable cell is found or if only an acceptable cell is found, theUE 101 camps on that cell and commences the cell reselection procedure. Cell selection identifies the cell that theUE 101 should camp on. - The
SGSN 614 is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile stations within its geographical service area. Its tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility management, logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The S6a interface enables transfer of subscription and authentication data for authenticating/authorizing user access to the evolved system (AAA interface) betweenMME 608 and HSS (Home Subscriber Server) 616. The S10 interface betweenMMEs 608 provides MME relocation andMME 608 toMME 608 information transfer. TheServing Gateway 610 is the node that terminates the interface towards the E-UTRAN 612 via S1-U. - The S1-U interface provides a per bearer user plane tunneling between the E-UTRAN 612 and Serving
Gateway 610. It contains support for path switching during handover betweeneNBs 612. The S4 interface provides the user plane with related control and mobility support betweenSGSN 614 and the 3GPP Anchor function of ServingGateway 610. - The S12 is an interface between
UTRAN 606 and ServingGateway 610. Packet Data Network (PDN)Gateway 618 provides connectivity to theUE 101 to external packet data networks by being the point of exit and entry of traffic for theUE 101. ThePDN Gateway 618 performs policy enforcement, packet filtering for each user, charging support, lawful interception and packet screening. Another role of thePDN Gateway 618 is to act as the anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies such as WiMax and 3GPP2 (CDMA 1X and EvDO (Evolution Data Only)). - The S7 interface provides transfer of QoS policy and charging rules from PCRF (Policy and Charging Role Function) 620 to Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) in the
PDN Gateway 618. The SGi interface is the interface between the PDN Gateway and the operator's IP services includingpacket data network 622.Packet data network 622 may be an operator external public or private packet data network or an intra operator packet data network, e.g., for provision of IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) services. Rx+ is the interface between the PCRF and thepacket data network 622. - As seen in
FIG. 6C , the eNB utilizes an E-UTRA (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) (user plane, e.g., RLC (Radio Link Control) 615, MAC (Media Access Control) 617, and PHY (Physical) 619, as well as a control plane (e.g., RRC 621)). TheeNB 103 also includes the following functions: Inter Cell RRM (Radio Resource Management) 623,Connection Mobility Control 625, RB (Radio Bearer)Control 627,Radio Admission Control 629, eNB Measurement Configuration andProvision 631, and Dynamic Resource Allocation (Scheduler) 633. - The
eNB 103 communicates with the aGW 601 (Access Gateway) via an S1 interface. TheaGW 601 includes aUser Plane 601 a and aControl plane 601 b. Thecontrol plane 601 b provides the following components: SAE (System Architecture Evolution)Bearer Control 635 and MM (Mobile Management)Entity 637. Theuser plane 601 b includes a PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) 639 and a user plane functions 641. It is noted that the functionality of theaGW 601 can also be provided by a combination of a serving gateway (SGW) and a packet data network (PDN) GW. TheaGW 601 can also interface with a packet network, such as theInternet 643. - In an alternative embodiment, as shown in
FIG. 6D , the PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) functionality can reside in the eNB rather than theGW 601. Other than this PDCP capability, the eNB functions ofFIG. 6C are also provided in this architecture. - In the system of
FIG. 6D , a functional split between E-UTRAN and EPC (Evolved Packet Core) is provided. In this example, radio protocol architecture of E-UTRAN is provided for the user plane and the control plane. A more detailed description of the architecture is provided in 3GPP TS 36.300. - The eNB interfaces via the S1 to the
Serving Gateway 645, which includes aMobility Anchoring function 647, and to a Packet Gateway (P-GW) 649, which provides an UE IPaddress allocation function 657 andPacket Filtering function 659. According to this architecture, the MME (Mobility Management Entity) 661 provides SAE (System Architecture Evolution)Bearer Control 651, IdleState Mobility Handling 653, NAS (Non-Access Stratum)Security 655. - One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the processes for acknowledgement signaling may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware, or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below with respect to
FIG. 7 . -

In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. In another example, reconfigurable hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be used, in which the functionality and connection topology of its logic gates are customizable at run-time, typically by programming memory look up tables.

Further, thecommunication interface 715 can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. - The
processor 703 may execute the transmitted code while being received and/or store the code in thestorage device 709, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, thecomputing system 700 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave. - The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the
processor 703 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as thestorage device 709. Volatile media include dynamic memory, such asmain memory 705. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise thebus 701. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read. - Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem or via a wireless link. A modem of a local system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.
