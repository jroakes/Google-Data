- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to help explain the social networks and methods illustrated in FIGS. 2-4 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a social network 200 .
- the social network 200 comprises a graph comprising vertices 202 - 212 and edges 220 - 234 .
- the vertices 202 - 212 comprise profiles A-F. Each profile can represent a member.
- the edges 218 - 234 comprise associations between profiles.
- the social network 200 comprises a plurality of differing types of associations represented by edges 220 - 234 .
- the types of associations listed in FIG. 2 for illustration purposes are business associations, activity partner associations, friendship associations, community associations, and common characteristic associations.
- Common characteristic associations can include associations based on some characteristic such as attending the same high school or being from the same hometown, but can indicate a lower level of significance that another type of association, such as a friendship association.
- edge 220 and edge 222 each comprise an association between profile A at vertex 202 and Profile D at vertex 208 .
- the edge 220 represents a business association
- the edge 222 represents a friendship association.
- Profile A is also associated with profile E by a common characteristic association comprising edge 218 .
- the association between profile A and profile E may be more attenuated than the association between profile A and D, but the association can still be represented by the social network depicted in FIG. 2 .
- Each member represented by the profiles A-F comprising the vertices 202 - 212 is a person. Other types of members can be in social network 200 .
- the associations 220 - 234 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise bi-directional associations.
- the associations are bi-directional because when one profile, for example profile A, is associated with another profile, for example profile D, then profile D is also associated with profile A.
- a and D will not be associated with each other until both profiles consent to such association; e.g., A may invite D to be associated therewith, and the association occurs upon D's acceptance of such invitation.
- the invitation for example, may include sending an email or other message to D indicating that A has requested an association with D.
- Other embodiments of the present invention may comprise directed associations or other types of associations.
- Directed associations associate a first profile with a second profile while not requiring the second profile to be associated with the first profile.
- profile A can be associated by a friendship association with profile B
- profile B can be unassociated by a friendship connection with profile A.
- a display of profile A's friends would include profile B, but a display of profile B's friends would not include profile A.
- a degree of separation can be determined for associated profiles.
- One method of determining a degree of separation is to determine the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles. This method of determining a degree of separation can produce a type-specific degree of separation.
- a type-specific degree of separation is a degree of separation determined based on one particular type of association. For example, a profile A has a friend association degree of separation of two from profile E. The fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 220 and the friendship association comprising edge 234 .
- the degree of friendship separation determined according to one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, is two.
- a common characteristic degree of separation can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- the common characteristic association degree of separation is one.
- the common characteristic in this example can be that profile A attended the same high school as profile E.
- a common characteristic association may be selected by profiles A and E to represent that they are associated in some fashion, but to not create a close association such as with a friendship association.
- the degree of separation may be determined by use of a weighting factor assigned to each association. For example, close friendships can be weighted higher than more distant friendships. According to certain aspects of embodiments using a weighting factor, a higher weighting factor for an association can reduce the degree of separation between profiles and lower weighting factors can increase the degree of separation. This can be accomplished, for example, by establishing an inverse relationship between each associations and a corresponding weighting factor prior to summing the associations. Thus, highly weighted associations would contribute less to the resulting sum than lower weighted associations.
- Methods according to the present invention may be implemented by, for example, a processor-executable program code stored on a computer-readable medium.
- One embodiment of a method according to the present invention includes outputting an information request interface, wherein the information request interface provides a user with the ability to request information from at least one member of a social network associated with the user; receiving an information request from the user; and notifying one or more members of the social network of the user's information request.
- Another embodiment of a method of the present invention can include outputting an information request interface, wherein the information request interface provides a user with the ability to request information from at least one member of a social network associated with the user; receiving an information request from the user; notifying one or more members of the social network of the user's information request; outputting an information delivery interface, wherein the information delivery interface provides one or more members of the social network with the ability to provide the requested information to the user; displaying information provided by one or more members; and updating a profile of a member that provides information in response to the information request to indicate that the member responded.
- a user of a social network can request a wide variety of information from members of the social network.
- the term “user” will refer to a member of a social network that requests information or assistance from other members of the social network as set forth herein. While the “user” is understood to be a member of the social network, the term “user” was selected to differentiate this member from the other members of the social network who may provide assistance or the requested information. A different term was selected in order better explain the present invention without having to continually modify the term “member.”
- the information request can include a recommendation request, an advice request, or a request for assistance.
- categories of requests are not intended to be mutually exclusive (e.g., an information request, in some embodiments, may be both a recommendation request and an advice request). Further, other categories of requests, while not specifically recited herein, can also be encompassed by the term information request.
- recommendation requests can include, without limitation, restaurant recommendations, recipe recommendations, beverage recommendations, wine recommendations, movie recommendations, music recommendations, television show recommendations, recommendations for medical professionals, college/university recommendations, recommendations for computers and computer-related accessories, recommendations for electronic equipment (e.g., media players, televisions, speakers, cameras, digital cameras, speakers, etc.), automobile recommendations, Internet service provider recommendations, vacation recommendations, and many other types of recommendations.
- electronic equipment e.g., media players, televisions, speakers, cameras, digital cameras, speakers, etc.
- automobile recommendations e.g., Internet service provider recommendations, vacation recommendations, and many other types of recommendations.
- advice when a user requests advice, the user may be in a situation where he is unsure about how to proceed, how to respond, or how to otherwise act (or not act), and seeks advice from members of the social network to assist with his decision based on the members' past experiences, or even based on the members' initial reactions to the situation.
- Examples of advice requests can include, without limitation, relationship advice (e.g., issues involving significant others, family, friends, co-workers, etc.), computer advice, automobile repair advice, home improvement/repair advice, gardening advice, and many other types of advice.
- a request for assistance can include search assistance, such that a user requests assistance from members of the social network in locating information on a network (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, WAN, LAN, the social network, etc.).
- a network e.g., the Internet, an intranet, WAN, LAN, the social network, etc.

This flexibility can advantageously allow a user to protect the privacy or confidentiality of the user's information request (e.g., if the information request is personal or of a sensitive nature), to notify members that are more likely to possess or be aware of the information being sought, and to expand the scope of the members notified if more narrow notifications are unsuccessful, as well as other advantages.
- the user can specify the names of the members that are to be notified. In other embodiments, the user can specify that every member of a community within the social network should be notified. In other embodiments, the user can specify that every member of the social network should be notified.
- the user in some embodiments, can specify members having a particular association with the user and/or a particular degree of separation with the user. For example, the user can specify that only members having a friendship degree of separation of one are to be notified of the request. As another example, if a user is planning a family gathering, the user may specify that only members having a family association are to be notified.
- the user can also utilize other associations, such as common characteristic associations, to advantageously notify members that are more likely to possess, have access to, or be aware of the requested information. For example, if the user is seeking recommendations for a Thai restaurant in San Francisco, the user may only notify members that reside in San Francisco or for whom San Francisco is their hometown. The user may also specify that only members that list Thai cuisine as one of their favorite foods are to be notified.

For example, information requests that have received new or unviewed responses can be displayed on a client device in a different font, in a different color, with an icon beside the information request, or with a short message beside the information request (e.g., “2 new responses received”).
- the user can view all of the responses to the information request, from the same member or from a plurality of members, at the same time.
- the information responses provided by a plurality of members can be displayed at a common location, such as a web page, a document, a spreadsheet, or other file.
- other information can also be displayed, such as, for example, the name of the member that provided the requested information, the member's email address or other ways in which the user might contact the member, a link to the member's profile, the date and/or time the information was submitted, and other information.
- the user can indicate that he has received the requested information. For example, when the user receives the requested information or when the user no longer wishes to receive information, the user can click a button, click on an icon, select a menu item, enter a keystroke, or take other action to indicate that he no longer wishes to receive information.
- any notifications that may have been provided to members that have not yet viewed the information request can be removed. For example, if an icon appeared in the profile of a member to indicate that an information request had been made, the icon can be removed. If the member received another type of notification (e.g., a message), the message can be removed or recalled.
- the user may want to keep the requested information private, while in other embodiments, the user may believe that other members may be interested in the requested information. For example, if the user was seeking relationship advice, the user may want to keep the information received private.
- the information request interface can allow a user to specify that any responses to the information request are to be displayed only to the user.
- the user in some embodiments, can also specify that certain responses to the information request are to be displayed only to the user.
- the user can specify that a particular response be kept private, that some responses be kept private, or that all responses be kept private.
- the user can specify that only the members who received the information request can view the responses.
- the user can choose to have the information request and all responses available for viewing.
- the information request interface can allow the user to specify that the information request and responses can be viewed by others.
- the user in some embodiments, can specify which members should be allowed to view the information request and the responses. These members can be the same ones that received the notification, can be a broader group (e.g., all members of the social network), or can be a narrower group.
- the requested information may be such that the user believes that other members of the social network may be interested in viewing the responses. In such embodiments, the user can choose not to restrict access to the responses.
- the user can distribute the information request and the information received to members of the social network. The user can choose to distribute the information in the same manner that the user can choose to notify members of the information request initially. For example, in some embodiments, the user can specify the names of the members that are to receive the information. The user, in some embodiments, can specify members having a particular association with the user and/or a particular degree of separation with the user.
- Embodiments of the present invention can allow a user to modify the members of the social network that are notified of the information request.
- the user may specify an initial group of members to receive the information request (e.g., members having a family degree of separation of one with the user), but may not receive the requested information from that initial group.
- the user in some embodiments, can modify the scope of members notified. For example, if user initially notified members having a family degree of separation of one, the user could broaden the scope to notify members that have a family degree of separation of two or less and members that have a friendship degree of separation of one.
- a social network engine in some embodiments, could ensure that members who were initially notified of the information request would not be notified again when the user broadened the scope.
- the user can notify one or more members of the social network that do not have a close association with the user. For example, the user could ask the social network engine to notify other members of the social network, even those not having an association with the user, of the user's information request. In some embodiments, the user can ask the social network to notify members of the social network that are most likely to have the requested information. In some embodiments, the user can ask the social network to notify members of a community within the social network.
- the user can request notification of other members of the social network if the one or more members initially notified do not provide the requested information to the user within a predetermined period of time.
- the user in some embodiments, can specify the predetermined period of time.
- the user can also specify which additional members (e.g., additional associations and/or degrees of separation) should be notified or can request that the social network determine and notify members most likely to provide the requested information.
- Embodiments of the present invention can monitor and track the information requests to which a member responds.
- the member profile of a member that provides information in response to the information request can be updated to indicate that the member responded.
- a social network engine can update the member's profile in a social network database to indicate that the member responded.
- the member's profile may not be updated for providing multiple responses to the same information request once the profile has been updated to indicate that an initial response was provided.
- data related to the subject matter of the information request to which a member responds can be stored. Such data can be used to determine the subject areas in which the member may be interested in providing assistance.
- a user that submitted an information request can rate the quality of a member's response to the information request.
- the quality of a member's responses to information requests can also be tracked. For example, when a user views a response to her information request, the user can be provided with the option to rate the response.
- the rating system can be based on any number of rating scales (e.g., numerical ratings, alphabetical ratings, star ratings, etc.), although the same rating system can be used for all members in the social network for consistency.
- the rating in some embodiments, can be stored in the member's profile.
- a member's profile can include an average response rating, which may be the average of all ratings submitted for the member's responses to information requests.
- Embodiments of the present invention can advantageously use the data related to a member's responses to information requests.
- the number of responses to information requests by a member, the subjects of information requests to which the member responds, and/or the quality of the member's responses can be used to determine the likelihood that a member might respond to subsequent information requests. Such determinations can be made by a social network engine.
- a user may specify that a social network engine should notify the members of the social network most likely to respond to the user's information request.
- the social network engine could determine the subject matter of the information request, or ask the user to identify the subject matter of the information request.
- the social network engine can then search a social network database to identify the members most likely to respond by considering data related to the number of responses to information requests by a member, the subjects of information requests to which the member responds, and/or the quality of the member's responses for each member, or for a subset of the total members.
- the social network engine can also consider other data in a member's profile, such as whether the member has an interest or interests similar to the subject of the information request, in determining which members to notify. For example, if a user requests recommendations for classical music compact discs, the social network engine might identify members that list classical music as interest and notify them of the information request. To narrow the list of members to notify, the social network engine might also consider the data mentioned above, including number of responses to information requests, the subjects of responses to information requests, and/or the quality of the member's responses.
- Data related to a member's responses to information requests can also be used, in some embodiments of the present invention, to provide benefits to members who respond to information requests.
- Some embodiments of the present invention can include providing a benefit to a member that provides information in response to a predetermined number of information requests.
- Some embodiments can also consider the quality of the member's responses in determining whether to provide a benefit. For example, a fewer number of the highest rated responses can be required to receive the benefit.
- members might acquire “points,” “social dollars,” or some other form data that can be awarded to members based on the quantity and/or quality of their responses to information requests.
- any number of benefits can be provided to members that qualify to receive the benefit.
- Examples of such benefits can include, without limitation, gift certificates, clothing, mugs, money, access to premium content in the social network, tickets, travel vouchers, invitations to parties or other social gatherings, and others.
- the social network can comprise a store where a member can use “points” or “social dollars” to purchase items, services, access to premium content, or other benefits.
- the member's “points” or “social dollars” can be decreased by the purchased amount.
- Members might also be assigned titles or names based on the quantity and/or quality of responses to information requests. Such title or names can be whimsical or fun, in some embodiments, while still giving some indication of the member's willingness to assist.
- While the social network can provide incentives for members of the social network to respond to information requests, some members of a social network may not want to be notified of information requests. In some embodiments, a member of the social network may elect not to be notified of information requests. In such embodiments, the social network engine will not notify the member of an information request, even if the member falls within the group of members identified by the user to be notified.
- Embodiments of the present invention can be directed to information requests that are requests for search assistance.
- a user may request assistance from members of the social network in locating information on a network (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, WAN, LAN, the social network, etc.).
- Some embodiments may use search records, which are discussed in more detail below.
- One embodiment of a method can include generating a search record comprising data related to at least one search of a network, wherein the at least one search is based on an information request from a user of a social network; outputting the search record to at least one member of the social network; and updating the search record to include data related to at least one additional search of the network by the at least one member of the social network.
- a user may be trying to locate information on a network (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, WAN, LAN, the social network, etc.).
- the user can be searching for any type of information that might be found on such networks, such as files, data, reference information about a topic, goods, services, people, directions, contact information, and other information.
- the user may use a search engine, such as GOOGLE, to facilitate the search.
- the user may determine that he needs assistance finding the information. For example, the user may not find any information, or the user may find some information but suspect that better information exists. In some embodiments, the user may determine that he needs assistance from the outset and may not conduct any searches on his own.
