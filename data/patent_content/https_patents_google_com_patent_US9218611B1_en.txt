- an advertiser selects a bid for an advertisement in an Ad Group or an Ad Campaign that the advertiser wants displayed on the Internet using an ad auction application, such as Google AdWords.
- the system provides the advertiser with information to allow the advertiser to determine the necessary bid to reach a targeted number of unique users.
- a unique identifier can be stored as a cookie.
- Cookies can be deleted from user devices, such as by a user deleting cookies, a browser deleting cookies (e.g., upon browser exit, based on a browser preference setting), or some other software (e.g., anti-spyware software) deleting cookies.
- cookies are deleted from a user device, a new cookie will be set on the user's device when the user visits a web page.
- the new cookie may be used to store a new quasi-unique identifier, and thus subsequent user interaction data that occurs on the user device may be associated with a different identifier. Therefore, because each user identifier is considered to represent a different user, the user interaction data associated with the deleted cookies are identified as being associated with a different user than the user interaction data that is associated with the new cookies.
- Described herein are illustrative embodiments for providing an advertiser with pertinent information, in the form of a user landscapes report, for providing the advertiser with information about a relationship between traffic, cost (or budget) and bid for content ads of an ad group and/or an ad campaign (or for an entire ad group or ad campaign).
- Some of these embodiments can be used with the Google Display Network (GDN), or with other types of online auction applications in which ads participating in an online auction are input to a ad server to determine which of those ads will win the auctions.
- GDN Google Display Network
- the output of the ad server (e.g., which ads won the auction and which ads lost the auction) is fed to a log file as an offline (e.g., batch) process, referred to as a landscapes pipeline.
- a server that determine a minimum bid for each ad to win each auction of each unique online user, a lowest bid for each ad to win each auction of each unique online user is determined, and a plurality of (bid, user) pairs for each ad are obtained. For each (bid, user) pair, the bid represents a bid necessary to win an auction for the user based on the criteria considered in the auction.
- the plurality of (bid, user) pairs are aggregated to construct a curve, or plot, which represents the relationship between the number of reached users and the bid for an ad (see, e.g., FIG. 6 ).
- an offline landscapes pipeline process is performed daily, and data from a plurality of (e.g., seven) consecutive days of landscapes data is aggregated, to obtain an N-day window (N being an integer) used to compute the number of unique users at each potential bid point for an ad, an ad group or an ad campaign.
- An ad group contains one or more ads which target a set of keywords, ad placements on a web page, or both.
- the advertiser sets a bid, or price, to be used when an ad is triggered by the keywords or placements in the ad group.
- An ad campaign may be a set of one or more ad groups of an advertiser, with each ad group serving a different purpose.
- a first ad group in an ad campaign may correspond to ads that introduce a particular product to users
- a second ad group in the ad campaign may correspond to ads that provide more details on the particular product (e.g., to be output at a later point in time after the first ad group has been shown to users)
- a third ad group in the ad campaign may correspond to other, related products of the same advertiser.
- the system may be configured to provide an advertiser with information about bid and cost relationships for an advertisement, an ad group, or an ad campaign of the advertiser.
- an advertiser can optimally set a bid for future ads, ad groups and ad campaigns, so as to maximize the ratio of advertising revenue to advertising cost.
- “landscape” in some embodiments is a relationship between traffic, cost and bid, with respect to an ad, ad group, or ad campaign.
- Traffic is the amount of users the ad was shown to (impressed to)
- cost is the amount of money that the advertiser had to pay for showing the ad to the users
- bid is the cost-per-click amount that the advertiser selected for an ad, for consideration in ad auctions that are performed due to certain online user actions.
- one type of user action that may cause an ad auction to occur is when users enter predetermined web pages that allow ads to be provided on their pages. These predetermined web pages are referred to as publishers.
- Publishers may receive revenue when ads displayed on their pages are clicked by users.
- the publishers may be provided additional revenue when those ads are converted to an actual purchase of an advertiser's product or when a user registers on the advertiser's web site that the user is sent when he/she clicked on the ad, etc.
- the types of ads to be considered for auctions due to these type of user actions may be referred to as “content ads.”
- Other definitions of “landscape” are possible with respect to some embodiments, while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention (such as a landscapes that relates different ad budgets to traffic and/or cost and/or clicks).
- a second type of user action that may cause an ad auction to occur is when users perform online searches using an online search application, such as the online search engine provided by Google.
- the keywords associated with the user's online search are compared to keywords and phrases associated with ads of an advertiser, and if there is a sufficient match, and based on other parameters such as predicted click thru rate (pCTR) of the ad and the bid entered for that ad by the advertiser (using Google AdWords application, for example), the ad may either win the auction or lose the auction to other competing ads.
- pCTR predicted click thru rate
- ad wins the auction that ad is displayed to the user along with the user's online search results, typically at a particular position (e.g., to the right of, and/or above) of the online search results screen.
- a combination of bid and quality is used by a ad server to determine which ads in a database of candidate ads “win” each auction and are thus shown to the user, whereby all ads that “lose” each auction are returned by the ad server back to the ad indexes that store the ads for consideration in current and future ad auctions.
- FIG. 1 shows an illustrative example of a web site which includes an advertisement section 120 , whereby advertisements that win an advertisement auction caused by a user entering the web site are displayed in the advertisement section 120 .
- Ad 1 there is room for three ads to be shown, Ad 1 , Ad 2 and Ad 3 , whereby the web site entered by the user also includes a non-ad section 110 that corresponds to information of the web site owner, in this case, a “Welcome Greeting” to users entering Web Site X.
- FIG. 2 shows a plurality of ad indexes 210 that store advertisements for consideration in ad auctions, in which a ad server 220 determines which of the advertisements stored in the ad indexes 210 will win an auction and thus be shown (or “impressed”) to a user that caused an auction to be performed.
- landscapes Given the relationship between traffic, cost and bid, landscapes provide information for an advertiser to determine the appropriate cost and bid levels to assign for an ad, ad group and/or ad campaign.
- a first landscape that can be determined in some embodiments is a Bid landscape, which is a cost function of bid.
- a second landscape that can be determined in some embodiments is a Cost landscape, which is a traffic function of cost.
- Other landscapes can also be determined and provided to an advertiser in a User Landscapes Report, to be described in more detail below.
- a Bid-Impression landscape for an Ad Group in the form of Imp(Bid) assumes that the bid of an Ad Group changes and every other variable, such as the bids made by other advertisers for other Ad Groups competing with the Ad Group in online auctions, stays the same.
- landscapes can be a fairly accurate barometer of information to provide to advertisers, based on the assumption of a single changing variable with all other variables non-changing.
- Y may correspond to an accumulated value over a certain time period, such as one day, or one week, or one month.
- Y may correspond to the number of impressions made by an ad for a particular bid amount X for that ad over a week's time period.
- the user landscapes report may be generated at the same time other reports are generated for a user, such as a user share report that provides the user with information as to the different set of users that an advertisement can reach.
- a Bid-Impression Landscape for an ad or Ad Group (e.g., Ad Group/Criteria, in which an ad group criteria is something that an advertiser can assign to a particular Ad Group, whereby the advertiser can assign more than one criteria to the same Ad Group in Google Ad Words), is also referred to herein as a “Bid Impression Landscapes”, or BILA.
- BILA is a function of Impressions(Bid) for an Ad Group/Criteria, and corresponds to the finest level of granularity an advertisers can place a bid upon.
- Impressions(Bid) means that for a particular bid placed by an advertiser for an ad, ad group, or ad campaign, the number of impressions made to users within a particular time period (e.g., the last seven days) is determined.
- the auction simulation determines, for increasing bid amounts (e.g., increasing in units of 1 cent in bid amount), how many of those 188 lost auctions the ad would have won with the increased bid amount.
- the bid amounts for all of the competing ads in those 188 auctions are kept constant, and only the variable associated with the bid amount of ad in question is changed (e.g., increased) to determine how many more auctions that ad would have won for different bid amounts.
- a plot of ‘bid amount versus won auctions’ is obtained for an ad, which in effect corresponds to a Bid-Impression landscape for that ad.
- the minimum bid required by an ad to win the auction is determined, and that amount is stored in a memory for that auction.
- a set of pairs of (bid, impressions) is thereby obtained, in which impressions correspond to an ad being shown to an online user due to the ad winning an auction caused by that online user.
- the set of pairs of (bid, impressions) can also be understood to correspond to the derivative function of Impressions(Bid), from a mathematical perspective.
- BILA is an increasing function as provided by the parameters set in the auction simulation unit or process (in that only one variable changes for each auction, that being the bid assigned to an ad, ad group, or ad campaign). This results in a concave plot of ‘bid versus impressions’ values in a User Landscapes Report.
- User Landscapes can be constructed for a short period of time, such as a single day, or for longer periods of time. Due to scalability reasons, tracking of users over multiple days is not desired since it takes a good deal of processing time and resources, and so a multi-day aggregation of User Landscapes is performed in some embodiments, as an average over all single-day User Landscapes during the multi-day period.
- a multi-day aggregation of User Landscapes is performed in some embodiments, as an average over all single-day User Landscapes during the multi-day period.
- software pseudo-code for performing an aggregation process of single-day User Landscapes over a multi-day period, consistent with some embodiments:
- the aggregating of 7 single-day Landscapes can be done by at least two different ways:
- the 7 day aggregation of landscapes serves at least two purposes.
- the first purpose of aggregation (the 1 st stage of aggregation) is that it smoothes the fluctuation of traffic and network environment. For example, it is a common pattern that traffic rises on weekdays and drops on weekends. Given a sliding 7-day window, the landscapes prediction is more stable than by just using data from a single day. So, in a 1st stage of aggregation, data from 7 daily landscapes curves is rolled up, or accumulated, as explained above.
- the second purpose of aggregation (a 2 nd stage of aggregation) is utilized to pick up a few points of the landscapes curve which can best represent the landscapes curve (the 7-day curve), to thereby not overload the advertiser with too much data when viewing the landscapes data report.
- criteria_id> it may receive hundreds or thousands of bid points.
- the 2 nd stage of aggregation is utilized to select a few typical points on the curve, by using different point selection algorithms as described below.
- Each different point selection algorithm defines its own “distance function” d(x, y), in which x and y are two separate points on the 7-day landscapes curve. Each point is a tuple of ⁇ bid, impressions, clicks, cost, conversions, unique_users> (whereby unique_users is associated with a bid point as discussed above).
- This is one possible point selection algorithm that may be utilized in various embodiments, in which this point selection algorithm provides for evenly spaced selected points of (click, cost).
- cookie correction is performed for online accesses that generate auctions, whereby cookie correction filters non-unique users from unique users accessing the Internet.
- cookie reset e.g., Internet
- users deleting cookies, cookies expiring users disabling their cookies
- the Internet browser used by users hiding cookies and/or providing its own “default” cookie in its place.
- the cookie correction algorithm only selects “good” cookies, which are cookies that have persisted for a period of time on the Internet (e.g., 12 hours or more). As such, a first user cookie is not counted, but rather only if the cookie is reused for at least a certain number of Internet accesses (e.g., three or more) is the cookie determined to be “seasoned” and thus counted.
- the following software pseudo code can be performed in cookie correction in an illustrative embodiment:
- Ad1_uniqueusers AuctionParticipation_ad ⁇ ⁇ 1 AuctionParticipation_ad ⁇ ⁇ 1 , goodusers * Gooduser_ad ⁇ ⁇ 1
- Auction Participation corresponds to all auctions for which advertisements of Adgroup Ad 1 participated in.
- Goodusers_ad 1 is a vector of values (including shown impressions, bid lost, budget lost, frequency capped, etc.) for adgroup Ad 1 computed using only page views from users having “seasoned” (also referred to herein as “good”) cookies.
- AuctionParticipation_ad 1 goodusers corresponds to the number of auctions participated by an advertisement of Adgroup Ad 1 on the page views of “good” users (those users having “good” cookies).
- a unique cookie id is set to an online request (e.g., a request by a user to go to a particular Internet web page that will host advertisements, or a request by a user to conduct a particular image search or keyword search on the Internet) if the request comes in without a cookie, and those cookies are treated as “not good” cookies.
- an online request e.g., a request by a user to go to a particular Internet web page that will host advertisements, or a request by a user to conduct a particular image search or keyword search on the Internet
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing the steps of cookie correction utilized in the formation of a user landscapes report, according to several embodiments of the invention.
- step 360 it is determined whether a user query has an associated cookie. If the request does not have an associated cookie, then in step 365 that user query is provided with a unique cookie ID that is set for users without cookies.
- step 370 it is determined if the corresponding cookie is “seasoned” (e.g., is “good”). If the cookie is seasoned, then it is counted in step 375 . If the cookie is not seasoned, then in step 380 that user query is provided with a unique cookie ID that is set for users without seasoned cookies.
- seasoned e.g., is “good”.
- step 385 all of the user requests made within a predetermined time period (e.g., the last 24 hours) are extrapolated upwards to account for users without cookies.
- step 390 a user landscapes report is created based on the extrapolated user landscapes data obtained in step 385 .
- cookie correction algorithm may be performed at the aggregate level, to obtain statistics that are provided in the User Landscapes Report, the individual identity of each of the unique users is preserved and not provided to an advertiser in the User Landscapes Report.
- FIG. 4 shows a User Landscapes computation system 400 consistent with various embodiments of the invention.
- Auction data is received by an identifying unit 405 , which receives auction data and which identifies auctions that occurred during a predetermined time period in which an ad participated in, and in which of those auctions the ad did not win.
- the auction data can be provided to the identifying unit 405 by an application such as Google AdWords, and/or from an Internet server or servers storing such information.
- the output of the identifying unit 405 is provided to an auction simulation unit 410 , which performs simulated auctions by changing one variable in an auction (e.g., the bid assigned to an ad) to determine the bid amount for the ad that would have resulted in the ad winning the auction that the ad participated in, and stores the results in an auction data storage unit 420 .
- the auction simulation unit 410 also may refer to historical auction data stored in a historical auction data unit 422 , which may include information as to predicted ad clicks based on ad position on a web page, in performing its auction simulations.
- An aggregation unit 430 aggregates the simulated auction data output by the auction simulation unit 410 , to provide a multi-day auction data, which is provided to a report generating unit 440 that outputs a user landscapes report.
- the report generation unit 440 may utilize a cookie correction unit 450 to modify the user landscapes report to show data for unique users (whereby the report does not identify the unique users, and so their privacy is maintained).
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing stages in the computing of a user landscape report consistent with some embodiments of the invention.

- the report may be generated by the system in the form of display data that is transmitted to one or more client computers.
- the User Landscapes Report 600 includes a plot 610 of impressions per bid.
- the “X” in the plot 610 represents the actual number of impressions of an ad and the actual bid made by an advertiser for the ad, and the other plot points represent different ⁇ impressions, bid ⁇ values that are determined based on the computations performed by an auction simulation unit and other elements of a user landscapes computation system, such as the one shown in FIG. 4 .
- an advertiser can determine whether it makes sense for him/her to increase a bid or cost for an ad group and/or ad campaign to try to find the optimal online advertisement costs versus online advertisement revenue point.
- the user landscapes report can perform simulated auctions using lesser bids than what an advertiser actually submitted for an ad, to determine if the advertiser has been overbidding on his/her ads.

Abstract
Description
-
- Given 7 single-day Landscapes L_i={″(bid, usershare), . . . }, i is from 1 to 7
- For each bid b that appears in any Landscapes_i
- For each L_i
- If L_i does not contain b
- dd (b, usershare) into Landscapes_i
- using linear extrapolation from the closest points in L_i;
- take the ave_usershare as average of usershare at bid=b across all Landscapes;
- add (b, ave_usershare) into the aggregated Landscapes aggBL;
- aggBL now contains all bids from every input Landscapes L_i
- Run point-selection on aggBL to limit the number of bid points before output.
- If L_i does not contain b
- For each L_i
-
- 1) associate user number with each bid point, in which the bid points are selected by spacing based on (click, cost) or impressions, or
- 2) bid points selected by spacing based on user number.
These two ways of aggregating data are explained in more detail below.
D=sum{d(x[i−1],x[i])2}, whereas {x[i]|x[i] on L} and i in {0, . . . N−1}
Typically, the expected number of points needed N is less than 10.
Given the use of different point selection algorithms, different sets of bid points from the landscapes curve can be chosen and thereby provided to an advertiser in a user landscapes report.
d(x,y)=|unique_users— y−unique_users— x|
As such, between every two consecutive points on the curve, the increment of unique_users becomes relatively constant. This is another possible point selection algorithm that may be utilized in various embodiments.
