Definitions
- the invention generally relates to search engines. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for improving a search ranking using related queries.
- search engines operating in a networked computer environment such as the World Wide Web or in an individual computer can provide search results in response to entry of a user's search query.
- the search results are ranked in accordance with the search engine's scoring or ranking system or method.
- conventional search engines score or rank documents of a search result for a particular query based on the contents of the documents, such as on the number of times a keyword or particular word or phrase appears in each document in the search results.
- Documents include, for example, web pages of various formats, such as HTML, XML, XHTML; Portable Document Format (PDF) files; and word processor and application program document files.
- PDF Portable Document Format
- Other search engines base scoring or ranking on more than the content of the document.
- one known method described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web page.
- Other conventional methods involve selling a higher score or rank in search results for a particular query to third parties that want to attract users or customers to their websites.
- a user of a search engine may enter an obscure or infrequently used search query.
- conventional search engines can return unreliable search results since there is relatively little data to rank or score search results for the search query.
- the search results may be displayed as a list of links to the documents associated with the search results.
- a user may browse and visit a website associated with one or more of the search results to evaluate whether the website is relevant to the user's search query. For example, a user may manipulate a mouse or another input device and “click” on a link to a particular search result to view a website associated with the search result. In many instances, the user will browse and visit several websites provided in the search result, clicking on links associated with each of the several websites to access various websites associated with the search results before locating useful or relevant information to address the user's search query.
- the user may decide to change or modify the search query to a second, typically-related query and obtain a new or similar set of search results.
- the user may manipulate a mouse or another input device and “click” on a link to a particular search result to view a website associated with the search result.
- the user may browse and visit several websites associated with the search results returned for the second query by “clicking” on links associated with the websites returned in the search results.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems and methods that improve search rankings for a search query by using data associated with queries related to the search query.
- One aspect of an embodiment of the present invention comprises receiving a search query, and determining one or more related queries related to the search query. Such related queries may be defined and determined in a variety of ways.
- Another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention comprises determining an article (such as a web page) associated with the search query, and determining a ranking score for the article based at least in part on data associated with the related query.
- Such related query data may include one or more of a variety of data associated with the related query.
- a variety of algorithms using related query data may be applied in such systems and methods.

- the related query processor 138 determines relationships or otherwise executes a set of instructions to determine relationships between search queries, and stores relationship-type data in the related query database 120 .
- the present invention may comprise systems having different architecture than that which is shown in FIG. 1 .
- the related query database 120 and processor 138 may not be part of the search engine 124 , and may carry out modification of selection data (such as click counts) or other operations offline.
- the related query processor 138 may affect the output of the document locator 134 or other system.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 2-4 .
- the related query database 120 and clickthrough database 122 contain data gathered and stored prior to carrying out the example method of the present invention as shown in FIGS. 2-4 .
- the related query processor 138 shown determines a relationship between two search queries by recording and analyzing, for example, the proximity of one search query to another search query. For example, when a user 112 a types in a first search query such as “infinity auto” and then inputs a second search query such as “infiniti” immediately afterward, the related query processor 138 may define a relationship between the first search query and the second search query. In this example, the relationship or proximity between search queries would be defined as “back-to-back” or consecutive.
- queries “infinity auto,” relationships to queries “infiniti,” “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car” may be defined if a user 112 a inputs these queries immediately following the initial query “infinity auto.”
- Other types of relationships or proximities can be defined according to the invention and stored by the related query database 120 .
- the related query database 120 can store information that the relationship between the first search query “infinity auto” and the second search query “infiniti” should be stronger or otherwise weighted heavier than the relationship between the first search query and a third search query “luxury car.”
- a determination can be made to weight the relationship between the first search and second search query heavier than the relationship between the first search and third search query so that improved search results for subsequent search queries can be obtained from related queries.
- Types of weighting can include the number of times two search queries are input “back-to-back,” or the proximity in time that two search queries are input. Other types of weighting or similar, relationship-type data can be defined by the invention and stored by the stored by a related query database 120 .
- the related query database 120 shown includes a list of related queries for a particular query. For example, for the search query “infinity auto,” four related queries may be stored and associated with the search query “infinity auto.” These related queries can be “infiniti,” “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car.” This number of related queries is used for example purposes. In other embodiments, the number of related queries can be greater or fewer.
- the clickthrough database 122 shown stores data associated with users' selection of a search result 132 from a search engine 124 , such as from a list of documents located in response to a search query 114 .
- a user 112 a enters an input at a client device 102 a - n , such as manipulating a mouse or another input device to click on one or more URLs associated with web pages or documents of a search result 132 .
- a user “click” is generated by the user's selection of a document located in the search result 132 .
- This “click” on a document is stored in the clickthrough database 122 as a selection associated with the document's presence in a search result returned for a particular search query.
- Many other such related query lists, associated with other queries, may be stored there as well.
- clickthrough data User clicks are generally referred to as “clickthrough” data.
- the search engine 124 measures and stores the clickthrough data as well as other data related to each of the documents located in the search result 132 .
- Clickthrough data is generally an indicator of quality in a search result.
- Quality signals or clickthrough data can include, but is not limited to, whether a particular URL or document is clicked by a particular user; how often a URL, document, or web page is clicked by one or more users; and how often a particular user clicks on specific documents or web pages.
- Other types of quality signals similar to clickthrough data such as user inputs or observational type data, can be stored by a clickthrough database 122 or similar data storage devices.
- Other data related to documents located in a search result 132 that can be stored in a clickthrough database 122 or other data storage device can include, but is not limited to, how often a particular URL, document, or web page is shown in response to a search query 114 ; how many times a particular search query 114 is asked by users 112 a - n ; the age or time a particular document has been posted on a network 106 , and identity of a source of a particular document on a network 106 .
- the server 104 is in communication with the related query database 120 and the clickthrough database 122 .
- the server 104 carries out a process by which the data in the two databases 120 , 122 are used to improve the search results provided in response to a search query 114 from a user 112 a.
- One exemplary method according to the present invention comprises receiving a search query, determining a related query related to the search query, determining an article associated with the search query, and determining a ranking score for the article based at least in part on data associated with the related query.
- the related query may be related to the search query in any way, and determined to be related in any way.
- related queries include having been input as consecutive search queries by users previously (whether once or multiple times), queries input by a user within a defined time range (e.g., 30 minutes), a misspelling relationship, a numerical relationship, a mathematical relationship, a translation relationship, a synonym, antonym, or acronym relationship, or other human-conceived or human-designated association, and any computer- or algorithm-determined relationship, but the invention is not limited to any particular relationship.
- the related query data may comprise one or more of a variety of data associated with a related query in any way.
- Examples of related query data include a selection score for an article when associated with a related query (such as, for example, the number of times the article has been “clicked” when returned in search results in response to a search for the related query), a second selection score for a second article associated with the related query, and a total selection score for a plurality of articles associated with the first related query (such as, for example, the total number of clickthroughs for all or a defined number of articles when returned in search results for the related query).
- a selection score for an article when associated with a related query such as, for example, the number of times the article has been “clicked” when returned in search results in response to a search for the related query
- a second selection score for a second article associated with the related query such as, for example, the total number of clickthroughs for all or a defined number of articles when returned in search results for the related query.
- Another examples include the number of times the related query has been the subject of a search, the number of times search results for the related query have been shown to users, the number of times search results for the related query have included the first article, and the number of times search results for the related query shown have included the first article. Any data associated with the related query may be included in related query data, and these are merely examples.
- determining an article associated with the search query may comprise determining that the article is associated with both the search query and the related query (for example, the article may be returned in search results for both the search query and the related query).
- a selection score for the article when associated with the related query may be determined, and determining the ranking score for the first article may comprise determining the ranking score for the article based at least in part on the selection score.
- it is determined that the article is associated with both the search query and with the first related query by determining an initial search result for the search query, the initial search result comprising the article, and determining that a search result for the related query comprises the article as well.
- the article comprises a representation of the first article, such as a uniform resource locator.
- determining the ranking score for the article comprises determining a number of times the article was selected when presented in search results for the related query. This may be accomplished in any fashion. One example is by determining a number of clickthroughs for the article when presented in search results for the related query.
- a ranking score for an article is determined. This may be accomplished in any fashion.
- a mathematical function or algorithm may be used. One or more variables may be used in the function, including those associated with related queries and other variables.
- One example of determining a ranking score for an article comprises determining an initial ranking score for the article when associated with the search query, and calculating a mathematical function comprising the initial ranking score and the selection score.
- This mathematical function may be any of a variety of functions or algorithms.
- One such function comprises combining the initial ranking score and the selection score, weighted with at least one weighting factor.
- Other such functions comprise combining the initial ranking score and the selection score, normalized with at least one normalization factor. Again, these are only examples, and a variety of functions may be used.
- articles are ranked in relation to other articles based at least in part on related query data. For example, in one method a second article associated with the search query is determined, and a ranking score for the second article is determined based at least in part on data associated with the first related query. The first article and the second article are then ranked based at least in part on the first ranking score and the second ranking score. A search result for the search query having the first article and the second article ranked according at least in part to the first ranking score and the second ranking score may then be provided.
- a second related query related to the search query is determined, and the first ranking score for the first article is further based at least in part on data associated with the second related query.
- Data associated with one or more related queries may be used to score and rank articles and provide search results.
- FIGS. 2-4 illustrate an exemplary method 200 in accordance with the present invention in detail.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIGS. 2-4 .
- the method 200 shown provides an improvement of a search ranking using clickthrough data and related queries.
- FIGS. 2-4 represent one or more steps carried out in the exemplary method 200 .
- the example method 200 begins.
- Block 202 is followed by block 204 , in which a related query database 120 is provided. This may be accomplished by, for example, constructing such a database or establishing communication with such a database.
- the related query database 120 stores relationship-type data between a search query 114 and other search queries.
- Block 204 is followed by block 206 , in which a selection data database, in this case a clickthrough database, is provided.
- a selection data database in this case a clickthrough database
- the clickthrough database 122 stores data associated with users' clicks or inputs to a search result 132 provided by the search engine 124 , such as a list of documents, such as web pages, provided in response to a search query 114 from a user 112 a.
- Block 206 is followed by block 208 , in which a search query, in the form of a search query signal, is received by the server.
- a search query in the form of a search query signal
- a user 112 a generates a search query 114 at a client device 102 a .
- the client device 102 transmits an associated search query signal 126 reflecting the search query 114 to the server device 104 via a network 106 .
- the search engine 124 receives the search query signal 126 and processes the search query 114 .

- the related query processor 138 receives the initial search result.
- a related query signal function reflects a score for a document that includes data associated with at least one query related to the search query.
- the related query signal function determines a weighted value for each document in the initial search result depending upon the number of times other users have previously clicked or otherwise selected the particular document as a part of the initial search result, and upon the number of times other users have previously clicked or otherwise selected the particular document as part of search results for other queries related to the search query.

- Examples of variables that may be included in a related query signal function include, without limitation, one ore more of the following:
- variables there are a variety of other variables that may be included, and these are only examples. Moreover, these and other variables may be limited or defined by a designated time period, a designated number of users, the number of users who refined their query from q to q' i (e.g., the number who input a related query q' i after inputting a query q), by all those who input the query q' i , or by other limitations or refinements. Variables, limitations, definitions, or other data associated with related queries are referred to generally as related query data.
- An example of such a limitation is as follows: 1000 people input the search query “infiniti” in a search engine over a defined time period (such as one day), but only 20 people may have first input “infinity” and then input “infiniti.” So, if we are given the original query “infinity,” the term S(infiniti) could be set to 1000 or 20 in the related query function, as desired.

- An embodiment of this function may, in addition to using selection (such as clickthrough) information, use the score generated by a search engine on articles for related queries. For example, the function may use selection information combined with information on how well the article scores against the related query. It is as follows:

- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a subroutine 212 for carrying out the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 in accordance with example (1).
- the subroutine 212 provides a related query signal 128 for each document received in an initial search result 132 .
- An example of subroutine 212 is as follows.
- the subroutine 212 begins at block 300 .
- a counter associated with the search engine 124 is set to a value such as “1.”
- the related query processor 138 can set a variable “i” in an associated memory 118 to an initial value of “1.”
- the counter or variable “i” counts the number of documents that are processed by the subroutine 212 , and the current value of “i” reflects which document in the list of documents in the document data is under operation.
- Block 300 is followed by block 302 , in which the number of queries related to the search query is determined.
- the search engine 124 calls to the related query database 120 for the number of queries related to a particular query.
- the related query processor 138 retrieves data from the related query database 120 associated with the number of queries related to a particular query.
- This type of data includes any relationship data as described in block 204 or other relationship-type data stored in the related query database 120 or other data storage device.
- the number of related queries can be characterized by the variable “M.” If the related query processor 138 determines that there are four related queries for a particular query 114 , the variable “M” may be set at a value of “4,” and the related queries may be designated as follows: q' 1 , q' 2 , q' 3 , and q' 4 .
- the set of M related queries to be analyzed may be a subset of the total number of recognized related queries; for example, a query may be determined to have 100 related queries, but only the top 20 related queries (as determined according to, for example, the weight of relationship between the particular query and the related query, or by any other means) may be used.
- Block 302 is followed by block 304 , in which a number of documents is determined.
- the server 104 received document data associated with the search query 114 . Among the data determined was the total number of documents in the list of documents responsive to the search query.
- This number of documents is characterized by (and is set as) the variable “N.”
- N the number of documents. For example, as mentioned earlier, a search result for the search query “infinity auto” could have 15 documents, and the server 104 would set “N” to a value of “15.”
- any total number of documents for a search query that has been defined or otherwise stored by the related query database 120 or another data storage device for a particular query can be transmitted to, or otherwise determined by the search engine 124 or related query processor 138 .
- the number of documents for each search result for a particular search query can depend upon the relationship-type data previously stored in the related query database 120 as well as clickthrough data stored in the clickthrough database 122 , or on other similar types of data stored in other data storage devices.
- Block 304 is followed by block 306 , in which a sum of weighted related query click data for a particular document over all related queries is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines a sum of weighted related query click data for a particular document over all related queries such as a weighted value that describes the total number of clicks on documents associated with all documents associated with related queries.
- the related query processor 138 determines a sum which reflects some or all user clicks on a document when returned in response to prior searches for the related queries. The sum can then be applied by the search engine 124 or related query processor 138 to a related query signal function or to set of computer-executable instructions.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example of subroutine 306 shown in FIG. 3 .
- the subroutine 306 provides a sum of weighted related query click data for a particular document over all related queries.
- This embodiment of subroutine 306 begins at block 400 .
- a counter associated with the search engine 124 is initialized to the value of “1.”

- Block 400 is followed by block 402 , in which a normalization factor is determined.
- the normalization factor is a reflection of how often a particular related query is asked or otherwise input by users 112 .
- the search engine 124 determines a normalization factor that describes how often a particular query is asked by users.
- the related query processor 138 retrieves clickthrough data from the clickthrough database 122 .
- the related query processor 138 then applies a predetermined equation or set of computer-executable instructions to some or all of the clickthrough data to define a normalization factor for each related query.
- normalization factors are parameters that can be set either manually or in some automated fashion from the data.
- the normalization factor could be the sum of the weighting factors for each respective variable “M.”
- a normalization factor for each related query, q' 1 , q' 2 , . . . q' m can be defined as Norm_q' 1 , Norm_q' 2 , . . . Norm_q' m , respectively, as shown in the related query signal function above in subroutine 212 .
- the related query processor 138 can define a normalization factor, Norm_q' 1 , Norm_q' 2 , Norm_q' 3 , Norm_q' 4 , respectively, for each previously identified related queries “infiniti,” “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car.” These normalization factors could then be applied to the related query signal function shown above in subroutine 212 .
- Block 402 is followed by block 404 , in which a number of selections, in this case clicks, is determined for the current document of interest (document “i”) for a related query (related query “j”).
- the search engine 124 determines the number of clicks for document “i” when document “i” is returned in search results for query “j.”
- the related query processor 138 accesses clickthrough data stored by the clickthrough database 122 or other data storage devices. In some embodiments, this clickthrough data is weighted by the number of times a selection option for the document was displayed to users in response to the query (i.e., realization of clickthrough as a percentage based on the number of displays to the user).
- the related query processor 138 applies a predetermined equation or set of computer-executable instructions to some or all of the clickthrough data to determine the number of clicks for a particular document for a related query.
- the search engine determines the number of clicks made by other users over a defined time with the document of interest (document “i”) when that document (document “i”) is returned in response to the search query “infiniti.”
- Block 404 is followed by block 406 , in which a weight of a relationship between the search query and a related query is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines the weight of a relationship between a present query and a related query.
- the related query processor 138 accesses the related query database 120 or other data storage device to retrieve relationship data. Using a predetermined equation or set of computer-executable instructions, the related query processor 138 determines the weight of a relationship between a present query and a related query.
- the related query processor 138 retrieves the weighting values or scores for related queries.
- the related query database 120 may indicate that the relationship between a first query “infinity auto” and a second query “infiniti” should be stronger than the relationship between the first query and a third query “luxury car.”
- a determination can be made to weight the relationship between the first and second query heavier than the relationship between the first and third query so that improved search results can be obtained from related queries.
- the weight of a relationship between a present query and a related query is represented by W 1 , W 2 , . . . W m in the related query signal function of subroutine 212 .
- the related query processor 138 can define a weight for the relationship between the query “infinity auto” and each of the previously identified related queries “infiniti,” “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car.”
- the weight of the relationship for each related queries would then be represented in the related query signal function above in subroutine 212 as W 1 , W 2 , W 3 , W 4 , respectively.
- weighting of the relationship can be based on proximity between a search query and related queries, the number of times two queries are input “back-to-back,” or the proximity in time that two queries are input. Other weighting factors can be defined in a predetermined set of rules as described above with respect to the related query database 120 .
- Block 406 is followed by block 408 , in which weighted related query data is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines weighted query data using one or more predetermined factors.
- the related query processor 138 utilizes the normalization factor, the number of clicks for a particular document for a related query, and the weight of relationship between a present query and a related query to determine weighted related query data.
- the related query processor 138 processes a respective normalization factor (Norm_q' 1 ) for a first related query “infiniti,” a number of clicks for a particular document for the related query “infiniti” (#q' 1 ), and a weight of relationship between the query “infinity auto” and “infiniti” (W 1 ) to determine a value for weighting the related query data for the particular related query “infiniti.”
- Normal_q' 1 a respective normalization factor for a first related query “infiniti”
- #q' 1 a number of clicks for a particular document for the related query “infiniti”
- W 1 weight of relationship between the query “infinity auto” and “infiniti”
- Other values for weighting the related query data for the other related queries “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car” can be similarly processed with each related queries' respective factors and components as described in blocks 402 - 404 .
- the weight (W 1 ) of the relationship between “infinity auto” and “infiniti” is multiplied by the number of clicks (#q' 1 ) on document “i” for the related inquiry “infiniti,” and then the result is divided by the normalization factor (Norm_q' 1 ) to determine a value representing the weighted related query data for a document “i.”
- Block 408 is followed by decision block 410 , in which a decision is made whether all of the related queries associated with the search query have been processed.
- this variable “M” may be assigned a maximum, e.g. 1000.
- a counter is incremented to the next value to track the number of related queries that have been processed. For example, the counter or variable “j” initially set at a value of “1” is incremented to a next value of “2.”
- the subroutine 308 then returns to block 404 to process in relation to the next related query (q' 2 ). Subsequent related queries are processed by blocks 404 - 408 , and the counter at block 414 is incremented, and the process 404 - 408 repeated, until all of the related queries are processed.
- blocks 404 - 408 would process the remaining related queries “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car.”
- subroutine 306 is followed by block 308 , in which a blending factor is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines a blending factor that reflects the reliability or perceived trust in the quality of related queries for a particular query.
- the related query processor 138 utilizes a predetermined equation or set of computer-executable instructions to determine the blending factor that accounts for the reliability or perceived trust in the quality of the related queries for a particular query.
- the blending factor can be particularly useful if a series of related queries is from a particular source known or otherwise perceived not to be reliable or otherwise trustworthy. In that case, the blending factor can be used to affect or otherwise influence the weight or value of the data associated with the related queries.
- the blending factor is applied to a related query signal function or to a set of computer-executable instructions processed by the related query processor 138 .
- blending factors are parameters that can be set either manually or in some automated fashion from the data.
- the blending factor indicates the amount of trust in user clicks on the original query “q” over clicks on related queries.
- the related query processor 138 determines a blending factor for the related queries “infiniti,” “luxury car,” “quality luxury car,” and “Japanese quality luxury car,” as represented by “A” in the related query signal function above in subroutine 212 . This factor indicates the reliability or perceived trust in the relatedness of the related queries to “infinity auto.”
- Block 308 is followed by block 310 , in which a subject query click weight is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines a subject query click weight using the number of actual clicks on the particular document of interest (document “i”) in a search result 132 for the search query 114 .
- the related query processor 138 retrieves clickthrough data from the clickthrough database 122 or other data storage device.
- the related query processor 138 processes a portion of or all of the clickthrough data with a predetermined equation or set of computer-executable instructions to determine the subject query click weight which is a function of the clickthrough data associated with a particular document for the subject search query.
- clickthrough data for a single document “N” located in a search result 132 for the user's search query 114 is used to determine a subject query click weight.
- this click number is then weighted by, for example, applying a multiplier “A.”
- the related query processor 138 determines a subject query click weight for particular search query “infinity auto,” as represented by “# Initial i ” in the related query signal function above in subroutine 212 .
- the subject query click weight can be expressed a total number of user clicks on a particular document “i” for the query “infinity auto.”
- a multiplier such as “A” can then be applied to “# Initiali” to obtain the subject query click weight for a document “i.”
- Block 310 is followed by block 312 , in which a related query signal for a document is determined.
- the search engine 124 determines a related query signal 128 for a particular document in a search result 132 .
- the related query processor 138 uses a number of factors such as the number of related queries; the number of documents for the related queries; the sum of weighted related query click data for a document over all related queries, the blending factor, if needed, and the subject query click weight, to determine a related query signal 128 for a particular document in a search result.
- this related query signal is calculated using the data determined in previous blocks discussed.
- the related query processor 138 determines a related query signal 128 for a particular document in a search result 132 .
- a weighted value representing the weighted total number of user clicks on document “i” after counting clicks on related queries is determined by the related query processor 138 . This is carried out by performing the mathematical functions as indicated by the algorithm described above to calculate the “# Total i ” for document “i.”
- Block 312 is followed by decision block 314 , in which a decision is made whether all documents for related queries have been processed.
- the search engine 124 compares the counter or variable “i” initially set at a value of “1” in block 300 to the variable “N,” which has been set to a value according to the number of documents to be processed for the search query. If all the documents have been processed, then the counter or variable “i” will equal the variable “N” and the “YES” branch is followed to block 316 .
- a maximum number of documents for analysis may be set. For example, “N” may be set to a maximum number that is less than the number of documents determined in block 304 .
- a counter is incremented to track the number of documents that have been processed. For example, the counter or variable “i” initially set at a value of “1” is incremented to a next value such as “2.” The subroutine 212 then returns to block 306 to continue processing the next document. Subsequent documents are processed by blocks 306 - 314 , and the counter or variable “i” at block 318 is subsequently incremented until all of the documents are processed, and the value of the counter or variable “i” equals “N.” Thus, in the example provided previously for “infinity auto,” all 15 documents of the search result for the search query “infinity auto” would be processed by blocks 306 - 314 .
- subroutine 212 is followed by block 214 , in which the related query signal for each document is provided to the ranking processor.
- the related query signal 128 for each document is transmitted to the ranking processor 136 for determining subsequent rankings or scores of search results in response to other search queries.
- the ranking processor 136 includes a ranking or scoring function or set of computer-executable instructions that incorporates the related query signal 128 and/or other output from the related query processor 138 .
- a weighted value generated from subroutine 212 is transmitted to the ranking processor 136 , which utilizes a related query signal 128 such as a weighted value to rank or otherwise score subsequent search results.
- a related query signal 128 such as a weighted value to rank or otherwise score subsequent search results.
- Other signals 130 generated for each document by the search engine 124 or another system or method can also be transmitted to the ranking processor 136 to rank or score subsequent search results.
- Block 214 is followed by block 216 , in which search results are provided.
- the ranking processor 136 generates a ranking or scoring of each document located in a search result 132 in response to a search query 114 .
- the ranking processor 136 uses the related query signal 128 from block 214 , such as a weighted value, the ranking processor 136 affects the ranking or scoring of one or more documents located in a search result 132 .
- the ranking processor 136 can use other signals such as those shown in FIG. 1 as 130 in conjunction with the related query signal 128 to rank or otherwise score documents of a search result 132 .
