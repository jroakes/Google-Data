Definitions
- This disclosure relates to dictionaries for natural language processing applications, such as machine translation, non-Roman language word segmentation, speech recognition and input method editors.
- natural language processing techniques are used in data processing systems, such as speech processing systems, handwriting/optical character recognition systems, automatic translation systems, or for spelling/grammar checking in word processing systems.
- These natural language processing techniques can include automatic updating of dictionaries for natural language applications related to, e.g., non-Roman language word segmentation, machine translation, automatic proofreading, speech recognition, input method editors, etc.
- Non-Roman languages that use a logographic script in which one or two characters, e.g., glyphs, correspond to one word or meaning have more characters than keys on a standard input device, such as a computer keyboard on a mobile device keypad.
- a standard input device such as a computer keyboard on a mobile device keypad.
- the Chinese language contains tens of thousands of ideographic characters defined by base phonetic or Pinyin characters and five tones.
- the mapping of these many to one associations can be implemented by input methods that facilitate entry of characters and symbols not found on input devices. Accordingly, a Western style keyboard can be used to input Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters.
- An input method editor can be used to realize an input method.
- Such input method editors can include or access dictionaries of words and/or phrases. Lexicons of languages are constantly evolving, however, and thus the dictionaries for the input method editors can require frequent updates. For example, a new word may be rapidly introduced into a language, e.g., a pop-culture reference or a new trade name for a product may be introduced into a lexicon. Failure to update an input method editor dictionary in a timely manner can thus degrade the user experience, as the user may be unable to utilize or have difficulty utilizing the input method editor to input the new word into an input field.
- a user may desire to submit a new word, e.g., a new trade name, as a search query to a search engine. If the input method editor does not recognize the new word, however, the user may experience difficulty in inputting the new word into the search engine.
- a new word e.g., a new trade name
- a word corpus e.g., a collection of web documents.
- Such documents can include web pages, word processing files, query logs, instant messenger (IM) scripts, blog entries, bulletin board system (bbs) postings or other data sources that include word data.
- IM instant messenger
- bbs bulletin board system
- a method determines first word frequencies for existing words and a candidate word in a training corpus, the candidate word defined by a sequence of constituent words, each constituent word being an existing word in a dictionary. Second word frequencies for the constituent words and the candidate word in a development corpus are determined. A candidate word entropy-related measure based on the second word frequency of the candidate word and the first word frequencies of the constituent words and the candidate word is determined. Additionally, an existing word entropy-related measure based on the second word frequencies of the constituent words and the first word frequencies of the constituent words and the candidate word is determined. The candidate word is determined to be a new word if the candidate word entropy-related measure exceeds the existing word entropy-related measure.
- a method determines first word probabilities for existing words and a candidate word in a first corpus, the candidate word defined by a sequence of constituent words, each constituent word an existing word in a dictionary. Second word probabilities for the constituent words and the candidate word in the second corpus are determined. A first entropy-related value based on the second candidate word probability and the first word probabilities of the candidate word and the constituent words is determined. Additionally, a second entropy-related value based on the second constituent word probabilities and the first word probabilities of the candidate word and the constituent words are determined. The candidate word is a new word if the first entropy-related value exceeds the second entropy-related value.
- a system in another implementation, includes a word processing module and a new word analyzer module.
- the word processing module is configured to access and partition a word corpus into a training corpus and a development corpus, and to generate first word probabilities for words stored in the training corpus and second word probabilities for the words in the development corpus.
- the words include a candidate word comprising two or more corresponding words.
- a new word analyzer module is configured to receive the first and second word probabilities and generate a first value based on the first word probabilities for the candidate word and the two or more corresponding words and the second word probability for the candidate word.
- the new word analyzer module is also configured to generate a second value based on the first word probabilities for the candidate word and the two or more corresponding words and the second word probabilities for the two or more corresponding words.
- the new word analyzer module is further configured to compare the first value to the second value and determine whether the candidate word is a new word based on the comparison.
- the methods, systems and apparatus provided in the disclosure may facilitate the new word detection from text written in languages, e.g., languages without word boundaries in sentences, thus facilitating the updating of dictionaries for natural language processing applications in an easy and timely manner. Accordingly, the data processing performance of a system or device using languages without boundaries in sentences may be improved.
- the system or device may have improved performance in speech processing, handwriting/optical character recognition, automatic translation, automatic classification, automatic abstracting, and/or spell/grammar checking in word processing systems.

In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 generates first and second entropy-related values based on the first and the second probabilities. For example, the first entropy-related value and the second entropy-related value may represent the uncertainty of the language models with and without the candidate word, respectively.
- the new word analyzer module 208 determines that the candidate word is a new word if the first entropy-related value is smaller than the second entropy-related value.
- the reduction of entropy can be indicative of an information gain (IG) resulting from correctly detecting the new word.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can notify the dictionary updater module 210 to update the dictionary 124 with the new word.

- the number of words in the training corpus and the development corpus may vary slightly by including the candidate word in the language model, e.g., the word may be counted as one word, or may be counted as two words if the constituent characters and are considered separately.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can generate the entropy-related values using fixed sizes of the training corpus and the development corpus, e.g., by adjusting the probabilities for only a candidate word and the constituent words that define the candidate word.
- the entropy-related values are thus a close approximation of the actual entropy values.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can use the entropy-related values as the entropy values of the training corpus and/or the development corpus.

- the word processing module 206 can identify a candidate word by combining two or more existing words in the training corpus 232 .
- the word processing module 206 can identify a candidate word (x, y) by combining two existing words x and y.
- the system 200 can utilize word data from the word corpus 204 , e.g., web page data in the training corpus 232 and the development corpus 234 , to determine whether the candidate word is a new word.
- the word processing module 206 can generate an n-gram language model from data stored in the training corpus 232 to include an identified candidate word (x, y).

- the word processing module 206 generates a word count value of the candidate word, D(x, y), and word count values of constituent words, D(x) and D(y) from the development corpus 234 .
- D(x), D(y), and D(x, y) may be the number of occurrences of x, y, and (x, y), respectively in the development corpus 234 .
- the system 200 can determine probabilities of x, y, and (x, y) in the development corpus 234 .
- the probability of (x, y) in the development corpus 234 can be determined by
- the new word analyzer module 208 determines whether the candidate word is a new word. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 can determine that the candidate word is a new word if the uncertainty of the development corpus 234 decreases by including the candidate word as a new word. In some examples, an entropy value can be used to measure an uncertainty in the development corpus 234 . For example, the entropy value of the development corpus 234 can be determined by
- V the entire set of words considered to compute the entropy H
- w is a word in the development corpus 234
- p(w) is the probability of the word in the development corpus
- D(w) is the number of occurrences of w in the development corpus.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can generate entropy values H and H′ for the development corpus 234 , where H and H′ are the entropy values of the development corpus 234 without and with, respectively, including the candidate word in the language models. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 generates the actual entropy values H and H′ using the actual sizes of a corpus without and with the candidate word, respectively. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 can also use one or more entropy-related values that can approximate the actual entropy values. For example, the new word analyzer module 208 can generate H′ using the size of the corpora 232 , 234 without the candidate word.
- the size of the training and development corpora 232 , 234 may decrease after including (x, y) as a new word in the vocabulary, the difference may be negligible for computing the entropy of the corpora 232 , 234 with the candidate word (x, y). For example, if a sequence of n constituent words W 1 W 2 . . . Wn is considered a potentially new word, the size of the corpus decreases only by the number of occurrences of W 1 W 2 . . . Wn, e.g., m, multiplied by n ⁇ 1, e.g., m*(n ⁇ 1).
- the new word analyzer module 208 can determine whether the candidate word is a new word. For example, if H′ ⁇ H ⁇ 0, then the new word analyzer module 208 may determine that the candidate word is a new word because the entropy value of the development corpus 234 is reduced by including the candidate word.
- the new word analyzer module 208 compares the entropy values H and H′ using the probabilities p(x), p(y), and p(x, y), and the word count values D(x), D(y), and D(x, y). Because the word frequencies of words other than the candidate word and the constituent words are not affected by the addition of the candidate word, the formula for generating a difference between H and H′ can be generated using a simplified formula. By cancelling equal terms, the following formula can be derived to compute the difference between H and H′
- the values of p′(x), p′(y), p′(x, y) are the probabilities of x, y, and (x, y), respectively, in the language model when the sequence of characters xy is considered a candidate word.
- the values of p(x) and p(y) are probabilities of x and y, respectively, in the language model when the sequence of characters xy is not considered a candidate word.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can determine that the candidate word (x, y) is a new word if Z ⁇ 0, which is equivalent to the condition:
- the probabilities p(x), p(y), p′(x), and p′(y) are represented using number of occurrences of x, y, and (x, y) in the training corpus 232 divided by the total number of words in the training corpus 232 . For example,
- the new word analyzer module 208 can generate a first value using a word frequency of the candidate word in the development corpus 234 (e.g.,
- a first entropy-like value V 1 based on these values can be calculated based on the formula:
- V ⁇ ⁇ 1 D ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ D ⁇ ⁇ log ⁇ p ⁇ ( x , y ) p ⁇ ( x ) ⁇ p ⁇ ( y ) .
- the new word analyzer module 208 can generate a second entropy value using a word frequency of the constituent words in the development corpus 234 (e.g.,
- a second entropy-like value Vs based on these values can be calculated based on the formula:

- the new word analyzer module 208 determines that the candidate word is a new word if V 1 >V 2 .

- the scalar value can be fixed, e.g., 0.9, or adjusted according to applications.
- the dictionary updater module 210 receives data indicative of the determination from the new word analyzer module 208 . In some implementations, if the new word analyzer module 208 determines that the candidate word is a new word, then the dictionary updater module 210 can add the new word into the dictionary 124 .

For example, the process of detecting new words in the corpus can be implemented on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Other triggering events can also be used; e.g., a new word detection process can be performed for a web-based input method editor if an unrecognized word is received as input with enough frequency to be statistically significant.
