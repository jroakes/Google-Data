Definitions
- the present invention is a method for processing heterogeneous data and more particularly is a method for heterogeneous data which uses an interoperability assistant module with specifications for transforming the data into a common intermediate representation of the data using the specifications and creating an information bridge with the interoperability assistant module through a process of program generation.
- databases used for design and engineering employ a variety of different data models, interface languages, naming conventions, data semantics, schemas, and data representations.
- a fundamental problem for concurrent engineering is the sharing of heterogeneous information among a variety of design resources.
- Successful concurrent engineering also requires access to data from multiple stages of the design life-cycle, but the diversity among data from different tools and at different stages creates serious barriers.
- Database gateways provide communication mechanisms to external systems--but only if those systems have a relational interface. That is, the system must either processes SQL queries or at least must provide a relational application programming interface (API). Since an API is a set of functions to be accessed via remote or local procedure invocation, a relational API presents data in terms of named arrays (relation tables) that contain flat tuples, with one data value per column in each tuple, and with the number of columns fixed per named array. The functions' names and parameters are defined in the API and may vary depending upon the gateway.
- Language features for multidatabase interoperability include variables which range over both data and metadata, including relation and database names, and expanded view definitions with provisions for updatability. Selected translation or mapping approaches are known and others which are based upon the 5-level architecture are described in Sheth and Larson. Approaches to semantics-based integration and access to heterogeneous DBs where semantic features are used to interrelate disparate data and resolve potentially different meanings are known. Seen from a higher level, what are needed are mediation services among different representations and systems.
- Schema Integration Database design tools have been applied to schema integration, and related work formalizes interdatabase dependencies and schema merging. Some related approaches utilize view-mapping, and data migration. Some of the work in this area assumes that the resulting target schema or view is to be relational rather than another heterogeneous representation. Much of the work on data semantics also is applicable to semantics of schema integration.
- Object Encapsulation Since object technology can hide the implementation and data structures within objects, it is interesting to consider encapsulation and the hiding of heterogeneity within object interfaces, with one or more interfaces being specially crafted for each heterogeneous database. Some of the work in this area includes the FINDIT system [6], object program language interfaces, and an execution environment for heterogeneous software interfaces. These object approaches serve to hide, rather than obviate, the specialized programming which still is needed for each application. Sciore has done interesting work on the use of annotations to support versioning, constraint checking, defaults, and triggers.
- One aspect of the present invention is drawn to a method for integrating heterogeneous data embodied in computer readable media having source data and target data including providing an interoperability assistant module with specifications for transforming the source data, transforming the source data into a common intermediate representation of the data using the specifications, transforming the intermediate representation of the data into a specialized target representation using the specifications.
- An information bridge is created with the interoperability assistant module through a process of program generation and the source data is processed through the information bridge to provide target data wherein the target data is in a non-relational form with respect to the source data.
- the DAtabase Integration SYstem (DAISy) of the present invention provides both high-level user interfaces and program level access across heterogeneous databases (HDBs), allowing integration of a wide variety of information resources including relational and object databases, CAD design tools, simulation packages, data analysis and visualization tools, and other software modules. DAISy eliminates tedious and costly specialized translators. A key focus is on reusability of components through a specification-based approach. A declarative specification language is utilized to represent the source and target data representations. This high level data structure specification (HLDSS) provides a uniform language for representing diverse databases and specialized file formats, such as produced by CAD tools.
- HDSS high level data structure specification
- a rule-like specification applies functional transformations in a manner similar to that of production rule systems and term-rewriting systems.
- These specifications are utilized to create information mediators and information bridges each of which can access heterogeneous data resources and transform that information for use by databases and specialized representations. In all cases, the data is mapped to an intermediate internal format. This also provides reusability of each information mediator to support multiple applications.
- Each of the information bridges are created through a program generation process, and this process and the associated tools within the DAISy platform are reused for each new information bridge which is created.
- FIG. 1 shows the architecture of the database integration platform
- FIG. 5 shows a schema browser display
- the design can support heterogeneous databases with different schemas and data models, such as multiple relational and object-oriented databases, and other application packages, such as CAD, CAE, and CASE (Computer Aided Design, Computer Aided Engineering, and Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools, which produce specialized data structure representations.
- CAD Computer Aided Design
- CAE Computer Aided Engineering
- CASE Computer Aided Software Engineering
- the overall architecture of the system is reviewed in FIG. 1 and consists of several primary modules.
- the information bridge 1 transforms data from heterogeneous data resources 2, 4 and 6, for example, respectively a Nano-Fabrication Database, Simulation Tools, and a CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing) Database into a common intermediate representation and then into a specialized target representation--as determined by the specifications.
- the target representation may be another database with a different data model and schema, or the target may be a specialized data structure needed by a design tool.
- a system user 8 may access the information bridge 1 in a variety ways.
- One way of accessing uses an optional browser 10, shown as a graphical interface to view and browse the combined uniform schema 11 and data obtained from multiple data sources 2, 4, and 6. Queries also may be posed against a common view of the data collection in order to focus the resulting view for additional browsing.
- Another way of accessing the information bridge is through existing tools 12 and the various data representations 2, 4 and 6 those tools understand. In this case, the information bridge completes the transformation process and imports the external data into this specialized representation.
- a new software package then can be registered automatically once the existence of the package is known.
- the server invokes the package with the standard argument requesting its self-description, and the server then enters that information into its database. Later if the server is queried as to the existence of a software package that provides some set of functions, the server can respond by checking the attributes and values of registered packages, and return information on all that match the query.
- Other information can be provided in the self-description, such as the units of measurement that are used, semantic details, general information, and perhaps cross-referencing of other documentation (e.g., manual pages or documents that describe some standard implemented by the software).
- the self-description information is self-contained within the package itself, it increases the usefulness of the package by not requiring information about it to be scattered around the system in the form of documentation files, source code comments, configuration files, and post-it notes on the screen of the last person that compiled the package.
- the two HLDSS data structure specifications describe the source 22 and target 24 representations respectively.
- Both the source 22 and target 24 may be very different heterogeneous data resources.
- Each may be an object, relational, or other database, or a specialized data file and structure, or an application program interface (API) to a software package, such as a CAD tool.
- API application program interface
- the structure within the IA subsystem consists of several intermediate stages and modules. Most of the code in the resulting information mediator is created through generation module 30 which is completely driven by the high level HLDSS and HLTRS specifications.
- the output of the IA is a compiled information bridge mediator 60, which when executed, provides the desired transformations between heterogeneous representations.
- the execution of the IA 20 module is distinct from the execution of an information bridge 1.
- the IA module is active in a system generation phase and generates code which compiles into an information bridge.
- an information bridge is the end result of the system generation phase; data resources are not involved during this phase.
- the bridge can be executed (the information bridge execution phase) at which time the data transformation occurs.
- the IA analysis and code generation is only executed once (when the information bridge is built) and the information bridge is executed for each data transformation.
- the integration administrator would be the individual most likely to be involved with system generation whereas more general users would be involved with just the execution phase of the information bridges.
- the input that the IA module uses to generate the code for an information bridge comes from the three high-level specification files that were described above.
- the high level data structure specification (HLDSS) describes the logical and physical representation of a set of data resources.
- the production rules of the HLDSS allow the IA module to generate an internal intermediate logical representation of the data while the annotations on the production rules (and the attributes of these annotations) describe the physical representation of the data.
- the IA module requires one HLDSS to describe the heterogeneous input data sources 22 and another HLDSS to describe the target representation 24.
- the third input to the IA module is the high level transformation rule specification (HLTRS) 23.
- the HLTRS 23 is a set of rewrite rules on the logical representation of the data so that the source data representation can be transformed (possibly through intermediate representations) to the target data representation.
- the schema analysis of the HLDSS specification language may be facilitated through the use of Lex and Yacc tools and is identical for both the source and target HLDSS. However, this does not account for the processing of the annotations and attributes of the HLDSS; this additional processing of the HLDSS files is different for the source 22 and target 24 and is the recognizer generator 36 for the source HLDSS and view generator 56 for the target HLDSS.
- the annotations/attributes are processed in both cases to obtain information such as database and API interfaces, hosts and filenames.
- the data handling information is stored on the individual nodes of the schema trees and code is generated to access input data and produce output data.
- the stored information differs between the source and target, so as to distinguish between input schema trees and output schema trees.
- the two generators are logically similar and may be combined.
- the above activities on HLDSS files are handled by the HLDSS parser.
- the HLDSS parser is called once to generate the code specific to the source HLDSS 22 and called (with different parameters) a second time to process the target HLDSS 24.
- the system generation process next compiles the automatically generated code as well as some fixed template code which cannot be compiled before the specification code is created. Finally, the code is linked with the class library 44 and any other libraries that may be necessary to actually access data (e.g., the Oracle library, etc.).
- the output of generation module 30 is a mediator generator which forms the information bridge mediator 60 with mediator generator outputs 40, 50 and 58.
- Input data 62 is processed by the source recognizer 64 formed by recognizer generator 36, the transformer engine 66 formed by transformer generator 42 and the target builder 68 formed by view generator 56 to produce transformed target data 70.
- HLDSS high level data structure specification
- the HLDSS specification language is uniform regardless of the diverse database, data structure, and file representations. The significant differences among these different data representations is accounted for by annotations on the HLDSS productions (statements). These annotations give rise to different specialized interpretations of each production, based upon the annotation. The uniformity of the HLDSS language foreshadows the uniformity of the internal intermediate representation of the actual data within the information mediator/bridge 60.
- Grammar productions specify the structure of the database, file format, or main memory data structures via a grammar-like set of extended BNF productions plus annotations.
- Each grammar production consists of:
- the production refers to an object from an object-oriented database.
- the LHS is the name of the object, and the RHS components are the attributes or methods whose values are to be selected.
- An explicit OSQL query may be specified instead, in which case, the result will be treated as a virtual object (LHS) having the component names designated by the RHS.
- the nature of the aggregations may differ from one data representation to another.
- the different kinds of aggregations and data representations are distinguished through the use of annotations.
- Different kinds of aggregations include, for example:
- the annotations on grammar productions are of the form " ⁇ CategoryName>: ⁇ name> ⁇ ", where ⁇ name> is just a reference to a subsequent line beginning with "Spec: ⁇ name>”--this serves to elaborate this annotation with further details.
- the CategoryName designates the primary category of the data source, and is selected from the top level of the taxonomy of heterogeneous data resources--which includes Relational DB, Object DB, File, URL, API, and DataStructure (i.e., main memory data structure).
- Type Integer numberOfElements numberOfNodes elementNumber codeNumber
- Type Float scaleX scaleY xCoordinate uCoordinate
- This specification accesses a Sybase relational table named ⁇ header ⁇ for attributes Name, Version, Type, and Fmt. It also accesses an ONTOS object database to obtain the ⁇ bound ⁇ information from the ⁇ Mesh ⁇ object whose Name was just obtained from the relational tuple.
- the ⁇ element ⁇ and ⁇ node ⁇ data are obtained from the same Mesh object.
- ⁇ numberofElements ⁇ is the number of instances of ⁇ element ⁇ data that occur for ⁇ element+ ⁇
- ⁇ numberofNodes ⁇ is the number of instances for ⁇ node+ ⁇ .
- each ⁇ element ⁇ has an elementNumber and eight nodeNumber data components, each of which is an integer.
- the production refers to an object from an object-oriented database.
- the LHS is the name of the object, and the RHS components are the attributes or methods whose values are to be selected.
- An explicit OSQL query may be specified to qualify the objects of interest, and/or to limit the set of attributes/methods to be accessed--not all OODBs support such queries.
- An annotation applies to all subordinate productions (i.e., expansions of the non-terminals on the right hand side of the production) unless productions for those non-terminals provide different annotations.
- the HLDSS provides a specification language using a linear textual syntax consisting a sequence of lines of text.
- a graphical representation has been developed and is referred to as the logical structure diagram (LSD).
- the HLDSS is parsed and processed by schema analyzers 32 and 52 to create annotated logical structure diagrams (LSDs) 34 and 54, each of which is a schematic structure graph (like a parse tree) that represents the schema and data structures of the data resources.
- Logical structure diagrams provide a form of meta-schema in that LSD's may be used to graphically describe different data models and schemas.
- the motivation for the LSD internal representation is that a context-independent uniform graph-based representation can represent all anticipated data resource schemata and structures.
- the context-dependent interpretation is dictated by annotations, which are processed by the HLDSS preprocessor and the recognizer generator 36 and view generator 56 modules.
- the uniform LSD structure represents aggregations (e.g. sets, hierarchically nested data, etc.) and associations (n-ary relationships, attributes, dependencies).
- the LSD consists of nodes and edges, where each node and edge logically may be associated with both an interpretation and a label, as described below. This interpretation does not change the uniform LSD structure, but rather enables us to see how the LSD corresponds or maps to (or from) the external heterogeneous formats and structures.
- HLDSS is the surface syntax and the LSD is the general schematic conceptual structure which is used internally.
- Surface syntax other than the HLDSS could be utilized to create the schematic LSD initially.
- the graphical interface could be extended to support multiple specification paradigms.
- the logical structure diagram provides a uniform representation over diverse schemata and structures, and it does this by logically separating the representation problem into three layers:
- the descriptive representation language or formalism is the logical structure diagram. It is a logical graph (often a tree) of data entities and logical dependencies. The fact that this descriptive language is uniform in its logical structure depends on the ability to independently specify the interpretation and naming relative to different data models and different databases.
- the logical structure diagram is defined as a triple (N, E, I ), where N is a set of nodes, E is a set of edges over such nodes, and I is the interpretation of the nodes and edges relative to the data model and schema.
- Each edge E i is an tuple consisting of k Ei nodes from N and an optional edge label.
- the edge represents an association or relationship, and in general may be a hyperedge (thus making the LSD a hypergraph).
- Binary edges that is, with two nodes plus an optional edge name also will be used.
- I N is an interpretation over the nodes which partitions the node set N into subsets, each corresponding to a primary component type of the chosen data model (e.g., relation table names and attribute names).
- I E is an interpretation which partitions the edges so that a subset of edges contains a common set of node(s) from one partition of I N and this subset of edges relates these node(s) with nodes from a different partition of I N .
- the interpretation I represents and makes explicit the primary implicit relationships of the data model.
- a relational data model would have an interpretation in an LSD where I consists of nodes which denote relation names, nodes which designate attribute names within the relations, and edges would connect relation nodes and attribute nodes.
- an object model would designate nodes as object types, attributes, or methods, and edges would designate either: 1) a named relationship between an object type and one of its attributes, 2) a subtype (specialization) relationship between an object type and its parent object type, or 3) an aggregation relationship between an object type and its component object types.
- FIG. 3 An example of a logical structure diagram 200 is shown in FIG. 3 and corresponds to the following HLDSS productions:
- node nodeNumber (153) xCoordinate (154) yCoordinate (155) ⁇ ODB: Ont3 ⁇
- LSD logical structure diagram
- the LSD instance tree or LSD parse tree reflects the actual structure of the data instances within the information bridge.
- the LSD schema and the LSD instances will be explicitly distinguished from each other only when this is not implied by context of the discussion.
- the LSD provides a neutral data description language, which may be defined in graph-like terms utilizing nodes and edges, or may be defined in production-like terms in the HLDSS as just described.
- a database pattern may be defined in terms of selected components from the schema together with selection predicates.
- the DB pattern will consist of objects, attributes and/or relationships from the schema, together with predicate qualifications to restrict the allowed data values and relationships. The restrictions may limit the combinations of data object instances which can successfully match the database pattern.
- Optional linking variables can be utilized to interrelate several data objects and their attributes.
- the DB pattern When the DB pattern is applied against a database of instances, components in the pattern match or bind to data instances such that all conditions in the pattern are satisfied.
- the attribute and object names utilized in the pattern serve as implicit variables which are bound to these names.
- the DB pattern may match multiple data instances. Some components of the pattern may serve only to restrict possible matches of other components that are to be produced in the result of the pattern match. Thus components which are to appear in the result are designated as output components of the pattern. Each different valid combination of instances for the output components constitutes a match instance.
- the DB pattern may be thought of as returning a collection of bindings for each combination of the output variables--such that each combination satisfies the DB pattern qualifications.
- Database patterns provide the equivalents of selection, projection, and join. In addition they can provide recursion to obtain the closure of a relationship, as well as other constructs which are useful in non-relational schemas.
- the form of the patterns are based upon the structure of the schema, and thus such patterns are applicable not only to object oriented models but also to the relational model as well as more traditional hierarchical and network schemas.
- a database pattern P is the ordered triple [ND,E,F], where ND is a set of node descriptors, each composed of a node N i and an optional predicate P i .
- the collection of individual nodes Ni constitutes the set N.
- E is a set of edges defined in terms of nodes from N, as discussed below.
- F is the pattern's outform, which provides a generalization of the notion of projection. F can be utilized to specify structuring and organization of the resultant data instances.
- An edge E i represents a relationship among nodes.
- an edge is indicated by a tuple (N1, N2, . . . , ⁇ , . . . , N K-1 , N K ) of nodes N i .di-elect cons. N, and thus may be a hyperedge.
- ⁇ is an optional edge designator, which either may be an existing edge name, recursion over a given edge type, or a binary comparison function, such as a join condition.
- This general form of database pattern can be usefully treated as a hypergraph, in which some or all edges have k>2 nodes. When binary edges which consist of two nodes can be used, the database pattern P forms a graph.
- the process of matching the pattern P against the database D treats the DB pattern P as a mapping (multi-valued function) which is applied to D to produce the match set M.
- the high level transformation rule specification (HLTRS) 23 consists of a set of condition-action transformation rules (sometimes also referred to as tree/graph rewrite rules). which are of the form:
- the left side of a rule specifies the data objects on which the rule operates, the middle section of the rule specifies the action or transformation operation to be applied on each such input instance, and the right side specifies the label/name of an output form.
- a transformation rule would be:
- Token1 Token2 TransformFcn(Token1 Token2):: TokenOut
- Each of these rules thus serves to coordinate and transform some input or intermediate data objects to other intermediate objects or output objects.
- the collection of rules comprises a data flow network which maps the input structure or schema to the output structure/schema. Execution of the rules in the information bridge then carries out the actual data transformations.
- a rule binds to and acts on each instance, or combination of instances if the left hand side of the rule consists of multiple components, of input data which satisfies its conditions.
- the left hand side identifies ⁇ trigger conditions ⁇ for an invocation of the rule. Specifically, it may be token name(s) which occur in the input HLDSS, or else the result-label of some intermediate data object produced by another such transformation/coordination rule. There may be multiple left side pre-condition labels for a transformation rule. The left side may include some additional constructs that serve as filter or guard predicates on execution of the rule.
- the transformation action represents a functional application, and usually makes reference to a library of transformation operators, though it can include code fragments, much in the same spirit that Yacc and Lex admit code fragments within each production.
- the parameters to the function come from the data objects whose labels appear on the left side of the rule.
- the rule When there is a new data instance for each of these tokens on the left, the rule is triggered. The resulting value or subtree instance produced by the rule is then given the output label that is designated on the right side of the rule specification.
- the right side of a rule may be a simple data element or a complex data structure represented by a subtree. That is, the right side may be the label of any terminal node or the ⁇ root ⁇ of any subtree/subgraph of the output HLDSS, or any intermediate data object that is to be utilized by another rewrite rule.
- each label of the input schema tree must be distinct so that this designation is unambiguous. This is facilitated by adding a suffix to components of the HLDSS which otherwise would have the same label.
- Each rule is implicitly iterated for each distinct combination of data object instances which satisfy the conditions on the left side.
- multiple object labels occurring on the left side may give rise to a cross-product of data instances, each of which invokes the transformation.
- a vector-dot product of the instances corresponding to each of the multiple labels on the left hand side may be specified.
- modifiers which may be used on the left hand side of transformation rule are described below in reference to the virtual parent concept.
- transformation operators provide rearrangement of data objects (e.g., permutation), aggregation of objects which satisfy a given criteria into a collection, and the reverse process of separating a collection into individual objects.
- Other operators iteratively apply a function to each member of a subtree (a collection is a special case), as well as operators which are a generalization of relational selection, projection, and join.
- each invocation of the transformation produces one data object--which may be complex and consist of substructure.
- the Collect operator collects multiple data objects and produces an ordered bag (a sequence) of data objects, where the relative collection point is either explicitly specified or else is the common parent (relative to the input grammar) of the multiple left hand side data objects.
- the Each operator takes a single compound data object and produces multiple outputs, one for each top level member of the compound data object.
- One of the important aspects of the internal representation of the invention is that it supports not only tree manipulation and tree rewriting operations, but also the application of extended relational operators.
- the subtree root is designated as a collection (with "+” or "*" to designate multiple occurrences)
- a collection of subtree instances is in the instance tree.
- a tree rewrite operation that is to be applied to this subtree can be iterated over each subtree instance.
- the first level children of a subtree may be treated as the (possibly complex) attributes in an n-ary tuple whose degree is the number of such children (as defined in the schema tree).
- the set of such instance subtrees can be seen to correspond to a set of tuples, with the label of the subtree corresponding to the name of a (virtual) relation.
- the operator is applied to each subtree instance, which corresponds to a tuple consisting of (possibly complex) first-level components. Extended relational operators thus can operate on each subtree instance by treating it in this way as a tuple.
- the component of such a tuple may be complex, in that it may itself be a subtree, in which case a nested relational representation is being manipulated.
- a transformation operator is iteratively (or in parallel) applied to each subtree instance.
- the appropriate subtree is indicated by the label on the left side of the transformation rule.
- Each result produced by the operator is given the label from the right side of the transformation rule.
- Operators discussed below which take a label as an argument use such a label internal to their processing, e.g., to relabel internal subtrees, for example.
- Pred may be a user supplied predicate, or it may be an integer, a label name, or a list of label names.
- Pred is a positive integer i, this means that the condition is satisfied only at level i of the tree, where the root is level 0.
- Pred is a label or a string of labels, the condition is true at a node of the tree if the node's name matches the label or one of the labels in the list.
- Pred is false at a visited node the ApplyFcn is not invoked, but traversal continues into the interior nodes of its subtree.
- the rewrite operator is more general in that it allows rewriting and transformation of the input tree/sequence into a more general output tree.
- Rewrite builds its output as a hierarchical tree-like structure by copying its AggregateIn structure, subject to local rewrites at each node. Pred is treated the same as for the Iterate operator.
- the result for the Rewrite operator is a tree structure which is a projection of the structure of the original tree (i.e., some nodes may be omitted).
- the values for nodes of the rewritten tree may be transformed values or copies of the corresponding node of the original tree.
- Extended relational operators include the following project/permute operators:
- This operator permutes the top level members of each subtree instance having the designated SubTreeLabel according to the specified Permutation order.
- the i-th entry in the Permutation order specifies the relative index of the initial entry which is to occur in the i-th position of the result. This may include repetition of members.
- the operator can be viewed in either of three related ways. It may be viewed as the traditional relational operator "project”, in that each instance to which it is applied can be viewed as a tuple (possibly complex) of the relation named by the second argument; it thus provides relational projection onto the designated columns of the tuple. Alternatively, it may be viewed as SelectByPosition, since it selects the components of the LabeledSubTree according to the indices given in the first argument. Or it may be viewed as a permutation, since it rearranges each first level sequence or subtree of the second argument--it is iteratively applied to each such subtree instance at that level. These interpretations are equivalent operationally, but the interpretation is relative to how the user or integration administrator is viewing the data. Thus there are synonyms for this operator as Project or Permute.
- This PredJoin operator is an extension of the above Join operation. It extends the notion of join from equality matching as the join condition to testing of a user provided pred -- function. This will fully accommodate less-than and greater-than joins as well as other join conditions. This operation is more costly because the hash join approach is not applicable for an arbitrary predicate comparison of the join keys.
- a Collect operator allows for grouping a set of data instances relative to a common criteria.
- the Collect operator appears in a separate rule and must have an UpTo clause on the left side of the rule; the form is:
- This rule will collect instances of Token1 into a collection which will then be given the label designated on the right side of the rule. Only one token type may appear on the left side of the rule. All instances of Token1 under a single instance of the virtual parent will be grouped into the same collection. If the virtual parent in the UpTo clause is omitted, then the nearest ancestor to Token1 which is an aggregate "plus" node, or the root, is taken to be the virtual parent. The completion signal for this Collect rule is the input instance tree node for the virtual parent.
- This rule takes on the left side a label which represents one collection and produces multiple outputs, one output for each member of the collection.
- the input CollectionToken is consumed only when the last member of the collection is processed.
- only one token type may appear on the left side of the rule.
- the Merge operator combines several different input tokens from the left side into one sequence which is then passed to the body of the transformation rule.
- the result is a single instance, which is given the label on the right side of the rule.
- the form is:
- the TransformFunction may be any transformation taking one argument which is a sequence or list of elements.
- the $1 represents the first component from the left side, which here is the result of the Merge operator.
- Expand is the reverse of the Merge operator. Expand takes a single argument which is sequence or list and treats the first element of that sequence as the first argument to the TransformFunction, and so on. Its form is:
- the cross product takes multiple inputs on the left hand side of the rule and is distinguished by the * separating these inputs.
- This rule has two forms, the first is:
- VP represents a virtual parent of the input sets--this must be a common ancestor of Token1, Token2, and Token3.
- the cross product rule first performs an implicit Collect of all instances of type Token1 to form a set which is called Token1+. Similarly, an implicit Collect is performed for Token2 and Token3 arguments.
- the virtual parent in the UpTo clause is not specified explicitly, then it defaults to the closest common ancestor of these input types, relative to the input instance tree. Recall that the common ancestor of derived data refers transitively to its origins in the input instance tree.
- the Cross Product then applies the TransformFunction separately to each combination of instances from each of these collected input sets: Token1+, Token2+, and Token3+.
- the CrossProduct collects these results to produce one output sequence, which consists of the sequence of results arising from every Cross-Product combination.
- the CrossProduct is a predefined operator and can take an arbitrary number of input argument types.
- the second form of the cross product rule simply omits the UpTo clause, which changes the meaning of the rule just to the extent that no implicit Collect is performed for the left hand side tokens--the * serves to designate the rule as a cross product.
- each of the left hand side token arguments is then taken to already represent a set, as may occur if a left side argument was a Node+ from the input tree or if the data has already been processed by an explicit Collect rule.
- the cross product then proceeds as before, applying the TransformFunction to each combination of values from the input collections--duplicates are not eliminated.
- the inner product is similar to the second form of the cross product in that it takes multiple left hand sides tokens which each represent collections--except that these arguments are now treated as being ordered, and thus are sequences.
- the form of this rule is:
- Token1 Token2 .
- Token3 Transformlunction ($1) :: TokenOut
- the dot or period designates the inner product instead of the * for cross product.
- the first element from each of the input sequences are paired to form the first tuple or vector of data to which the TransformFunction is applied. Then the TransformFunction is applied to the second tuple of data formed from the second component of each sequence represented on the left hand side of the rule.
- the output consists of a single sequence arising from each application of the Transform Function.
- the dependency graph 200 shown in FIG. 4 is the basis for rule execution. It is implemented as a high level abstract class for the information bridge. It is composed of three submodules for the input tree 210, rule graph 220, and output tree 230, respectively. Although the term tree is used, the input and output actually may be cyclic directed graphs, though they most often are trees. Non-tree structures arise when two or more leaf nodes are identical (corresponding to multiple parents) or when there is a directed cycle representing a recursive structure, such as the contains or part-of relationships that arises in applications such as bill of materials. These three submodules are linked together to form the actual dependency graph data structure and associated functions, as shown in FIG. 4. The input tree feeds into the rule graph which feeds into the output tree.
- the input tree 210 actually consists of both a schema tree and an instance tree.
- the input schema tree is constructed automatically from the input HLDSS and includes accessor functions which will retrieve and, if necessary, parse input data from multiple input sources.
- a node 212 in the schema tree represents a named type of data element, much as an attribute in a relational schema defines a component of each tuple.
- a roster may represent the set of students taking a course, or a database relation name may represent the set of tuples which populate that relation table.
- the accessor functions When the accessor functions retrieve data instances, they build an instance tree which has the same logical structure as the schema tree, but now with potentially multiple instances nodes for those schema nodes which are subordinate to an aggregation node in the tree. There would be one input instance aggregate node for each occurrence of a collection--say each course--and one data node for each member of an aggregate (e.g. each student). Similarly, to represent a relation in a relational database, there would be a separate schema node for the relation itself, for a generic tuple, and for each attribute type. In the instance tree there would be as many tuple nodes as there are tuples, and each tuple would have one instance node for the value of each attribute of the relation
- Input data instances are first inserted into the input tree.
- the data instances are then passed by the input tree to the rule graph, together with completion signals.
- the rule graph 220 will apply specified transformation rules on the data instances to generate intermediate instances and output instances.
- the final rules of the rule graph insert the output instances into the output tree 230 which assembles and eventually outputs them accordingly.
- dependency graph 200 forms the implementation structure which enables data driven processing of the input data instances.
- This processing is asynchronous and thus is amenable to parallel processing. Intermediate data tokens arising in the rule graph are released as soon as they are no longer needed. Elements of the input instance tree also could be released once all their dependencies have been processed.
- the asynchronous processing is supported by two major dependency coordination schemes in the dependency graph: (1) The blocking and unblocking scheme in the rule graph and in the output tree, and (2) a completion signal scheme.
- the blocking and unblocking scheme in the rule graph and in the output tree and (2) a completion signal scheme.
- the rule graph 220 is a directed graph and consists of two types of nodes--(intermediate) data nodes 222 and rule nodes 224.
- Each rule node is connected to one or more input data nodes and no more than one output data node.
- Several rules may interact in that the output of one or more rules may feed the input to one or more other rules, as shown in FIG. 4. This is consistent with the fact that each HLTRS rule (rule node) can have multiple input labels/data and at most one output label (for one data node). Multiple other rules may utilize this rule's output, and this is accomplished by having a data node feed multiple HLTRS rules (rule nodes).
- the left-most data nodes in the rule graph are connected to input schema nodes of the input tree.
- the right-most rule nodes in the rule graph are connected to the output schema node in the output tree.
- the rule graph thus is a part of the data flow diagram in the dependency network.
- a blocking and unblocking scheme is used to ensure a smooth and proper flow (i.e., no overflow) of data instances in the rule graph.
- Each rule has a one queue for each of the rule's inputs.
- the rule is blocked until the output is consumed by another rule or by the output tree--in the case of a collect rule, discussed below, the rule does not produce its output until the collection is completed.
- the implementation considers a rule blocked when its output node is blocked, which indicates that the result produced by the previous execution of the rule has not yet been consumed.
- the rule may be triggered again when there is at least one data element in each of its input queues.
- a rule is considered activated once it has been triggered and before it has completed execution.
- Activated rules are appended to a working list of activated rules, and can be executed in the order in which they were activated. The activated rules could also be executed in parallel on a multiple processor platform.
- a rule When a rule is executed it utilizes one data instance from each of its input queues.
- the implementation utilizes one physical queue for each rule's output. This queue may feed one or more other rules--in the latter case, all the consumer rules have logical queue pointers into this one physical queue.
- the rule creating this output is considered unblocked when any of the logical queues of subsequent rules is empty.
- the actual data instance is removed from the physical queue only when all logical queues have utilized this data instance.
- the output tree 230 actually consists of both an output schema tree and an output instance tree--this is similar to the input tree.
- the output instance tree may have potentially multiple output instance nodes 232 corresponding to a given schema node.
- Transformations may be expressed as a set of transformation rules--though in the limiting case, one rule could produce the full output tree.
- a transformation rule or a chain (composition) of transformation rules establishes a correspondence or mapping from one or more leaves and subtrees of the input to one or more leaves or subtrees of the output instance tree.
- Blocking/unblocking on the output schema nodes will cause blocking/unblocking on the rule nodes in the rule graph.
- the completion signal scheme augments the blocking and unblocking of rules and is used to determine when a set or collection of data is complete. Two different cases arise.
- a parent node may have several distinct children nodes, each having its own different label. That parent node and its set of children are considered complete when there is an instance for each child node. Subsequent instances would be associated with a different parent.
- the second case arises when an input or output tree node has an explicit set indicator, which is referred to as a "plus" node in the HLDSS because the syntax is Node+. This represents the parent node of the set or collection, and the type of the children which are the members of the set are indicated by a schema node labeled Node (without the ⁇ plus ⁇ ).
- the Collect and Product operators in transformation rules depend on knowing when their input sets are complete.
- the output tree also depends on knowing when any output nodes representing a set or collection (i.e. designated as "plus” nodes) are complete.
- a logical association is made with each data instance in the input tree of a list of the instance nodes of all its ancestors. For each set or collection operator in the rule graph, and each set or collection node in the output tree, one of these ancestors is selected as a virtual parent.
- the virtual parent provides the basis for the collection. In general, the virtual parent is the closest ancestor common to all the member instances.
- the virtual parent is designated in the transformation rules below by an UpTo(ancestor) clause on the left hand side of a rule, as noted earlier.
- the virtual parent serves as a form of generalized GroupBy criteria. If the UpTo clause is specified without an argument, then the default is to retain the grouping of data from the input. That is, the default virtual parent is taken to be the closest ancestor from the input tree which is common to all member instances of the collection or set.
- each data instance with its relevant ancestors is not directly annotated, rather it is created as a separate virtual or invisible data node for each instance of these virtual parent ancestors.
- Each such virtual data node is referred to as a completion signal and it is propagated through the rule graph to the output tree.
- code is inserted in the relevant rules and output schema nodes to detect the signals which are needed.
- Rule graph nodes also filter out multiple occurrences of the same signal, such as may arise when a rule has multiple inputs. Only the last such duplicate signal is propagated onward. The number of duplicate signals is determined during analysis time and this count is used to determine the last duplicate.
- parsing and recognition of heterogeneous data resources are accomplished by code modules, which in some cases consist of generated code that is created by the earlier modules of the system.
- code modules which in some cases consist of generated code that is created by the earlier modules of the system.
- the HLDSS preprocessor which parses and interprets the HLDSS specification, is responsible for generating such code and tailoring it to the annotations given in the HLDSS.
- This code generation process creates the LSD schema tree and the modules (e.g., parsers) which access data and build the LSD instance tree.
- This generated code also performs the necessary data conversions from the external form to the internal values--as dictated by the Type specifications which are also part of the full HLDSS (not shown in FIG. 3).
- FIG. 3 shows a logical structure diagram which accesses different data resources.
- the multiple overlapping ovals surrounding nodes marked with a "+" signify that multiple data instances correspond to this node for a single parent instance.
- the nodes of the LSD are annotated with the annotations that are given in the HLDSS, together with derived annotations that are determined during processing.
- One important category of derived annotations is that of uniform regions, discussed below, which determines the access and parsing/generation of data.
- the schema tree represents the logical structure of the data.
- the structure of the schema tree specifically the parent/child/sibling relations, are represented by the productions in the HLDSS file.
- the right-hand side elements of a production are children of the left-hand side. And that left-hand side, in turn, is a child of the production in which it appears as a right-hand side. All elements that appear together on the right-hand side of a production are siblings.
- the type specifications specifically integer, float and string, describe the data types of the actual instance data.
- the annotations and spec lines describe details of how the data is stored. Note that this is independent of the structure of the schema tree. A given schema tree can map back to data that is stored in very different ways, like a flat file, a web page, a relational database or an object oriented database, but share the same logical structure, by the use of different annotations for the input and output.
- the schema tree consists of "schema nodes," where each node corresponds to a right-hand side element in an HLDSS production.
- chema nodes where each node corresponds to a right-hand side element in an HLDSS production.
- An example of part of an HLDSS specification is given earlier when discussing FIG. 3.
- Each node has attributes such as a label and a node type.
- the node's label is determined by the corresponding element name in the HLDSS file.
- their type corresponds to the type of their data, i.e., string, float, integer, etc.
- non-terminal nodes their type describes what kind of non-terminal it is.
- Non-terminal nodes can either be left-hand side nodes, or "plus" nodes.
- each non-terminal that appears on the left-hand side of a production in the HLDSS file gives rise to a corresponding non-terminal node in the schema tree.
- the children of that rule-node are all of the nodes that appear on the right-hand side of the aforementioned production. Any of these right-hand side nodes that are non-terminals appear as the left-hand side of another production. This process proceeds recursively.
- the first phase analyzes the HLDSS and creates the description of the LSD schema tree and the necessary data structures.
- the second phase utilizes the description that was generated in the first phase to actually construct the data structures in the executing information bridge process.
- Interpreted languages, such as Lisp, TCL/TK or Perl provide an "eval ⁇ operator that allows (source) code generated by a program to be interpreted and executed by the program that created it.
- the first is to create an internal language and interpreter for the intermediate representation and use that for the description and interpretation.
- the drawback of this approach is that the internal representation is limited by the language that is created to describe it. As system requirements change or expand, this representation, as well as the interpreter, must be changed to allow new features to be added.
- the second option is to generate code in an existing language, compile the code, and then execute it. The draw back is that it requires a separate compilation and execution phases, which represent separate processes.
- the benefit is that since the generated code is the same language as the generator (C++ in this case), it can be directly used and has all the expressive power of the underlying language (C++).
- the HLDSS parser generates C++ code, which is then compiled in the first phase.
- the compiled code when executed, creates the actual data structures for the schema and instance trees when the information bridge is executed in the second phase.
- a uniform region is essentially a contiguous set of data from a common data source such that it is uniformly parsable, e.g., tuples from database relations, or binary data from a file.
- a uniform region is defined as a complete subtree or subgraph within the logical structure diagram, all of whose terminal nodes are uniformly parsable and from a single data source, and such that there is no larger containing complete subtree/subgraph which qualifies as a uniform region.
- Terminal nodes correspond to actual data
- non-terminal nodes correspond to structures and aggregates.
- the LSD schema becomes a more general graph rather than a tree due to multiple parent nodes and/or cyclic references.
- a subtree is complete if there is a unique node which serves as a root, and such that the subtree includes all and only those nodes reachable from the root via the directed edges.
- a subgraph is complete if it contains a complete subtree which spans all the nodes of the subgraph.
- Uniform regions partition the set of terminal nodes, and thus the set of actual data, into homogeneous subsets, each of which may be accessed by a single access mechanism and parser/recognizer.
- Shared substructure is represented by an LSD instance subgraph which has two or more parent nodes. If the LSD schema graph is cyclic, this represents a recursively defined data structure. The corresponding LSD instance graph need not have such cycles since each component could be represented by a separate copy of its instance subgraph--unless the instance data is also shared.
- multiply referenced substructure in the LSD schema graph does not automatically imply shared substructure in the LSD instance graph--it is just the potential for sharing which is indicated by an explicit annotation in the HLDSS and in the LSD schema graph.
- Parsers can be organized as object types according to the taxonomy of data resource types.
- An instance of a parser object type is associated with a specific uniform region in the LSD schema. That parser instance is activated whenever data from that uniform region is to be accessed or created.
- Different uniform regions will have different instances of the same parser object type when these regions have the same type of data source and same type of data representation--e.g. objects in an object database. Utilizing different parser object instances, even of the same type, captures the possible differences in data sources (e.g., two different ASCII files) and the different states those parser object instances may be in when (an occurrence of) their region is complete.
- a given uniform region is characterized by a data source, a parser type, and a parser object instance; and this information is attached to the unique node in the LSD schema tree/graph which is the root of this uniform region.
- the process of determining uniform regions and associated parsers for the LSD tree (or graph) serves to cover all terminal nodes with distinct parsers.
- the root or distinguished node of each uniform region now has a parser method associated with it which can recognize (or create) data in that region.
- each node of this LSD schema there will be several instance nodes, all being instances of this type of LSD schema node.
- each associated instance node represents a different instance or occurrence of this uniform region in the actual data.
- Each child node then is visited in turn, proceeding from left to right for sequential processing.
- Parallel execution would be supported by processing independent subtrees in parallel. Limited dependencies between subtrees could be approached by message passing between the respective parallel processes for these regions.
- parsers The operation of specific types of uniform region data access functions, referred to as parsers will now be addressed. All relational database parsers share substantial functionality, and this is accomplished by the definition of a relational parser object type. Then specific relational databases are handled by creating associated parser object subtypes, such as for Oracle, Sybase, and Informix database products.
- step 5 commits the transaction, thereby allowing the database to release access to the underlying tables that serviced this query--typically this is needed only for multi-step insert and update access but not for simple query retrieval.
- Step 6 to close the database is executed only when the system has determined that no further access to this database is needed, or at the end of processing the LSD and all data for it.
- Both relational and object database parser types are themselves subtypes of the ⁇ database ⁇ object type in the system. This serves to abstract from the above methods those operations which are in common among all databases, such as generic initiation of a connection and opening the database, establishing a query or access pattern, accessing data instances, completing the access, and eventually disconnecting from the database.
- connection to the database may be closed when the system determines that no other access to that database will be needed or upon completion of all interactions.
- Structured files, databases, and other data resources are treated uniformly--the same HLDSS specification language and LSD internal representation applies to all heterogeneous representations. The differences are dictated by the annotations.
- a binary region is processed by a different type of parser which recognizes 8-bit data and treats field lengths in bits rather than bytes.
- the length may be fixed or may be specified by prior data or terminated by data matching a given pattern (regular expression).
- Each individual data source is specified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- URL can be thought of as a universal file reference across the entire internet.
- an annotation specifies a URL, the data resource is accessed and then the retrieved data is decomposed or parsed in the same manner as for an ASCII file.
- Embedded hyperlinks may also be processed by the system.
- the right hand side (RHS) of an HLDSS production defines named components of the data structure referenced by the left hand side (LHS). Any of these components may involve further substructure by specifying another production with that component on the LHS. Arrays would be accessed as a sequence of elements whose length is the product of the dimensions of the whole array or of the specified array slice.
- a linked list would be represented by a production with a linked list annotation.
- Trees would be represented by a set of productions, one for each subtree, and may be recursive, where the LHS represents a node and the RHS represents the children.
- the number of components may be unspecified, in this case the "+" or "*" notation in the HLDSS for the repeating component designates one or more, and zero or more occurrences, respectively.

- X windows interface X windows interface and it represents the Interoperability Assistant and Toolkit. It provides a great deal of support for building and executing information bridges along with other functionality. Consequently, it is intended to be used by both the Integration Administrator as well as by general users of information bridges.
- a control file approach is used to store the pertinent information needed to create and/or execute an information bridge.
- the control file contains information about the locations of the three specification files, the location of the information bridge, as well as pertinent information relating to data sources and data targets.
- An Integration Administrator can create a new control file or, in many cases, modify a similar control file on-line and save the modified file under a new name.
- Two types or classes of users of the system include:
- One of the capabilities available to the user is to dynamically view the progress of execution of an information bridge during the data transformation process using a monitor to show the status of each of the three separate processes:
- the browser provides a homogeneous presentation of both the schema and data instances from multiple heterogeneous databases and structured design files.
- The represents an important aspect of integration since the user need not be concerned with the differences between data models, databases, and other structured data representations.
- This feature in an information bridge the ability to graphically represent data in a uniform manner without relying on particular data models is provided.
- Such browsing may be done on either 1) schema and data prior to transformation--so as to preserve the original logic of the application; and/or 2) after such data transformations are completed--the latter thus includes the semantic integration which has been done through the transformation rules.
- the browsing mechanisms are the same. The ability to browse the data from either of these two viewpoints provides useful flexibility.
- the schema shown in FIG. 3 is displayed by browser schema 300 in FIG. 5, the browser providing both horizontal and vertical views for schema and data.
- the user In addition to browsing the full schema and full instance trees, the user also can control how the schema and instance trees are displayed.
- the user may contract specific subtrees so as to focus on portions of the schema and/or data that are of interest and remain in view. Such contracted subtrees may be expanded to their full subtrees at any time during the browsing, as controlled by the user.
- the browser also may be switched between instance and schema displays at will.
- the Browser example in FIG. 5 shows that the data values at the leaves of the schema are displayed. Data is associated only with the leaves, while the tree structure represents relationships in the source and/or target databases. Notice that only one set of related data values is shown at a time--that is, one data value for each leaf node in the LSD schema tree.
- the set of menus and options include:
- Tree Menu apply to both schema browsing and instance browsing
- View Menu option to switch between vertical display (root at top and leaves at bottom) verses horizontal display (root at left and leaves at right).
- the user may go to the next or previous instance relative to the current instance and a designated pivot node.
- the pivot serves as the point at which the notion of next and previous is applied.
- the Next Instance operation advances to the next instance of the pivot node, and in so doing will advance each of the immediate children of that pivot node--with this effect propagating down to the leaves.
- some or all leaf nodes will show their data values changing.
- sequence of values for the different leaf nodes is defined as a logical ⁇ tuple ⁇ since there is a single value in each position at any one time. That is, a tuple is defined as the sequence of data values, one per leaf node, that fall under the tree scope of a selected node, which is referred to as an ⁇ anchor ⁇ node.
- a more compact representation of data values in tabular form showing multiple such logical tuples at a time.
- the user selects a subtree of the LSD tree by selecting as an anchor node the root of this subtree.
- the tabular view then will display in a scrollable subwindow the sequence of tuples arising from the leaf nodes under the root of the selected subtree. There will be one tuple for each combination of leaf node data values.
- a dialog box then allows specification and editing of the qualifications for the node.
- SEMDAL includes frame based structures, inheritance, creation of groups of frames, etc.
- a subset of SEMDAL can be transformed into the HLDSS format. This enables SEMDAL to be applied to database interoperability issues for structured databases (relational, object-oriented, hierarchical, etc.) as well as for structured files.
- the interpretation is defined as the operational processing which is to be applied to different constructs of the syntactic language, both in terms of the logical meaning as well as the procedures which are to be applied for a particular application.
- the following is an example of a Frame construct:
- ⁇ !FRAME manifest header bound nodes numNodes
- ATTributes are scoped within that Frame, that attributes defined in the !ATT portion are semantic attributes, and that the names on the right side of the ": :" are structural components or structural attributes. Any representation language includes in its definition some implicit interpretations. What is important is that the set of interpretations which are being described are explicit so that different interpretations can be captured within the same language by specifying the relevant interpretations rather than needing different languages for each.
- the SEMDAL language is mapped into SGML.
- the lexical scoping of the Frame construct is not directly paralleled by SGML.
- the Frame construct allows the same attribute name to be used differently in different frames due to the lexical scoping and is similar to an object definition. However, if each attribute name is used uniformly in all Frames, then the Frames of SEMDAL can be translated into the !Elements of SGML and the !ATT of SEMDAL becomes the !ATTList of SGML.
- manifest is a relation which has fields/attributes for header, bound, nodes and numNodes.
- ⁇ phyla ⁇ in the HLDSS for database interoperability is essentially what is meant here by the interpretation. This is what determines whether the HLDSS statement is to be treated as a reference to a relation, an object, or part of a parsing specification for a structured file.
- INTERPretation attribute can be used by a reasoning or processing engine to determine how the other attributes and constructs of the specification should be interpreted and utilized.
- a 2-dimensional matrix is defined with a value that is called a WindVector.
- the structural components of WindVector are defined in a second Frame.
- “MatA” is a matrix because its INTERPretation is “matrix”. This means that the right most structural component is the value at each entry of the matrix, and the other structural components are the dimensions, thus it is a 2-dimensional matrix. Hence the dimensions and value attributes could have been deduced.
- the notation "$" means that the value of WindVector rather than the string/name ⁇ WindVector ⁇ is the value at each element of the matrix--this value consists of the 4-tuple of structural components defined in the WindVector Frame.
- the notation (Lat 1 Lon) allows semantic attributes which are common to multiple components or attributes to be defined concisely in a single expression; similarly for the Units of (X 1 Y 1 Z). Of course, this example is not the only way of representing the direction and speed of a wind vector.
- matrices can be represented in a relational database by a relation defined for each matrix and having an attribute/field for each of the N dimensions, and another attribute for the value--or several attributes if the value has substructure. Then each tuple would contain the N coordinates followed by the value at that coordinate. This could be space efficient for sparse matrices.
- N-ary relationships are also achieved as another interpretation of a Frame.
- an n-ary relation may be defined by a Frame as in the following example:
- variable Logical variables for both values as well as for names in SEMDAL are now introduced and it is shown how constraints can be expressed in terms of these variables. Variables can be denoted as ?XX where the"?” indicates that XX is the name of a variable, and XX may be any alphanumeric string where the leftmost position is alphabetic and capital letters and lower case letters are treated as different.
- the variable may stand for either a value or a name of any term in SEMDAL, that is, the variable may stand for the name of a Frame, the name of a structural component (on the right side of the ":: "), the name of a semantic attribute or a semantic (sub)attribute of an attribute (a slot), etc.
- variable The meaning of the variable is designated by setting it equal to the components involved.
- Use of the wildcard “*" can refer to multiple components, which may be further restricted if desired by a predicate that the variable also must satisfy.
- valid expressions for defining variable include:
- the first expression above defines the variable ?Cv to be the value of the Cost component in the Supplies frame, while the second and third expression define the logical variable ?CR and ?Ty to be the values of the semantic attributes Currency and type respectively.
- the fourth expression defines the variable ?Cattr to be one of the attribute names in the set of attributes of Cost, while the fifth expression defines the variable ?Aset to be the set of attribute and component names of Supplies--the curly braces ⁇ ⁇ indicate that the set of attributes rather than one attribute is intended.
- Constraints are a very important part of metadata for the following reasons:
- Constraints express logical consistency among different schematic constructs and definitions when they are interrelated in the real world.
- Constraints provide an important means of expressing semantics involving multiple objects.
- Constrains express the requirements for data consistency within complex databases and between different sites that contain interrelated data values.
- Constraints can express conditions and predicates which may signal important events.
- Constraints are used to make the active metadata repository respond to changes and events and to initiate actions dynamically.
- the !Constraints set can be lexically within a Frame, or can be in a !Group clause, or can stand alone outside of a Frame--the latter is appropriate when constraints interrelate components of two or more frames.
- the Constraints set is named and may contain multiple constraints separated by ";" and ended by the closing ">".
- constraints do not need to involve variables.
- constraint statement
- the dotted expressions such as Supplies.Cost, are path expressions, and the value of the component on the rightmost side of that path is the value which is being constrained. A suffix of ".value" could be added to the right side of each path for the same effect.
- constraints may also be generalized. While the six constraint expressions above defined each variable in terms of its allowed set of values, another form of constraint makes the value set implicit in terms of how the variable can be bound. thus a constraint such as:
- variable ?X binds variable ?X to any component or attribute of Supplies which has a value, and it binds ?Y to the value of that component.
- One of the significant advances made by the present invention is the seamless ability to store diverse forms of metadata in a single repository utilizing a single logical and physical storage scheme.
- the differences between metadata representations as currently used are accounted for via the operational interpretation of the uniformly stored information.
- alternative syntactic realizations of this metadata are provided so as to continue to support those applications which expect different syntax for different uses.
- the logical design level of the metadata repository allows for multiple implementations and is convenient in different storage architectures.
- the physical storage of one implementation is relation-based in order to be accessible with the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standard for the Java interfaces to relational databases. Note that the choice of repository implementation is independent from the data models being described.
- JDBC Java Database Connectivity
- the metadata repository of the present invention encompasses both structure and semantics, and it does so in a way that can accommodate separately developed and different metadata within a primary framework.
- the main structural representation focuses on hierarchical tree-structures as the dominant structuring mechanism. It also accommodates full directed graph structures through cross-referencing among nodes in the spanning tree of the graph.
- the semantic representation consists of three levels:
- Semantic Frames attributes, and subattributes or slots
- syntactic diversity has been capitalized on to admit yet other alternative syntactic expressions for both output as well as input, thereby enabling the development of specialized mini-languages for particular applications while retaining a common underlying semantics and uniform internal representation.
- Such syntactic diversity has been accommodated by providing for an input parser and an output formatter to realize each such specialized mini-language. Both the parser and formatter communicate with the common logical representation.
- this logical representation could have its physical storage implementation in a relational database, or an object-database, or in a hierarchical or network database architecture just as easily.
- a relational storage implementation has been chosen because of its accessibility through the increasingly popular JDBC application programming interface.
- the metadata representation of the present invention shall be referred to as the Semantic Metadata Description Language, or SEMDAL and is also referred to as MDS (MetaData Specification) for short. It is a frame-based representation where a MetaFrame contains potentially multiple attribute value specifications. Each attribute may have subattributes, and these too may have subattributes if needed. This creates a potentially hierarchical array of descriptors. A simple example of such descriptors are ⁇ units ⁇ and ⁇ precision ⁇ information for length, weight, or other measures.
- MetaFrame's metadata The potential hierarchy of semantic descriptors, and the actual substructure of the stored data are distinguished as described by the MetaFrame's metadata.
- Such data substructure is explicit as in SGML, and is denoted by a ⁇ Substructure ⁇ attribute (similar to SGML's ⁇ !Element ⁇ ), or by using a syntactic shorthand similar to BNF (Backus-Naur Form) grammar specifications.
- COPY is a structure copy operation on the value of B.substructure.
- the spanning tree could be created, and then cross-references to correctly represent the shared nature of multiple references to a node could be done.
- the underlying logical model for the metadata repository thus is a hierarchical structural model that can represent the spanning tree over a graph or directed graph structure.
- the logical model for semantic attributes provides a hierarchy of subordinate descriptors--this semantic hierarchy is separate from the structural hierarchy.
- Each semantic descriptor can be represented as a whole, with operations to retrieve the associated value, the parent descriptor which is refined by this subattribute, and the set of subattributes of the current descriptor.
- This features of the logical model can be represented and stored in an object-database or a nested-relational database (there are few nested relational databases). It can be conveniently represented in a traditional relational database through the use of keys which reference the subordinate hierarchical levels.
- the structural hierarchy is reflected by tuples in a different relation, with similar ability to find the parent aggregate and/or the component children of a non-terminal node.
- each level of the semantic hierarchy and the structural hierarchy are represented by tuples in relational tables, and references to subordinate (or parent) levels is effected through the relational join operation.
- the basic group is a Metaframe, which is named.
- the MetaFrame is started with “ ⁇ MetaFrame", every completed line ends with semi-colon ";” except that this is optional for the last line.
- the MetaFrame is closed with "/>” or, optionally with "/MetaFrame>.
- MetaFrames are not syntactically nested.
- a MetaFrame contains semantic attributes and sub-attributes (slots) which may be nested arbitrarily deep.
- a MetaFrame also contains structural components which may themselves be aggregates of other components.
- the representation for an analog watch then can refer to Clock-Schema.SecondHand.Length.Units to define the units in which the length of the second hand will be expressed. Then a simple number in the actual data representation will have meaning that is explicit. Such units is semantic information and is part of the metadata that is managed, and it is necessary information in order to properly utilize the actual length data values--which may be stored in a separate database of instance data.
- Uniformity of representation in SEMDAL is achieved by recognizing that seemingly different data models and representation formalisms differ mostly in terms of how they represent information, and, in fact, there is much overlap between data models. The superficial differences often involve implicit assumptions in a data model, such as the implications of syntax. These assumptions are made explicit in the SEMDAL model.
- SEMDAL provides a system level attribute ⁇ INTERP ⁇ to capture this INTERPretation, indicating, for example, whether the data is from a relational database table or from the data members of an object.
- subattributes such as “units”
- subattributes do not define substructure of the data--rather these subattributes provide additional metadata to help interpret the data which is presented.
- a pattern-based attribute expression may be used to indicate this as:
- Length and Width may be abbreviated as follows, where the alternatives are enclosed in parentheses and are separated by “
- A.type attribute for some attribute path A.
- a list of tokens may be given for a semantic attribute, thereby creating an ordered multi-valued result.
- Each value token also may be treated as a semantic attribute which can have further attributes. So for example below, “Methods” has a pair of method names as its value, and here one of these values, "Rotate”, itself has the semantic attribute of "Args":
- MetaFrame MDS1--often the name of the frame may be given to be the same as the first leftmost component (here ⁇ Manifest ⁇ ). Note that "::” is an abbreviation for substructure.
- the ODB above has substructure consisting of a set of header information--the "+" indicates one or more occurrences of this information, similarly for bound.
- the object database contains a set of bound information, while the relational database contains a table with all the header information.
- the dot before System, Site, and Access indicates that "header” prefixes each of these, since header is the leftmost component on the previous line.
- Both the Type and Length information are the same for Name and Version. Note that the alternation symbol "
- a comma is used as the separator to denote a list of attribute-value pairs, as for the multiple attribute values for Photo.
- Size attribute for Photo has a semantic subattribute indicating that the size is in kilobtyes.
- any attribute may have subattributes, and these in turn may also have subattributes-providing considerable extensibility as more of the implied knowledge of an application is made explicit.
- Attributes such as INTERPretation are system defined attributes. In order to avoid name conflicts as the application designer creates attribute names, system attributes may be prefixed with the "! exclamation mark, as "! INTERP".
- Metadata repository The logical structure described for the Metadata repository is hierarchical, which could be naturally implemented in a ⁇ nested relational ⁇ database or an object database, as well as in other databases. Due to the increasing value of the JDBC connectivity between Java programs and relational databases, a relational implementation has been chosen. Thus the Metadata Repository will be accessible via the JDBC standard API.
- the metadata which are stored describe related instance data--which usually is stored separately in one or more repositories, such as in a relational or object database, document repository , or multimedia digital library.
- MetaFrameAttributes is defined to represent the primary semantic information from each attribute line of the MetaFrame.
- the columns of MetaFrameAttributes are:
- the full attribute path includes the Frame name--if the Frame is unnamed it is given a default name of "!Unnamed".
- the FrameName is listed in a separate column for indexing, thus the AttributePath' in the MetaFrameAttributes relation does not include the FrameName.
- Each of the attribute components which are bounded by a dot' delimiter on one or both sides is referred to as an ⁇ attribute term ⁇ .
- the attribute terms in “Auto . Engine . NumCylinders” are “Auto”, “Engine”, and “NumCylinders”.
- the AttributePath includes the attribute terms from left to right as a single string, including the ⁇ dot ⁇ delimiters.
- the ⁇ Local Attribute ⁇ is this rightmost attribute term in an attribute path.
- the ⁇ Parent AttributePath ⁇ is formed by removing the LocalAttribute from the AttributePath ⁇ .
- the Parent is shown as null, which means that the Frame is the parent.
- Multiplicity is set to ⁇ one ⁇ if the value consists of a single token or if double quote marks are around the whole value, thereby making it a single string. Otherwise, if a subattribute "ValueSeparator" exits, it is used to parse what is given for the value into the actual multiple values. Else whitespace is used as the separator to parse the value and determine the Multiplicity. Upon retrieval of this information, the subattribute ! Multiplicity (where "! is required) is materialized from this Multiplicity field, rather than being stored and retrieved as a separate attribute path tuple. System attributes of the form "! 1" and “! ⁇ integer>” are also provided, where the "! is required, to reference the first through nth value in a multi-valued result--giving n>!Multiplicity is an error.
- Wildcard expressions in an attribute path include special symbols such as "* " for zero or more attribute terms, or "?” for one attribute term. These wildcard attribute path expressions are entered directly in the table as is, and also are expanded for all existing attribute paths, with each expansion entered separately as well. When new attribute paths are entered, they will be checked relative to the existing wildcard expressions. When new wildcard expressions are entered, they will be checked relative to all existing attribute paths. Wildcard expressions involving “*” may be qualified, by naming the "*” as in "*x”, and including a qualifying expression, as in Car.*x (
- ⁇ 3, x 1 "Level?").NumCylinders. The qualifying expression, within the "()”, says that up to 3 attribute terms may occur, and that the first/leftmost must match the given string pattern, i.e., must begin with "Level” followed by one more character.2
- MetaFrameStructure The substructure portion of a MetaFrame consists of those lines, typically placed first in the MetaFrame, which have "::" following a token--or an attribute path ending in substructure--these are often referred to as structure productions. To represent this information in a relational database, to create a relational table MetaFrameStructure:
- LHS is the left hand side of the "::” or the parent attribute path of substructure
- RHS is one of the right hand side components. There is one such tuple for each right hand side component. Order is the ordinal position, starting at one, and taken from left to right, of this RHS component. Occurrence is the occurrence flag for that RHS: either "?", "*", "+”, or blank--representing respectively one, zero or more, one or more, or single occurrence.
- the first three columns of the MetaFrameStructure table are separately indexed.
- SYSColumns : tabid colno colname coltype collength . . . ;
- XML is an emerging language called the Extensible Markup Language. It is intended to extend and eventually supersede HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and to be in the spirit of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) but to be substantially simpler than SGML.
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- SGML Standard Generalized Markup Language
- the DAtabase Integration System DAISy has been described in detail and how it provides interoperability across heterogeneous resources, including databases and other forms of structured data.
