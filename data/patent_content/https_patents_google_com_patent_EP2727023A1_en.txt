Definitions
- This disclosure relates to shared metadata for media files.
- Multimedia files such as audio or video files may be played based on a user's personal preference or ranking. For example, certain songs can be included in a particular playlist based on the user's selection. Further, the order in which the songs are played may also be based on the user's preference.
- the user's preferences are embodied in metadata associated with each media file.
- the metadata can include general information about a particular media file, such as an author, title, or genre associated with the media file, as well as user-specific information, such as a user's personal rating of the media file, the user's personal categorization of the media file, or a date/time that the media file was last played, for example.
- the metadata associated with a media file may be stored with the media file as tags. In some instances, users can also share media files with other users or view other users' media files.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a set of common music tracks associated with a first user and a second user, wherein the set of common music tracks includes at least one music track present in both a first set of music tracks associated with the first user and a second set of music tracks associated with the second user; retrieving metadata associated with at least one music track in the set of common music tracks, the metadata being specific to the second user; and organizing a set of user music tracks associated with the first user based on the retrieved metadata.
- Retrieved metadata for the at least one music track in the set of common music tracks contains information regarding at least one category, the at least one category including a date the particular music track was last played by the second user, a number of times the particular music track has been played by the second user, or a rating of the particular music track by the second user.
- Organizing the set of user music tracks includes displaying at least a portion of the set of user music tracks in an order based on the at least one category.
- Organizing the set of user music tracks includes displaying data to the first user based on retrieved metadata for each of the common music tracks.
- a request is received from the second user to hide data based on the retrieved metadata associated with a particular music track, and display of the data to the first user is prevented.
- Organizing the set of user music tracks includes automatically playing music tracks in the set of user music tracks in an order based on the retrieved metadata, including playing the music tracks based on metadata associated with the particular music track without displaying the metadata to the first user.
- Organizing the set of user music tracks includes automatically playing music tracks in the set of user music tracks in an order based on retrieved metadata. Determining the order for playing the music tracks comprises assigning an individual score for at least one category of the retrieved metadata for at least one music track in the set of common music tracks; calculating a preference score for the at least one music track based on the individual score for the at least one category; and determining an order for playing the at least one music track based on the preference score calculated for the at least one music track.
- Results of the organizing of the set of user music tracks is transmitted to a client device associated with the first user, wherein the results include at least one of a playlist of at least a portion of the set of user music tracks or a display of data based on retrieved metadata.
- the set of common music tracks includes at least one music track shared by the first user with the second user. At least one music track in a second set of user music tracks associated with the second user that is not in the set of user music tracks associated with the first user is identified; and a suggestion to the first user for obtaining the at least one music track based on retrieved metadata for the at least one music track is presented.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system that organizes media files based on shared metadata in accordance with an embodiment.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process for organizing music tracks in accordance with an embodiment.
- FIGS. 3A-3E are example diagrams of user interfaces presented to a user in accordance with an embodiment.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computing device that can be used to implement the processes described herein.
- This specification describes technologies relating to shared metadata for multimedia files. Although this specification focuses on sharing metadata associated with audio files (e.g., music files), the implementations disclosed herein can be used to share metadata associated with other multimedia file types, such as video files, for example.
- audio files e.g., music files
- video files for example.
- a user can organize a music collection based on usage patterns and likely preferences of other users.
- a user can benefit from another specific user's preference or dislike for various songs.
- the other user may be, for example, a friend of the user who may share similar tastes in music.
- a user may have some songs in common with a friend, and the user may be interested in which common songs the friend prefers or listens to more frequently.
- metadata associated with the friend's preferences and history of listening to the common songs can be collected, and information represented in the metadata can be presented to the user. The user can then view the information associated with the common files and organize the user's own music files based on the metadata.
- the user's playlist can be automatically arranged or individual songs rated based on the metadata collected from the friend. Suggested songs or playlists can also be presented to the user based on the metadata from the friend's music collection.
- the metadata collected from other users can include, for example, other users' personal ratings or categorization of individual songs, the play count of songs by other users, or the date a particular song was last played by other users.
- the play count of a particular song includes a number of times the song has been played by a particular user within a certain time period.
- a user may have the option of granting access to metadata of some of the user's songs while hiding access to metadata of other songs.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example architecture for a system 100 that organizes media files based on shared metadata.
- the system 100 includes a mobile device 102, which may include a processing system that may be accessed by a user interacting directly with the mobile device 102 through a graphical user interface (GUI) 108.
- GUI graphical user interface
- any appropriate computing system can be used in place of the mobile device 102, including a personal computer, laptop, PDA, tablet, or other computing device.
- the mobile device 102 includes a processor that can execute programs, perform data manipulations, and control tasks vin the mobile device 102.
- the processor can execute programs and computer applications such as media player 105.
- the computer applications can include a web browser or other application configured to present an interface to a user for accessing data associated with preferences of other users, such as users of other mobile devices or computing systems 150.
- a media player application 105 performs playback of digital multimedia, including playback of streaming media and audio or video files.
- the digital multimedia may be remotely stored as media files 124 at a server 142, and provided to the mobile device 102 across a network 106 or stored locally at the mobile device 102.
- the media player 105 is executed on the remote server 142 and provided as a hosted service to a user of mobile device 102.
- the media player 105 may also be stored and executed locally at the mobile device 102.
- the media player 105 can include additional features.
- the media player 105 interfaces with a media organizer 111 module that provides functionality for organizing a user's media files 124.
- media organizer 111 is illustrated as an individual module at server 142, media organizer 111 can also be implemented as a sub-module within media player 105 or as any application, widget, embedded application, sub-module, third party service, process, component, library, and the like, configured to perform the features described herein.
- the media organizer 1 11 can allow a user to save media files 124 for later playback or to edit media file metadata 125 associated with the media files 124.
- the metadata 125 can be represented as tags for individual media files 124 that can be stored with each media file 124. As depicted in FIG.
- the metadata 125 is stored at the server 142 with the media files 124.
- the metadata 125 can also be stored separately from the media files 124, such as in a separate repository.
- the metadata 125 can indicate, for each media file 124, an author, title, genre, length of playback, date of composition, style, or a user's personal rating/categorization of the media file 124, for example.
- the metadata 125 can also include information about usage patterns of a media file 124, such as date/time of last play or a count of the number of times the media file 124 has been played (e.g., play count).
- FIG. 1 depicts media files 124 and media file metadata 125 stored at the server 142, the media files 124 and metadata 125 may be stored locally at the mobile device 102 or at the computing device 150.
- multiple users may have their own media files 124 at the server 142.
- the media files 124 are uploaded by each user or purchased through a music service associated with server 142 at a prior time.
- Each of the users may own their own set of songs.
- the mobile device user may have a set of songs 120 while the computing device user may have a different set of songs 180.
- the media files corresponding to each of the songs may be stored on the server 142, each user may be limited to playback of the set of songs belonging to that particular user. Each such user may not be permitted to play songs belonging to other users.
- a user's own songs may be associated with user-specific metadata providing information regarding the user's preferences for each song. Accordingly, the songs 120 belonging to the mobile device user are associated with one set of user-specific metadata 121 while the songs 180 belonging to the computing device user are associated with a different set of user-specific metadata 181.
- the user-specific metadata 121 and 181 may be automatically captured by the media organizer 11 1 during users' playback of their songs. Some items of the metadata 121 and 181 may be defined by the user directly, such as a rating of a particular song, for example.
- the metadata 121 and 181 may also be captured at client devices 102 or 150 and uploaded to server 142.
- the user-specific metadata 121 and 181 are depicted with their respective media players 105 and 165 because, typically, the metadata associated with a particular user is utilized only with respect to that user or viewed only by the user. In some instances, however, the user-specific metadata may be shared with other users or accessed for organizing other users' media files. Accordingly, the user-specific metadata 121 and 181 may be "shared metadata" in some instances.
- the shared metadata 121 and 181 may be stored with their respective media files 125 at the server 142.
- the media files 124 may be stored locally at different client devices, such as at mobile device 102 and computing device 150, instead of at the server 142.
- the user-specific metadata 121 and 181 may also be stored at server 142 to allow media organizer 111 to analyze the metadata for organizing songs for users.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a computing device user with a different device than the mobile device user, multiple users can access their own media files on the server 142 through the same device. For example, two friends may access their own media files using separate accounts on the server 142 through the same mobile device 102.
- a media organizer 1 1 1 can also be configured to create, edit, or share playlists containing one or more songs.
- a playlist can include a grouping of certain songs for sequential playback.
- media organizer 11 1 can interface with media files associated with other users, allowing a user to view or access media files associated with the other users.
- mobile device 102 may communicate with server 142 over a network 106, allowing the mobile device user to view media files associated with the computing device user.
- Media file metadata, playlists, and other information can be shared between users.
- media organizer 1 11 is also configured to organize a user's songs 120 based on shared metadata 181 associated with other users, such as the computing device user.
- media organizer 1 11 can obtain metadata associated with other users who share common songs with the user, and present suggestions to assist the user in organizing the user's songs 120.
- the suggestions can be designed to provide guidance to the user in rating or categorizing individual songs, grouping songs together, or determining an order of playback of songs.
- the media organizer 1 1 1 automatically performs some organizational functions, such as automatically generating playlists, ordering songs, or rating songs.
- FIG. 1 depicts a flow of data during various states among mobile device 102 and server 142, when an example process for organizing media files based on shared metadata is performed by the system 100.
- the states (a) to (e) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than the illustrated sequence.
- a mobile device user can initiate a request to determine whether another user shares common songs with the user.
- a common song may be any song that is present in the music collections of a first user (e.g., mobile device user) and another user (e.g., computing device user).
- the actual media file associated with a common song may not be the same in the mobile device user's library and the computing device user's library, the same song may be represented in both music collections.
- a particular song is identified as a common song if the songs in two music collections have the same title and artist name. Variations in album name between two songs may not preclude a match as a common song.
- songs are identified as "common” songs when appropriate. For example, a user may have a song titled “Lean on Me” while another user has a song titled “Lean on Me (Live).” Both songs are variations of the same song and may be identified as a common song.
- Metadata associated with common songs may assist users in organizing those songs.
- the request is sent to the media organizer 111 at server 142 to determine whether there are common songs associated with a user of computing device 150.
- potential users from which user-specific metadata may be obtained for organizing a user's media files may be identified based on the user's selection. For example, a user may select a friend from a friend list in order to determine whether the user shares common songs with the selected friend.
- media organizer 111 may also maintain a constant record of which songs are common to which users. For example, media organizer 111 may store a particular field in the metadata 125 of each media file stored in server 142 indicating which users have the same song in their music collection. The metadata field may be updated accordingly when a particular user adds or deletes a particular song.
- the request may be a signal to the media organizer 11 1 that the mobile device user is currently accessing media files 124 stored on the server 142, and not an explicit request to determine common songs.
- the media organizer 11 1 responds to the request by determining a list of the songs stored on the server 142 that are common between the two users.
- the songs are stored as media files 124 on the server 142, and each user of the media organizer 111 may have a personal digital library of songs. Users may purchase media files from a music service provided through the server 142 or may upload personal media files to the server 142 for storage.
- the media organizer 1 11 determines the songs that are shared between the mobile device user and the computing device user during state (b).
- the mobile device user may "own” a set of songs 120 on the server 142.
- the songs 120 are stored at the server 142, "the songs 120 belong to the user of mobile device 102 and may be presented and played for the user through media player 105, as illustrated in FIG. 1.
- the computing device user also owns a set of songs 180 stored on the server 142 and may play the songs using media player 165. Accordingly, media organizer 1 11 can identify a set of common songs 1 15 between the two song collections 120 and 180.
- the media organizer 1 1 1 extracts metadata 181 specific to the user of computing device 150 and that is associated with each song in the set of common songs 115.
- the media file metadata 181 is user-specific and may provide an indication of likely preferences of the computing device user.
- the metadata 181 may include information regarding the frequency that each song is played, a date/time each song was last played, or a personal rating of the songs.
- metadata 181 may also include a user's designation of particular songs that the user wants to share with all or a portion of the user's friends.
- the metadata 181 may include information regarding the context in which certain songs are played.
- the locations of the computing device user at the time a particular song is played may be included in metadata 181 to determine if the user plays the song more frequently in certain locations.
- the location of a user may be obtained from global positioning system (GPS) data or other signals indicating a location of the user such as a check-in application that identifies a particular event, store, restaurant, or venue that the user is present at.
- Context information found in the metadata 181 may also include, for example, an estimated activity of a user (e.g., running, driving) while a particular song is playing, which may be determined by analysis of a user's motion during playback. As described below, a particular song may then be recommended to another user when the other user is in the same location or performing the same activity.
- the computing device user may not want to share metadata indicating a play count or personal rating of a particular song in the set of common songs 115, such as "If I Can Turn Back Time," for example.
- the computing device user can designate the metadata or information based on the metadata associated with "If I Can Turn Back Time" that provides information about the user's play count or personal rating of the song as hidden so that the metadata or information is not viewable by the mobile device user.
- media organizer 111 may allow a user of computing device 150 to share some metadata and related information with other users while designating some metadata and related information to be hidden. Metadata associated with specific songs can be hidden or specific information can be hidden with respect to individual songs or a group of songs.
- the media organizer 111 analyzes the identified metadata 181 in order to organize the user's songs 120 based on the identified metadata 181. In some implementations, the media organizer 111 arranges the common songs 115 in a particular sequence for playback on the mobile device 102, or generates a suggestion to play the songs in a particular order, based on signals indicating the likely preferences of the user of computing device 150. The signals may be determined based on the identified metadata 181. Examples of signals reflecting preferences of a user can include a play count for a particular song, a date the song was last played, a user-specified rating of the song, and the like. An overall score can be generated for each common song based on a combination of the various factors described above that indicate a user's likely taste or preference for a particular song.
- the identified metadata 181 can be used in conjunction with metadata 121 reflecting the mobile device user's own preferences to determine a play order for a larger set of songs, including songs that are not among the common songs 115.
- a playlist that includes the common songs 115 as well as the other songs in the mobile device user's song collection 120 may be presented to the mobile device user for playback.
- the location of each of the common songs 115 in the playlist may be based on both the metadata 181 associated with the computing device user as well as metadata 121 associated with the user of mobile device 102.
- the song may be placed generally lower on the playlist than songs that are associated with high or neutral ratings, including songs that may not be among the common songs 115 but have higher scores based on the mobile device user's own metadata 121.
- the results of the analysis performed during state (d) are conveyed to the mobile device 102 during state (e).
- the media organizer 111 can generate a playlist with songs in a particular sequence, or the media organizer 111 may also automatically play the mobile device user's songs 120 in a particular sequence based on the analysis during state (d).
- the actual metadata 181 (or information based on metadata 181) specific to the computing device user can also be presented for viewing to allow the user of mobile device 102 to decide how to order or rate the songs.
- the mobile device user's metadata 121 may be automatically edited based on analysis of the metadata 181 associated with the computing device user.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process 200, performed by media organizer 111, for organizing music tracks for a first user.
- media organizer 111 identifies a set of common music tracks shared between a fist user and a second user at 202.
- the first and second users may each have their own set of music tracks, which may be stored together in the same location, such as at a server.
- the first and second users may generally be limited to viewing or listening to their own music tracks. Some music tracks may be present in both users' music collections. Accordingly, the cross-section of their music collections is identified.
- Media organizer 1 11 retrieves metadata associated with each music track in the set of common music tracks at 204.
- the metadata may be specific to the second user.
- the metadata for a particular music track can include information regarding at least one category, such as a date the particular music track was last played by the second user, a number of times the particular music track has been played by the second user, or a rating of the particular music track by the second user.
- the metadata can also include information regarding the context in which a particular music track is commonly played, such as a specific location of a user listening to the music track or an activity being performed by the user while listening to the music track.
- metadata may not be available for every music track.
- Media organizer 11 1 organizes a set of user music tracks associated with the first user based on the retrieved metadata at 206.
- the set of user music tracks corresponds to all or a portion of the user's music collection, which may include the set of common music tracks.
- the information from the retrieved metadata for the set of common music tracks may be displayed to the user.
- the first user can sort the common music tracks based on one of the categories represented in the retrieved metadata, as described below with respect to FIG. 3. Not all of the information based on metadata specific to the second user may be displayed to the first user. For example, second user may designate some metadata as hidden to prevent the metadata from being displayed to the first user.
- Metadata may still be used to generate a playlist or determine an order in which music tracks are played to the first user.
- the set of user music tracks may be automatically played to the first user in an order based on the retrieved metadata.
- FIGS. 3A-3E depict example screenshots of user interfaces presented to a user when media files are organized using media organizer 1 1 1, as described above in relation to FIGS. 1 and 2.
- the user interfaces for presenting and organizing media files depicted in FIGS. 3A-3E may be integrated with other applications, such as a media player application, social networking application, chat room application, and the like.
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example screenshot 300a of a display of a user's own music collection 302.
- a user may view music tracks 303 in the collection by song title, artist, album, or genre, for example.
- the user can access a playlist 304 to view music tracks that are grouped together or music tracks that are arranged in a particular sequence for playback.
- the user can also access a list 306 of other users, or friends.
- the list of friends 306 may include other users who have previously established an online connection with the user, such as through a social network, prior communications, or shared interests, for example.
- the friends may be other users that also have music collections with common songs shared with the user.
- the metadata associated with friends that have common songs may potentially be used to organize the user's media files.
- the user may add additional friends by clicking on a visual object 309a depicting a "plus” sign, which may bring up an Add Friends dialog box.
- the user may also add friends using a "Search, add, or invite” box 309b.
- a user can hide the list of friends 306 from view.
- FIG. 3B illustrates an example screenshot 300b of a display of common music tracks shared with one of the user's friends 306a.
- a user's selection of the name of one of the friends 306a from the friends list 306 can initiate a request to media organizer 111 to determine and present a list of common music tracks 308 to the user.
- the common music tracks 308 are the music tracks that are owned by both the user and the friend 306a.
- FIG. 3C illustrates an example screenshot 300c of a display of metadata information associated with music tracks shared between two users.
- information based on metadata that is specific to both a user and the user's friend 306a can be displayed for a particular music track.
- rows 322, 324, 326, and 328 represent common music tracks that are present in the user's music collection and the friend's 306a music collection
- columns 312, 314, 316, 318, 319, and 320 represent different categories of metadata information for each music track displayed.
- the categories may include the friend's number of plays for each music track 312, the user's number of plays for each music track 314, the friend's date of the last play of each music track 316, the user's date of last play of each music track 318, the friend's personal rating of each music track 319, and the user's personal rating of each music track 320.
- FIG. 3D illustrates an example screenshot 300d of a display of metadata information associated with a user's friend and sorted based on a particular category.
- the user may arrange the common music tracks in an order based on the friend's number of plays for each music track by selecting the friend's number of plays column 312.
- the user may also select another column to arrange the order of songs by other metadata categories, as illustrated in FIG. 3C.
- a user may view the friend's information for the common music tracks so that the user can decide which of the common music tracks to listen to, in what order to listen to them, or how to rate them.
- FIG. 3D illustrates an example screenshot 300d of a display of metadata information associated with a user's friend and sorted based on a particular category.
- the user may arrange the common music tracks in an order based on the friend's number of plays for each music track by selecting the friend's number of plays column 312.
- the user may also select another column to arrange the order of songs by other metadata categories, as illustrated in FIG.
- the user may also view information based on his own metadata for the common music tracks to compare with the friend's metadata or to see the metadata associated with the user that may be displayed to other users.
- Other metadata categories that are not illustrated in FIG. 3C may also be displayed, such as typical location of a user during playback of each music track or typical activities being performed during playback of each music track.
- the user-specific metadata may be used to determine a general preference score approximating a user's "taste" for a particular music track.
- the preference score may be used to automatically determine a sequence or frequency for playing the common music tracks to another user.
- the preference score may be based on one, all, or a combination of metadata categories, such as the ones depicted in FIG. 3C. For each music track, an individual score may be assigned for each of the categories, such as a play count, a last played date, or a personal rating. Music tracks with a greater number of play count, a more recent play date, or a higher personal rating, would receive a higher score for each of those categories.
- the individual scores for each metadata category can then be combined to form an overall preference score.
- different weights can be assigned to individual scores when calculating the overall preference score.
- the overall preference score may be hidden from users and just used to organize music tracks, or the preference score may also be presented to users in some instances.
- a user may be able to access metadata information of common songs from more than one other user.
- a group of users may share common songs, and metadata information from each of the users may be used to organize media files for one or more of the members of the group.
- a user may be able to view metadata information associated with each of the other members of the group, for example.
- a group preference score may also be calculated for each music track that includes a combination or average of preference scores associated with different members for each music track.
- the media organizer 1 11 may present a list of suggestions to the user indicating music tracks that the user may not own but that may be owned by one or more of the user's friends 306.
- the suggested music tracks may be determined based on, for example, a threshold number or percentage of the user's friends 306 who each own particular music tracks that are not owned by the user.
- the media organizer 111 may also determine suggested music tracks based on information extracted from metadata associated with music tracks owned by the user's friends 306. For example, if a particular music track that is not owned by the user is associated with a high play count or high rating by other friends 306 who own the music track, the media organizer 111 may present the particular music track as a suggested music track for the user to purchase or obtain.
- the media organizer 1 11 may be configured to present a suggestion of potential friends based on metadata associated with other users that are not included in the user's friend list 306. For example, the media organizer 111 may automatically search for common music tracks that the user shares with other users that are not in the friend list 306. If the number of common music tracks shared between the user and one of the other users exceeds a minimum threshold number or percentage, the media organizer 1 1 1 may suggest the other user as a potential friend for the user to add to the friend list 306. The media organizer 11 1 may also suggest potential friends based on likely preferences of other users extracted from metadata associated with common music tracks. For example, the media organizer 111 may calculate user-specific preference scores for each common music track shared between the user and another user. If the preference scores for the common music tracks are similar, the media organizer 111 may suggest the other user as a potential friend for the user.
- FIG. 3E illustrates a screenshot 300e of options that may be presented to a user for a particular music track.
- a menu of options 307 for a selected music track 305 may be presented to a user, as illustrated in FIG. 3E.
- the user may select a particular music track 305, and a menu 307 is presented in response with the option to hide a particular music track from a friend.
- the user may allow other users to view the music track but hide specific information from the metadata for the music track, such as the number of plays of the music track, the last played date of the music track, or the user's personal rating of the music track.
- the user may be given the option to change privacy settings to designate who can view common music tracks shared with the user, who can view metadata information specific to the user, or what categories of metadata information are visible.
- the user may choose among allowing only friends, friends of friends, or anyone to view common music tracks or metadata information. These privacy settings may be applicable to all common music tracks or to a particular music track.
