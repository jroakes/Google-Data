- the video content client device 150 includes a set-top box, mobile device, and personal computer client device.
- the video content delivery system 100 shown in FIG. 1 may include any number of interconnected IPTV servers 110 , managed networks 120 , video content servers 130 , video content client devices 150 , and users 160 .
- the managed network 120 and internet 140 shown in FIG. 1 are communication networks.
- the present invention also contemplates the use of comparable network architectures including a LAN, a Personal Area Network (PAN) such as a Bluetooth network, a wireless LAN (e.g., a Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) network), peer-to-peer overlay network, and a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
- PAN Personal Area Network
- Wi-Fi Wireless-Fidelity

- the system also contemplates network architectures and protocols such as Ethernet, Internet Protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol.
- the multimedia content delivered in the video content delivery system 100 shown in FIG. 1 includes, but is not limited to, transport mechanisms such as HTTP.
- transport mechanisms such as HTTP.
- One advantage of the HTTP transport mechanism is avoidance of firewall issues that associated with other transport mechanisms.
- the multimedia content is delivered to the video content client device 150 as a single bitrate stream.
- One disadvantage associated with HTTP is streaming quality depends on the quality of the IP connection. Since content delivery may undergo stalling due to bandwidth fluctuations, it is difficult to use a single bitrate stream for live broadcasts and video-on-demand (VOD) delivery.
- VOD video-on-demand
- various other embodiments, including adaptive streaming, live streaming, and scalable coding are available at the IPTV server 110 and video content server 130 to deliver multiple bitrate versions of the multimedia content.
- the video content client device 150 selects an appropriate version for decoding and rendering depending on the managed network 120 , internet 140 , and video content client device 150 resources that are available. Technologies that currently facilitate this selection include Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)/Apple HTTP-Live-Streaming (HLS), Microsoft Silverlight Smooth Streaming, Google WebM, MPEG DASH, and Flash. For instance, HLS works with segmented TS-based video streams or files. Thus, the chosen container for HLS is an MPEG transport stream (TS) encapsulating MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) for video and AAC for audio.
- TS MPEG transport stream
- the multimedia content is typically chunked and made available to the video content client device 150 as relatively small files, typically on the order of 5 to 30 seconds. Some use cases may utilize larger chunks.
- the chunks from different bitrate versions streams can be synchronized to allow for switching between bitrate versions based on the throughput of the managed network 120 and internet 140 and video content client device 150 processing capabilities.
- An index file points to the chunk files that make-up the multimedia content. Each chunk is typically encoded and encrypted independently.
- Scalable coding schemes such as scalable-video coding (SVC) or JPEG2000 or Motion JPEG2000 follow the paradigm of “Encode once, decode in many ways”.
- the bitstream is scalable in multi-dimensions or characteristics, e.g., resolution (size), bitrate (quality), frame-rate, position, and color-component.

- Efficient implementations of multimedia content players will pre-buffer multimedia content streams so that playback from a point within the pre-buffered portion begins with minimal lag. Such pre-buffering is useful for reducing playback latencies especially for operations such as seek or random-access operations in the multimedia content stream, and fast-playback modes (e.g., playback at two-times normal speed).
- the multimedia content stream includes a number of frames.
- the “key-frames” are the frames that can be independently decoded, without reference to other frames (e.g., intra frames in MPEG-4 Visual, and IDR frames in H.264). The key frames are important when implementing random-access and trick-play operations.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram that illustrates one embodiment of a prior art single segment multimedia content pre-buffering method.
- the prior art implements pre-buffering of a single segment from the playout position onward as shown in FIG. 3 .
- the shaded region indicates the accumulation of data in a buffer over a period of time. As time progresses, the amount of data buffered may increase until a desired amount is reached.
- An example of such pre-buffering can be found in a video content client device 150 that views a video on an internet 140 video sites such as YouTube, where the entire media stream is progressively pre-buffered. When the video content client device 150 is an embedded device with limited resources, it cannot perform pre-buffering of the entire clip length.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram that illustrates one embodiment of a prior art multiple segment multimedia content pre-buffering method.
- segmented pre-buffering the buffered segments are discontinuous, where each buffered segment corresponds to the beginning of a segment in the multimedia content stream.
- a multimedia content player plays the multimedia content stream from the playout position shown in FIG. 4 .
- the shaded regions indicate the accumulation of data in a buffer associated with the playout position and each possible seek position (SEEK ⁇ 2, SEEK ⁇ 1, SEEK +1, and SEEK +2).
- a user 160 seeks to a position in the multimedia content stream that does not align with a segment boundary, the system has to flush the currently pre-buffered data and begin the pre-buffering process.
- the present invention builds upon the concept of segmented buffering as shown in FIG. 4 by aligning each buffer to start at a key-frame in the multimedia content stream. This will enable a user 160 to seek to a point far-removed from the current playout position.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram that illustrates a multiple segment multimedia content pre-buffering method according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the intelligent selection of pre-buffering segments can be based on several considerations that improve upon the simple prior art strategy of pre-buffering equal segment lengths starting from each key frame, or from each selected key frame. Weighting based on access-likelihood can improve the benefits of pre-buffering.
- the size of the buffer is the amount of buffered content
- the strategy shown in FIG. 5 can be adapted further as a learning engine that collects how a user accesses the stream over a period of time to predict how the user will likely access the stream in the future.
- some users may typically playout content linearly.
- Another user may regularly randomly access the content in a forward direction, to look-ahead in the content.
- Yet another user may regularly replay parts of content that have already been played or skimmed.
- the present invention maintains a historical log of access to the stream for each user-profile to support the learning engine.
- the segmented pre-buffering shown in FIG. 5 can also be extended to adaptive bit-streams and scalable streams, wherein multiple versions of the same content that vary a characteristic of the content (e.g., bitrates), are made available to the video content client device 150 as needed.
- Scalable streams typically do not store multiple encoded versions as separate streams, enhancement versions are deltas (i.e., differential components) over a base version.
- each encoded version of a scalable stream is reconstructed from encoded components of the stream, where each encoded component varies a characteristic of the stream.
- FIG. 6 is a network bandwidth chart that illustrates an adaptive chunked multimedia content pre-buffering method according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- Each row in the chart (STREAM 1 , STREAM 2 , STREAM 3 , and STREAM 4 ) illustrates an adaptive stream at a given bitrate, where each stream comprises eight chunks (i, i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4, i+5, i+6, and i+7) that are available over a given period of time.
- STREAM 1 has the lowest bitrate
- STREAM 2 has the second lowest bitrate
- STREAM 3 has the third lowest bitrate
- STREAM 4 has the highest bitrate.
- the network bandwidth chart also shows the change in the available network bandwidth 610 over time.
- the system examines the available network bandwidth 610 and selects the chuck for that time period from the appropriate stream. As shown in FIG. 6 , since the available network bandwidth 610 is high at time i, the system selects the chuck 620 from STREAM 4 . At time i+1 and i+2, since the available network bandwidth 610 has dropped, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 3 . At time i+3, since the available network bandwidth 610 has dropped, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 2 . At time i+4, since the available network bandwidth 610 has dropped, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 1 . At time i+5, since the available network bandwidth 610 has increased, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 2 . At time i+6, since the available network bandwidth 610 has increased, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 3 . At time i+7, since the available network bandwidth 610 has increased, the system selects the chuck from STREAM 4 .
- FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram that illustrates a successive selection pre-buffering method based on bitrate according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- pre-buffering of adaptive streams is based on a multi-level or successive approximation strategy in which selection is based on bitrate.
- the stream with the lowest bitrate (STREAM 1 ) is buffered most frequently
- the stream with the second lowest bitrate (STREAM 2 ) is buffered less frequently
- the stream with the third lowest bitrate (STREAM 3 ) is buffered even less frequently
- the stream with the highest bitrate (STREAM 4 ) is buffered least frequently.
- STREAM 1 is buffered at every key frame (KF 1 , KF 2 , KF 3 , KF 4 , KF 5 , KF 6 , KF 7 , KF 8 , and KF 9 ),
- STREAM 2 is buffered at every other key frame (KF 1 , KF 3 , KF 5 , KF 7 , and KF 9 ),
- STREAM 3 is buffered at every fourth key frame (KF 1 , KF 4 , and KF 9 ), and
- STREAM 4 is buffered at every eighth key frame (KF 1 and KF 9 ). Since low bitrate streams consume less buffer space than high bitrate streams, buffering the low bitrate streams more frequently is not an overly excessive use of buffer space.
- the target bitrate chunk i.e., the bitrate associated with the available network bandwidth 610
- the target bitrate version of the stream is presented. If the target bitrate chunk is not available for that seek point, the user 160 can quickly be presented the next highest bitrate version of a chunk starting from the seek point, even as the target bitrate chunk (i.e., the bitrate associated with the available network bandwidth 610 ) starts in parallel with getting buffered from the seek point and immediately successive segments beyond. In this approach, for the chunk duration, the user may be presented with a quality that is lower than what the instantaneous bandwidth affords.
- the pre-buffering of the target bitrate version is kept ready. This trade-off is to minimize the latency. In the worst case, the lowest bitrate version is always available, if buffered from every seek point, it could be argued that if the instantaneous network bandwidth is high enough, the latency in presentation of the target bitrate chunk may be acceptable perceptually. Hence, this approach (to present a quality that is lower than what the instantaneous bandwidth affords, in the interest of latency) could be conditionally gated by a threshold which decides if the available network bandwidth would induce latencies in presentation and hence requires presentation of pre-buffered lower bitrate versions.
- the threshold depends on whether the latency induced by the available network bandwidth (and presentation-unit size) is perceptually objectionable.
- an adaptive streaming client starts from the lowest bitrate version of adaptive stream to minimize the latency incurred when starting the playout. Also, so that sudden changes in quality do not cause discontinuities in the viewed content, this embodiment progresses gradually through all the interim bitrate versions, until the bitrate afforded by the current network bandwidth. If network bandwidth drops, the strategy typically is different in that the bitrate version closest to, and lesser than the network bandwidth, is immediately transitioned to, without stepping down gradually. Additional considerations in buffering can optimize the latency incurred in playing out from a position that has no pre-buffered data.
- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram that illustrates a successive selection pre-buffering method based on priority according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- pre-buffering of adaptive streams is based on according a higher priority to the current stream being played. Assuming that the available network bandwidth 610 has a higher probability to remain constant or only vary gradually, rather than exhibiting instantaneously sudden changes, this strategy buffers more frequently for the current stream being played, and less frequently for other bitrate streams.
- the method buffers segments that start from every key frame of the bitrate version of stream currently being played. Bitrates that are “farther away” from the current played-out-stream's bitrate can be buffered less frequently in a successive manner. As shown in FIG.
- the current playout position 810 is at key frame KF 5 in STREAM 2 .
- STREAM 2 is buffered with more frequently by buffering at the start of every key frame (KF 1 , KF 2 , KF 3 , KF 4 , KF 5 , KF 6 , KF 7 , and KF 8 ).
- the bitrate streams proximate to the bitrate of the current stream are STREAM 1 and STREAM 3 , hence STREAM 1 and STREAM 3 are buffered less frequently than STREAM 2 .
- STREAM 8 shows a dyadic sub-sampling whereby every alternate key frame of the key frames buffered for STREAM 2 are buffered for STREAM 1 and STREAM 3 (KF 1 , KF 3 , KF 5 , KF 7 , and KF 9 ). Since the bitrate for STREAM 4 is farthest from the bitrate of the stream currently being played, STREAM 4 is buffered least frequently (KF 1 , KF 5 , and KF 9 ).
- This strategy illustrated in FIG. 8 can also be applied in the domain of resolution. Resolutions (sizes) which are “farther away” from the resolution of the stream currently being current played can be buffered less frequently in a successive manner.
- a mobile device that consumes 640 ⁇ 480 resolution media is unlikely or less likely to need segments of a high definition (HD) stream.
- HD high definition
- Scalable coding schemes such as scalable-video coding (SVC, built upon H.264 as its base-layer), as well as JPEG2000 or Motion JPEG2000 follow the paradigm of “encode once, decode in many ways”.
- the bitstream is scalable in multi-dimensions or characteristics (e.g., resolution (size), bitrate (quality), frame-rate, position, and color-component).
- resolution size
- bitrate quality
- frame-rate position
- color-component color-component
- Scalable coding is a forward-looking technology that may not be widely deployed at present but is envisioned to find wide prevalence.
- each bitrate version of the content constitutes one encoded component.
- each encoded component comprises of one or more of a specific resolution (size), a specific quality layer, a specific frame-rate, a specific position, and a specific color-component.
- the strategies described above and illustrated in FIG. 6 , FIG. 7 , and FIG. 8 are applicable to scalable schemes.
- the multi-level paradigm described for adaptive streaming can also be applied to scalable streams.
- the segments of the current bitrate or the current resolution can be given more weight for buffering, in accordance to the earlier figures depicting a distance weighted multi-level buffering.
- FIG. 9 is a flow diagram that illustrates a successive selection pre-buffering method based on a learning model according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the stream selection can also be based on a learning or heuristic model 900 .
- the buffering can be determined based on intelligently learning, and adapting, to one or more objective learning parameters 910 , including user-profile parameters 911 , media category 912 , end-user device profile 913 , acceptable latency of playout from a start of the content stream or one of the seek positions, and network parameters 914 .
- This approach typically includes an offline learning phase to train the model, followed by an online field-deployment phase. While the previously described strategies can be realized in low-complexity, an intelligent learning approach involves relatively moderate to high complexity (based on the training algorithm) for the learning phase followed by low complexity for the field-deployment phase.
- the user-profile parameters 911 detect patterns in how a user 160 accesses the content that they view. Some users may prefer to view content linearly from start to finish. Other users may prefer to quickly sample the content randomly or “channel surf”. Still other users may prefer to playback portions of the content that they viewed earlier.
- the user-profile parameters 911 may include time or byte offsets of each of the user's access to the content, or a log of all the trick plays (e.g., fast-forward, reverse, pause, etc.) that the user requested.
- the media category 912 detect patterns in the category of the content that a user 160 accesses. If a stream is a sporting event, such as a cricket match, the stream would have a number of replays associated with significant portions of the sporting event, such as a boundary, catch, and clean bowled.
- the media category 912 may include sporting event clips having highlight portions, movies, and news.
- the end-user device profile 913 detect characteristics in the end-user device that affect the content that a user 160 accesses. Since each end-user device has a target resolution and bitrate, the buffering scheme gives more weight to the preferred resolution and bitrate. For example, when the end-user device is a mobile device, there is no need to buffer a high-definition (HD) stream.
- the end-user device profile 913 may include an HD display, mobile device, or personal computer.
- the network parameters 914 detect characteristics in the network performance that affect the content that a user 160 accesses. Since the video content client device 150 can switch to a different bitrate version of a stream based on the available network bandwidth 610 , a regression analysis of network bandwidth data that includes past and present usage may be useful to predict future changes in network bandwidth.
- the network parameters 914 may include time-series network bandwidth (i.e., data samples of network bandwidth variation over time).
- the learning model 900 shown in FIG. 9 inputs the learning parameters 910 to a preprocessing 920 module that performs sampling, dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis, and other preprocessing.
- the output of the preprocessing 920 module is input to a predictive classification and modeling 930 module that includes learning by algorithms such as decision trees, Bayesian/statistical classification, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms.
- the output of the predictive classification and modeling 930 are the weights for segments associated with positions and multiple-version streams 940 .
