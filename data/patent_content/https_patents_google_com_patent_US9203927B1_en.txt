- the content provider is an advertiser that wants a particular advertisement to be displayed on the publisher's website.
- the content provider's request may include that the content receive a particular number of impressions (e.g., the number of times the second content is provided by the publisher along with the first content).
- the content provider's request may include one or more constraints.
- the constraints may be one or more conditions that specify the manner in which second content is provided. For example, the constraints may include that the content should be provided to devices within a certain period of time (e.g., between May 1 and May 5, between 9 AM and 5 PM, etc.). The constraints may include that the content should be provided to devices in certain geographical locations (e.g., Canada, Kansas, etc.). The constraints may include that a particular type of content should be provided (e.g., a 300 pixel ⁇ 250 pixel full motion video banner, a 160 pixel ⁇ 600 pixel static graphic banner, etc.). Other types of constraints may be associated with delivery of a content item.
- a content item is time-restricted (e.g., serve content only between 5 PM and 9 PM), then achieving the requested number of impressions is challenging because a content publisher has a limited time during which to serve the content.
- a content item is location-restricted (e.g., serve content only to devices in Canada), then achieving the requested number of impressions is challenging because a content publisher is limited to devices only in the specified locale.
- a particular type of content item e.g., serve a 300 pixel ⁇ 250 pixel full motion video banner
- achieving the requested number of impressions is challenging because a publisher has limited space on, e.g., the publisher's website, on which the specified content may be provided. For example, a publisher may have only one spot for a 300 pixel ⁇ 250 pixel banner, whereas the publisher may have two spots for a 160 pixel ⁇ 600 pixel banner.
- delivery of one content item may be associated with multiple constraints (e.g., serve content (a) only between 5 PM and 9 PM, and (b) only to devices in Canada).

- the “constraint domain” describes a range of possible constraint parameter values that may be associated with a content item. An overlap exists when two or more content items share one or more of the same constraint parameter values.
- campaign receiver 208 may receive two line item requests: campaign 1 for display in the United States from December 1 to December 5 and campaign 2 for display in all countries from December 1 to December 3.
- an overlapping constraint domain exists with respect to the both time and geography.
- the date range December 1 to December 3 is shared by both campaign 1 and campaign 2.
- the geography range United States is also shared by both campaign 1 and campaign 2.
- Implementations of the present disclosure may advantageously generate a content delivery schedule to satisfy the impressions requirements for campaign 1 and campaign 2, as well as satisfy the constraints associated with both campaigns.
- the data may be processed by campaign receiver 208 and/or stored by campaign database 212 such that when the constraint domain data for multiple line items is received at analyzer 214 , analyzer 214 may, among other things, determine if overlapping constraints exist.
- Campaign receiver 208 may aggregate, associate, or otherwise process the line item, campaign, and/or budget data as shown in FIG. 3 , according to an illustration implementation.
- campaign database 212 may store aggregated, associated, or otherwise processed data as shown in FIG. 3 .
- Campaign database 212 may include detailed historical databases (e.g., relational databases, XML databases, etc.) of relevant data.
- Memory 206 includes computer code modules that continuously, frequently, or infrequently query, aggregate, transform, search, or otherwise process the data maintained in the detailed databases.
- FIG. 3 suggests that that data is organized and sorted by campaign in database 212 . In other implementations, data may be sorted by content provider, content publisher, content item, etc.
- Campaign 300 includes one or more content items 338 , 340 for delivery to, e.g., client computing devices.
- Content items 338 , 340 may be associated with content provider 302 . While FIG. 3 shows two content items 338 , 340 , in various implementations, campaign 300 may be associated with one or more than two content items.
- Content items 338 , 340 may include text, static graphics, animation, video, rich media, etc.
- Content items 338 , 340 may have varying display sizes (e.g., on a website), file sizes (e.g., as stored in a memory and/or transmitted to a client computing device), data formats (e.g., Flash, HTML5, etc.).
- content items 338 , 340 may be interactive.
- content items 338 , 340 may solicit user responses or may include a game involving user control through one or more user input devices associated with a client computing device (e.g., mouse, keyboard, etc.).
- content items 338 , 340 are online advertisements (e.g., advertisements for display on a webpage).
- content items 338 , 340 may be information (e.g., news), games, or other types of content.
- Content provider 302 may have requested that content items 338 , 340 be published by content publisher 306 .
- content provider 302 may have requested content items 338 , 340 be published by more than one content publisher or any content publishers associated with content organizer 108 .
- Campaign 300 may be associated with a budget 304 .
- Budget 304 may include updated information based on, e.g., previous display of content items 338 , 340 , additional input from content provider 302 , etc.
- budget 304 may have originally included a target amount of money for expenditure on display of content items 338 , 340 .
- Content items 338 , 340 may have been previously displayed by publisher 306 .
- Budget 304 may be updated (e.g., decreased) to account for the previous impressions.
- analyzer 214 FIG. 2
- a content delivery schedule may be generated periodically (e.g., every day, every hour, etc.).
- Budget server 102 ( FIG. 1 ), which may be configured to receive actual content delivery data, may push updated budget data (based on the actual content delivery data) to scheduling server 110 so that each iteration of the content delivery schedule is generated based on an up-to-date budget.
- quota 308 may be a metric describing an amount or frequency a content provider intends that content items 338 , 340 be published by content publisher 306 .
- quota 308 includes impressions 310 . Impressions 310 may be a number of times a content item is provided for display to devices 114 ( FIG. 1 ). For example, a content provider may request that content item 338 be provided for display 500 times in the aggregate. As described below, the impression requirement may also be associated with one or more constraints (e.g., generate 500 impressions for content item 338 by serving to devices in the United States between December 1 and December 5.
- quota 308 may be associated with a campaign as a whole (e.g., one or more content items). In other implementations, each content item is associated with a particular quota 308 .
- Constraint parameters 320 may be one or more conditions that specify how content items 338 , 340 are delivered to devices 114 ( FIG. 1 ). Constraint parameters may include temporal/time limitations 322 . For example, a content provider may transmit instructions to a content publisher that a content item is to be delivered between specified hours (e.g., between 5 PM and 8 PM), for a specified duration (e.g., for three hours), on specified days (e.g., between Friday and Sunday), on specified dates (between December 1 and December 5), and/or any combination thereof. Time constraints 322 may also include instructions for delivery to repeat periodically (e.g., delivery between Friday and Sunday every week).
- Constraint parameters may also include geography and location-based limitations 326 .
- a content provider may transmit instructions to a content publisher that a content item is to be delivered to devices in one or more particular regions (e.g., the United States, North America, etc.) or to all devices except those in certain regions.
- Constraint parameters may also include content type limitations 324 .
- a content item may be provided as a either a static image or as an animation
- a content provider may transmit instructions that the content should be delivered to devices as an animation.
- other constraint types may also exist. For example, based on a user's voluntary self-identification, content may be delivered based on a user's demographics.
- a content organizer, content publisher, and/or content provider may have more, fewer, and/or different constraints associated with delivery of content items.
- one content item may be associated with one or more constraint types (e.g., time and geography).
- each content item may be associated with a constraint domain (the cross section of all constraint values for a particular content item).
- a provider may transmit instructions that a content item is to be delivered between December 1 and December 5 (time constraint) to devices in the United States (geography constraint).
- time constraint time constraint
- geoography constraint devices in the United States
- an overlap may occur in the constraint domain of the multiple content items. For example, a first campaign may be requested to be delivered between December 1 and December 5 to devices in the United States, and a second campaign may be requested to be delivered between December 1 and 3 to all devices.
- the time period December 1 to December 3 and the geographic region United States are overlaps.
- no overlaps may exist in the constraint domain.
- a first content item may be requested to be delivered to devices in Canada on December 3, and a second campaign may be requested to be delivered to devices in the United States on December 4-5. While these examples include two types of constraints (time and geography), in others implementations, the constraint domains associated with a content item may include more, fewer, and/or different constraint types.
- Campaign 300 may be associated with one or more priority parameters.
- scheduling server 110 is configured to generate a content delivery schedule that satisfies the impression goals and constraints of all campaigns.
- “All campaigns” may include, for example, the competing campaigns for the particular content publisher in a given constraint domain. For example, each of four content providers may have requested a content publisher to publish one content item between 5 PM and 8 PM on a given day.
- Scheduling server 110 may determine if the impressions goals and constraints of all four content items may be satisfied. Circumstances may arise when it is infeasible or otherwise inefficient to satisfy the impressions goals and/or constraints of one or more campaigns.
- scheduling server 110 may sacrifice one or more of the campaigns based on the priority parameters 330 associated with each campaign. According to an illustrative implementation, only impressions goals are sacrificed. That is, if a content provider transmits an impressions goal and constraints to a content publisher, the constraints are satisfied even if the impressions goal is not met. In other implementations, impressions goals and/or constraints may be sacrificed. Thus, priority parameters 330 may be utilized by scheduling server 110 to determine in which order impressions goals and/or constraints are not met. That is, priority parameters 330 may be used to determine, when not all impressions goals and/or constraints can not be satisfied, which campaigns' impressions goals should be met.
- Priority parameters 330 may include relationship value 332 and revenue value 336 .
- relationship value 332 may describe a preexisting relationship between a content provider and a content publisher.
- relationship value 332 may be defined by a content publisher for each content item that a content provider requests the publisher to deliver to devices. For example, content provider A may request that two content items be published: a first content item may be assigned a high relationship value, and a second content item may be assigned a low relationship value. Content provider B may request that one content item be published, and the content item may be assigned a high relationship value.
- Revenue value 336 may be a monetary description associated with a content item.
- revenue value 336 may be an amount of money a content provider agrees to expend for every one thousand impressions. In some implementations, revenue value 336 maybe a dollars-per-impression value.
- a content publisher may be choose to prioritize the satisfaction of the impressions goals for a content item that generates more revenue higher than lower-revenue-producing campaigns.
- Revenue value 336 may be described as a subset of relationship value 332 (i.e., relationship 332 is a more general description of relative priority between multiple campaigns).
- campaigns may be associated one or more relationship values 332 and/or revenue values 336 .
- memory 206 includes demand forecaster 210 .
- Demand forecaster 210 may generate a prediction of future traffic (e.g., demand for a content items, ad requests, etc.) for a future period of time (e.g., the next hour, the next day, etc.). That is, demand forecaster 210 may predict, e.g., the number of impressions and/or the frequency of impressions for content items.
- Demand forecaster 210 may generate predictions based on past content demand and delivery. Past content demand and delivery data may be transmitted by content server 106 ( FIG. 1 ) to scheduling server 110 . Predictions may be based on one or more constraints.
- predictions may be specific to e.g., geography, time/day of the week, type of content, etc.
- demand forecaster 210 may be configured to generate updated predictions periodically (e.g., every hour, every day, etc.)
- demand forecaster 210 may generate an updated prediction each time scheduling server 110 generates an updated content delivery schedule.
- Demand forecaster 210 may also utilize past content delivery data to predict selection rates (e.g., click through rates) for particular content items. Predicted selection rates may vary based one or more parameters. For example, content with full motion video may have a higher click through rate than content with static graphics.
- Memory 206 includes analyzer 214 .
- Analyzer 214 may be configured to generate a content delivery schedule that meets the impressions goals and constraints of one or more campaigns. According to an illustrative implementation, analyzer 214 may generate a different content delivery schedule for each content publisher associated with a content organizer. The schedule may include instructions describing the delivery of each of one or more content items requested to be delivered along with other content delivered by the content publisher. Analyzer 214 may combine knowledge of current and future campaigns with predictions about future content requests (i.e., traffic) to generate a content delivery schedule. Analyzer 214 may receive current and future campaign data from campaign database 212 . Analyzer may receive predicted traffic data from demand forecaster 210 . Analyzer 214 may transmit the content delivery schedule to content server 106 , which in turn may deliver the content items based on the schedule.
- Analyzer 214 may use one or more mathematical methods to generate a content delivery schedule.
- analyzer 214 may use a bipartite maximum flow or non-chronological simulator.
- a non-chronological simulator may process in a random order (instead of chronologically), which advantageously enables optimization across time.
- Each campaign may be assigned a satisfaction index (SI).
- SI may be a scalar quantity that tracks how well the campaign is delivering.
- Analyzer 214 may process all predicted traffic, assigning each impression to the eligible campaign with the lowest SI. (Initially, impressions_simulated_thus_far is zero, and SI is undefined. An arbitrary decision may be made in the initial case.) Periodically (e.g., each hour, each day, etc.) and for each campaign, the number of assigned impressions is recorded. This data may then be provided to content server 106 in the form of an optimized delivery plan.
- Analyzer 214 may be implemented using bipartite maximum flow.
- Bipartite maximum flow algorithms are used to solve a class of problems where N classes of things need to be efficiently allocated into M categories.
- the N classes may be the types of impressions, i.e., groupings of impressions. Impressions fall into the same group if they are eligible for the same set of campaigns.
- the M categories may be campaigns.
- Each of the N classes may be applicable only for a different subset of the M categories.
- One goal of the bipartite maximum flow method may be to utilize as many of the objects as possible.
- Each of the N classes may have a limited quantity of objects available.
- Each of the M categories may have a maximum number of objects assigned to it.
- the category limits are the campaign goals.
- An optimized content delivery schedule is generated by making efficient use of the impressions to achieve the campaign goals.
- bipartite maximum flow may be described as the full space of inventory (i.e., campaigns), being subdivided until each piece (i.e., region) is a subset of all campaigns.
- Each campaign may be composed of many regions. Regions may be contained in multiple campaigns.
- a node is created in the residual graph describing the problem. The campaign nodes are connected to the source. Each edge has the capacity of the impressions goals of the campaign. A node is created for each region. Each of the nodes is connected to all campaign nodes that contain it with edges with infinite capacity. Each region is connected to the sink with an edge capacity reflecting the estimated traffic (inventory) for the node. The maximum flow may then be calculated.
- the actual flow on each of the internal edges connecting the campaigns and the regions reflects the optimal delivery for a campaign in that region. This may be recorded as the optimized content delivery plan.
- linear programming and/or other mathematical methods may be implemented by analyzer 214 to generate an optimized content delivery schedule.
- Analyzer 214 may be configured to optimize for any utility function describing the delivery of content items to devices. According to an illustrative implementation, analyzer 214 is configured to satisfy the impressions goals and constraints of as many campaigns as possible. If not all goals and/or constraints may be met, publisher-provided priority (e.g., relationship value 332 of FIG. 3 ) may be used to decide which campaigns' goals are sacrificed. In some implementations, a campaign with a lower priority parameter may be sacrificed ahead of a campaign with a higher priority parameter. Priority parameters may be received per campaign. As between campaigns with equal priority values, revenue (e.g., revenue value 336 of FIG. 3 ) may be used to determine which campaign(s) are sacrificed.
- publisher-provided priority e.g., relationship value 332 of FIG. 3
- Priority parameters may be received per campaign.
- revenue e.g., revenue value 336 of FIG. 3
- the impressions goals of a campaign with higher revenue may be sacrificed only after a campaign with lower revenue is sacrificed.
- the revenue parameter may be cost per one thousand impressions or another measure of costs that a content provider has agreed to incur for delivery of the content item.
- a rate of selection of the served content e.g., click through rate
- content items may include a hyperlink to a designated URL.
- a user's selection of a content item e.g., depressing a mouse button, tapping a touch screen, etc.
- content that is more likely to be selected is sacrificed only after content that is less likely to be selected has been sacrificed. This may advantageously increase the utility of served content by serving content that is more likely to be selected.
- other criteria and/or orders of such criteria for choosing which campaigns goals to sacrifice are used.
- analyzer 214 may transmit a content delivery schedule to a simulation server (e.g., simulation server 104 ).
- Simulation server 104 may simulate the expected content delivery based on the schedule generated by analyzer 214 .
- simulation server 104 may rerun the actual content requests for a past period of time that corresponds to the period of time during which the content items of the generated schedule are being delivered. For example, if the schedule includes content items to be delivered between December 1 and December 5, simulation server 104 may implement the schedule using the traffic from December 1 through December 5 of the previous year.
- the simulation server may generate metrics to describe the efficacy of the generated schedule. For example, simulation server 104 may be configured to determine how many impressions goals were satisfied, etc.
- the metrics data may be transmitted to analyzer 214 and used by analyzer 214 to modify the content delivery schedule.
- Content delivery may be simulated by simulation server 104 zero, one, or more times prior to a schedule being delivered to content server 106 for implementation.
- FIG. 4 a diagram illustrating how a content delivery schedule is generated is shown, according to an illustrative implementation.
- the processes involved in generating delivery schedules 410 , 420 , and 430 may be carried out, in general, by scheduling server 110 of FIG. 1 and, specifically, in one implementation, by analyzer 214 of FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 4 is shown to include campaigns 402 , 404 , 406 , 408 .
- Campaigns 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 may include content items (second content) requested to be delivered with other content (first content) served by a content publisher.
- One or more content providers may have requested that the campaigns 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 be delivered to client devices.
- Campaigns 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 may each be associated with an impressions goal.
- campaigns 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 are associated with time and geography constraints. (In other implementations, campaigns may be associated with fewer, more, or different constraint types.)
- a content provider may request that campaign 402 be delivered between December 1 and December 5 to devices in the United States.
- Campaign 404 is requested to be delivered to all devices between December 1 and December 3.
- Campaign 406 is requested to be delivered to devices in Canada on December 3.
- Campaign 408 is requested to be delivered to all devices between December 4 and December 5. Between the four campaigns, overlaps exist in the time and geography constraints.
- Analyzer 214 may compute different delivery targets to reconcile the different overlaps. For example, analyzer 214 may determine (e.g., using bipartite maximum flow, non-chronological simulator, etc.) that campaign 406 needs all matching inventory on December 3 in order to meet its impressions goals. That is, campaign 406 may meet its impressions goals only if campaign 406 (and no other campaigns) are served in Canada on December 3. This is shown in schedule 430 .
- Schedule 430 indicates that content server 106 ( FIG. 1 ) is instructed to deliver campaign 406 in Canada on December 3. (Schedule 420 , for campaign 404 , shows that campaign 404 is not served in Canada on December 3.)
- Campaign 406 's delivery requirement affects campaigns with overlapping constraints.
- campaign 404 overlaps with campaign 406 with respect to time and geography. Because only campaign 406 is served to devices in Canada on December 3, campaign 404 may need to be served more in geographical regions other than Canada (e.g., the United States) on December 3. This is shown in schedule 420 .
- Schedule 420 includes that campaign 404 is delivered more in the United States on December 3 so that campaign 404 may also satisfy its impressions goals.
- the increased delivery of campaign 404 in the United States may affect delivery of campaign 402 (not shown).
- Campaign 408 which does not include overlapping time constraints, may not be affected by the adjusted delivery of campaigns 402 , 404 , and 406 .
- Schedules 410 , 420 , and 430 may be delivered to content server 106 as instructions executable by content server 106 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Process 500 may be carried out by, e.g., scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 500 may be a high level flow diagram of processes described in more detail in FIGS. 7-10 .
- Process 500 includes receiving line item, campaign, and budget data ( 502 ).
- Line item data may be received from content publisher 112 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Line item data includes impressions goals, constraint parameters, and/or priority parameters associated with one or more content items.
- Budget data may be received from budget server 102 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Budget data includes an amount of money to be spent on delivery of one or more content items.
- Campaign data may be received from content publisher 112 , budget server 102 , and/or other servers associated with content organizer 108 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Process 500 includes determining whether an overlap exists in the constraint domain for two or more campaigns ( 504 ).
- Content organizer 108 may evaluate the constraints associated with multiple campaigns (e.g., hundreds, thousands, etc.) that are requested to be delivered with other content served by a content publisher 112 .
- An overlap may exist when two or more campaigns share a constraint parameter value (e.g., serve content A in North America and serve content B in Canada; Canada is a shared constraint parameter).
- a constraint parameter value e.g., serve content A in North America and serve content B in Canada; Canada is a shared constraint parameter.
- Process 500 includes generating a traffic prediction (e.g., expected content demand and content delivery) for a future period of time ( 506 ).
- the traffic prediction may be based on past content demand and delivery.
- Process 500 includes using the predicted traffic and constraint parameters to generate a content delivery schedule ( 508 ).
- the content delivery schedule may include instructions for the delivery of a particular campaign by a content server 106 .
- the goal of the generated content delivery schedule may be to satisfy the impressions goal of a campaign.
- One or more mathematical methods may be used to generate a content delivery schedule (e.g., bipartite maximum flow, non-chronological simulator, etc.). Some exemplary methods are described in more detail in the discussion of FIGS. 7-10 .
- Process 500 includes transmitting the content delivery schedule to a content server ( 510 ).
- the content delivery schedule may include instructions executable by a processor associated with the content server 106 . When the content server 106 receives a request for content, content server 106 may serve content based on the schedule.
- process 600 may be added to process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 600 may be carried out by scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 600 includes generating a content delivery schedule ( 602 ).
- Step 602 may be substantially similar to step 508 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 600 includes transmitting the content delivery schedule to a simulation server ( 604 ).
- Simulation feedback may be received from the simulation server ( 606 ).
- Simulation feedback may include an indication of the predicted success (e.g., satisfaction of impressions goals and/or constraints) for one or more campaigns.
- Process 600 includes regenerating the content delivery schedule based on the simulation feedback ( 608 ). For example, if the simulation feedback indicates that content delivery schedule results in over-delivery of a particular campaign, the delivery schedule may be updated to decrease delivery. Steps 604 - 608 may be repeated multiple times. Process 600 includes transmitting the content delivery schedule to the content server ( 610 ) to be implemented.
- Process 700 may be carried out by, e.g., scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 700 may be a more detailed flow diagram of steps 504 - 508 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 700 may describe circumstances in which two campaigns are compared.
- a similar process may be carried by scheduling server 110 in comparing tens, hundreds, and thousands of campaigns.
- Process 700 includes generating a first time window and a second time window for placing or otherwise delivering a first article of content and a second article of content, respectively ( 702 ).
- the first article of content may be associated with a first campaign
- the second article of content may be associated with a second campaign.
- the time windows may be based on constraint parameters associated with the content items.
- content items are associated with time constraints.
- the time windows may include a start time and an end time.
- the time window may describe a period during which a content provider intends that the content items be delivered to, e.g., client computing devices.
- a content provider may transmit instructions specifying the time window.
- the time window may be “generated” by, e.g., a scheduling server in the sense that the scheduling server generates instructions executable by a content server (a content delivery schedule or content delivery plan) relating to, e.g., the start time, the end time, the total duration, etc.
- a content server a content delivery schedule or content delivery plan
- the articles of content may be associated with different or multiple constraint types (e.g., geography, time and geography, etc.).
- the articles of content may be associated with, e.g., a geographical delivery region in addition to or in lieu of a time window.
- the cross section of constraint parameters associated with a content item forms a constraint region.
- a scheduling server e.g., may generate a constraint region for a first and second article of content.
- Process 700 includes generating a first quota for the first article of content and a second quota for the second article of content ( 704 ).
- the quota may be, e.g., the impressions that a content provider intends that a content item receive.
- a content provider may transmit instructions specifying the quota.
- the quota may be “generated” by, e.g., a scheduling server in the sense that the scheduling server generates instructions executable by a content server (a content delivery schedule or content delivery plan) relating to, e.g., the total impressions and/or minimum impressions per time period.
- Process 700 includes determining a first average number of impressions per unit of time needed to deliver a total number of impressions required by the first quota (for a first campaign and/or first article of content) ( 706 ).
- the total number of impressions may be set by the content provider, and the average number of impressions per unit of time may be calculated by analyzer 214 ( FIG. 2 ). For example, if a content provider has requested five hundred impressions over the course of five days, an average-per-unit-time delivery may be one hundred impressions per day.
- a second average number of impressions to deliver per unit time (for a second campaign and/or a second article of content) may also be determined ( 708 ).
- Process 700 initially assumes that delivery using the first average and second average for a specified period of time will result in satisfaction of the impressions goals for the first and second campaigns or articles of content.
- Process 700 includes determining whether there are overlapping constraints associated with the first article of content and second article of content ( 710 ). This may occur, for example, if the first article should be published May 10, 2012 through May 20, 2012, and the second article should be published May 18, 2012 through May 22, 2012.
- the period of May 18, 2012 through May 20, 2012 is an overlapping constraint. While this overlap relates to the time/date when the content is delivered, the overlapping constraints may be one or more other constraint types (e.g., geography, content type, etc.).
- Process 700 includes determining, notwithstanding this overlapping constraint, whether the content server 106 ( FIG. 1 ) can publish the required number of impressions for both the first and second articles by publishing the content at the average rate per unit of time ( 712 ).
- Content server 106 may be able to deliver the required number of impressions for both articles under certain conditions. For example, if enough viewers are viewing the publisher's publication (e.g., the traffic is high enough), the publisher may be able to deliver the requested number of impressions notwithstanding the time overlap. Similarly, if the content server 106 can publish both articles of the content at the same time, the overlapping time might not affect the publisher's ability to deliver the required number of impressions.
- a website publisher may have space on its website for a 300 pixel ⁇ 250 pixel banner and a 160 pixel ⁇ 600 pixel static graphic banner. If the first campaign includes a 300 pixel ⁇ 350 pixel banner and the second campaign includes a 160 pixel ⁇ 600 pixel banner, then both content items may be published simultaneously. Thus, content may be delivered at the average number of impressions per unit time ( 714 ). If analyzer 214 ( FIG. 2 ) predicts the content server 106 will not be able deliver the required number of impressions for both campaigns, analyzer 214 may generate schedule data to deliver more than the average number of impressions per unit time ( 716 ).
- the non-overlapping constraint region describes the constraint domain (i.e., cross section of constraint parameter values) for a particular campaign that is not shared with another campaign.
- the constraint domain i.e., cross section of constraint parameter values
- Process 800 may be carried out by, e.g., scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 800 may be a more detailed flow diagram of steps 504 - 508 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 800 may describe circumstances in which two campaigns are compared.
- a similar process may be carried by scheduling server 110 in comparing tens, hundreds, and thousands of campaigns.
- a first campaign and a second campaign may each be associated with constraint domains (e.g., restriction on content delivery relating to time, geography, etc.).
- Process 800 includes determining if the constraint domains of the first and second campaign overlap ( 802 ).
- analyzer 214 may be configured to schedule average-per-unit-of-time delivery of the first and second campaign ( 804 ). If there is an overlap, then analyzer 214 may determine if the publisher can accommodate publication of both campaigns ( 806 ). This may arise in the circumstances described in the discussion of step 708 of process 700 ( FIG. 7 ). If so, then average-per-unit-of-time delivery of the first and second campaigns may be scheduled ( 804 ). If not, analyzer 214 may determine which content to publish in the overlapping domain ( 808 ). Analyzer 214 may utilize one or more mathematical processes to determine which content to publish in the overlapping and non-overlapping domains. In the implementation of FIG.
- analyzer 214 generates schedule data 810 that includes publishing the first campaign in the overlapping domain 814 , publishing a portion of the required impressions for the second campaign in the non-overlapping domain 812 , and publishing the remainder of the required impressions for the second campaign in non-overlapping domain 816 .
- schedule data 810 that includes publishing the first campaign in the overlapping domain 814 , publishing a portion of the required impressions for the second campaign in the non-overlapping domain 812 , and publishing the remainder of the required impressions for the second campaign in non-overlapping domain 816 .
- schedule data 810 that includes publishing the first campaign in the overlapping domain 814 , publishing a portion of the required impressions for the second campaign in the non-overlapping domain 812 , and publishing the remainder of the required impressions for the second campaign in non-overlapping domain 816 .
- a second campaign may be requested to be delivered to devices in Canada on December 2.
- a first campaign may be requested to be delivered to devices in North America between December 1 and December 3.
- the overlapping constraint domain includes December 2
- Analyzer 214 may schedule delivery of the second campaign for, e.g., United States, Mexico, and other countries in North America (other than Canada) for December 1 (non-overlapping domain 812 ) and December 3 (non-overlapping domain 816 ). In other implementations, analyzer 214 may generate different schedule 810 . The content delivery schedule generated by analyzer 214 may be transmitted to content server 106 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Process 900 may be carried out by, e.g., scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 900 may be a more detailed flow diagram of steps 504 - 508 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 900 may describe circumstances in which two campaigns are compared.
- a similar process may be carried out by scheduling server 110 in comparing tens, hundreds, and thousands of campaigns.
- a first campaign and a second campaign may each be associated with constraint domains (e.g., restriction on content delivery relating to time, geography, etc.).
- the first campaign and second campaign may also be associated with one or more priority parameters.
- the priority parameters may include, for example, relationship value 332 ( FIG. 3 ) and/or revenue value 336 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the priority parameters may be assigned by, e.g., a content publisher or may be calculated by, e.g., a content organizer Process 900 may be used when, e.g., analyzer 214 has determined that it is infeasible to satisfy the impressions goals of both the first campaign and the second campaign.
- Process 900 includes determining if the constraint domains of the first and second campaign overlap ( 902 ). If not, then analyzer 214 ( FIG. 2 ) may be configured to schedule average-per-unit-of-time delivery of the first and second campaigns ( 904 ). If there is an overlapping constraint region, then process 900 may determine which campaign has higher priority ( 906 ). Analyzer 214 may compare the priority parameters associated with the first and second campaign. Analyzer 214 may determine which parameter value is higher or lower. Analyzer 214 may receive instructions associated with the priority parameters to determine whether a higher or lower priority parameter is indicative of higher priority. In the implementation of FIG. 9 , the first campaign has a higher priority ( 920 ).
- analyzer 214 may generate schedule data 910 that places the higher priority campaign in the overlapping domain ( 908 ). By placing the first campaign in the overlapping domain 914 , analyzer 214 may have assured that at least the impressions goal for the first campaign is met. The second campaign is placed in non-overlapping domains 912 , 916 . Because it was determined to have a lower priority parameter, the second campaign's impressions goal may not be satisfied.
- Process 1000 may be carried out by, e.g., scheduling server 110 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 1000 may be a more detailed flow diagram of steps 504 - 508 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 1000 may describe circumstances in which two campaigns are compared.
- a similar process may be carried by scheduling server 110 in comparing tens, hundreds, and thousands of campaigns.
- a first campaign and a second campaign may each be associated with constraint domains (e.g., restriction on content delivery relating to time, geography, etc.).
- the first campaign and second campaign may also be associated with one or more priority parameters (e.g., relationship value 332 and/or revenue value 336 of FIG. 3 ).
- Process 1000 may utilize predictions regarding content selection rates (e.g., click through rates) from demand forecaster 210 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Process 1000 includes determining if the constraint domains of the first and second campaign overlap ( 1002 ). If not, then analyzer 214 ( FIG. 2 ) may be configured to schedule average-per-unit-of-time delivery of the first and second campaigns ( 1004 ). If there is an overlapping domain, process 1000 includes identifying a portion of the overlapping domain that has a higher click through rate than a second portion. For example, demand forecaster 210 may determine that content served between 5 PM and 8 PM has a higher click through rate than content served during other times. Process 1000 includes determining which campaign has higher priority ( 1008 ). Step 1008 may be substantially similar to steps 906 and 918 of process 900 ( FIG. 9 ). In the implementation of FIG.
- Process 1000 includes placing the higher priority content in the first portion of the overlapping domain (i.e., the portion determined to have a higher click through rate) ( 1012 ).
- Schedule data 1014 may include serving the higher priority content in the first portion of the overlapping domain 1020 so that the first campaign (which has a higher priority) has a higher likelihood of satisfying its impressions goals.
- the second campaign is scheduled in the second portion of the overlapping domain 1022 (which has a lower click through rate that the first portion 1020 ).
- Schedule data 1014 is also shown to include that analyzer 214 has scheduled the second campaign to be delivered in non-overlapping domain 1016 and the first campaign to be delivered in the non-overlapping domain 1018 .
