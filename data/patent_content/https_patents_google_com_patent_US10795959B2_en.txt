- the present disclosure is generally directed to reducing latency in converting portions of a message to a hyperlink for content items.
- a messaging application or chat application executing on a computing device can receive, via a user interface, a message.
- This message can include, for example, text, symbols, words, terms, phrases, characters, or strings.
- the messaging application can send the message to a second computing device via a network.
- the messaging application can send the message to a second computing device via a messaging system or messaging server.
- Thousands of messages per second may be directed from one computing device to another computing device via the messaging system.
- selecting and serving content items such as ads is computationally resource intensive from a data processing system perspective because the selection process includes a number of complicated and expensive steps. Thus, the selection process introduces latency in the content selection and serving flow which negatively impacts sending messages from one client computing device to another client computing device.
- the present disclosure is generally directed to reducing latency in converting portions of a message to a hyperlink for content items.
- the systems and methods of the present solution can provide a data processing system configured to facilitate reducing latency in converting terms of an outbound message to a hyperlink to a content item.
- the systems and methods of the present solution can facilitate maintaining end-to-end encryption of the outbound message.
- the data processing system can receive portions of the message from a first computing device as the message is typed or otherwise input into the first computing device.
- a messaging application, chat application, or other component configured on and executed by the first computing device can stream the message to the data processing system as the message is provided to the first computing device.
- the data processing system can perform a content selection process using the portions of the message streamed to the data processing system.
- the data processing system can select a content item and identify a term of the message to convert to a hyperlink as the message is being input to the first computing device.
- the data processing system can provide instructions to the computing device to convert a term to a hyperlink to a selected content item.
- the data processing system can hold the instructions and provide the instructions upon receiving an indication that the message is complete and ready to be delivered to a second computing device.
- the data processing system can provide the instructions asynchronously down to the client device as decisions are made, such as as soon as “Let's get pizza” is typed, the data processing system can send an instruction to replace “pizza” with a hyperlink.
- the instruction may later be superseded by a follow up instruction if the message changes.
- the data processing system can reduce latency in sending a message from a first computing device to a second computing device by selecting content items to link to terms in the message prior to the message being complete for delivery.
- a first instance of a chat application executing on a first computing device can communicate with a second instance of the chat application executing on a second computing device.
- the first and second instances of the chat applications can communicate with one another in real-time via a network or a server intermediary to the first and second devices.
- the first device can receive, via a user interface, an indication of main content (e.g., words or phrases of a text message) to send to the second device.
- main content e.g., words or phrases of a text message
- a data processing system of the present disclosure can translate text or other main content input into a first instance of the chat application executing on the first computing device.
- the data processing system can receive the main content and initiate a keyword auction using the main content to select supplemental content provided by content providers.
- the data processing system can convert, append, embed or otherwise combine a hyperlink for the selected supplemental content with the main content.
- the data processing system can add hyperlinks to specific words in a chat message or text message based on a content provider's keyword bidding.
- the hyperlinks can lead to supplemental content such as online advertiser content.
- the data processing system can transform portions of user-entered text into hyperlinks using a bid-based auction. Content providers can enter bids on the keywords that they would like transformed into hyperlinks to their supplemental content.
- the data processing system can provide a content selection interface.
- the data processing system can receive, from content providers via the content selection interface, content selection criteria (e.g., keywords, bids, budgets, geography, device characteristics, or network characteristics) used to select a supplemental content item of the content provider.
- content selection criteria e.g., keywords, bids, budgets, geography, device characteristics, or network characteristics
- the data processing system can use the entered content selection criteria to populate a repository of eligible supplemental content items.
- the data processing system can receive, from a first computing device, a message entered by a user into the first computing device.
- a chat application can execute on the first computing device.
- the chat application can include a module that parses or processes main content, text, messages or other data entered by a user into the chat application to send to a second computing device.
- the data input to the first computing device to send to a second computing device can be referred to as an outbound message.
- the chat application, or module thereof can parse the outbound messages and separate the message into keywords or n-grams (e.g., sets of multiple keywords).
- the chat application can facilitate streaming keywords to the data processing system as the keywords are entered or input to the first computing device. Streaming the keywords to the data processing system as they are entered into the chat application can facilitate selecting possible content item hyperlinks without affecting the latency of displaying messages at the second computing device.
- the request for content can be generated or occur while a message is typed into the first computing device.
- the request for content can be provided with each word or set of words sent to the data processing system as the words are input to the first computing device.
- the supplemental content item can be requested and provided with the outbound message on the sender's side (e.g., first computing device).
- the message delivered to the second computing device can already contain a hyperlink to the selected supplemental content.
- the chat application can filter the text such that certain terms or words are not provided to the data processing system or otherwise used for content selection. For example, the chat application can apply a filter such that only non-sensitive words and series of words are eligible to be sent to the data processing system and used for content selection. Filtering the text can maintain privacy by keeping subject matter confidential.
- the chat application can filter the text by using a dictionary. For example, the chat application can cross-reference a dictionary so as to only include dictionary words, rather than any proper nouns, to select content.
- the chat application can blacklist certain dictionary words that could be considered sensitive.
- the chat application can use (e.g., instead of or in addition to the blacklist) a whitelist of only approved words, or only of words currently being bid on by content providers, to maintain control over message privacy.
- the data processing system can select supplemental content items using an online content selection auction process.
- the data processing system can take into account the content providers' per-click bid times to determine the predicted likelihood that the user will click on the content item. Thresholds may also be applied such that the data processing system can hyperlink only very high quality content. For example, the data processing system may only provide a hyperlink to content items having a predicted click-through rate above a certain threshold. The data processing system may only convert terms in a text message to a hyperlink if the hyperlinked content item has a click through rate above a threshold. The data processing system can use a long-click rate (e.g., the portion of clicks that linger outside the chat app, indicating that the click was intentional and useful) to predict and act as a threshold.
- a long-click rate e.g., the portion of clicks that linger outside the chat app, indicating that the click was intentional and useful
- the data processing system can receive the request for supplemental content while a user is typing a message into the first computing device.
- the chat application executing on the first computing device can send each word and set of words sent to the data processing system as the message is being typed or input into the first computing device.
- the supplemental content item can be requested and attached to the message on the sender's side (first computing device).
- the delivered message therefore already contains a hyperlink to the content.
- the data processing system can measure or monitor the performance of the supplemental content corresponding to the hyperlink in the message.
- the data processing system can measure the performance either asynchronously within the chat application or with a redirect.
- the data processing system can indicate to the content provider when links are selected or on a per impression basis.
- the data processing system can skip the real-time content selection steps after the message is completed, and the chat application executing on the computing device can send the completed, outbound message to the second computing device without having to forward the message to the data processing system to perform content selection.
- the process of delivering a message that includes a term or keyword converted to a hyperlink to a selected content item can operate faster and the message with the linked content item can be delivered to the destination computing device sooner with reduced delay or latency.
- the message can be encrypted end-to-end from the sender computing device to the destination device, thereby maintaining a stronger encryption protocol and data security.

- the second content selection process may be among a subset of content items (e.g., top ranking 100 content items based on the first keyword) as compared to the first content selection process, which may reduce the usage of memory and computation resources, and reduce latency.
- the first content selection process can identify a first plurality of candidate content items from among a plurality of content items associated with the data processing system 120 , and the second content selection process can select a content item from the first plurality of candidate content items. If the data processing system receives additional portions of the message, the data processing system can continue to use the additional keywords to perform content selection processes among smaller sets (e.g., top 100 content items from on a first selection process based on a first portion of the message, top 50 content items from a second selection process based on a second portion of the message, top 25 content items from a third selection process based on a third portion of the message) of candidate content items. As the number of candidate content items input into the content selection process becomes smaller, the content selection process may become faster and more efficient.

- the data processing system can determine to augment the electronic message with two content items.
- the messaging application can determine to remove one of the links (e.g., a user can input preferences corresponding to a number of links to provide per electronic message, per a number of messages, or during a time interval).
- the data processing system can retrieve placement information for the third content item. For example, the data processing system can retrieve from a content data repository, a placement criteria for the third content item. The placement criteria can indicate a portion of the message in which to place the second hyperlink for the third content item. The placement can correspond to the same placement as a previously selected content item. The data processing system can determine not to replace the previously selected content item. For example, the data processing system can determine that the first term or keyword being converted to a link to the second content item is not to be replaced with a link to the third content item (e.g., higher ad score, more relevant ad, or higher bid price).
- the data processing system can determine not to provide instructions to convert a second term to the second hyperlink for the third content item based on the first term converted into the hyperlink being in the portion of the message corresponding to the placement criteria for the third content item.
