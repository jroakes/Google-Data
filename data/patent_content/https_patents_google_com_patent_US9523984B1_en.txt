Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.

- An autonomous vehicle operating on a road or path of travel may be configured to identify regions of the road or path in which the autonomous vehicle can pull over and stop. Further, the autonomous vehicle may be configured to periodically identify such regions as it travels so that in an emergency scenario the autonomous vehicle can quickly find a region in which to pull over.
- the autonomous vehicle may be looking for a safe space on or alongside the road to pull over.
- Some roads, such as those on bridges or those with obstructions in their shoulder lanes, may not be suitable or safe for pulling over the autonomous vehicle.
- the autonomous vehicle may ideally look for a continuous shoulder or region of a road that is free of obstacles and otherwise suitable for pulling over.
- the autonomous vehicle may monitor a road ahead in order to identify a region for pulling over the autonomous vehicle. For example, at a given moment, the autonomous vehicle may monitor a section of the road that it will be driving through over the next ten seconds or other period of time following the given moment.
- the autonomous vehicle may use a variety of methods to determine whether the section of the road (e.g., the identified region) is safe or otherwise suitable for pulling over the autonomous vehicle. If the autonomous vehicle determines that the section of the road is not safe or not otherwise suitable for pulling over the autonomous vehicle, the autonomous vehicle may continue driving along its normal path and monitor a different section of the road that is further ahead of the previous section.
- the autonomous vehicle may be configured to detect objects ahead of the autonomous vehicle on the road in the region, such as moving vehicles, parked vehicles, traffic cones, and other objects, both static and dynamic.
- the autonomous vehicle may also be configured to detect types of lane and road boundaries (e.g., road surface markings, curbs, physical barriers) in the region. Further, the autonomous vehicle may determine if such objects would prevent the autonomous vehicle from pulling over in the region, or if the autonomous vehicle can adjust its trajectory in order to pull over while avoiding such objects.
- the autonomous vehicle may also utilize map data associated with the road, and the map data may include information about the objects, the lane boundaries, and the road boundaries, among other information.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine a braking profile to employ in order to bring the autonomous vehicle's speed down to zero within the region.
- the braking profile may include multiple phases, and during each phase the autonomous vehicle may reduce its speed at a respective rate while travelling within the region.
- the autonomous vehicle may likely have to move laterally toward a point within the region that the autonomous vehicle will come to a stop.
- the braking profile may include lower rates of deceleration for phases during which the autonomous vehicle is undergoing the majority (or substantially all) of the lateral movement required to pull over the autonomous vehicle.
- the braking profile may take other forms as well.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine an adjusted trajectory based on the braking profile.
- the adjusted trajectory may include a route or path for the autonomous vehicle to travel within the identified region in order to pull over.
- the adjusted trajectory may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle can navigate to avoid static and/or dynamic objects within the identified region and, in some examples, avoid static and/or dynamic objects before the autonomous vehicle reaches the identified region.
- the autonomous vehicle may store in memory instructions for pulling over in accordance with the identified region, the braking profile, and the adjusted trajectory.
- the autonomous vehicle may be configured to periodically or continuously identify safe regions for pullover, determine corresponding braking profiles and adjusted trajectories, and store respective instructions for pulling over in each identified safe region. If the autonomous vehicle does not execute the instructions to pull over, it may continue driving along its current trajectory. When the autonomous vehicle executes the instructions to pull over, it may switch from its current trajectory to the adjusted trajectory.
- the execution of the instructions may be automated, such as in an event in which the autonomous vehicle detects an emergency scenario (e.g., sensor failure, empty gas tank, etc.) and responsively pulls itself over.
- an emergency scenario e.g., sensor failure, empty gas tank, etc.
- a driver or remote operator of the autonomous vehicle can manually provide a command to execute the instructions to pull over the autonomous vehicle. In still other events, the driver can disengage automated driving and manually pull the autonomous vehicle over as well.
- An example vehicle control system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- a vehicle control system may be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys. Other vehicles are possible as well.
- an example system may take the form of a non-transitory computer-readable medium, which has program instructions stored thereon that are executable by at least one processor to provide the functionality described herein.
- An example system may also take the form of an automobile or a subsystem of an automobile that includes such a non-transitory computer-readable medium having such program instructions stored thereon.

- the method 300 shown in FIG. 3 will be described as implemented by an example computing device, such as the computing device 111 in FIG. 1 .
- the method 300 can also be described as implemented by an autonomous vehicle, as the computing device may be onboard the vehicle or may be off-board but in wireless communication with the vehicle. Therefore the terms “computing device” and “autonomous vehicle” can be interchangeable herein.
- the computing device may be configured to control the vehicle in an autonomous or semi-autonomous operation mode. It should be understood that other entities or combinations of entities can implement one or more steps of the example method 300 .
- the method 300 includes identifying a region of a road ahead of an autonomous vehicle in which to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle based on lane boundaries of the road, one or more road boundaries indicating an edge of the road, and a size of the autonomous vehicle.
- the computing device may be configured to periodically identify regions of interest (e.g., every 100 milliseconds).
- the regions of interest may include multiple regions ahead of the autonomous vehicle and to the left and/or right of the autonomous vehicle.
- the computing device may gather a list of regions and then analyze the regions to determine a region that is most safe or otherwise preferable for pulling over the autonomous vehicle.
- the computing device may pull over the autonomous vehicle in the closest safe region rather than a farther region, depending on the urgency of the pullover.
- Other examples are also possible, and a variety of factors may determine which region out of multiple safe regions to pull over in, aside from the urgency of the pullover.
- a given region may be identified based on its distance from the autonomous vehicle and/or based on how soon the autonomous vehicle will enter the given region as the autonomous vehicle continues along its current trajectory. For example, at a given point in time and at a given location on the road, a region of interest may be a section of the road that the autonomous vehicle will be driving over during the next ten seconds following the given point in time. Other examples are also possible.
- the computing device identifying the region may comprise the computing device referring to a predetermined map stored in memory either locally at the computing device or remotely at another computing device (and/or the computing device dynamically building a map of the road ahead of the autonomous vehicle).
- the roads, paths, and other drivable areas of the dynamic map and/or the predetermined map may include labels for identified lanes, lane boundaries, road boundaries, and connections between lanes (e.g., which lanes can feed into other adjacent lanes).
- Such labels may include information indicating types of lanes of the road (e.g., traffic lane, passing lane, emergency lane, turning lane, bus lane, etc.), types of lane boundaries (e.g., white lines, yellow lines, other road surface markings and/or mechanical markings, etc.), types of road boundaries (e.g., regular curbs, red curbs, sidewalks, guard rails, other barriers, etc.) road intersections, one or more obstacles ahead of the autonomous vehicle, and other information about the road or areas adjacent to the road.
- types of lanes of the road e.g., traffic lane, passing lane, emergency lane, turning lane, bus lane, etc.
- types of lane boundaries e.g., white lines, yellow lines, other road surface markings and/or mechanical markings, etc.
- types of road boundaries e.g., regular curbs, red curbs, sidewalks, guard rails, other barriers, etc.
- the respective identified regions ahead of the autonomous vehicle may have an associated priority and/or quality score.
- a quality and/or priority determined by the computing device may indicate to the computing device that a suitable region for pullover that is farther ahead of the autonomous vehicle is more suitable for pullover than another suitable region that is closer to the autonomous vehicle.
- the pullover region that is farther away may have more pullover space than the closer region, and there may not be an immediate need to pullover (e.g., no emergency scenario).
- the computing device may pull over the autonomous vehicle in the suitable closer region with the lower quality score and/or priority if an emergency scenario is detected. Other examples are also possible.
- the computing device may be configured to filter out and disregard information from the map data. In such scenarios, the computing device may not consider certain regions as safe for pulling over the autonomous vehicle. For example, regions where a lane's boundary is marked as red or blue, or the lane is labeled as a “no parking” lane, may be ignored by the computing device. Other examples are also possible. However, it should be understood that in certain emergency scenarios, the computing device may be configured to pull over the autonomous vehicle in ignored regions if a pullover is necessary or required.
- the computing device may be configured to pull over the autonomous vehicle in regions that have been identified, but deemed unsafe or unsatisfactory for pullover by the computing device, such as regions that may have space for the autonomous vehicle to pullover and park, but are labeled as “no parking zones.”
- the computing device identifying the region may comprise the computing device utilizing the predetermined map data. Namely, the computing device may take identified regions of interest from the predetermined map and divide the regions into smaller “chunks” of similar or varying length, while the width of the chunks may be the same as the width of the road (e.g., from a leftmost road boundary to a rightmost road boundary) or may be a longer width. For example, each region may be divided into chunks of 50 centimeters in length. As another example, each region may be divided into chunks of 1 meter in length. In other examples, each region may be small enough in size where they do not need to be divided into chunks. Other examples are also possible.
- the computing device may then apply one or more methods/algorithms to each chunk to determine if the given chunk and/or the respective region that the given chunk is in are safe or otherwise ideal for pullover.
- One example method/algorithm may include the computing device first identifying the rightmost lane (L_r). The computing device may then obtain, from the predetermined map data, a set of road and lane boundaries (and possibly other boundaries), and identify the boundaries to the right of L_r. The computing device may then search through the boundaries in order to identify the rightmost boundary (B_l) which can be considered the edge of L_r. For example, if there is a bike lane to the right of L_r, the computing device may be configured to identify the left edge of the bike lane as B_l.
- the computing device may also search through the boundaries in order to identify the rightmost boundary which can be considered the edge of the road (B_e). After identifying B_l and B_e, the computing device may then determine the lateral distance from the center of L_r to B_l (D_l), and the lateral distance from the center of L_r to B_e (D_e). Further, if D_l plus the width of the autonomous vehicle (w) plus a threshold distance (T_p) is less than D_e, the computing device may determine that the given chunk is safe or otherwise suitable to pull over the autonomous vehicle at that given chunk of the respective region. In other words, this result indicates that the edge of the road is further from the rightmost lane than the width of the car plus a buffer distance (T_p). Alternatively, if D_l plus w plus T_p is greater than D_e, the computing device may determine that the given chunk is not safe or otherwise not suitable to pull over the autonomous vehicle at that given chunk of the respective region.
- the threshold distance, T_p may be a constant value used in many or all pullover scenarios.
- T_p may vary per scenario based on one or more factors including the predetermined map data, types of boundaries on the road, and other factors, some being associated with autonomous vehicle's surrounding environment. For example, a width of the road may determine a value for T_p. When streets are narrow, T_p may be larger so that when the autonomous vehicle pulls over and parks, it may not block passing traffic. In general, a positive value for T_p may require a wider region for pulling over the autonomous vehicle, which may also allow for less precise predetermined map data. As another example, a speed limit of the road may determine a value for T_p.
- T_p may have a negative value, which would allow the autonomous vehicle to pull over while leaving a portion of the vehicle in the road. Further on residential streets, for instance, the autonomous vehicle may be able to pull over safely while still leaving room for passing traffic.
- road surface markings may determine a value for T_p. When curbs are marked as loading zones, for instance, T_p may have a negative value (e.g., a negative value as much as the width of the autonomous vehicle, ⁇ w).
- T_p may have a value of zero for some roads, in which case the given chunk may be considered viable for pullover if, after pulling over the autonomous vehicle to the side of the road, no portion of the car would be left in the road.
- T_p may have a value of zero for some roads, in which case the given chunk may be considered viable for pullover if, after pulling over the autonomous vehicle to the side of the road, no portion of the car would be left in the road.
- T_p may have a value of zero for some roads, in which case the given chunk may be considered viable for pullover if, after pulling over the autonomous vehicle to the side of the road, no portion of the car would be left in the road.
- Many other factors are possible as well for determining a value of T_p.
- different known regions of a road indicated by predetermined map data may each have a respective predetermined T_p included in memory and associated with the predetermined map data. Additionally or alternatively, in other embodiments, the computing device may determine T_p for a particular region after identifying the particular region using live sensor data.
- the computing device may determine T_p by use of a decision tree or decision forest.
- T_p may have an initial value, and the computing device may run though a decision tree in order to add or subtract from the initial value.
- the initial value of T_p may be zero, and the computing device may first check a region of the road for its speed limit. If the speed limit exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 45 mph), a value may be added to T_p (e.g., +1.0 meters). If the speed limit is below a certain threshold (e.g., 15 mph), a value may be subtracted from T_p (e.g., ⁇ 0.5 meters).
- the computing device may determine if D_l is greater or less than one or more thresholds. Third, the computing device may then check if the region includes a loading zone or other special type of zone. The computing device may then determine other factors/values as well, and adjust T_p accordingly. It should be understood that other examples of decision trees/forests are possible as well and not limited to the aforementioned example.
- the computing device may also be configured to pull over the autonomous vehicle to the left of the road rather than the right.
- an algorithm may be utilized that is similar to the algorithm described above. For example, instead of searching for and identifying rightmost boundaries, the computing device may be configured to search for and identify leftmost boundaries. Additionally, the computing device may be configured to search for any road marking, physical barrier, etc. that separates the leftmost lane from oncoming traffic, instead of searching for and identifying an edge of the road. Other examples are also possible.
- the computing device may be configured to take chunks from one region that have been identified as safe chunks and combine them with safe chunks from another region. In other embodiments, instead of the computing device first identifying regions of interest and then dividing them into chunks, the computing device may be configured to identify smaller chunks (e.g., smaller regions) individually as it drives. In still other embodiments, chunks that include portions of a bridge or other road structure may not be considered viable for pullover if there is no place to park without blocking traffic.
- the computing device identifying the region may be based on an identification of one or more objects ahead of the autonomous vehicle on the road. Additionally or alternatively to identifying objects ahead of (or substantially in front of) the autonomous vehicle (e.g., in substantially the same lane as the autonomous vehicle or an adjacent lane), the computing device can be configured to identify other objects within an environment of the autonomous vehicle, including objects to the left and right of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., adjacent lanes on a road), and/or behind the autonomous vehicle, for example (e.g., such as another vehicle travelling behind the autonomous vehicle that may be ready to pass the autonomous vehicle and perhaps enter the identified region(s)).
- the computing device can be configured to identify other objects within an environment of the autonomous vehicle, including objects to the left and right of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., adjacent lanes on a road), and/or behind the autonomous vehicle, for example (e.g., such as another vehicle travelling behind the autonomous vehicle that may be ready to pass the autonomous vehicle and perhaps enter the identified region(s)).
- the computing device may also be configured to identify objects near and/or adjacent to the road as well, such as buildings, fire hydrants, or other objects at or beyond the road boundaries.
- the objects may be within a longitudinal distance threshold from the autonomous vehicle and/or within a lateral distance threshold from the autonomous vehicle.
- the one or more objects may include pedestrians, traffic control objects (e.g., stop signs, traffic cones, traffic lights), construction equipment, buildings, vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles), and other objects.
- traffic control objects e.g., stop signs, traffic cones, traffic lights
- construction equipment e.g., buildings
- vehicles e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles
- the computing device may be configured to determine respective characteristics of each object. For example, the computing device may be configured to determine a type of an object or classify the object (e.g., car or truck, car or motorcycle, traffic sign or a pedestrian, etc.). Further, the computing device can determine whether the object is moving or stationary (e.g., a parked car).
- the computing device may be configured to estimate a size (e.g., width and length) and weight of the object. Further, the computing device may be configured to determine a direction of motion of the object, such as if the object is moving towards the autonomous vehicle or away from the vehicle. Still further, the computing device may be configured to determine a transmission type (e.g., manual and automatic) and transmission mode of the object, such as whether the object is in park, drive, reverse, or neutral transmission mode. Yet still further, the computing device may be configured to determine a position of the object in a respective lane on the road or path of travel, and how close the object may be to lane boundaries. In some examples, the computing device may be configured to determine relative longitudinal speed and lateral speed of the object with respect to the autonomous vehicle. These characteristics are examples, and other characteristics can be determined as well.
- the computing device may be configured to use the sensors and devices coupled to the autonomous vehicle, which may include sensors and modules used in the navigation and pathing system 148 in FIG. 1 , as described above.
- Object data and other environmental data obtained from the autonomous vehicle's sensors may include information associated with live lane and road boundaries. The live boundaries may be similar to those encoded in the predetermined map, but the object data from the sensor(s) may take into account any changes in the environment between the construction of the predetermined map and the present time.
- the computing device may be configured to run one or more algorithms over the given region in order to determine whether they are safe for pullover.
- the one or more algorithms may be the same as the methods/algorithms described above with respect to the chunks of the given region.
- the one or more algorithms may be a modified version of the methods/algorithms described above, and information regarding the given region as obtained by the sensor data may take precedence over information regarding the given region from the predetermined map data. For example, more conservative boundaries may be utilized with a modified algorithm (e.g., live sensor data may detect a road boundary to be closer to the autonomous vehicle than the predetermined map indicated the road boundary to be).
- certain identified objects in the given region may effectively act as additional road edge boundaries. For example, if an object to the right of the autonomous vehicle is closer to the center of the autonomous vehicle's lane than a rightmost road boundary, the left edge of the object may serve as the rightmost road boundary instead the rightmost edge of the road. Other examples are also possible.
- Sensor data may include data obtained, for example, from a camera, such as the camera 134 in FIG. 1 or the camera 210 in FIG. 2 or any other image-capture device, may be coupled to the autonomous vehicle and may be in communication with the computing device.
- the camera may be configured to capture images or a video of the path/road of travel and vicinity of the path/road of travel.

- LIDAR-based information may include a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud.
- the 3D point cloud may include points corresponding to light emitted from the LIDAR device and reflected from objects on the road or in the vicinity of the road.
- operation of the LIDAR device may involve an optical remote sensing technology that enables measuring properties of scattered light to find range and/or other information of a distant target.
- the LIDAR device may be configured to emit laser pulses as a beam, and scan the beam to generate two dimensional or three dimensional range matrices.
- the range matrices may be used to determine distance to an object or surface by measuring time delay between transmission of a pulse and detection of a respective reflected signal.
- the LIDAR device may be configured to scan an environment surrounding the autonomous vehicle in three dimensions. In some examples, more than one LIDAR device may be coupled to the vehicle to scan a complete 360° horizon of the vehicle.
- the LIDAR device may be configured to provide to the computing device a cloud of point data representing obstacles or objects, which have been hit by the laser, on the road and the vicinity of the road.
- the points may be represented by the LIDAR device in terms of azimuth and elevation angles, in addition to range, which can be converted to (X, Y, Z) point data relative to a local coordinate frame attached to the autonomous vehicle.
- the LIDAR device may be configured to provide to the computing device intensity values of the light or laser reflected off the obstacles that may be indicative of a surface type of a given object. Based on such information, the computing device may be configured to identify the objects and characteristics of the objects such as type of the object, size, speed, whether the object is a traffic sign with a retroreflective surface, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to receive, from a RADAR device (e.g., the RADAR unit 130 in FIG. 1 ) coupled to the autonomous vehicle and in communication with the computing device, RADAR-based information relating to location and characteristics of the objects.
- the RADAR device may be configured to emit radio waves and receive back the emitted radio waves that bounced off the surface of objects on the road and in the vicinity of the road.
- the received signals or RADAR-based information may be indicative, for example, of dimensional characteristics of a given object, and may indicate whether the given object is stationary or moving.
- the computing device may be configured to detect and identify the objects and characteristics of the objects based on information received from multiple sources such as the image-capture device, the LIDAR device, the RADAR device, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from a subset of the multiple sources. For example, images captured by the image-capture device may be blurred due to a malfunction of the image-capture device, and in another example, details of the road may be obscured in the images because of fog.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR units and may be configured to disregard the information received from the image-capture device.
- the autonomous vehicle may be travelling in a portion of the road where some electric noise or jamming signals may cause the LIDAR device and/or RADAR device to operate incorrectly.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from the image-capture device, and may be configured to disregard the information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR units.
- the computing device may be configured to rank these sources of information based on a condition of the road (e.g., fog, electronic jamming, etc.). The ranking may be indicative of which device(s) to rely on or give more weight to in identifying the objects.
- the LIDAR and RADAR devices may be ranked higher than the image-based device, and information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR devices may be given more weight than respective information received from the image-capture device.

- the computing device may build a list of those regions and store them in memory.
- the identification of regions and determining left versus right edges/boundaries may be based on a country that the autonomous vehicle is in, such as whether the country the autonomous vehicle is in is a country in which driving on the right side of the road is the norm or whether driving on the left side of the road is the norm. In either case, the computing device can be configured accordingly.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an example scenario for identifying a region in which to pull over and stop an autonomous vehicle 400 .

- the computing device may first analyze region 402 , although the computing device may be configured to analyze other regions prior to or after analyzing region 402 . Due to the presence of another vehicle 412 currently parked in the curb lane 408 D of region 402 alongside the curb 414 of the road and taking up significant space of region 402 , the computing device may determine that region 402 is not suitable for pullover for at least the reason of the other vehicle 412 . The computing device may then analyze region 404 .
- the computing device may identify a red curb 416 (e.g., a “no parking zone”) as the rightmost boundary of the region 404 , and may thus determine that region 404 is not suitable for pullover for at least the reason of the red curb 416 .
- the computing device may also identify an object 418 in region 404 to the left of the autonomous vehicle 400 and in lane 408 A.
- the object 418 may be a static object such as a traffic cone or a wrecked vehicle, or the object 418 may be a dynamic object such as a moving vehicle or other moving object (e.g., travelling in the +y direction).
- the computing device may monitor the behavior of the object 418 to determine if the autonomous vehicle 400 may need to avoid the object 418 while in the process of pulling over or while continuing to follow a normal trajectory on the road.
- the computing device may then analyze region 406 . Moreover, the computing device may analyze region 406 using the method/algorithm described above. As such, the computing device may first identify the rightmost lane (L_r), 408 B. The computing device may then obtain, from the predetermined map data, a set of road and lane boundaries (and possibly other boundaries), and identify the boundaries to the right of L_r, including the rightmost boundary (B_l) (e.g., the edge of L_r) as the left edge of the bicycle lane 408 C. The computing device may also identify the rightmost boundary which can be considered the edge of the road (B_e) (e.g., the edge where the curb lane 408 D meets the curb 414 ).
- B_e the edge of the road
- the computing device may then determine the lateral distance from the center of L_r to B_l (D_l), and the lateral distance from the center of L_r to B_e (D_e).
- D_l the lateral distance from the center of L_r to B_e
- T_p small-valued threshold distance
- the computing device may determine that the given chunk is suitable for pulling over the autonomous vehicle 400 in region 406 . Since region 406 is suitable for pullover, the computing device may then enable the autonomous vehicle 400 to park at location 420 in region 406 .
- T_p may vary based on one or more factors, and in other similar scenarios may be of such a value where region 406 may not be suitable for pullover. It should be also understood that, although not described herein, the computing device may also perform the method/algorithm on regions 402 and 404 as well.
- FIG. 4B illustrates another example scenario for identifying a region in which to pull over and stop an autonomous vehicle 450 .
- the autonomous vehicle 450 e.g., a computing device of the autonomous vehicle
- the computing device of the autonomous vehicle 450 may identify a region 452 ahead of the autonomous vehicle 450 and determine whether or not the region 452 is safe or otherwise suitable for pulling over and stopping the autonomous vehicle 450 , in accordance with the methods and embodiments described above.
- the road may comprise two lanes between two curbs 454 .
- the computing device may analyze region 452 and determine that it is suitable for pulling over the autonomous vehicle 450 , since D_l plus w plus T_p is less than De(D_l is the same as D_e because B_l and B_e are the same boundary).
- Tp may be negative and may have a magnitude of at least w in order to allow for region 452 to be suitable for pullover.
- the computing device may then enable the autonomous vehicle 450 to pull over and park at location 456 .
- the road is a two-way road
- the computing device may identify two objects within the vicinity of the autonomous vehicle 450 : vehicle 458 travelling behind the autonomous vehicle 450 in the +y direction and vehicle 460 travelling in the ⁇ y direction in a different lane than the autonomous vehicle 450 .
- the computing device may determine that the road is such that the autonomous vehicle 450 may be able to park in region 452 at location 456 and still leave room for vehicle 458 to safely pass the parked autonomous vehicle 450 along trajectory 462 or a similar trajectory without hitting the autonomous vehicle 450 or taking up too much space of the lane that vehicle 460 is in.
- Other examples are possible as well.
- the method 300 includes, based on a speed of the autonomous vehicle and based on the region, determining a braking profile for reducing the speed of the autonomous vehicle while travelling within the region.
- the braking profile may be determined so as to account for safely controlling the autonomous vehicle while bringing the autonomous vehicle's speed down to zero. For example, pulling over the autonomous vehicle may involve sharp lateral movements, so the braking profile may include a specific lower rate or rates at which to decrease the autonomous vehicle's speed as it moves laterally to avoid control and stability issues that may result from a high rate of deceleration while moving sharply in a given direction. Other examples are also possible.
- the braking profile may be determined by the computing device so as to quickly navigate the autonomous vehicle off of the road or to a stopping location.
- the braking profile may be a function of the autonomous vehicle's current speed.
- the braking profile may also comprise a plurality of phases, each having a respective duration.
- the phases may include respective rates at which to reduce the speed of the autonomous vehicle while travelling within the region.
- the computing device may reduce the autonomous vehicle's speed at the respective rate.
- the braking profile may include a piecewise linear function associated with the phases.
- the piecewise linear function may include different line segments representative of the respective rates for each phase.
- the braking profile may include one or more of a linear function, a quadratic function, an exponential function, a spline function, and other functions (piecewise and/or non-piecewise).
- the computing device can also be programmable such that the respective duration of each phase can be predetermined or calibrated prior to the autonomous vehicle performing the example method 300 .
- the braking profile may comprise three (or more) phases including a pre-maneuver phase, a maneuver phase which follows the pre-maneuver phase, and a post-maneuver phase which follows the maneuver phase.
- the pre-maneuver phase may include a low rate of speed reduction (e.g., light braking), and in some examples, the autonomous vehicle may begin to move laterally towards its pullover destination during the pre-maneuver phase. The majority of the lateral movement may be performed during the maneuver phase, which may also include a low rate of speed reduction.
- the maneuver phase may also not require much longitudinal acceleration while the autonomous vehicle is undergoing the majority of the lateral displacement needed to pull over the autonomous vehicle.
- the post-maneuver phase may include a high rate of speed reduction (e.g., hard braking).
- a high rate of speed reduction e.g., hard braking
- the majority or entirety of the post-maneuver phase may be performed while the autonomous vehicle is travelling within that location off the main road.
- the lateral displacement of the autonomous vehicle in the maneuver phase may not be greater than the lateral displacement of the autonomous vehicle in the pre-maneuver and post-maneuver phases. In such examples, the total lateral displacement may be very small or there may be no lateral displacement at all.
- the braking profile may comprise less than three phases.
- the braking profile may be based on any objects and/or obstacles located within the region and/or outside of the region.
- the suitable region may be right before a bridge or barrier, so the braking profile may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle can come to a stop before reaching the bridge or barrier.
- each phase and respective rate may be based on at least a portion of unobstructed drivable space within the region.
- the braking profile may be based on detected vehicles within the environment of the autonomous vehicle. For example, such as shown in FIG. 4B , there may be another vehicle travelling behind the autonomous vehicle, and so the braking profile may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle will not brake hard during the pre-maneuver phase and surprise the other vehicle.
- the autonomous vehicle may adjust its speed based on the behavior of objects in the same or adjacent lanes on the road (e.g., ahead of or behind the autonomous vehicle), such as the example just described, and such as an adjustment made when a nearby vehicle or other dynamic object moves from its current lane to the lane in which the autonomous vehicle is travelling.
- Other examples are also possible.
- the method 300 includes, based on the braking profile, determining a trajectory such that the autonomous vehicle will travel within the region while reducing the speed of the autonomous vehicle.
- the determined trajectory may further be based on information obtained from the region and other identified regions, such as information described with respect to block 302 of the method 300 .
- the determined trajectory may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle will avoid any objects/obstacles within the region (and outside of the region, in some examples) while reducing the speed of the autonomous vehicle in accordance with the braking profile.
- the computing device may utilize a conjugate gradient method and/or other methods to optimize the determined trajectory.
- the trajectory may be determined so as to satisfy one or more constraints.
- the constraints may include minimizing the trajectory's deviation from a normal driving trajectory (e.g., if the autonomous vehicle was to continue driving instead of pulling over) while traveling the distance covered in the pre-maneuver phase of the braking profile.
- the constraints may also include only driving the autonomous vehicle on the existing road lane(s) or within the region so as to ensure that at no point in time during the pullover the autonomous vehicle travels beyond the road's far edge or other boundary.
- the constraints may further include the autonomous vehicle performing a minimal amount of steering during the post-maneuver phase as it comes to a complete stop within the region.
- the constraints may still further include ensuring that the autonomous vehicle slows down to avoid any moving vehicles in front of the autonomous vehicle while travelling along the trajectory. Other constraints are also possible.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example scenario for determining a braking profile and a trajectory such that an autonomous vehicle 500 will travel within the region while reducing the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 in accordance with the braking profile.
- the autonomous vehicle 500 e.g., a computing device of the autonomous vehicle
- the autonomous vehicle 500 may identify a region ahead in which to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the autonomous vehicle 500 is shown to be travelling at a current speed of 29 m/s, although other speeds are possible.
- the braking profile of the autonomous vehicle 500 may include a pre-maneuver phase 502 , a maneuver phase 504 , and a post-maneuver phase 506 .
- the computing device may be configured to decelerate the autonomous vehicle 500 at a low rate of 1 m/s 2 for a duration of two seconds, thus bringing the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 down to 27 m/s by the start of the maneuver phase 504 .
- the computing device may be configured to decelerate the autonomous vehicle 500 at a low rate of 1 m/s 2 for a duration of three seconds, thus bringing the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 down to 24 m/s by the start of the post-maneuver phase 506 .
- a low rate of deceleration may be needed during the maneuver phase 504 since the steering and lateral movement of the autonomous vehicle 500 may be largest during this phase.
- the computing device may be configured to decelerate the autonomous vehicle 500 at a higher rate of 4.8 m/s 2 for a duration of five seconds, thus bringing the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 down to 0 m/s and stopping the autonomous vehicle 500 on the shoulder of the road at location 508 , as shown.
- the computing device may determine a trajectory 510 for the autonomous vehicle 500 in accordance with the braking profile. However, in some cases, including cases in which no emergency is detected by computing device, the computing device may be configured to instruct the autonomous vehicle 500 to continue along its current trajectory 512 (e.g., default trajectory) rather than follow the trajectory 510 for pulling over in the region. As noted above, the trajectory 510 may include more steering and lateral movement of the autonomous vehicle 500 during the maneuver phase 504 . As shown, the trajectory 510 may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle 500 will avoid objects such as object 514 and object 516 . In addition, the braking profile may be determined to account for a presence of objects such as object 516 in the autonomous vehicle's 500 pullover region.
- the trajectory 510 may include more steering and lateral movement of the autonomous vehicle 500 during the maneuver phase 504 .
- the trajectory 510 may be determined such that the autonomous vehicle 500 will avoid objects such as object 514 and object 516 .
- the braking profile may be determined to account for a presence of objects such as object
- the braking profile may be determined such that the post-maneuver phase 506 includes hard braking (e.g., 4.8 m/s 2 for five seconds, as shown, or 8 m/s 2 for three seconds, for harder braking, etc.).
- hard braking e.g., 4.8 m/s 2 for five seconds, as shown, or 8 m/s 2 for three seconds, for harder braking, etc.
- the example scenario of FIG. 5 illustrates a braking profile that may be determined based on a high initial (e.g., current) speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- a high initial speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 e.g., current
- various aspects of the braking profile and the determined trajectory may change. For example, at low speeds, the duration of the pre-maneuver phase 502 may be reduced and the rate of deceleration during the post-maneuver phase 506 may be substantially reduced, which may cause the autonomous vehicle 500 to stop smoothly. Other examples are also possible.
- the method 300 includes determining, by the computing device (or other device configured to control the autonomous vehicle), instructions for pulling over and stopping the autonomous vehicle in the region in accordance with the determined trajectory. Further, at block 310 , the method 300 includes storing the instructions in a memory accessible by the computing device. As such, the computing device may be configured to receive information indicative of a request or requirement to access and execute the instructions so as to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle.
- the computing device may be configured to receive, from sensors and devices coupled to the autonomous vehicle (e.g., via one or more signals), information associated with, for example, condition of systems and subsystems of the autonomous vehicle, such as sensor systems and other systems and subsystems. For example, information indicating that the autonomous vehicle is about to run out of gas or information that an important sensor of the autonomous vehicle has failed may be taken into account by the computing device in determining whether to access and execute the instructions to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle. As another example, the computing device may encounter/detect a scenario (of the road ahead and/or of the autonomous vehicle's systems) that it does not know how to handle, and thus the computing device may then determine that the autonomous vehicle needs to be pulled over. Other examples are also possible. Further, the computing device may be configured to receive information from a remote operator indicative of a request to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle in accordance with the region, braking profile, trajectory, and instructions stored in the memory.
- the computing device may be configured to receive a manual command/instruction (e.g., via a button or switch located inside the autonomous vehicle) for the computing device to access and execute the instructions for pulling over the autonomous vehicle.
- the manual instruction may be received by a driver of the autonomous vehicle or other person(s), and upon execution of the
- the computing device may be configured to provide the driver of the autonomous vehicle a window of time during which the driver can take over manual control of the autonomous vehicle to either pull over the autonomous vehicle or continue driving, based on whether the driver deems it necessary to pull over the autonomous vehicle or not.
- the computing device may be configured to receive information associated with the surrounding environment of the autonomous vehicle, such as driving conditions and road conditions (e.g., rain, snow, etc.). For example, information indicating that the road is icy or wet ahead of the vehicle may be taken into account by the computing device in determining a region, braking profile, and/or trajectory to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle, and determining whether to access and execute the instructions to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle. Other examples are also possible.
- driving conditions and road conditions e.g., rain, snow, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to periodically determine the region, braking profile, trajectory, and instructions for pulling over and stopping the autonomous vehicle

- the default instructions may also be stored in memory accessible by the computing device.
- the computing device may be configured to execute the default instructions unless an emergency scenario is detected (e.g., a failure of one or more systems of the autonomous vehicle and/or of the computing device itself) and/or a manual override command is received, causing the computing device to access and execute the instructions to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle and divert from the current trajectory.
- an emergency scenario e.g., a failure of one or more systems of the autonomous vehicle and/or of the computing device itself
- a manual override command is received, causing the computing device to access and execute the instructions to pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle and divert from the current trajectory.
- the computing device may be configured to switch back to the current trajectory if the computing device determines that the emergency scenario is no longer present, if the computing device determined the emergency scenario in error, and/or if the driver mistakenly directed the computing device to execute the instructions, among other possibilities.
- the computing device may instruct the autonomous vehicle to switch back to the current trajectory automatically, or the driver may be enabled to either manually switch to the current trajectory or take control of the vehicle (e.g., speed and steering control).
- the decision made by the computing device e.g., one or more modules of the computing device
- the decision made by the computing device can be determined at the same module of the computing device that is configured to determine the pullover trajectory, or can be determined at a different module.
- a lower-level module e.g., a controller responsible for actuating the throttle/brakes and steering
- the lower-level module can be configured to make the decision of whether or not to execute the instructions to pull over the autonomous vehicle.
- the lower-level module may be configured to utilize heuristics relating to determining whether a high-level module responsible for determining the current trajectory has failed and if the high-level module has not determined/stored a new current trajectory in a particular amount of time (e.g., the high-level module has stopped continuously determining the current trajectory).
- the heuristics may also relate to determining how recently the pullover trajectory was generated and determining if the pullover trajectory is no longer suitable/valid for use (e.g., based on changing conditions of the road, or other factors). Other heuristics are also possible.
- Executing the instructions to either continue along the current trajectory or pull over and stop the autonomous vehicle may involve executing the instructions in accordance with one or more control strategies.
- the control system of the autonomous vehicle may comprise multiple control strategies that may be predetermined or adaptive to changes in a driving environment of the autonomous vehicle, the driving environment including the predicted actions of objects substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle, behind the autonomous vehicle, and/or to the side of the autonomous vehicle.
- a control strategy may comprise sets of instructions or rules associated with traffic interaction in various driving contexts.
- the control strategy may comprise rules that determine a speed of the autonomous vehicle, steering angle, and a lane that the autonomous vehicle may travel on while taking into account safety and traffic rules and concerns (e.g., other vehicles stopped at an intersection and windows-of-opportunity in yield situation, lane tracking, speed control, distance from other vehicles on the road, passing other vehicles, and queuing in stop-and-go traffic, and avoiding areas that may result in unsafe behavior such as oncoming-traffic lanes, etc.).
- the computing device may be configured to determine, based on the identified region, the braking profile, the determined trajectory, and the instructions of blocks 302 - 310 , respectively, a control strategy comprising rules for actions that control speed, steering angle, and lane of the autonomous vehicle.
