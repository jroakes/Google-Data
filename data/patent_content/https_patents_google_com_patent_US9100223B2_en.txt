Definitions
- This document relates to information processing.
- Content is distributed in computer systems or by other technologies in different situations. For example, advertisements can be used in an attempt to inform people about a wide variety of products, goods, and services. Generally, advertisers may seek to target the content of their advertising to the intended audience or viewers.
- Advertisements can take many forms, such as printed material, commercials on television and radio, billboards, and online advertising. These advertisements can be placed without detailed knowledge about the potential viewers with the intention of reaching potential customers who encounter the advertisement coincidentally. In some cases, advertisements are placed to target a particular demographic group (e.g., ads for toys in a children's' TV show or billboards for tires along a roadside) in order to increase the chances of reaching potential customers.
- a particular demographic group e.g., ads for toys in a children's' TV show or billboards for tires along a roadside

- Performing the analysis can include identifying at least a first time period characterized by the user being associated with the selection tendency regarding selecting the earlier content distributions, and a second time period characterized by the user not being associated with the selection tendency; and wherein selecting the format comprises determining whether the network activities during a most recent predetermined amount of time resemble those of the first time period more than the second time period.
- the determination can indicate that the user is associated with the selection tendency
- selecting the format can include: selecting multiple content portions to be included in the content distribution, wherein the multiple content portions are configured so that the user can select any of the multiple content portions. Selecting the format can include adding a highlight to a content portion to be included in the content distribution.
- the method can further include identifying, using the information collection, at least a first geographical region of multiple geographical regions from which content has been distributed to the user, the first geographical region identified as being associated with a higher frequency of selection by the user than others of the multiple geographical regions; selecting content from the first geographical region to be included in the content distribution.
- the content distribution can involve advertising, and the method can further include identifying an area of a user interface as being devoted to advertisement content and available to display the content distribution to the user; selecting non-advertisement content relating to a topic of the page; and placing the non-advertisement content in the area in the content distribution in lieu of the advertising content.
- the topic of the page can relate to a product and the non-advertisement content can relate to a review of the product.
- the advertisement content can be provided by an advertisement distributor and the non-advertisement content can be selected to be provided by a third party entity.
- the method can further include, in subsequent content distributions to the user, changing a content selection for the area from the non-advertisement content toward advertisement-related content.
- the method can further include monitoring at least one of the subsequent content distributions to determine whether a user tendency to select content in the area is changing.

- the collection of content 160 can be repository of advertisements (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio) and/or other information that can be stored as one or more items, objects, files and/or database records.
- One or more individual content portions in the content 160 can be associated with priority information, for example to indicate a user preference between text ads, image ads, one or more formats of video ads, and other ad formats.
- the collection of content 160 can be accessed by the content distribution system 150 to access content.
- the content distribution system 150 can retrieve one or more advertisements stored in the collection of content 160 , and provide those advertisements to the user systems 110 .
- the collection of content 160 can be flexibly located.
- the collection of content 160 is shown as part of the content distribution system 150 , but in other examples the collection of content 160 can be stored in part or whole by the content distribution system 150 , one or more of the content provider systems 120 , the content publisher systems 130 , and/or combinations of the systems 120 , 130 , 150 and/or other systems that can be used to store content.
- the collection of content 160 can be stored in part or whole by the user systems 110 .
- a video game disc's unused storage space can be used to store preloaded content, and during game play the video game can access the content distribution system 150 to determine what preloaded content to present to the user.
- the content distribution system 150 can includes a user signal component 170 .
- the user signal component 170 can generate and/or identify one or more user signals (e.g., information about the user's activities). For example, such a user signal can be used to infer information to describe the user's preferences and interests.
- the user's browsing habits can indicate that the user has a tendency to click on, or otherwise select, content such as advertisements that to some extent depends on a format aspect of the content. For example, such a user signal can be received and used to infer that the user has affinities for animated or otherwise highly active content, as opposed to, for example, text advertisements or still images.

- the collection of information 180 can include information that one or more users have provided explicitly. For example, a user can sign up for an account on the content distribution system 150 and/or a system that shares user data with the content distribution system 150 . The user can volunteer to provide demographic information, language preferences, content delivery preferences, information about personal and/or professional interests, and/or other information that describes the user's preferences.
- the collection of information 180 can indicate characteristics to which the user is averse. For example, an individual user's information can indicate that the user dislikes spicy foods, animated ad banners, and/or fur clothing.
- the content distribution system 150 and/or any other participant in the content distribution can create and enforce one or more privacy policies regarding how information is collected and/or used.
- user information stored in the collection of information 180 can be based upon monitoring user network behavior. For example, the user may have a long term history of interacting with various contents, such as advertisements.
- the user information can indicate short term characteristics by analyzing one or more users' recent actions. For example, the user may have recently interacted with one or more contents in a way that indicates a higher tendency to select content, which in some situations can be referred to as a “clickiness” of the user.
- the identity of the user is protected by use of one or more anonymization processes.
- certain information associated with users is anonymized or partially redacted.
- the user history and login association, or device history and address association can be anonymized by use of collision-resistant hashes that hash the identification data.

- Additional privacy protection techniques can also be used, such as the use of one or more encryption processes.
- the user signal component 170 and/or another component in the system 100 anonymizes data for users so that the stored data cannot be associated with the users.
- each user query can be associated with a unique 128-bit number that is not associated with any user.
- opt-in and/or opt-out procedures can be provided, and if the user opts-in for tracking of user history data, the systems and techniques described herein can associate search queries, clicks and/or other user activities with a user identifier that is uniquely associated with the user.
- a user can grant permission to the user signal component 170 to track the user's history so that historical data for the user's search sessions and other user data are tracked and associated with the user.
- a search engine and/or a browser can be configured to track only data approved by the user, such as only search queries and search result selections.
- the user can clear historical data associated with the user at any time, and can opt-out of such tracking at any time.
- an identifier can also anonymously identify a device (e.g., a laptop or a mobile phone) from which the user activity originated.
- a device identifier can be, for example, a cookie or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the system 100 can include a content format component 190 that can be used to select a format for content distribution.
- the format can be selected based on analyzing one or more information portions in the information 180 . For example, the user's network activities in interacting with one or more distributed content portions, such as advertisements, can be analyzed to determine the format aspect(s) most likely to trigger a response from the user.
- the distributed content can be configured such that the user can respond by clicking on or otherwise selecting the content, by visiting a page or other resource associated with the content provider, and/or by purchasing something from, or otherwise registering with, the content provider.
- the user systems 110 can include audio and/or video players, wherein the content publisher systems 130 can provide audio and/or video content, and the content distribution system 150 can use the user's identity to choose format(s) for content items that can be presented along with the audio and/or video content (e.g., ad banners near a video window, commercials inserted in the audio and/or video streams, “crawl lines” overlaid on a video window).
- format(s) for content items e.g., ad banners near a video window, commercials inserted in the audio and/or video streams, “crawl lines” overlaid on a video window).
- the user systems can be video game consoles that access the content distribution system 150 to obtain content items that can be presented in the consoles' lobby screens or in the games themselves (e.g., billboards in a driving game can present ads for products that the player is predicted to be more likely to buy).
- content items can be presented in the consoles' lobby screens or in the games themselves (e.g., billboards in a driving game can present ads for products that the player is predicted to be more likely to buy).
- the user systems 110 can include systems with which the user interacts remotely.
- the user can use a telephone to access an interactive voice response system (e.g., a directory assistance system).
- the interactive voice response system can pass the identity of the user to the content distribution system 150 , and request content items that are likely to appeal to the caller.
- the content distribution system 150 can choose a recommendation format based on information about the user (e.g., to recommend only one restaurant with a detailed description instead of multiple brief recommendations) and cause the IVR to generate its response to the user accordingly.
- audible commercials that align with the user's interests can be selected according to a particular format and presented to the user during the IVR session.
- the collection of content 160 can include information that describes the content items.
- the collection of content 160 can also include information that describes the languages, formats, vertical categories, and/or other information that can describe the content and/or be used to determine prediction values.
- a format for a content distribution can be selected based on one or more types of analysis.
- the analysis can take into account a user's demonstrated tendency to select distributed content based on one or more format aspects of the content. Any format aspect can be taken into account, such as the language preferred by the user.
- the content format component 190 can determine a first number of content portions that have been presented in earlier content distributions to the user. For example, the determination can indicate that the numbers are:
- the content format component 190 can determine a second number of events included in the network activities where the user has selected at least one of the content portions. For example, the determination can indicate that the selection numbers are:
- the content format component 190 can use any or all of the above example numbers in selecting the format for the content to be distributed, for example by comparing the number(s) of selection with the number(s) of impressions made to the user. For example, the content format component 190 can identify any earlier content distribution that had a certain format characteristic (e.g., a particular shape and/or location), and the format can be selected based on the analysis of how frequently the network activities occurred regarding the earlier content distributions that had the format characteristic.
- a certain format characteristic e.g., a particular shape and/or location
- a content portion can be stored in a format that permits text to be generated in any of two or more languages.
- content such as a text advertisement can be originally created in two or more languages, or can be subjected to translation to generate a translated version from an original text.
- the content format component 190 can identify any earlier content distribution(s) that was formulated in a certain language.
- a language for the content distribution to be made can be selected based on the analysis of how frequently the network activities occurred regarding the earlier content distributions that were formulated in the language.
- User “clickiness” and/or any other selection tendency can be taken into account.
- user network activity can be analyzed to determine whether the user is presently “clicky” (e.g., the user presently has a detectable tendency to select a relatively high percentage of content being distributed) or if the user is presently “not clicky” (e.g., the user presently has little or no detectable tendency to select distributed content). For example, clicking 30% or more of presented advertisements can be considered clicky, and clicking on less than 1% can be considered not clicky.
- analyzing the user network activity can include identifying one or more time periods of user activity and/or inactivity. For example, a first time period can be identified that is characterized by the user being associated with the selection tendency as a result of selecting the content distributed during the first time period to a relatively large degree. As another example, a second time period can be identified that is characterized by the user not being associated with the selection tendency.
- selecting the format can include determining whether the network activities during a most recent predetermined amount of time (such as during a last few minutes or hours) resemble those of the first time period more than the second time period. Other time frames and/or selectivity criteria can be used. In some implementations, if the user is determined to presently be in a clicky state, more than one content portion such as an advertisement can be presented in response. For example, presenting multiple advertisements at such a time might increase the chance of user response.
- Content can be selected based on geographical region. For example, a user may be located in a particular region but may have a tendency to prefer content (e.g., advertisements) that are associated with another region. Such a tendency can be detected, for example, by analyzing the information 180 .
- the content distribution system 150 can analyze the information 180 and select the geographical region whose content a particular user responds to most frequently, to name just one selectivity criterion.
- the content distribution system 150 can cause the user to be targeted with content from the selected region, for example by selecting advertisements from that region for presentation to the user.
- such a selection of geographical region can be made in addition to, or in lieu of, using other context information, such as user location or keyword matching, to choose the appropriate geographical region.
- FIG. 2 shows another example system that can perform content distribution.
- a system 200 can include the content distribution system 150 connected to the network 140 , and can include two or more user systems 110 A and 110 B.
- the user systems 110 A-B can communicate with the content distribution system 150 and/or with any other component, such as with each other, for example using the network 140 .
- the content distribution system 150 will select a format for the content distribution to each of the user systems 110 A-B.
- the content distribution system 150 can employ one or more user signals in making a format selection, such as, for example, a user signal associated with the respective users operating the user systems 110 A-B.
- the user signal component 170 can be used.
- the user signal can be derived from user information, such as from the information 180 .
- the content distribution system 150 can use the content format component 190 to select one or more formats. For example, a format can be selected as most likely to trigger a user response based on analyzing past network activities by the user.
- the format can be applied to any type of content stored in the content collection 160 , such as text content, image content, video content, audio content and/or any other type of content.
- the content format component 190 can use priority information or any other ranking measure to choose a format.
- the content format component 190 can take into account one or more preferences among text ads, image ads, one or more formats of video ads, and/or other ad formats. For example, a detected user preference for certain type(s) of ads can be taken into account.
- content can be presented in a user interface.
- the user system 110 A can generate a user interface 210 A
- the user system 110 B can generate a user interface 210 B.
- the user interface 210 A and/or 210 B can include a browser or any other type of program executable by the respective user system.
- the content distribution system 150 selects a first content portion for distribution to each of the user systems 110 A-B.
- the content can be distributed to the respective user systems at different times, such as in response to the respective user navigating to a page that meets a relevance criterion with regard to the first content portion.
- the content distribution system 150 can select the same or different formats of the first content portion for the respective user systems.
- the first content portion is presented as content 212 A on the user system 110 A, and as content 212 B on the user system 110 B.
- the format difference is schematically illustrated as a size difference (i.e., the content 212 B is displayed larger than the content 212 A), any or all format aspects can be varied.
- either of the contents 212 A and 212 B can be presented using a different size (e.g., number of pixels in height and/or width), layout (e.g., organization within a boundary), shape (e.g., rectangular or square), color (i.e., green or red), position (e.g., left/right or top/bottom orientation), frame (e.g., embedded in other content or separately), sound (e.g., with loud, medium or no sound effect), language (e.g., written in a native language of the region where the user's device is located or in another language), and/or highlight (e.g., blinking, extra large and/or animation) than the other one of the contents 212 A and 212 B.
- layout e.g., organization within a boundary
- shape e.g., rectangular or square
- color i.e., green or red
- position e.g., left/right or top/bottom orientation
- frame e.g., embedded in other content or separately
- sound
- more than one content portion can be selected and distributed to a user.
- the content distribution system 150 can select and forward a second content portion 214 to at least the user system 110 A.
- the second content portion 214 can be chosen in response to the content distribution system 150 determining that a user operating the user system 110 A currently has a selection tendency. Accordingly, in such an example, the user may be presented with more content (e.g., advertisements) than otherwise.

- the method 300 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- One or more steps can be performed in another order; and, as another example, more or fewer steps can be performed.
- an analysis can be performed of an information collection reflecting network activities by a user.
- the network activities can have occurred in response to earlier content distributions to the user.
- the content distribution system 150 can employ the user signal component 170 to analyze user activities reflected by the information 180 .
- a format can be selected for a content distribution to be made to the user.
- the format can be selected based on the analysis.
- the content format component 190 can select one or more format aspects for the contents 212 A-B and/or 214 based on the information 180 .
- a geographical region can be identified.
- the content distribution system 150 can identify that the user system 110 A is physically located in a first region and that the user operating the system is most likely to respond to content distributions regarding a second region.
- the content distribution can be performed to the user with the content having the format.
- the content distribution system 150 can be distributed by the content distribution system 150 .
- a content distribution can be changed.
- the content 212 A or 212 B in the area 218 may initially have been non-advertising content and can be changed to be more advertisement-related content.
- a selection tendency can be monitored.
- the content selection system 150 can monitor whether a user operating the user system 110 A and/or 110 B develops an increased tendency to select content in the area 218 .
