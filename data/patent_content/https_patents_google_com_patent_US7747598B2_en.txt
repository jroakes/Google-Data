Definitions
- Search engines provide a powerful tool for locating content in documents in a large database of documents, such as the documents on the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW), and/or the documents stored on the computers of an Intranet.
- the documents are located using an index of documents in response to a search query, consisting of one or more words, terms, keywords and/or phrases, henceforth called terms, that are submitted by a user.
- Documents in the index of documents may be matched to one or more terms in the search query to determine scores.
- a ranked listing of relevant documents or document locations, based on the scores, are provided to the user.
- Search queries may have a variety of purposes and formats.
- One class of formats corresponds to location searches.
- Conventional location searches often use a fixed format, such as a template.
- Existing templates are often fixed or may only allow a limited number of variations.
- words or terms in an existing location search query may have a pre-determined order (street name, state, zip code) and/or a pre-determined spelling.

- Location search queries such as a street address in a city
- the location search queries are processed to determine a canonical or Boolean expression.
- the processing may include determining one or more key words in a respective location search query, removing punctuation marks and non-location terms (such as articles) from the respective location search query, and determining one or more synonyms for one or more terms in the respective location search query.
- the synonyms may include predetermined abbreviations for and/or predetermined misspellings of one or more terms in the respective location search query.
- the canonical expression may be independent of, i.e., insensitive to, an order of the key words.
- the canonical expression may be compared to an index of geographic feature documents in a search engine.
- Each geographical feature document has a set of tokens that correspond to a geographical feature, which may be a location (e.g., a street, city, country, state, country) or a geographical entity (e.g., lake, river, mountain, continent, ocean, etc.). While a single geographical feature may correspond to a set of locations, such as a set of street addresses, all the locations associated with a geographical feature may be considered to be “a location” in the context of identifying the locations or geographical features that best match a location search query.
- the terms “geographical feature” and “location” are used synonymously in at least some portions of this document.
- the index of geographical feature documents may be distributed over multiple computers in the search engine.
- the index may include location information and supplemental information.
- the location information may include key words, synonyms for the key words, and proximate objects for multiple locations.
- the supplemental information may include reference coordinates, such as latitude and longitude and/or a range or street numbers, for the locations.
- Scores for a subset of the geographic feature documents that are a close match to a respective canonical expression may be returned by the computers.
- a ranking of a top-N geographic feature document may be determined. If a best score is more than a pre-determined multiple of a next best score, the location corresponding to the best score may be provided to the user along with a map image of the corresponding location.
- the map image may be centered on the corresponding location and may be sized to include a pre-determined bounding box, region or window around the corresponding location. Alternatively, if the best score is less than the pre-determined multiple, several locations corresponding to a range of scores may be provided to the user. Additional information, such as a location identifier (city, state, zip code and/or country) and/or links to corresponding map images, may be provided.
- the embodiments may accommodate a wide variety of formats, allow for ambiguity in the location search query and/or in the results, and may be use parallel processing so as to provide high speed processing of location search queries (sometimes called location searching).
- the embodiments therefore, may provide improved processing of location search queries.
- FIG. 1 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a location search process 100 . While the location search process 100 described below includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it should be apparent that the process 100 can include more or fewer operations, which can be executed serially or in parallel (e.g., using parallel processors or a multi-threading environment), an order of two or more operations may be changed and/or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.
- a location search query may be received ( 110 ). Key words may be determined ( 112 ).
- the location search query may be converted into a canonical form ( 114 ). This may include removing one or more non-location or noise words or terms, punctuation marks, diacritical marks (i.e., a mark added to letter to indicate a special pronunciation), and/or street numbers from the location search query.
- a Boolean expression may be generated ( 116 ).
- the Boolean Expression may contain synonyms for one or more words or terms in the location search query. Converting the search query into canonical form may also include expanding one or more abbreviations, such as expanding “st.” or “st” into “street”.
- a misspelled word or term in the location search query may be “corrected” by supplementing the query with a “synonym” for the misspelled word that comprises the corresponding correctly spelled word. Determining the key words ( 112 ) may make a resulting query independent of the order of the key words.
- N e.g., ten
- best matching geographical feature documents may be identified from a geographic features document database ( 118 ). At least one geographical feature or location corresponding to the identified documents may be provided ( 120 ). Alternately, in some situations zero documents are provided to the requesting user.
- the list of N best matching geographical feature documents is filtered to remove (A) documents whose score is less than a first threshold, and (B) documents whose SAF (described below) is less than a second threshold and whose score is less than a third threshold (e.g., the third threshold would typically be higher (i.e., more restrictive) than the second threshold).
- the latter “filter” removes poor quality matches that exceed the first threshold, but which are far outside the current viewport (as defined below), thereby allowing another geographical feature or location within or closer to the current viewport to be identified as the best match.
- Identifying the N best matching documents 118 requires several computational operations.
- First, geographical feature documents satisfying the search query are identified 118 A. For example, this may be accomplished by retrieving lists of documents having tokens that match each of the query terms and then performing a Boolean AND operation on the retrieved lists to produce a list of documents (if any) having tokens that match all the query terms.
- each token is a word, symbol or combination of words and/or symbols associated with a geographical feature.
- a document's tokens may include a variety of misspellings of various terms that describe the geographical feature associated with the document, and may include the names (and misspellings thereof) of neighboring or nearby geographical features (e.g., in case a user's search query incorrectly specifies a neighboring city or the like, but otherwise accurately lists terms associated with the geographical feature).
- the search query is first “rewritten,” by removing any non-location terms and any punctuation, prior to identifying documents that satisfy the search query.
- a respective individual term in the search query can be replaced by a Boolean OR expression that includes the term and one or more synonyms.
- synonyms are added to the search query for each term in the query for which a set of synonyms has been predefined.
- the “synonyms” added to a search query as part of a Boolean OR expression may also include “generic synonyms” for individual components of compound terms. For example, a generic synonym of the first component of the street name “N Rengstorff” is “directional_keyword,” which matches any directional keyword, including N, S, E, W, North, South, East, and West.
- a generic synonym is “affix_keyword” which matches words (or tokens) such as ave., avenue, blvd., boulevard, ln, lane, rd, road, st, street, rue and so on. Similar generic synonyms are also included as tokens in the document database, at the same address component positions as the corresponding “correct” keywords. Matches between generic synonyms in a rewritten search query and a document produce a significantly lower score than a match between a non-synonym keyword in the search query and a non-synonym token in a document.
- other modifications can be made to the search query in accordance with predefined rules so as to improve the quality of the search results.
- scores are computed for the identified matching documents 118 B. Exemplary processes for generating the score for each matching document are discussed in some detail below. Generally, though, documents with high quality matches to the search query are assigned higher scores than documents with lower quality matches to the search query. Other factors, such as the locations of the geographical features corresponding to the matching documents, relative to a current viewport in which a map or image is displayed, and the relative importance of these geographical features, may also be factors in computing the scores.
- the matching documents are then ranked based on the computed scores 118 C, and the N highest ranked documents are identified 118 D. In some embodiments, the ranking of the documents and the selection of the N highest ranked documents is combined into a single operation (e.g., by running a top N filter over the scores). In some embodiments, documents having lower rank than the top N documents are not ranked.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment 200 of processing a location search query.
- a location search query 210 such as “155 Abe Ave. Great Neck N.Y.”, is used as an illustrative example.
- the street number 155 and the period may be removed during operation 114 resulting in Abe Ave Great Neck N.Y.
- the location search query may be converted into a Boolean expression, including expanding abbreviations (such as Ave) and synonyms.
- the resulting Boolean expression is Abe AND (Ave OR Avenue OR Street OR Lane OR Court OR . . . ) AND (Great Neck) AND (NY OR (NEW YORK)).
- This Boolean expression is independent of, i.e., insensitive to, an original word or term order in the location search query 210 . As such, it may accommodate a wide variety of formats for the location search query 210 .
- Such a Boolean expression has a form that may be processed in a search engine using a distributed geographic feature document database. This is discussed further below.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment 300 of distributing geographic feature documents over a plurality of indexes, which may be stored on multiple computers in a search engine.
- Geographic features documents 310 may include a plurality of geographic feature documents 312 .
- a respective geographic feature document, such as document 312 - 1 may include a feature type (such as a street, road, route, city, country, intersection, etc.), a feature name (i.e., the name of a location), primary terms or tokens (such as specific key words associated with the feature), nearby feature terms or tokens (such as adjacent or proximate landmarks or locations of interest) and supplemental information (such as latitude and longitude of the feature).
- the supplemental information may be used by a map or tile sever to present a map image(s) corresponding to the location in the respective geographic feature document. This is described further below with reference to FIGS. 5 and 7 .
- a partitioner 314 may distribute subsets of the geographic feature documents 310 via one or more indexers 316 to a respective index, such as index 320 - 1 , in a plurality of indexes 320 .
- the index 320 - 1 may correspond to one partition or sub-partition of the indexes 320 (which may collectively be considered to be the inverse index of the entire geographic feature documents database).
- the indexes 320 may be stored on one or more computers in the search engine.
- the subsets may be distributed such each index 320 handles an equivalent or approximately equivalent portion of processing associated with the respective location search query.
- the documents 312 - 1 may be distributed randomly or pseudo-randomly over the indexes 320 .
- a hash function and modulo function may be used to distribute the geographic feature documents to M indexers, were M is the number of indexes (sometimes called index partitions or index sub-partitions).
- a hash function is applied to each geographic feature document (or to a predefined portion of the document) to produce a hash value, and then a “modulo M” function is applied to the hash value to produce a selection value between 0 and M ⁇ 1. The selection value determines which of the M indexers 316 is to receive the document for indexing.
- each of the indexes 320 may provide a top-N (such as a top-10) set of documents in the subset of documents that match the respective query.
- the top-N documents may be based on a ranking of scores.
- a score may be determined for each document that matches the search query. The score may be based on the canonical and/or Boolean expression for the respective location search query.
- the query processing for each sub-partition of the index 320 is handled by a respective server 730 , which returns information identifying up to N of the highest ranking documents that match the query.
- a server 726 that may be called an aggregator or partition level query execution manager combines the search results from the servers 730 , for example by selecting the N best search results from among the results returned by the servers 730 .
- query execution manager 720 the search results from all the aggregators 726 are combined, by selecting the N best search results from among the results returned by the aggregators 720 .
- a predefined number of best search results are selected at each level in a distributed hierarchy and are passed on to the next level. For example, if 10 sets of top-10 documents are received at a given level, the top-10 documents may be determined and passed on. In this way, the top-N documents in the documents 312 may be determined and/or identified using a distributed implementation. This approach may improve performance of the search engine and may reduce system cost and/or complexity.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a geographic feature document 400 , such as the document 312 - 1 .
- the document 400 may be compatible with hypertext markup language (HTML) and/or extensible markup language (XML).
- the document 400 may include information corresponding to a geographic feature, such as a location (e.g., a street, intersection, city, point of interest, etc.).
- Some documents 400 may include information for more than one location (e.g., multiple segments of a street, city, or the like).
- Such location information may include key words corresponding to the one or more locations, one or more regions associated with the one or more locations and synonyms for one or more of the key words.
- text following an HTML tag ⁇ CN> may indicate a type of location, in this case a route.
- Text following an HTML tag ⁇ CNA> may indicate an explicit name for the location, in this case Victoria Street.
- Text following HTML tags ⁇ CA> may indicate key words corresponding to the location, such as Riverside, London and England.
- Text following HTML tags ⁇ A> may indicate synonyms for the key words and/or the explicit name for the location, such as Sullivan, London and England.
- the synonyms may include words from foreign languages (i.e., languages other than the language of the key words).
- the synonyms may include abbreviations and/or common misspellings in one or more keywords and/or in the explicit name for the location.
- Text following HTML tags ⁇ Cn> may indicate other locations or regions that are nearby or that neighbor the location. In this example, the nearby locations or regions are Islington, West End and Covent Garden.
- the tagged text or information items in a document 400 may be called information items or text items or tokens.
- the information items or text items are processed by the indexers 316 ( FIG. 3 ) to produce the indexes 320 .
- the document 400 may include less information or additional information, including fewer or additional tags.
- the document 400 may include supplemental information, such as reference coordinates corresponding to the geographic features, that may be used by a map or tile sever.
- the reference coordinates may include latitudes and longitudes for one or more locations and/or a range of street numbers that bracket one or more locations.
- an order of the information in the document 400 may be changed. Two or more items in the document 400 may be combined into a single item.
- supplemental information in a document 400 is the supplemental information for street or other route.
- the supplemental information includes one or more segments, each corresponding to a portion of the street or route. Each segments specifies a beginning and ending street number corresponding to first and second ends of the segment, and also specifies a latitude and longitude for each end of the segment.
- the specified street number is used to identify the best matching segment in the document's supplemental information. If the specified street number falls between the beginning and ending street numbers for the best matching segment, linear interpolation is used to determine a latitude and longitude for the location specified by the location search query. Alternately, if the specified street number matches the beginning or ending street number for the best matching segment, then the corresponding latitude and longitude are used for the location of the location specified by the location search query.
- scores indicative of a degree of matching may be determined. These scores may indicate a relevancy of the documents 212 , and thus, the corresponding locations, to the location search query. As such, the scores may be used by the search engine to determine a best result, i.e., a best location, or a list of the top-N results, i.e., the top-N locations, in response to the location search query.
- scores may only be determined for a subset of the documents 312 ( FIG. 3 ), i.e., the search engine may determine a candidate set of documents that may correspond to the location search query.
- criteria for inclusion in the candidate set of documents may include a requirement that at least one of the key words match the explicit name of the feature (the text following the ⁇ CNA> tag in FIG. 4 ) and that each of the elements or terms in the canonical and/or Boolean expression occurs in a document.
- the scores may be determined using
- IR i is a query match score (with respect to a particular candidate document) corresponding to a respective term or element “i” in the canonical and/or Boolean expression
- FR is “feature rank” that indicates an importance of the feature or location
- E is a normalization value
- Q is an optional factor.
- Q may correspond to the quality of the match between the query and the candidate document, or it may correspond to any other metric that may be used to improve the quality of the search results.
- An example of the Q factor is the SAF factor described below with reference to FIGS. 11-15 .
- Q is set equal to SAF*Product(P j ), where SAF is the score attenuation factor described below, each P j is a penalty factor, and Product(P j ) is the product (i.e., the multiplicative product) of all the penalty factors.
- SAF is the score attenuation factor described below
- P j is a penalty factor
- Product(P j ) is the product (i.e., the multiplicative product) of all the penalty factors.
- Each of the penalty factors has a default value of 1.0, and is assigned a lower value (e.g., 0.7 or the like) if the corresponding penalty is applicable to the document in question.
- penalty factors are: A) a penalty factor that is applied when the document is neither in the user's country nor in his current viewport (as defined below); B) a penalty factor that is applied when the match between the document and the query is an inexact match (e.g., because the query contains an extraneous or mistaken term or symbol, and the only match between the mistaken term or symbol and the document is a match with a “generic synonym” token (see explanation above concerning “generic synonyms”)); and C) a penalty factor that is applied when the match between the query and the document is missing a key element (e.g., when the query matches a street name token and a country token, but not a city token of the document).
- Other penalty factors may be used in other embodiments.
- penalty factors are associated with situations indicative of a potentially poor quality match between a geographical feature document and a search query.
- Q is not used, or equivalently is set equal to 1.
- the normalization value, E is the maximum value of the sum of the IR i scores for a perfect match, or equivalently the sum of the token masses for the key words in the search query.
- the sum of the IR i values may be called the total match score or IR score for the candidate document.
- the value of IR i for a particular key word in the search query may include a product of weights.
- the weights may include a token mass, a relevance score and an element mass for the corresponding element or term in the canonical and/or Boolean expression.
- the token mass may correspond to a type of term, where the types of terms may include stop words, street affix key words (e.g., a street prefix word such as “rue” in French, or street suffix words such as “street,” “avenue,” “road,” and “place” in English), numbers, synonyms, and other key words, with each predefined type of term being assigned a predefined token mass.
- the predefined token mass values may have a predefined range, such as 0 to 1, or 0 to 8, or the like.
- the default token mass (for “other key words”) is 1, while token types such as synonyms, and street affix key words and stop words are all assigned lower token mass values.
- synonyms are assigned a larger token mass than street affix words.
- the relevance score may vary based on the degree of text match, with a predefined largest value for a complete text match between a query key word and an information element of the document.
- a predefined largest value for a complete text match between a query key word and an information element of the document When the best match of a query key word with the information elements of a document is only a partial match (e.g., the query key word matches only one word of a multiword element), the relevance score is less than the predefined largest value, and reflects the degree of text match.
- the element mass may vary as a function of a size or type of the geographic feature associated with an information item (in the candidate document) that matches a query key word. For example, an information item that is country name may be given a higher element mass than an information item that is a locality name (such as a city name), which in turn is given a higher value than an information that is a street name.
- the element mass may also reflect the type of information item that matches the query key word.
- the information item that contains the explicit name for the geographical feature may be assigned a highest element mass
- an information item that is a “context” item e.g., the city or country in which a street is located
- an information item that contains the name of a nearby city, region or other geographical feature may be assigned a lowest element mass.
- the element mass for an information item in a candidate document is equal to the product of two element mass factors, one of which is based on the size or type of the geographical feature named by the information item and the second of which is based on the type of information item (explicit name, context, or nearby feature) that matches the query key word.
- the element mass for an information item in a candidate document is equal to the sum of these two element mass factors.
- the feature rank, FR, for a candidate document may be based on a document frequency (a number of times a feature is referenced in the documents 312 in the database 310 , FIG. 3 ), or it may be based on the size of a geographic feature, with bigger features (i.e., geographic extent) given higher feature rank values.
- the feature rank can be based, at least in part, on the importance or popularity of the geographic feature corresponding to the candidate document. For example, the importance or popularity of the geographic feature corresponding to a candidate document may be determined by a world-wide-web search or other database search on the name of the geographic feature.
- an IR score is computed (with respect to a candidate document) for each of the synonyms and for the query key word, and then the best of those IR scores is selected and used when computing the combined IR score for the candidate document.
- the scoring function shown above is modified so as to increase the importance of one or more factors relative to the other factors.
- the scoring function may be changed to
- the scoring function discussed above is modified to favor documents whose name has terms in the same order as the terms are positioned in the search query over documents matching the same terms, but which have the terms in a different order in their name.
- the total match score may be supplemented (e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score) with a pair-wise matching score (e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score), which is based on the number of ordered term pairs (ordered, neighboring terms) in the search query that match ordered terms pairs in the document name.
- a pair-wise matching score e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score
- FIG. 5A is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a map image 500 provided to the user.
- a location tag 512 - 1 corresponding to the location is centered in a bounding box 510 .
- the bounding box 510 is sized such that a region 514 surrounding the location may be provided.

Abstract
Description
where IRi is a query match score (with respect to a particular candidate document) corresponding to a respective term or element “i” in the canonical and/or Boolean expression, FR is “feature rank” that indicates an importance of the feature or location, E is a normalization value, and Q is an optional factor. Q may correspond to the quality of the match between the query and the candidate document, or it may correspond to any other metric that may be used to improve the quality of the search results. An example of the Q factor is the SAF factor described below with reference to
where the exponent, M, is a value greater than one (e.g., 2, 2.5 or 3), and is typically between two and five (2≦M≦5), so as give the normalized total match score more importance in the scoring function than the feature rank, FR, and Q factors. In some embodiments, the scoring function discussed above is modified to favor documents whose name has terms in the same order as the terms are positioned in the search query over documents matching the same terms, but which have the terms in a different order in their name. For example, the total match score may be supplemented (e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score) with a pair-wise matching score (e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score), which is based on the number of ordered term pairs (ordered, neighboring terms) in the search query that match ordered terms pairs in the document name.
SkirtRegionRadius=ViewportRadius×(1+SkirtFactor×EV)
EV=A+B×e −M×X1
where A and B are selected so that EV equals its maximum value, 1, when X1 is equal to zero (i.e., when the viewport region is very small), and EV equals its minimum value, 0, when X1 is equal to its maximum value, 1 (corresponding to a viewport region that covers the entire earth). SkirtFactor is a configurable scaling factor. An exemplary value of SkirtFactor is 10; in other embodiments, SkirtFactor is equal to a value between 4 and 20. M is a configurable exponential rate factor. An exemplary value of M is 50; in other embodiments, M is equal to a value between 10 and 200. In addition, the value of M depends on the scaling of the angular distance X1. Solving for A and B in accordance with the constraints stated above, the equation for EV becomes:
When M=50, e−M is very close to zero (e−50≈1.9*10−22), and EV is approximately equal to e−M*X1.
where IRi is a query match score (with respect to a particular candidate document) corresponding to a respective term or element “i” in the canonical and/or Boolean expression, FR is the “feature rank,” which indicates the importance of the feature or location, E is a normalization value, and SAF is the scoring attenuation factor mentioned above. The IR, FR and E parameters are discussed in more detail above, and that discussion is equally applicable to the scoring function discussed here. It is noted that the sum of the IRi values for a particular candidate document (or geographical feature) can be considered to be an information retrieval score or query match score for the candidate, and that all the other parameters of the scoring function are for scaling, boosting or attenuating the score in accordance with additional factors so as to improve how the search results are ranked (i.e., so that the topmost ranked search results are the search results that are most likely to correspond to the geographical feature that is being sought by the user).
SAF=C+D×e −K×X
where K is an exponential scaling factor, and X is the ratio of (A) the distance between the geographical feature and the viewport region (i.e., the closest edge of the viewport region), and (B) the width of the viewport skirt region, as explained above with reference to
When K=3, e−K is approximately equal to 0.5, and 1-e−K is approximately equal to 0.95. When MinScore=0.2 and K=3, SAF is approximately equal to 0.158+0.842*e−3X for geographic features that intersect the viewport skirt region (but do not intersect the viewport region). Note that SAF, according to this equation is equal to 1.0 when X=0, and is approximately equal to 0.2 when X=1. As noted above, SAF is equal to 1 for geographic features that intersect the viewport region, and is equal to MinScore (e.g., 0.2) for geographic features that intersect neither the viewport region nor the viewport skirt region. In other embodiments, MinScore is a value between 0.1 and 0.5, and K is a value between 2 and 10.
