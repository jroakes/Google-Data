Specifically, content metadata records at least one version of content metadata formats and definitions in a memory or accessible storage that may be used when scanning online content items.
- the content management computing device Upon identifying that content metadata is present within an online content item, the content management computing device analyzes the content metadata to identify a voice interaction or voice interactions associated with the online content item. Further, the content management computing device may identify Interaction Parameters, Email Formats, and Interaction Responses associated with the online content item. Such identified voice interactions and other attributes are used when the content management computing device serves the online content item to a user computing device. Specifically, as described, the content management computing device serves online content items to the user computing device and sends an instruction to the user computing device to listen or monitor for voice response data for a period after serving the online content items. Further, the content management computing device sends an instruction to the user computing device to transmit collected voice response data back to the content management computing device upon collection. Also, the content management computing device may send an instruction to additionally serve an Interaction Response depending upon the voice response data collected.
- the content management computing device may also use the user computing device to identify and analyze content metadata.
- the user computing device at least partially identifies, parses, and analyzes content metadata and determines how to serve voice response data associated with the content metadata. Accordingly, the user computing device at least partially serves voice interactions with the online content item.
- the content management computing device may provide the user computing device with programming (e.g., scripts, plug-ins, or apps) that may be used to identify and serve voice interactions.
- the user computing device Upon collection of the voice response data, the user computing device transmits such voice response data to the content management computing device.
- the content management computing device processes the voice response data to identify a user request. Phrased differently, the content management computing device processes the voice response data in light of the voice interactions (as shown in, for example, Table 1) and identifies the meaning of the voice response data.
- the content management computing device processes the voice response data into a set of text data using a speech processing algorithm and additionally identifies the user request from the set of text data by applying at least one of a regular expression algorithm and a context-free grammar algorithm.
- the content management computing device may access user profile information associated with the user computing device.
- user profile information may include, for example, user calendar information, user contact information, and user payment information.
- the content management computing device determines that a user request, identified based on voice response data, represents a request for an offer.
- the content management computing device may determine that voice response data is responsive to SEND_PROD_OFFER (shown in Table 1, above.)
- the content management computing device may also retrieve a set of user profile information associated with the user computing device including at least a set of contact data, and use the set of user profile information to generate the response.
- the content management computing device may specifically access user payment information (e.g., data associated with Payment Method, shown above) associated with the user computing device.
- user payment information e.g., data associated with Payment Method, shown above
- the user computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a purchase because the voice response data is responsive to voice interaction PRODUCT_PURCHASE (shown in Table 1, above.)
- the content management computing device may also identify a set of purchase data from the user request defining the request for the purchase. In other words, the content management computing device may identify the terms of the purchase requested in the voice response data (e.g., the products sought for purchase and quantities).
- the content management computing device may also retrieve a set of user payment information associated with the user device and transmit the set of purchase data and the set of user payment information to the online content provider. As a result, the content management computing device may allow the online content provider to sell merchandise based on the voice response data collected.
- the content management computing device is configured to transmit a security request to the user device to verify that the request for the purchase is authorized.
- the content management computing device may send a request for authentication based on a passphrase, biometric data, a PIN code, or any other suitable security protocol.
- the content management computing device sends a general request for the user computing device to authenticate the user without requesting actual secure data.
- the content management computing device receives a security response from the user device indicating whether a user is authorized for purchasing goods or services (but not indicating private information of the user.) The content management computing device verifies that the request for the purchase is authorized.
- the user computing device may also be used to analyze collected voice response data.
- the content management computing device may provide the user computing device with software or other tools that may process voice response data on the user computing device. Accordingly, the user computing device may analyze the voice response data and send the parsed and analyzed data to the content management computing device in a non-audio format such as a text file. In such examples, lower data consumption may be employed because voice data files are not transmitted from the user computing device to the content management computing device.
- the content management computing device may determine that the voice response data is incomplete. For example, information collected may not be fully responsive to the voice interaction. In such examples, the content management computing device may determine that such voice response data is incomplete and further transmit a request for additional voice response data to the user device upon determining, based on the user request, that further input is required. In some embodiments, the user computing device may also be configured to analyze voice response data and determine whether a request for additional voice response data is required.
- the content management computing device may also determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event.
- the user computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event because the voice response data is responsive to voice interaction RESERVE_LOCATION (shown in Table 1, above).
- the content management computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event, identify a set of calendar options associated with the user device, and transmit the request for a scheduled event including the set of calendar options. Identification of the set of calendar options may be performed by retrieving user profile information including a user calendar.
- the content management computing device is configured to determine that the user request represents a request for more information. For example, a user may provide a response to a voice interaction that is a question requesting more information in return. In such examples, the content management computing device may identify a second online content item associated with the online content item, wherein the second online content item includes more information than the online content item and serve the second online content item to the user device.
- the content management computing device may identify at least one response. For example, based on a user request associated with SEND_PH_NUMBER, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a phone number associated with the online content item to the user computing device. In the case of a user request associated with SEND_PROD_OFFER, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a product offer for products identified by the user in the voice response data.
- the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for a reservation to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to the user computing device upon determining that the merchant can accommodate the reservation.
- the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for purchase to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to the user computing device upon processing the purchase.
- the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for purchase to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to a secondary user computing device (distinct from the user computing device) upon processing the purchase.
- Sending the at least one response to the secondary user computing device substantially facilitates allowing a user to interact with the online content provider at a delay and using multiple computing devices.
- a user may prefer to interact with the online content provider (and online content item) using a different device and at a different time.
- the content management computing device may be configured to communicate with such secondary user computing devices. Because different computing devices have different display and interaction characteristics (e.g., varying screen sizes and input interfaces), users may prefer interaction to be redirected from the user computing device to such secondary user computing devices.
- the content management computing device is configured to receive requests to redirect communications including responses to such secondary user computing devices.
- the content management computing device may identify secondary user computing devices based on user profile information or alternately based on voice response data. Accordingly, in some examples, the content management computing device requests information from the user profile to identify a set of contact information including information identifying secondary user computing devices or methods of contacting such secondary user computing devices (including, for example, email addresses, account names, and other identifiers).
- the voice interactions (such as those described) may be configured to prompt the user to identify secondary user computing devices in voice interactions. Accordingly, the content management computing device is configured to transmit the response based on the set of contact information to such secondary user computing devices.
- the content management computer device allows the user (via the secondary user computing device or any other computing device) to interact with the response at a delay in comparison to the time of initially serving the online content item.
- the user computing device is also configured to execute several steps to display voice interactive content.
- the user computing device is configured to at least: (i) receive an online content item from a content management computing device, wherein the online content item includes content metadata; (ii) identify at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata; (iii) serve the online content item via a user output interface; (iv) collect voice response data from a user input interface that is responsive to at least one voice interaction; and (v) transmitting the voice response data to the content management computing device.
- the user computing device is also configured to receive a second online content item, determine that the second online content item should be served based upon the collected voice response data, and serve the second online content item via the user output interface.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing one of the following steps: (a) retrieving an online content item including content metadata; (b) identifying at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata; (c) serving the online content item to a user computing device, wherein serving the online content item further comprises instructing the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction; (d) receiving the voice response data from the user computing device; (e) identifying a user request based on the voice response data; (f) transmitting a response, based on the user request, to device user account; (g) transmitting a request for additional voice response data to the user account upon determining, based on the user request, that further input is required; (h) processing the voice response data into a set of text data using a speech processing algorithm; (i) identifying the user request from the set of text data by applying at least one of a regular expression algorithm

The processor is programmed to retrieve an online content item including content metadata, identify at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata, serve the online content item to a user computing device, wherein serving the online content item further comprises instructing the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction, receive the voice response data from the user computing device, identify a user request based on the voice response data, and transmit a response, based on the user request, to a user account.
Description
- This description relates to voice interactions with computing devices, and more particularly, to methods and systems for creating and managing voice interactive content configured to respond to voice interaction from a user.
- At least some online content (i.e., content presented to consumers with online publications or online applications) is interactive online content configured to receive hands-on interaction from a user (i.e., an individual to whom the online content is presented) such as mouse-clicks and keyboard entries. Such user interaction may trigger further interactions between the user and the online content provider. For example, in the case of some text or graphical online content (e.g., ads), users may directly respond to offers, request further information, or arrange for follow-up interactions with online content providers.
- However, in many cases, users receive online content while otherwise occupied with tasks. In such cases, users may be less able to interact with or otherwise engage with the online content. For example, a user that is driving or jogging and receives online content may not be able to respond to the online content directly because their hands are not free for interaction with the online content. Further, the user also may not be able to record or otherwise remember the details of the online content for later follow-up. Accordingly, methods and systems for delivering online content that allow for interaction in such contexts may be desirable.
- In one aspect, a content management computing device for managing voice-interactive online content is provided. The content management computing device includes a memory for storing data and a processor in communication with the memory.

Any feature of any drawing may be referenced and/or claimed in combination with any feature of any other drawing.
- The following detailed description of implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the claims.
- The systems and methods described herein overcome described challenges of delivering interactive online content by serving online content configured to receive user voice interaction. More specifically, in the example embodiment, the systems and methods are implemented by a content management computing device configured to: (i) retrieve an online content item including content metadata, (ii) identify at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata, (iii) serve the online content item to a user computing device, wherein serving the online content item further includes instructing the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction, (iv) receive the voice response data from the user computing device, (v) identify a user request based on the voice response data, and (vi) transmit a response, based on the user request, to a user account.
- As described and suggested above, the systems and methods thereby achieve several technical effects. First, the systems and methods described allow users to engage with online content at a delay. As described above, much existing online content requests immediate user interaction even when it is impractical. The systems and methods described herein allow a user to delay the interaction to a time when the user may more conveniently interact with the systems. For example, users may receive an online content message and use the methods and systems to receive follow-up messages (e.g., an email message) to re-engage with the online content provider at a later time. Second, the systems and methods described provide mechanisms and infrastructure that may be used to define, create, manage, and serve interactive content and to additionally receive, process, and analyze user voice response data. As a result, the systems and methods solve the technological problem of accessing user interaction data responsive to interactive online content in contexts when known interaction data is otherwise inaccessible. This technological problem of data access, specific to the context of computer networks (and further specific to the context of content serving), is solved in the embodiments and the technical implementations described herein. Third, the systems and methods improve the technical field of content serving. By utilizing the infrastructure and systems described, the content management computing device accesses interaction content that is otherwise unavailable to content servers, publishers, and other parties. Through the use of the described content metadata in the online content items, the content management computing device identifies at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata and serves the online content item to a user computing device, wherein serving the online content item further includes instructing the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction. As a result, the content metadata facilitates the receipt of such otherwise inaccessible information. Fourth, the systems and methods described herein provide new solutions that are of unique value in the context of computer networks and, more specifically, the context of content serving.
- In one aspect, the methods described are implemented by a content management computing device. The content management computing device is configured to retrieve, manage, and serve an online content item such as an online advertisement. The online content item may be of any suitable format including text, graphical, audio, video, or any combination thereof. In the example embodiment, the online content item includes at least some audio content. In some embodiments, the online content item may not include audio content while remaining responsive to voice interactions.
- The online content item includes content metadata. The content metadata includes a description of voice interactions that may be associated with the online content item. For example, the voice interactions may include voice commands to which the online content item is responsive. In one example, the online content item may be configured to respond to user voice commands such as “Tell Me More”, “Send Me Information”, and “Buy Now.” Further, as described in detail below, such content metadata may allow for detailed description of voice interactions associated with the online content. Such content metadata may be analyzed, parsed, and processed by multiple systems to determine which voice interactions are associated with the online content item. In one embodiment, the content management computing device is configured to parse the content metadata and determine which voice interactions are associated with the online content item. In other embodiments, client systems such as the user computing device may parse the content metadata and determine which voice interactions are associated with the online content item.
- The content management computing device serves the online content item (e.g., an ad) to a user computing device (“user computing device”). More specifically, the online content item provides the online content item to the user computing device in the context of an online publication. In the example embodiment, the online publication is audio content and the online content item is served within the audio content. In one example, the online publication is a music stream and the online content item is served between songs of the music stream.
- As described herein, during the serving of the online content item, the content management computing device also instructs the user computing device to monitor for user feedback that may be associated with the voice interactions. In other words, the content management computing device instructs the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction defined by the content metadata. Therefore, in the examples above, the content management computing device may instruct the user computing device to monitor for a user speaking commands including, “Tell Me More”, “Send Me Information”, and “Buy Now.” Such examples are described in detail below.
- In the example embodiment, the user computing device receives such voice response data and transmits the voice response data to the content management computing device. Accordingly, the content management computing device receives the voice response data from the user computing device. In at least some examples, the user computing device may transmit the voice response data to the content management computing device in real time. In other examples, the user computing device may transmit the voice response data at periodic intervals or when suitable data connectivity is available.
- The content management computing device further processes the voice response data to identify textual information. In the example embodiment, the content management computing device may use any suitable audio processing algorithm to identify the textual information. Further, the content management computing device processes the textual information using a language processing algorithm to identify a user request. The user request, or user intent, represents the action intended by the user. The content management computing device also transmits the user request to the online content provider associated with the online content item.
- As used herein, a processor may include any programmable system including systems using micro-controllers, reduced instruction set circuits (RISC), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), logic circuits, and any other circuit or processor capable of executing the functions described herein. The above examples are example only, and are thus not intended to limit in any way the definition and/or meaning of the term “processor.”
- Described herein are computer systems such as content management computing devices, user computing devices and related computer systems. As described herein, all such computing devices and computer systems include a processor and a memory. However, any processor in a computer device referred to herein may also refer to one or more processors wherein the processor may be in one computing device or a plurality of computing devices acting in parallel. Additionally, any memory in a computer device referred to herein may also refer to one or more memories wherein the memories may be in one computing device or a plurality of computing devices acting in parallel.
- As used herein, the term “database” may refer to either a body of data, a relational database management system (RDBMS), or to both. As used herein, a database may include any collection of data including hierarchical databases, relational databases, flat file databases, object-relational databases, object oriented databases, and any other structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system. The above examples are example only, and thus are not intended to limit in any way the definition and/or meaning of the term database. Examples of RDBMS's include, but are not limited to including, Oracle® Database, MySQL, IBM® DB2, Microsoft® SQL Server, Sybase®, and PostgreSQL. However, any database may be used that enables the systems and methods described herein. (Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, Calif.; IBM is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y.; Microsoft is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.; and Sybase is a registered trademark of Sybase, Dublin, Calif.)
- As described above and herein, in some embodiments, the content management computing device may store user computing device identifiers, user identifiers, geographic identifiers associated with users, and transaction and shopping data associated with users, without including sensitive personal information, also known as personally identifiable information or PII, in order to ensure the privacy of individuals associated with the stored data. Personally identifiable information may include any information capable of identifying an individual. For privacy and security reasons, personally identifiable information may be withheld and only secondary identifiers may be used. For example, data received by the content management computing device may identify user “John Smith” as user “ZYX123” without any method of determining the actual name of user “ZYX123”. In some examples where privacy and security can otherwise be ensured (e.g., via encryption and storage security), or where individuals consent, personally identifiable information may be received and used by the content management computing device. In such examples, personally identifiable information may be needed to reports about groups of online users. In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about individuals including online users and merchants, or may make use of such personal information, the individuals may be provided with an opportunity to control whether such information is collected or to control whether and/or how such information is used. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, an individual's identity may be processed so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the individual, or an individual's geographic location may be generalized where location data is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of an individual cannot be determined.
- In one embodiment, a computer program is provided, and the program is embodied on a computer readable medium. In an example embodiment, the system is executed on a single computer system, without requiring a connection to a sever computer. In a further embodiment, the system is being run in a Windows® environment (Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.). In yet another embodiment, the system is run on a mainframe environment and a UNIX® server environment (UNIX is a registered trademark of X/Open Company Limited located in Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom). The application is flexible and designed to run in various different environments without compromising any major functionality. In some embodiments, the system includes multiple components distributed among a plurality of computing devices. One or more components may be in the form of computer-executable instructions embodied in a computer-readable medium.

Such voice responses are captured by the user computing device as “voice response data.”
- The systems and processes are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. In addition, components of each system and each process can be practiced independent and separate from other components and processes described herein. Each component and process also can be used in combination with other assembly packages and processes.
- As described above, the content metadata used by the systems defines at least one voice interaction that may be associated with online content. Such voice interaction is identified and used to capture voice response data at the user computing device. In an example embodiment, an example of descriptive content metadata is given in the example below (Table 1):
-
TABLE 1 Inter- Online action Inter- Content Param- action Email ID Interaction Label eters Response Formats ABC123 SEND_PH_NUMBER Phone Provide Plain Number Hours of Text Operation by Audio DEF456 SEND_PROD_OFFER Product Provide HTML Names, Audio and Product Offer Plain Attributes, Summary Text Product Quantities GHI789 RESERVE_LOCATION Date, Audio HTML Time, Confir- and Location, mation Plain Quantity Text of People JKL012 PRODUCT_PURCHASE Product Audio HTML Names, Confir- and Product mation Plain Attributes, Text Product Quantities, Payment Method - Table 1 includes four illustrative examples of voice interactions that are each associated with a distinct online content item. As described below and herein, in other examples multiple voice interactions may be associated with a given online content item. However, for simplicity, Table 1 only identifies one voice interaction per online content item. Additionally, the types of voice interactions shown in Table 1 are illustrative but non-limiting. Accordingly, additional voice interactions (including those described below) may be associated with other online content items.
- Shown in Table 1, online content item “ABC123” may be an advertisement for a service such as a gym or fitness center. When “ABC123” is displayed to a user on a user computing device, a promotion for a special offer (e.g., a discounted membership to the gym) may be provided along with a request to call the gym now for membership. As described herein, a user may not be able to call the gym at the time of ad serving. As a result, the content management computing device causes the user computing device to allow a user to interact with online content item “ABC123” using voice interaction “SEND_PH_NUMBER” (as identified in “Interaction Label”). When executed, SEND_PH_NUMBER allows a user to request the gym's phone number to be provided to the user. In one example, the user may respond to a voice prompt at the end of the display of “ABC123”. For example, the display of “ABC123” may end with the user computing device providing a message (via visual or audio output) of “Please say yes if you would like our phone number.”
- The content management computing device causes the user computing device to listen for a response for a configurable period of time and collect voice response data from a user. In other words, after “ABC123” is displayed, voice interaction SEND_PH_NUMBER begins. In the example embodiment, the content management computing device causes the user computing device to listen for five seconds. In other embodiments, the period of listening may be configured in the content metadata. Alternately, settings of content providers, the content management computing device, and the user computing device may be used to control the period of listening.
- Content metadata may also include “Interaction Parameters” that further define the voice interaction. Specifically, Interaction Parameters define the parameters that are monitored for when the content management computing device parses and analyzes the voice response data. In the example embodiment, SEND_PH_NUMBER includes an Interaction Parameter of a Phone Number. As such, the content metadata causes the user computing device to listen for a contact number (e.g., a mobile phone number) to which the gym's phone number may be sent. Upon receiving voice response data of “Yes” (indicating that the user wants the gym's phone number) from the user computing device, the content management computing device sends the phone number of the gym to a message account associated with the user computing device. If the user provides a phone number (responsive to the Interaction Parameter of Phone Number) with text message capabilities, the message may be sent via text. Alternately, the message account associated with the user computing device is an email address associated with the user computing device that is detected by the content management computing device based on previous or current interaction with the user computing device. Therefore, if a phone number is not provided, the gym's phone number may be sent via email. In alternative embodiments, the message account may be any suitable message style including SMS, text message, instant message. In additional embodiments, the response of the system may be sent via applications including web-based applications.
- Content metadata may also include an “Interaction Response”. The Interaction Response reflects a follow-up that may occur after the user computing device attempts to collect voice response data. In the given example, Interaction Response includes “Provide Hours of Operation by Audio.” In this example, when the voice response data of “Yes” is collected, the user computing device may provide an audio message with the hours of operation of the gym. In other examples, other forms of follow-up may occur in Interaction Response. In one example, Interaction Response may include a second prompt message that provides a new audio message and listens for an additional voice interaction. For example, the Interaction Response for an alternative form of “ABC123” may cause the user computing device to provide a message of “What type of membership are you interested in?” to a user and listen for a secondary voice interaction. As bandwidth may vary for users (e.g., when a user computing device migrates between data networks), in some examples audio associated with an Interaction Response may be pre-downloaded in order to avoid latency in serving the Interaction Response or alternately to avoid using data networks that are undesirable (e.g., cellular roaming networks).
- Content metadata may further include email format types that allow an online content provider to specify a type (or types) of email follow-up that may be sent in response to the user voice response data. In some examples, message accounts may prefer certain email formats (or message formats) and the content management computing device may accordingly match such email format types to message accounts as appropriate.
- In the second example, online content item “DEF456” is associated with voice interaction “SEND_PROD_OFFER”. DEF456 includes content describing several product offers promoted by a particular merchant. As suggested, SEND_PROD_OFFER is a voice interaction that causes a user computing device to monitor for a request by a user for details on the product offer. For example, “DEF456” may include audio content describing a sale of apparel and end with a statement, “If you would like to know more about this sale, say, ‘Send Me Details’ and name the products you want to hear about!” The content management computing device, upon parsing and analyzing DEF456 and identifying SEND_PROD_OFFER, causes user computing device to serve DEF456 and listen for a user response of “Send Me Details” within the designated period of listening. In SEND_PROD_OFFER, Interaction Parameters include Product Names, Product Attributes, and Product Quantities. Therefore, the content management computing device causes the user computing device to listen for such parameters in the voice response data. Upon completion, SEND_PROD_OFFER also provides an Audio Offer Summary describing the available offers. In the example, SEND_PROD_OFFER may be sent in plain text email or HTML email.
- In the third example, online content item “GHI789” is associated with voice interaction “RESERVE_LOCATION”. “GHI789” includes content describing service offerings for a business such as a restaurant. As suggested, RESERVE_LOCATION is a voice interaction that causes user computing device to monitor for a user request for a reservation at the advertising business. For example, “GHI789” may include audio content describing a special deal at a restaurant and end with the statement, “Make your reservation now!” RESERVE_LOCATION includes several Interaction Parameters including Date, Time, Location, and Quantity of People. In one example, content management computing device causes the user computing device to listen for such interaction parameters and create a reservation at the restaurant if possible. In a second example, user computing device may be in communication with a user calendar. In such examples, user computing device may identify and access the user calendar and identify openings on the user calendar that may be provided to the restaurant. In at least some examples, RESERVE_LOCATION may also include follow-up requests for information not present in the calendar including, for example, Quantity of People.
- In a fourth example, online content item “JKL012” is associated with voice interaction “PRODUCT_PURCHASE”. “JKL012” includes content describing service offerings for a product that may be purchased. Although JKL012 is similar to DEF456, PRODUCT_PURCHASE allows a user to specifically request to purchase a product or products. In contrast to SEND_PROD_OFFER, PRODUCT_PURCHASE also collects the Interaction Parameter of Payment Method and thereby allows a user computing device to provide payment data. In a first example, Payment Method is provided based on user voice interaction. In a second example, Payment Method is provided through the user computing device or software associated with the user computing device including, for example, an electronic wallet or a web-based wallet. In such examples, content management computing device may also require the user computing device to receive a security input (e.g., a password or a PIN code) to validate that the user has access to the payment method specified in Payment Method.
- In alternative examples, as described above, the content management computing device facilitates delayed interaction between the user and the online content provider. In a first example (such as the example of online content item “JKL102” associated with voice interaction “PRODUCT_PURCHASE”), the content management computing device (or an associated device including an online content provider computing device) may send order details to the user. Such order details may be sent to the user via email or any other suitable medium. Order details may be sent to the user computing device or additional computing devices accessible to the user. Upon receipt, the order details are configured to allow the user (via the accessed computing device) to review and approve, cancel, or modify the order by interaction with the order details.
- In a second example, (such as the example of online content item “GHI789” associated with voice interaction “RESERVE_LOCATION”), the content management computing device (or an associated device including an online content provider computing device) may send reservation details to the user. Such reservation details may be sent to the user via email or any other suitable medium. Reservation details may be sent to the user computing device or additional computing devices accessible to the user. Upon receipt, the reservations details are configured to allow the user (via the accessed computing device) to review and approve, cancel, or modify the reservation by interaction with the order details.
- As described herein, alternative voice interactions and combinations of voice interactions may be provided. Further additional Interaction Parameters may be collected for the above voice interaction types or any alternative types.
- As described above and herein, the content management computing device is configured to transmit a response, based on the user request to an account (“user account”) that is associated with the user. As indicated above, such responses may include a message with contact information for an online content provider, confirmation of reservation details, confirmation of order details, offer details, or any other follow-up message created based on the voice interaction. The user account may be any account associated with the user identified based on user features such as a user profile. In one example, the user account is an online application account. In a second example, the user account is an email account. In a third example, the user account is a messaging account for any suitable messaging protocol. As described herein, the user account may be accessed via the user computing device or other computing devices including secondary user computing devices, as described below.
- Described above and in Table 1 are several variations on voice interaction types that may be used in content metadata that is associated with online content. In addition to the descriptive content metadata described, structural metadata and associated syntax is also defined so that online content may use consistent data formats and structures in communicating with content management computing device and/or user computing device.
- Structural metadata may be provided by the content management computing device to online content publishers and online content providers (e.g., advertisers). Such structural metadata may also include acceptable metadata syntax. In some examples, structural metadata is defined and provided including standardization tools including but not limited to controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, data dictionaries, and metadata registries. The structural metadata may be provided using any suitable format including plain text, rich data format (RDF), hypertext markup language (HTML), and extensible markup language (XML).
- In an example embodiment, the structural metadata defines a set of acknowledged voice interaction types, parameters associated with each voice interaction type, interaction response associated with each voice interaction type, and email format associated with each voice interaction type. Further, structural metadata defines the layout, format, and syntax of the content metadata.
- As described above, multiple parties may receive structural metadata that may be used to create content metadata. In at least one example, content providers (e.g., advertisers) may create content metadata and embed such content metadata within online content items. In other examples, content publishers, the content management computing device, and other parties may create content metadata and embed such content metadata within online content items. In one example, content providers may send a request to the content management computing device. The request may be for particular online content items created by the content provider to be modified to include specific voice response data. In such an example, the content management computing device may edit the online content to include voice interaction metadata.
- As described above, multiple systems may analyze online content to determine that content metadata is present. In the example embodiment, the content management computing device may scan online content items to identify content metadata. Because content metadata is structured in a manner specified or promulgated by the content management computing device, the content management computing device can recognize such content metadata. Specifically, content metadata records at least one version of content metadata formats and definitions in a memory or accessible storage that may be used when scanning online content items.
- Upon identifying that content metadata is present within an online content item, the content management computing device analyzes the content metadata to identify a voice interaction or voice interactions associated with the online content item. Further, the content management computing device may identify Interaction Parameters, Email Formats, and Interaction Responses associated with the online content item. Such identified voice interactions and other attributes are used when the content management computing device serves the online content item to a user computing device. Specifically, as described, the content management computing device serves online content items to the user computing device and sends an instruction to the user computing device to listen or monitor for voice response data for a period after serving the online content items. Further, the content management computing device sends an instruction to the user computing device to transmit collected voice response data back to the content management computing device upon collection. Also, the content management computing device may send an instruction to additionally serve an Interaction Response depending upon the voice response data collected.
- In at least some examples, the content management computing device may also use the user computing device to identify and analyze content metadata. In such examples, the user computing device at least partially identifies, parses, and analyzes content metadata and determines how to serve voice response data associated with the content metadata. Accordingly, the user computing device at least partially serves voice interactions with the online content item. In such examples, the content management computing device may provide the user computing device with programming (e.g., scripts, plug-ins, or apps) that may be used to identify and serve voice interactions.
- Upon collection of the voice response data, the user computing device transmits such voice response data to the content management computing device. The content management computing device processes the voice response data to identify a user request. Phrased differently, the content management computing device processes the voice response data in light of the voice interactions (as shown in, for example, Table 1) and identifies the meaning of the voice response data. In one example, the content management computing device processes the voice response data into a set of text data using a speech processing algorithm and additionally identifies the user request from the set of text data by applying at least one of a regular expression algorithm and a context-free grammar algorithm.
- In some examples, the content management computing device may access user profile information associated with the user computing device. Such user profile information may include, for example, user calendar information, user contact information, and user payment information. In at least one example the content management computing device determines that a user request, identified based on voice response data, represents a request for an offer. For example, the content management computing device may determine that voice response data is responsive to SEND_PROD_OFFER (shown in Table 1, above.) In such examples, the content management computing device may also retrieve a set of user profile information associated with the user computing device including at least a set of contact data, and use the set of user profile information to generate the response.
- In another example, the content management computing device may specifically access user payment information (e.g., data associated with Payment Method, shown above) associated with the user computing device. For example, the user computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a purchase because the voice response data is responsive to voice interaction PRODUCT_PURCHASE (shown in Table 1, above.) The content management computing device may also identify a set of purchase data from the user request defining the request for the purchase. In other words, the content management computing device may identify the terms of the purchase requested in the voice response data (e.g., the products sought for purchase and quantities). The content management computing device may also retrieve a set of user payment information associated with the user device and transmit the set of purchase data and the set of user payment information to the online content provider. As a result, the content management computing device may allow the online content provider to sell merchandise based on the voice response data collected.
- In some examples, use of payment data may have security restrictions. In at least one example, the content management computing device is configured to transmit a security request to the user device to verify that the request for the purchase is authorized. For example, the content management computing device may send a request for authentication based on a passphrase, biometric data, a PIN code, or any other suitable security protocol. In the example embodiment, the content management computing device sends a general request for the user computing device to authenticate the user without requesting actual secure data. In this example, the content management computing device receives a security response from the user device indicating whether a user is authorized for purchasing goods or services (but not indicating private information of the user.) The content management computing device verifies that the request for the purchase is authorized.
- In some examples, the user computing device may also be used to analyze collected voice response data. For example, by using a client-server architecture, the content management computing device may provide the user computing device with software or other tools that may process voice response data on the user computing device. Accordingly, the user computing device may analyze the voice response data and send the parsed and analyzed data to the content management computing device in a non-audio format such as a text file. In such examples, lower data consumption may be employed because voice data files are not transmitted from the user computing device to the content management computing device.
- In some examples, the content management computing device may determine that the voice response data is incomplete. For example, information collected may not be fully responsive to the voice interaction. In such examples, the content management computing device may determine that such voice response data is incomplete and further transmit a request for additional voice response data to the user device upon determining, based on the user request, that further input is required. In some embodiments, the user computing device may also be configured to analyze voice response data and determine whether a request for additional voice response data is required.
- In some examples, the content management computing device may also determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event.
- For example, the user computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event because the voice response data is responsive to voice interaction RESERVE_LOCATION (shown in Table 1, above). In such examples, the content management computing device may determine that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event, identify a set of calendar options associated with the user device, and transmit the request for a scheduled event including the set of calendar options. Identification of the set of calendar options may be performed by retrieving user profile information including a user calendar.
- In further examples, the content management computing device is configured to determine that the user request represents a request for more information. For example, a user may provide a response to a voice interaction that is a question requesting more information in return. In such examples, the content management computing device may identify a second online content item associated with the online content item, wherein the second online content item includes more information than the online content item and serve the second online content item to the user device.
- Based on the user request, the content management computing device may identify at least one response. For example, based on a user request associated with SEND_PH_NUMBER, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a phone number associated with the online content item to the user computing device. In the case of a user request associated with SEND_PROD_OFFER, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a product offer for products identified by the user in the voice response data. In the case of a user request associated with RESERVE_LOCATION, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for a reservation to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to the user computing device upon determining that the merchant can accommodate the reservation. In the case of a user request associated with PRODUCT_PURCHASE, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for purchase to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to the user computing device upon processing the purchase. Alternately, in some examples, the content management computing device may determine that the at least one response includes sending a request for purchase to the online content provider (e.g., the merchant) and also sending a confirmation to a secondary user computing device (distinct from the user computing device) upon processing the purchase. Sending the at least one response to the secondary user computing device substantially facilitates allowing a user to interact with the online content provider at a delay and using multiple computing devices. As described above, in many examples a user may prefer to interact with the online content provider (and online content item) using a different device and at a different time. Similarly, in all examples described herein, the content management computing device may be configured to communicate with such secondary user computing devices. Because different computing devices have different display and interaction characteristics (e.g., varying screen sizes and input interfaces), users may prefer interaction to be redirected from the user computing device to such secondary user computing devices.
- In at least some examples, the content management computing device is configured to receive requests to redirect communications including responses to such secondary user computing devices. For example, the content management computing device may identify secondary user computing devices based on user profile information or alternately based on voice response data. Accordingly, in some examples, the content management computing device requests information from the user profile to identify a set of contact information including information identifying secondary user computing devices or methods of contacting such secondary user computing devices (including, for example, email addresses, account names, and other identifiers). In other examples, the voice interactions (such as those described) may be configured to prompt the user to identify secondary user computing devices in voice interactions. Accordingly, the content management computing device is configured to transmit the response based on the set of contact information to such secondary user computing devices. As a result, the content management computer device allows the user (via the secondary user computing device or any other computing device) to interact with the response at a delay in comparison to the time of initially serving the online content item.
- As described herein, the user computing device is also configured to execute several steps to display voice interactive content. Specifically, the user computing device is configured to at least: (i) receive an online content item from a content management computing device, wherein the online content item includes content metadata; (ii) identify at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata; (iii) serve the online content item via a user output interface; (iv) collect voice response data from a user input interface that is responsive to at least one voice interaction; and (v) transmitting the voice response data to the content management computing device.
- In some embodiments, the user computing device is also configured to receive a second online content item, determine that the second online content item should be served based upon the collected voice response data, and serve the second online content item via the user output interface.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing one of the following steps: (a) retrieving an online content item including content metadata; (b) identifying at least one voice interaction associated with the content metadata; (c) serving the online content item to a user computing device, wherein serving the online content item further comprises instructing the user computing device to collect voice response data that is responsive to at least one voice interaction; (d) receiving the voice response data from the user computing device; (e) identifying a user request based on the voice response data; (f) transmitting a response, based on the user request, to device user account; (g) transmitting a request for additional voice response data to the user account upon determining, based on the user request, that further input is required; (h) processing the voice response data into a set of text data using a speech processing algorithm; (i) identifying the user request from the set of text data by applying at least one of a regular expression algorithm and a context-free grammar algorithm; (j) determining that the user request represents a request for an offer; (k) retrieving a set of user profile information associated with the user computing device including at least a set of contact data; (l) using the set of user profile information to generate the response; (m) determining that the user request represents a request for a purchase; (n) identifying a set of purchase data from the user request defining the request for the purchase; (o) retrieving a set of user payment information associated with the user computing device; (p) transmitting the set of purchase data and the set of user payment information to the online content provider; (q) transmitting a security request to the user account to verify that the request for the purchase is authorized; (r) receiving a security response from the user computing device; (s) verifying that the request for the purchase is authorized; (t) determining that the user request represents a request for a scheduled event; (u) identifying a set of calendar options associated with the user computing device; (v) transmitting the request for a scheduled event including the set of calendar options; (w) determining that the user request represents a request for more information; (x) identifying a second online content item associated with the online content item, wherein the second online content item includes more information than the online content item; and (y) serving the second online content item to the user account.
