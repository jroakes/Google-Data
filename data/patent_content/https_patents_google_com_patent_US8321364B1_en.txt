- FIG. 1 is an example system 100 for cloud-based computing.
- Cloud-based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided, to some extent, between client and server devices.
- a “cloud” may refer to a service or a group of services accessible over a network (e.g., Internet) by client and server devices, for example.
- any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power, applications, and files.
- cloud computing enables a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Users can store and access personal files such as music, pictures, videos, and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium.
- a cloud-based application may store copies of data and/or executable program logic at remote server devices, while allowing client devices to download at least some of this data and program logic as needed for execution at the client devices.
- downloaded data and program logic can be tailored to capabilities of specific client devices (e.g., a personal computer, tablet, or mobile phone, or robot) accessing the cloud based application.
- client devices e.g., a personal computer, tablet, or mobile phone, or robot
- dividing application execution and storage between the client and server devices allows more processing to be performed by the server devices taking advantage of server devices processing power and capability, for example.
- Cloud-based computing can also refer to distributed computing architectures in which data and program logic for a cloud-based application are shared between one or more client devices and/or server devices on a near real-time basis. Parts of this data and program logic may be dynamically delivered, as needed or otherwise, to various clients accessing the cloud-based application. Details of the architecture may be transparent to users of client devices. Thus, a PC user or robot client device accessing a cloud-based application may not be aware that the PC or robot downloads program logic and/or data from the server devices, or that the PC or robot offloads processing or storage functions to the server devices, for example.

- any of the modules may be interconnected, and/or may communicate to receive data or instructions from each other so as to provide a specific output or functionality for the robot.
- the robot may send data to a cloud for data processing, and in another example the robot may receive data from the cloud.
- the data received from the cloud may be in many different forms.
- the received data may be a processed form of data the robot sent to the cloud.
- the received data may also come from sources other than the robot.
- the cloud may have access to other sensors, other robots, and the internet.
- FIG. 4 is an example system 400 in which robots may interact with the cloud and shares information with other cloud computing devices.

- Each robot 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 may interact with the cloud 410 , and may further interact with each other through the cloud 410 , or through other access points and possibly directly (e.g., as shown between robots 406 and 408 ).
- the cloud 410 may receive input from several robots. Data from each robot may be complied into a larger data set. For example, the robot 402 may take a picture of an object and upload the picture to the cloud 410 .
- An object recognition program on the cloud 410 may be configured to identify the object in the picture and provide data to all the robots connected to the cloud 410 about the recognized object, as well as possibly about other characteristics (e.g., metadata) of the recognized object, such as a location, size, weight, color, etc.
- every robot may be able to know attributes of an object in a photo uploaded by the robot 402 .
- the cloud 410 may include, store, or provide access to a database 412 of information related to objects, and the database 412 may be accessible by all the robots 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 .
- the database 412 may include information identifying objects, and details of the objects (e.g., mass, properties, shape, instructions for use, etc., any detail that may be associated with the object) that can be accessed by the robots 402 , 404 , 406 , 408 to perform object recognition.
- information regarding use of an object can include, e.g., such as for a phone, how to pick up a handset, how to answer the phone, location of buttons, how to dial, etc.
- the database 412 may include information about objects that can be used to distinguish objects.
- the database 412 may include general information regarding an object (e.g., such as a computer), and additionally, information regarding a specific computer (e.g., a model number, details or technical specifications of a specific model, etc.).
- Each object may include information in the database 412 including an object name, object details, object distinguishing characteristics, etc., or a tuple space for objects that can be accessed.
- Each object may further include information in the database in an ordered list, for example.
- the database 412 may include a global unique identifier (GUID) for objects identified in the database 412 (e.g., to enable distinguishing between specific objects), and the GUID may be associated with any characteristics or information describing the object.
- GUID global unique identifier
- a robot may be configured to access the database 412 to receive information generally distinguishing objects (e.g., a baseball vs. a computer), and to receive information that may distinguish between specific objects (e.g., two different computers).
- the database 412 may be accessible by all robots through the cloud 410 (or alternatively directly accessible by all robots without communication through the cloud 410 ).
- the database 412 may thus be a shared knowledge-base stored in the cloud 410 .
- the robots 402 , 404 , 406 , 408 may share information through the cloud 410 , and may access the database 412 .
- the shared database 412 may include information shared across social-networks.
- Social-networking technology may be used as a convenient way to connect and foster relationships with friends, family, and business colleagues.
- a typical social-networking service may have many members (or “nodes”) and may store profile data for each member including data that defines connections or interrelationships between the member and various other members of the service.
- the connection data may define for each member one or more social-network groups, each including one or more other members with whom the member is connected.
- the social-networking service may then allow members to share information, data, content, and the like with other members of their social-network group(s) in a computer implemented, virtual environment. For instance, through interaction with the social-networking service, a member may conveniently receive social-network updates posted by other members with whom the member is connected and may view profile information such as connections of those other members.
- one or more social-network groups may be created by adding connections to other accounts and organizations.
- the manner in which these connections are added may vary from social-networking service to social-networking service.
- some social-networking services operate in a symmetric manner in which a member may submit a request to “friend” or add to the member's social-network group a connection with a specified party, and the social-networking service may then invite that party to become a connection in the member's social-network group and adds the requested connection if the party accepts the invitation.
- social-networking services operate in an asymmetric manner in which a member may submit a request to “follow” a specified party, and the social-networking service may then add to the member's social-network group a connection with that party without formally inviting and receiving an acceptance from the party.

- Each social-network may include social-network data that is associated with a party (e.g., the first party and/or the second party). This social-network data may be stored at the party associated with the social-network data, on a social-networking server, or on any number of other servers, for example.
- Social-work data may be represented by a sociogram or other data construct that may be used to visually or programmatically represent connections or interrelationships between one or more parties.
- the connections or interrelationships between the parties may be symmetric or asymmetric.
- a symmetric connection may generally represent a connection where both the first party and the second party have mutually agreed to connect to one another. This may be the result of the first party requesting to connect to the second party and the second party granting the request, for example.
- an asymmetric connection may represent a connection that is formed when a single party requests a connection.
- an asymmetric connection may occur when the first party requests to connect to the second party and no confirmation, reciprocal request, or grant from the second party is required to effectuate the connection.
- the determination of whether the connections or interrelationships within a social-network are symmetric or asymmetric may depend on the respective social-network, for example.
- Sociograms and the data associated therewith, may be used to represent one or more relationships between the first party and the second party.
- these relationships may be specific to or centered around the first party and/or the second party.

- the process of determining if the first party and the second party are connected may be performed by the first party device performing a look-up in a database having social network connection data 520 to determine if a connection between the first party and the second party exists.
- the determination process may include the first party device sending a query to a server having connection data and the server performing a look-up to determine if a connection between the first party and the second party exists.
- An example server may include the social networking server 600 having social-network connection data 614 stored in a database.
- the database used to perform the look-up may include additional data associated with the connections including if the connection is a symmetric or asymmetric connection, the type of relationship, if any, between the first party and the second party, a duration of the connection, a history of changes that have occurred with the connection including additions, modifications, deletions, etc.
- the method 700 may include restrict access.
- the access restriction may include restricting all access to any data associated with the first party and/or the second party.
- the access restriction may include restricting access to that data that the first party and/or the second party has requested (e.g., via privacy settings).
- data that falls under one or more of the social-network's default privacy settings may be restricted.
- the process of restricting access may be performed by a server, such as a social-networking server 600 .

- the method 700 includes determine access level.
- the access level may be associated with a party, group, etc., and may indicate the amount and/or type of access the party has to data associated with the first party.
- the access level may indicate parties within a group have access to a first subset of the data associated with the first party but not to a second subset of data associated with the first party.
- the access level may also be used as a mechanism for the first party to limit the amount and/or type of data that may be available to the second party.

- the access level may be based on a degree of separation between the first party and the second party.
- the degree may be defined by the sociogram. For example, a first degree may indicate a first party's symmetric connection. A second degree may indicate one or more parties connected to the first party's symmetric connections, but not symmetrically connected to the first party, for example. Similarly, a third degree may indicate one or more parties connected to the second degree connection, but not to the first party's symmetric connection. The more tenuous the connection, the more limited the access level may be. In some embodiments, there may be a maximum degree of connection or an indication that no connection exists between two or more parties, for example. While symmetric connections have been used for illustration purposes, asymmetric connections or a combination of asymmetric and/or symmetric connections may be used to define the degree of separation between a plurality of parties.
- the access level may be used to restrict the second party's ability to (i) read data associated with the first party, (ii) write data to an account, page, display, etc., associated with the first party, (iii) modify data associated with the first party, (iv) delete data associated with the first party, (v) read, write, modify, and/or delete data associated with any of the first party's connections.

- the data may also or alternatively include data that may be associated with the second party such as a post, a video, a link (e.g., a hyperlink), a quote, a picture or image of a finished project, a recipe, a set of instructions, etc. that the second party added or otherwise associated with the first party's account. This may include a message or a picture that the second party sent to the first party.
- the data may also include a command that the second party sent to the first party and/or data that the second party added, wrote, modified, deleted, etc., to the second party's account.
- the data may be further described as primary data (e.g., data originating from the first party) and/or secondary data (e.g., data originating from the second party.)
- the first party may be a robot that has its own page in a social-network.
- the robot may perform a task in the real world, such as cleaning a room, and take a picture of the completed task (e.g., using a camera sensor).
- the robot may post (e.g., via a server) the picture of the completed task to the robot's page and may also post the instructions that the robot used to complete the task to the page.
- a second party such as a second robot with its own page, may view (e.g., read) the picture and/or instructions and comment (e.g., write data to the page) on the picture and/or instructions.
- the first party and/or a third party may read the second party's comment, add a comment in response to the second party's comment, modify the second party's comment, and/or delete the second party's comment, for example.
- the ability of any party to read, write, or otherwise modify data may vary based on a number of factors including the amount of read, write, or modify control the first party, social-network, etc. gives to the second party.
- the ability of the second party to write data may be associated with the second party's ability to control content associated with the first party, wherein the content may be text, images, audio, video, executable instructions, etc.
- the robot's write control may be limited based on whether the robot is owned and/or operated by the human user, owned by a friend or family member of the human user, owned by a connection of the human user, is a connection of the human user, etc.
- the ownership of a robot may be represented in the social network by designating the robot as a subpage (e.g., a unique area in a social-network that may be associated with a page), identified link, or relationship, etc.
- the relationship between human users and robots may be modeled using any cardinality such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many, for example.
- the ability of a party to read, write, modify, delete, etc. data may depend on the frequency at which the data is written, how many parties are writing data, the time of day, the location of the first party and/or the first party's user, the location of the second party and/or the second party's user, the group or type of connection between the first party and the second party, first and/or second party preferences, social-network rules and/or regulations, etc.
- the first party or the social-network may set permissions that always allow one or more second parties to write data or never allow one or more second parties to write data.
- the access may be limited based on the time of day.
- the second party may be restricted from writing data late at night or early in the morning when the first party or a user associated with the first party may be asleep.
- access may be limited based on the date. For example, a second party may be restricted from reading, writing, modifying, and/or deleting data to a first party account when the first party is unavailable to monitor the data associated with the first party's account. Thus, for example, access may be restricted when the robot first party is being repaired or upgraded and the robot first party is unable to monitor the account. Further, when a relationship exists between the robot first party and the robot first party's owner, then the restrictions of the owner may be imputed to the robot first party.
- Access may also or alternatively be restricted based on a location of the first party and/or the second party.
- the location may include public or private locations and may vary based on additional factors such as a context associated with the location. For example, data obtained by the first party while in a location designated as private (e.g., a bedroom or a bathroom) or designated as having confidential information may be restricted from being accessed by the second party.
- the first party may be restricted from writing or otherwise adding data associated with a location to the first party's account.
- Context may be used in conjunction with or independently from other factors to determine access levels.
- Example contexts may be based on a tone of a conversation (e.g., if a party is arguing), key words in a conversation (e.g., if a party is discussing finances, a surprise party, etc.), parties located nearby or involved in the conversation (e.g., if a party is meeting in secret), etc.
- Contexts may be defined by the first party, the second party, the social-network, etc.
- a public location may be a shopping mall.
- the robot first party may take pictures of purchased objects while at the mall and post the pictures to a webpage for second parties to comment or review.
- the robot first party may refrain from taking and posting pictures or may restrict the intended recipients access to the pictures.
- the restriction may be permanent, temporary, indefinite pending an event (e.g., the owner giving the recipient the present), etc.
- access may be restricted based on the group or type of connection between the first party and/or the second party. For example, an owner may take pictures of a night out with friends. The owner may instruct the robot to upload the pictures to the owner's account and/or to the robot first party's account and limit access to the pictures based on the group of friends that are in the pictures. Thus, the party may restrict access to the pictures based on whether the party is in the group. In further examples, the owner may place a restriction on the picture such that copies or subsequent versions of the pictures may only be viewed or otherwise accessed by the parties in the group.
- the method 700 includes analyze party data.
- the amount of data available for analysis may be correlated with the access level.
- the data may be analyzed by a cloud, server, social-network, first party device, second party device, etc.
- a server may analyze data associated with the first party and/or second party. This may allow the server to learn characteristics of the first party and/or the second party, likes and/or dislikes of the first party and/or the second party, preferred activities of the first party and/or the second party, what groups the first party and/or the second party is associated with, what connections the first party and/or the second party has, what interactions the first party has had with the second party and/or the third party, what interactions the second party has had with the third party, etc.
- this learning may be performed using any number of machine learning taxonomies including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc., for example.
- the method 700 includes determine first party behavioral expectation.
- a behavioral expectation may be associated with a social norm.
- a behavioral expectation may be based on a pattern of behavior expected within in given situation and/or within a particular group, degree of connection, etc.
- the pattern of behavior may broadly include implicit or explicit rules that a group may use for appropriate and/or inappropriate values, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, etc.
- the rules may define an action, for example.
- the process of determining a first party behavioral expectation may be performed by a processor located at a server, cloud, first party device, etc.

- the determined first party behavioral expectation may be sent to the sending device (e.g., the server, cloud, first party device, etc.)
- the determination of the first party's behavioral expectation may be based in whole or in part on the party data analyzed at block 710 . Similar to the analysis of block 710 , any number of machine learning taxonomies including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc., may be used when determining or otherwise analyzing the first party's behavioral expectation. The frequency at which the first party's behavioral expectation is determined may vary based on a predetermined or random amount of time, the happening of an event, etc.
- the server may determine or otherwise analyze data associated with the first party.
- the data may include pictures of a spaghetti dinner that the robot first party made at a certain time on Thursday night, for example.

- the server may determine a behavioral expectation by analyzing data associated with the first party. Based on the analysis, the server may determine that the first party has dinner at the same time every night, makes a spaghetti dinner a certain percentage of the days in a week or month, is most likely to make spaghetti on Thursdays, frequently uses the posted recipe, etc., for example. The server may also determine that a certain percentage of symmetric connections and/or asymmetric connections like the garlic bread video and/or posted variations of the recipe for the robot first party to make for the human owner.
- the server may use the data, determinations made from the analysis of the data, etc., to determine a behavioral expectation associated with the first party.
- This behavioral expectation may be, for example, that the first party will make a spaghetti dinner because it is a Thursday evening.
- the behavioral expectation may also be that the first party will consider or give weight to the recommendations of second parties within a certain group while giving little or no weight to the recommendations of second parties within other groups.
- the weight may vary based on a number of factors including the group or degree of connection of the second party, if the second party is a symmetric or asymmetric connection, a degree of similarity between the first party and the second party (e.g., as measured by the overlap in each party's likes and/or dislikes), etc.
- the server may determine a behavioral expectation based on data obtained from the first party or first party device. This data may be indicative of a preferred behavioral expectation associated with the first party.
- the preferred behavioral expectation may be a specific or relative preference that the first party or the owner of the first party has over one or more other behavioral expectations.
- An example of a specific preference may include the first party indicating that that the first party likes dinner served promptly at a specific time.
- An example of a relative preference may include the first party indicating that the first party prefers a first thing or action over a second thing or action.
- a relative preference may indicate that the first party prefers pasta over rice, cleaning the table right after dinner instead of 20 minutes after dinner, etc.
- behavioral expectations may be added, deleted, confirmed, modified, etc., by the first party and/or by the owner of the first party.
- a robot first party may determine that the behavioral expectation is for the robot to make a spaghetti dinner on Thursday evenings.
- the owner of the robot first party i.e., the one eating the dinner
- the owner may determine that the owner does not want a spaghetti dinner every Thursday.
- the owner may indicate the owner's dislike of the robot first party's behavior.
- the owner may indicate a favorable approval of the time that the dinner was ready, but correct the robot first party's table place setting based on the number of people at dinner.
- the added, deleted, confirmed, modified, etc., behavioral expectations may be communicated via an oral command to the robot, by a user interface that may facilitate communication between the owner and the robot, by making a comment on the owner's or the robot first party's page, by adjusting the robot first party's page or profile, by adjusting the owner's page or profile, etc.
- comments, changes, or the like that are made to the owners page and/or profile may be shared with the owner's robot and/or a page associated with the robot, for example.
- the robot first party may adjust or otherwise change the robot first party's behavioral expectation to reflect the owner's preference.
- the server may determine the preferred behavioral expectation associated with the first party and identify at least one of (i) an action, (ii) a spoken word, (iii) a written word, and (iv) a vocalization, based on the preferred behavioral expectation.
- the identified action, spoken word, written word, and/or vocalization may occur in response to the determined or received behavioral expectation.
- the server may identify that the behavior expectation is for the robot first party to clean the table after dinner, to ask the robot first party's owner if an after dinner coffee or tea is desired, textually or pictorially display drink options, prepare a drink according to a selection received from the owner, and make a beeping sound when the drink is complete.
- the method 700 includes determine second party behavioral expectation.
- the determination of the second party's behavioral expectation may be based in whole or in part on the party data analyzed at block 710 . Similar to the analysis of block 710 , any number of machine learning taxonomies including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc., may be used when determining the second party behavioral expectation, for example.
- the frequency at which the second party behavioral expectation is determined or otherwise analyzed may vary based on a predetermined or random amount of time, the happening of an event, etc.
- the process of determining a second party behavioral expectation may be similar to the process of determining a first party behavioral expectation.
- the process may performed by a processor located at a server, cloud, second party device, etc., which may send a query to a behavioral expectation database.
- the behavioral expectation database may be the same or different database that stores behavioral data associated with the first party.
- an analysis may be performed of the behavioral expectation data associated with the second party and a determination may be made of the second party's behavioral expectation.
- the determined second party behavioral expectation may be sent to the sending device (e.g., the server, cloud, first party device, etc.)
- the server may analyze data associated with the second party.
- Data associated with the second party may include a video that the second party posted on the second party's page showing how a robot can make a pasta casserole and garlic bread.
- the data may also include a post (e.g., a message) on the first party's page suggesting the first party try the casserole.
- Secondary data associated with the second party may include comments from the robot first party, the owner of the robot first party, third parties, etc., indicating that the pasta casserole looks very good, asking for instructions (e.g., robot executable instructions) to make the recipe, suggesting changes to the recipe, etc.
- the server may use the data, determinations made from the analysis of the data, etc., to determine a behavioral expectation associated with the second party. For example, the server may determine that the behavioral expectation is for the second party to try new recipes and suggest recipes to the second party's symmetric connections. The server may also determine that the behavioral expectation is that a certain percentage of parties that try the second party's recipes like the recipe. However, the server may also determine that the behavioral expectation is not to use the second party's robot implementable instructions, but rather to use a set of robot implementable instructions posted on the second party's page by a third party, for example.
- the second party and/or the owner of the second party may add, delete, confirm, modify, etc., the behavioral expectation in a manner similar to that discussed above in reference to the first party.
- the method 700 includes compare first party and second party behavioral expectations.
- the server, cloud, social-network, first party device, second party device, etc. may compare one or more of the behavioral expectations associated with the first party to one or more of the behavioral expectations associated with the second party.
- the comparison may be used to rank or otherwise determine what behavioral expectation is most acceptable, frequently followed, liked, etc.
- the ranking may be performed based on the first party's and/or the second party's group, symmetric connections, asymmetric connections, social-network, etc.
- the ranking may be indicative of the behavioral expectation that is most popular or widely accepted within the group, symmetric connections, asymmetric connections, social-network, etc.
- the comparison of the behavioral expectations may be further utilized to cause the server, cloud, etc., to recommend a behavioral expectation to the first party.
- the server may compare the behavioral expectation of making garlic bread to accompany the spaghetti dinner with the first party's behavioral expectation of not preparing garlic bread and suggest and/or query the user about preparing the garlic bread.
- the method 700 includes modify behavioral expectation.
- the modification may be performed by a server or the first party device, for example.
- the modification may include modifying the behavioral expectation associated with the first party to match the behavioral expectation associated with the second party.
- the modification may include modifying the behavioral expectation to match a preferred behavioral expectation that may be received from the first party, the owner of the first party device, tec.
- the modification may include modifying the behavioral expectation associated with the second party or a third party based on the behavioral expectation of the first party, for example.
- the behavioral expectation of the social-network, groups within the social-network, symmetric connections, asymmetric connections, etc. may be used for purposes of modifying the behavioral expectation of one or more parties.
- the modification may be performed by a server, cloud, first party device, second party device, etc.
- the modification process may utilize the data analyzed at blocks 710 , 712 , and 714 . Furthermore, the modification process may utilize data obtained from comparing the first party's behavioral expectation to the second party's behavioral expectation.
- the server may notify the first party about the modification behavioral expectation before or after the modification is performed and may also allow the first party to respond to the modification (e.g., via the first party device). Thus, the server may notify the first party that garlic bread will be served with the spaghetti dinner. The first party may respond with feedback to affirm the modification, cancel the modification, enter a new or alternative modification, etc.
- the server may learn from the feedback and use the feedback when analyzing the first party's behavioral expectation, second party's behavioral expectation, etc.
- FIG. 8 is an example social-network page of a first party device, in accordance with embodiments described herein.
- the social-network page may represent a unique area that may be associated with one or more social-networks and may also be associated with the first party, for example.
- a page may include an area within the social-network or a social-network website.
- the social-network page 800 of FIG. 8 may be associated with a robot first party.
- the robot first party social-network page 800 may be an independent or stand-alone page that is not affiliated with or controlled by another party.
- the robot first party social-network page 800 may be a subpage of one or more owner pages or robot pages.
- the subpage may optionally inherit data, behavioral expectations, privacy settings, etc., from the owner or other robot.
- multiple parties may own and/or have control over the robot first party and, therefore, have control of all or part of the robot first party's social-network page 1000 .
- the social-network page 800 of FIG. 8 includes a variety of data including groups 802 , a news data feed 804 , second party posts 806 , first party posts 808 , instructions 810 , pictures 812 , video 814 , etc. All or part of the data in FIG. 8 may be logged or otherwise stored in a database (e.g., activity data database 506 ) and associated with the first party.
- the logged data may be maintained indefinitely, deleted after a predetermined time has elapsed, deleted upon the happening of an event, etc.
- Example events may include a certain amount of data logged, a predetermined number of posts, the first party terminating an account, etc.
- the log may be unique to the first party and/or shared amongst a plurality of parties (e.g., when the parties are associated with the same owner). All or part of the logs may be restricted based on access level, the social-network's privacy policy, user preference, etc.
- the robot first party may have a number of symmetric and/or asymmetric connections. Each connection may belong to one or more groups 802 , such as a family group, friend group, colleague group, etc.
- the groups 802 may be created by the robot first party, the second party, social-network, owner, other robots, etc.
- the robot first party may add new connections to or delete connections from one or more groups 802 .

If a connection does not exist, has timed out from inactivity, has had the connection terminated by the first party and/or the connected party, etc., then the robot first party may delete the connection. If the robot first party and the second party are connected, the server, cloud, etc., may analyze the robot first party's data, the second party's data, a third party's data, etc., to identify what group the second party should belong. The analyzed data may be used to determine a behavioral expectation as to what group the second party is associated. The determination may be compared to the group that the second party is currently associated with and, if needed, may be used to modify the group that the second party is associated with, for example.
- the first party may include the second party in the family group.
- the first party may analyze the second party's groups and determine that the second party includes the first party in the friends group, instead of the family group.
- the first party may also or alternatively compare other connections in the first party's family group to connections in the second party's family group to determine if the first party and the second party are family.
- the analysis may indicate that the owner of the first party is a family member of the second party; however, the robot first party is not itself a family member of the second party. Accordingly, the first party robot may determine if the behavioral expectation is to include the owner's family in the family group or to include the owner's family in the friends group.
- the robot first party may make this determination by analyzing groups associated with other connections (e.g., the third party) and determine the behavioral expectation of those connections.
- the server may compare the robot first party's behavioral expectation of including the owner's family in the robot first party's group to the second party's behavioral expectation of including the owner's family in a friends group. Based on this comparison, the server may modify the behavioral expectation of the robot first party such that the owner's family is associated with the friends group.
- This modification may include the robot first party, server, cloud, social-network, etc., deleting the second party from the family group and adding the second party to the friends group.
- this modification may include the robot first party modifying permissions of the group associated with the second party.
- the robot first party social-network page 800 may also include a news data feed 804 .
- the data in the news data feed 804 may be added by the robot first party, the owner of the robot first party, the second party, the social-network, etc.
- the type of data included in the news data feed 804 may be based on the behavioral expectations of the first party, connections of the first party (e.g., the second party), the social-network, etc.
- the social-network may indicate that the behavioral expectation is to include birthdays of connections in the news data feed 804 .
- an analysis of one or more of the connections may indicate that if there is a surprise birthday party then the behavioral expectation is to keep the surprise birthday party and/or anything surrounding the surprise birthday party secret from the owner of the first party.
- the server, robot first party, etc. may determine that the behavioral expectation is to notify the owner's friends of the upcoming party but not the owner's work colleagues.
- Robots and/or human users may add, delete, modify, etc. data associated with the robot first party's social-network page 800 .
- the data may include any number of actions and/or comments including second party posts 806 , first party posts 808 , instructions 810 , pictures 812 , video 814 , etc.
- the robot first party's owner Adam
- Adam may be celebrating a birthday
- the robot first party Robot X
- the robot first party may allow all of Adam's friends and/or the robot first party's friends to see the details of the birthday party.
- One of Adam's friends may have a robot, Robot Y, that notices that it is Adam's birthday, that Adam is a good friend of Robot Y's owner, and that Robot Y's owner has a behavioral expectation of baking a cake for birthday parties. Based on this data, Robot Y may post a comment 806 or suggestion that the robot first party bake a cake for Adam.
- the robot first party may receive the second party post 806 and determine if the behavioral expectation associated with the robot first party is for the robot first party to bake a cake for Adam's birthday. In making this determination, the robot first party may analyze and/or otherwise interpret data associated with the owner, the owner's actions, etc. The data may be based on information obtained via one or more social-networks, based on real-world objects and/or events, etc. Thus, for example, the robot first party may identify the real-world existence of chocolate sprinkles on Adam's table, a mixer on Adam's kitchen counter, etc. The robot first party may also analyze social-network data associated with the number and/or origin of “likes” the second party post 806 received from connections in the social-network. The robot and/or social-network may combine this social-network information with the real-world information to determine that the behavioral expectation is to bake a cake for Adam's birthday party.
- the robot first party may rank comments and/or instructions that are posted to the robot first party's social-network page 800 .
- the rank may be indicative of the level of acceptance associated with a behavioral expectation.

- the second party may be a human user, Betty, who notices that it is Adam's birthday and instructs the robot first party to sing happy birthday to Adam.
- the robot first party may execute the instruction 810 automatically or may analyze the instruction 810 to determine if the behavioral expectation is for the first party to execute the instruction 810 , for example.
- the analysis of the instruction 810 may be performed by determining a behavioral expectation associated with the instruction 810 .
- the analysis may be performed by querying log data associated with the robot first party, the robot first party's owner, connections in the first party's sociogram, connections in the owner's sociogram, etc., to determine if and to what extent the instruction 810 has been performed, if the owner liked or disliked the executed instruction 810 , issues that may have occurred during execution of the instruction 810 , etc.
- the server may analyze the robot first party's robot connections to determine if any of the connections have executed the instruction 810 of singing happy birthday and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the instruction 810 . This analysis may include how frequently the instruction was executed, the lag time in executing the instruction, when to execute the instruction, etc. Based on the analysis, the server may determine that the behavioral expectation is to execute the instruction 810 up to a certain number of times per day when the robot first party's owner is not otherwise predisposed (e.g., watching a movie, talking on the telephone, sleeping, etc.). Thereafter, the server may send instructions to the robot first party that may be executable by the robot to perform the action of singing happy birthday.
- the robot first party may post pictures 812 and/or video 814 of a completed or ongoing instruction.
- the pictures 812 and/or video 814 may be available in real time.
- the robot first party may have found a chocolate cake recipe and executed instructions for baking a chocolate cake.
- the robot first party may have created a video 814 while executing the instructions and posted the video 814 on the robot first party's social-network page 800 for others to view and comment on.
- Parties connected to the robot first party may view the video 814 in real time or upon completion of the executed instructions.
- parties viewing the video 814 in real time may add instructions and/or comments to the robot first party social-network page 800 , such as to add frosting to the chocolate cake.
- the robot first party may determine the behavioral expectation associated with the instructions and/or comments and act accordingly. Thus, for example, if it is determined that the behavioral expectation is to add frosting to cakes upon completion, then the server may search for instructions for making frosting and/or frosting a cake and send the instructions to the robot first party along with an indication that the frosting instructions should be executed after the cake is baked, but before adding the chocolate sprinkles.
- the robot first party may add pictures 812 to the first party during or upon completion of the instructions.
- the robot first party may add pictures of the final baked cake and/or pictures of the robot first party making the cake.
- the robot first party's connections may comment and/or add instructions based on the pictures, such as to add candles to the cake, for example.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example of a first party device executing instructions based on behavioral expectations, in accordance with embodiments described herein.

- a second party may view the posted actions and comment and/or instruct the robot first party 900 to take a responsive action, for example.
- the robot first party 900 may receive the instruction and analyze behavioral expectations associated with the action. Based on the analysis, the robot first party 900 may execute instructions for performing the action.
- the robot first party 900 may begin playing the chess game 904 against the robot first party's owner 902 .
- the server may analyze opening chess moves that have been performed in the past by the robot first party 900 , robot first party's owner 902 , a connection of the robot first party 900 or robot first party's owner 902 , etc.
- the server may also determine a behavioral expectation associated with the opening chess moves. This behavioral expectation may be to begin by moving a chess piece to a specific location.
- the robot first party's owner 902 may respond in turn by moving a chess piece.
- the server may analyze the robot first party's 900 move and the robot first party's owner's 902 move by comparing the sequence of moves to a log of prior moves performed in prior games between the robot first party 900 and robot first party's owner 902 , moves performed in games with a second party, etc. Based on the analysis, the server may determine that the next move or action the robot first party 900 should make is to move another or alternative chess piece. The server may send the robot first party 900 instructions to implement the move.
- the second party may view the actions between the robot first party 900 and the robot first party's owner 902 and instruct the robot first party 900 to make a move and/or refrain from making a move.
- the second party may optionally instruct the robot first party to make a different move.
- the server may cause the robot first party 900 to pause while the server analyzes the behavioral expectation associated with the proposed move.
- the server may reconsider the behavioral expectation in light of the second party instruction and/or a third party instruction, and if the behavioral expectation has changed, the server may modify the behavioral expectation associated with the robot first party 900 and instruct the robot first party 900 to perform the action that is associated with the modified behavioral expectation, for example.
- one or more weights may be associated with behavioral expectations.
- the weights may be indicative of an amount of influence the party has in determining the behavioral expectation associated with the first party and/or any other party. For example, when the second party suggesting that the robot first party 900 perform a move associated with a chess grandmaster, the server may associate a higher relative weight to the party's instruction than to an instruction received from a different party who may have a logged history of losing chess games.
- the robot first party 900 may restrict one or more parties from providing commands and/or otherwise controlling the robot first party 900 .
- the restriction may be based on the group that the party is associated with, the type of action the party is requesting, a log of multiple dislikes associated with the party's actions, a permission level associated with the party, etc.
