- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing an example of a process for providing content to users who are followers of entity feeds.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document.
- Selection of a content item is based, at least in part, on whether a user for whom the content item is requested is a follower of an entity feed (e.g., a user that has requested content from the entity feed to be presented in the user's social network interface). For example, a user that is a follower of an entity feed for a particular entity may enter a search query in a browser. In response to the query, eligible content items matching the query are selected or identified. From the eligible content items, selection can be made of a particular content item that is associated with a distribution parameter identifying the particular entity.
- a follower of an entity feed e.g., a user that has requested content from the entity feed to be presented in the user's social network interface.
- a user that is a follower of an entity feed for a particular entity may enter a search query in a browser.
- eligible content items matching the query are selected or identified. From the eligible content items, selection can be made of a particular content item that is associated with a distribution parameter identifying the
- a user can be considered to follow an entity, for example, based on the user interacting with a “follow” element on the entity's social web page in a social networking system or requesting that content from an entity feed provided by the entity be presented in the user's social network interface.
- a user that requests content from the entity feed be included in the user's social network feed can be considered to be a follower of the entity.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which content is distributed.
- the environment 100 includes a search system 110 that provides search services and a content management system 120 that can provide a content item in response to a content item request associated with the resource.
- the environment 100 includes a network 102 , e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them, that connects web sites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 109 , the search system 110 , the content management system 120 , and at least one social networking system 130 .
- the environment 100 may include many thousands of publishers, web sites 104 , content sponsors 109 and user devices 106 .
- a web site 104 can include one or more resources 108 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) or some other language that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements (e.g., scripts).
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web site 104 can be maintained by a publisher, e.g., a publishing entity that manages and/or owns the web property.
- a resource 108 is any data that can be provided by the web site 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources 108 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name a few examples.
- the resources 108 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds, and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computing devices, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the search system 110 can identify the resources 108 by crawling and indexing the resources 108 provided by the publishers of the web sites 104 . Data about the resources 108 can be indexed based on the resource 108 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 108 can be stored in a search index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 114 to the search system 110 .
- the search system 110 accesses the search index 112 to identify responsive resources that are predicted to be relevant to the search query 114 , for example, based on measures of relevance that have been computed for the responsive resources.
- the search system 110 selects the responsive resources, generates search results 116 that identify the responsive resources, and returns the search results 116 to the user devices 106 .
- a search result 116 is data generated by the search system 110 that references a responsive resource for a particular search query, and includes an active link (e.g., a URL) to the responsive resource.
- An example search result 116 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- User devices 106 receive the search results 116 and render the search results 116 , for example, in the form of one or more web pages, for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource 108 referenced by the link.
- the web site 104 hosting the resource 108 receives the request for the resource 108 from the user device 106 and provides the resource 108 to the requesting user device 106 .
- Search results 116 are selected to be provided to a user device 106 in response to a search query 114 based on result scores.
- Result scores are scores that represent a measure of relevance (e.g., a predicted relevance) of the resource 108 to a search query.
- a result score for a resource 108 can be computed based on an information retrieval (“IR”) score corresponding to the resource 108 and, optionally, a quality score of the resource 108 relative to other available resources.
- IR information retrieval
- a presentation order for the search results 116 can be selected based on the result scores.
- data that causes presentation of the search results 116 according to the presentation order can be provided to the user device 106 .
- the content management system 120 includes a content selection apparatus 122 that is configured to select content items to be provided with resources, such as publisher provided web pages or search results pages. Generally, the content items are selected in response to receipt of a request for a content item, which is referred to as a content item request.
- the content item request can include, for example, data identifying a network address of the resource with which the selected content item will be provided, data specifying a topic to which the resource is related, and in the context of a search results page, the search query in response to which the search results pages is being provided.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can also select content items based, at least in part, on contextual information related to a potential recipient of the content item. For example, assume that the user device from which a content item request is received is logged into a user account. In this example, data provided by the user through the user account can be considered contextual information that can be used for content item selection.
- the contextual information can include, for example, whether the user is a follower of an entity feed. For example, a user who is interested in an entity may elect to follow (or stop following) an entity feed associated with an entity. The election can occur, for example, when the user selects a follow control within the social networking system 130 .
- followers of an entity can also include secondary followers that have not explicitly requested to follow the entity, but are still considered followers based on their relationship with a primary follower of the entity.
- Secondary followers can include, for example, social network friends of the user who are primary follower of the entity or that may see information about the followed entity in the user's activity stream.
- the secondary followers are followers of the user, who are in turn followers of the entity.
- Other types of followers and follower relationships can exist.
- content sponsors and/or entities can optionally specify the different types of followers and associated different ways in which content is to be selected and distributed.
- the contextual information used by the content selection apparatus 122 to select content items includes information about followers of entity feeds.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can use followers data 126 to identify followers of an entity feed associated with a selected one of the entities 128 , and in turn, select one or more resources 108 based on that information.
- the resource(s) 108 can be provided, for example, to the user device 106 and distributed in a manner consistent with distribution parameters 129 .
- the distribution parameters 129 can specify that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of an entity feed associated with the content item.
- information in the distribution parameters 129 can be used to modify the creative (e.g., the content of the advertisement), the bid, or the format (e.g., replacing a text advertisement with a video advertisement when presented to a follower, or changing the advertisement's size or presentation).
- a content item provider can provide a baseline bid that is submitted to an auction when a particular distribution keyword is matched by data in a content item request.
- the content item can further specify that the bid is eligible to be increased over the baseline bid when it is determined that the user to whom the content item will be presented is a follower of a particular entity.
- the content item provider can specify entity specific content that can be used to populate portions of the content item when the content item request specifies that the user is a follower of a particular entity.
- entity specific content can be used to populate portions of the content item when the content item request specifies that the user is a follower of a particular entity.
- a sports equipment distributor may specify that information about a product manufactured by the particular entity be included in the content item when the user to whom the content item will be presented is a follower of that particular entity.
- selection of a content item can occur, for example, by first identifying at least one eligible content item (e.g., having a keyword that matches information included in a request for content).
- a given eligible content item can have associated with it distribution parameters 129 associated with distributing content based on whether the users to whom the content item will be distributed are followers of entity feeds.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can perform additional steps. Specifically, the content selection apparatus 122 can determine if the user associated with the request is a follower of an entity feed associated with the eligible content item. If so, then a bid associated with the eligible content item and based on follower information, for example, can be entered into an auction.
- That bid can join with bids of other eligible content items, and the auction can be performed based on the bids in order to select a content item to be provided in response to the request.
- bids can be adjusted based on the determination that a user associated with a request for content is a follower of an entity feed for an entity associated with an eligible content item.
- followers data 126 can be determined based on information from social networks (e.g., the social networking system 130 ) or other sources. For example, when a user elects to follow (or stop following) an entity feed associated with an entity, such as making an selection of a follow control within the social networking system 130 , the content management system 120 or some other system can update the followers data 126 to include data indicating that the user is a follower (or no longer a follower) of the entity feed. In some implementations, information in the followers data 126 can be updated or refreshed on an as-needed, e.g., to periodically update the followers data 126 with followers information from the social networking system 130 and/or other sources (e.g., web pages associated with entities).
- social networks e.g., the social networking system 130
- other sources e.g., web pages associated with entities
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a system 200 for selecting content items to be presented to users who are followers of entity feeds.
- the system 200 can select a content item 212 in response to a search query 208 received from a browser 202 .
- the content item 212 that is selected can be selected based in part on whether a user 201 associated with the search query 208 is a follower of an entity feed 210 , for example, that is related to the search query 208 . For example, if the search query 208 is “shoes,” and the user 201 is identified as a follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X shoes, then the content item 212 that is selected by the content management system 120 can be an advertisement for Brand X Shoes.
- the content management system 120 can receive the search query 208 from the browser 202 , e.g., as a request for content to fill a content block 204 or a content item slot 206 .
- a user identifier associated with the user 201 can accompany the search query 208 , such as a user identifier that is maintained as part of a login service or identified in some other way (e.g., in a cookie).
- the follower determination apparatus 124 can determine if the user 201 is a follower of any entity feeds, such as by looking up follower information for the user in the followers data 126 .
- the user 201 can be identified as a follower of the entity feed 210 for a Brand X Shoes entity.
- the Brand X Shoes entity can be identified and/or distinguished from several other entities that the user 201 may follow, for example, based on the keyword “shoes” in the search query 208 .
- the user may follow several entity feeds, including the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes.
- the follower determination apparatus 124 can specifically identify the user as a follower of Brand X Shoes entity feed among others because, for example, it may be the only entity feed related to shoes.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can select from among eligible content items having distribution parameters that condition the distribution of a content item on the distribution parameters being met.
- the distribution parameters can specify that content items are to be provided to users who are followers of entity feeds associated with a request for content (e.g., matching the search query 208 having keywords related to “shoes”).
- an eligible content item can have associated distribution parameters 129 (e.g., as specified by a content sponsor 109 ) for selecting content items based on the determination that users that will receive the content items are followers of entity feeds.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can select an advertisement for Brand X Shoes, e.g., from among other eligible content items.
- the selection can be based, for example, on the user 201 being a follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes.
- the content management system 120 can provide the content item 212 (e.g., the Brand X Shoes advertisement) in response to the search query 208 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing an example process 300 for providing content to users who are followers of entity feeds.
- the process 300 is a process by which a content item is selected for a user who is a follower of an entity feed, e.g., the entity feed 210 associated with the Brand X Shoes entity. The selection is made because the user follows the entity feed 210 , and distribution parameters associated with the content item specify that the content item is to be provided to such followers.
- the content item 212 can be provided in response to the search query 208 entered by the user 201 who follows the entity feed 210 in a social network, e.g., a social network page related to Brand X Shoes.
- the process 300 can be implemented by one or more data processing apparatus from the environment 100 , such as the content management system 120 , the content selection apparatus 122 , and/or the follower determination apparatus 124 .
- the process 300 can be implemented as instructions stored on computer readable device, and execution of the instructions by data processing apparatus can cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of the process 300 .
- the process 300 includes steps for receiving and using content item provider distribution parameters for providing content items to followers of entities. These steps can occur, for example, before a request for content is received in step 302 .
- distribution parameters can be received from a content item provider that specify that the content item is eligible for distribution to users that submit a search query matching a distribution keyword and are determined to be followers of the entity feed.
- a bid specifying a maximum amount that the content item provider is willing pay for distribution of the content item based on the distribution parameters being met can also be received.
- the distribution parameters can include instructions, for example, for increasing bids in an auction for eligible content items when the user associated with a corresponding request for content is a follower of an entity feed.
- the distribution parameters can also specify entity specific content that will be used to populate the content item when the user is determined to be a follower of a particular entity.
- the content sponsor 109 or other content item provider associated with Brand X Shoes can define or otherwise submit distribution parameters 129 that specify that advertisements in the campaign are to be provided to users who are followers of Brand X Shoes (e.g., in one or more entity feeds) when a the distribution keyword “shoes” is part of a content item request.
- the content sponsor 109 can provide a maximum bid and/or other bidding parameters for selection of their content item according to the distribution parameters.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can determine that the search query 208 includes “shoes” that matches the distribution keyword “shoes” and use that information in selecting the Brand X Shoes advertisement.
- a search query associated with a user is received ( 302 ).
- the content management system 120 can receive the search query 208 (e.g., “shoes”) entered in the browser 202 on the user device 106 associated with the user 201 .
- the search query 208 may or may not explicitly reference an entity, such as a particular brand or manufacturer of shoes.
- the search query 208 can be a generic query that references shoes.
- the follower determination apparatus 124 can determine that the user 201 is a follower of Brand X Shoes.
- the user 201 may also be a follower of the entity feed 210 , e.g., in an activity stream or other feed, blog or resource provided by or associated with the Brand X Shoes entity that can be followed by users in a social network (e.g., the social networking system 130 ).
- the determination that the user is a follower of a particular entity can be made, for example, using information available from the social networking system 130 .
- information stored in the followers data 126 can identify the user 201 as a follower of Brand X Shoes.
- the information identifying the user 201 as a follower of Brand X Shoes can be included in the followers data 126 , for example, based on the user having performed some action to begin following the shoe brand's social network page.
- the user 201 may have interacted with a follow control or some other mechanism that enables the user to become a follower of Brand X Shoes.
- determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a primary follower of the entity feed. The determination is based, for example, on information indicating that a request was made to receive the entity feed.
- the first user's request to receive the entity feed can be independent of the first entity requesting to receive the first user's feed.
- the user 201 may have decided, within a social network (e.g., the social networking system 130 ), to follow the social network page related to Brand X Shoes.
- information associated with Brand X Shoes that appears in the Brand X Shoes entity feed e.g., activity stream
- determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a secondary follower of the entity feed. This determination can be based, for example, on information that the secondary follower follows a primary follower. As an example, consider the case in which the user 201 is not a primary follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. However, the user 201 can be considered to be a secondary follower if a social network friend of the user 201 is a follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. In this example, the follower determination apparatus 124 can determine that the user 201 is a follower of the Brand X Shoes entity feed by way of being a secondary or indirect follower.
- content sponsors 109 can elect to include distribution parameters 129 for providing their content items to secondary followers, e.g., users who may happen to see a feed of an entity in a friend's activity stream.
- a content item is selected based on the search query and the determination that the first user is a follower of the first entity.
- the content item that is selected can have distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that have submitted the search query ( 306 ).
- the content selection apparatus 122 can select a shoe advertisement related to Brand X Shoes.
- the advertisement may be part of an advertising campaign that includes distribution parameters 129 specifying that the advertisement is to be provided to users who are followers of the Brand X Shoes social network page, e.g., including providing the advertisement when a follower of Brand X Shoes enters a query for shoes and/or in other situations.
- the selection of the shoe advertisement can be made in part because the advertisement is eligible for selection based on it being associated with the keyword “shoes,” e.g., by matching the “shoes” term in the search query 208 , as described above.
- the selection is also based, for example, on the user 201 being a follower of Brand X Shoes, such as on a social network or by some other way of following the product or manufacturer.
- the selection of the Brand X Shoes advertisement can be made instead of other eligible content items, including other shoe-related advertisement for which there may be no associated entity feeds followed by the user 201 .
- a portion of the eligible content items can be filtered out, e.g., advertisements associated with entities that are direct competitors of, e.g., the Brand X Shoes.
- the content selection apparatus 122 can avoid selecting content for competing entities that may have products and/or services in the same category or sub-category as Brand X Shoes.
- auctions can include negative bidding, e.g., to avoid or lower a bid of a competing eligible content item, e.g., by bidding lower for an eligible content item for a cheap shoe store using information about the user 201 , the search query 208 , and/or the Brand X Shoes entity.
- the process 300 further includes steps for providing content based on correlations between first and second entities. Specifically, a determination can be made that the first entity and a second entity are correlated entities based on similarities between online activity related to both of the first and the second entity. For example, the content management system 120 can make a determination that a high percentage of followers of Brand X Shoes are also followers of Brand Y Running Shorts. This correlation can be determined, for example, based on activity exhibited by the user 201 and/or other users in the social networking system 130 who may have a pattern of being associated with, following, and/or interacting with both entities in some way.
- a content item for the second entity can be provided based on the user being a follower of the entity feed for the first entity.
- the content management system 120 can provide a Brand Y Running Shorts advertisement in addition to (or instead of) a Brand X Shoes advertisement based on the determination that these two entity are correlated entities.
- determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities includes determining that a search page co-occurrence rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold search page co-occurrence rate, where the search page co-occurrence rate is based on a number of search result pages in which both the first entity and the second entity are referenced relative to a total number of search results pages in which at least one of the first entity or the second entity are referenced.
- the content management system 120 can determine that the Brand X Shoes entity and the Brand Y Running Shorts entity are correlated based on search page co-occurrence rates.
- the correlation between the entities can be determined to exist if both entities occur (e.g., are referenced) a minimum percentage of instances when a search results page references at least one or the other entity.
- determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities includes determining that a user co-selection rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold user co-selection rate, where the user co-selection rate is based on a number of users that have interacted with content items provided by each of the first entity and the second entity relative to a total number of users that have interacted with a content item provided by one of the first entity or the second entity.
- the content management system 120 can determine that the Brand X Shoes entity and the Brand Y Running Shorts entity are correlated based on user co-selection rates.
- the correlation can be determined if content items for both entities receive a user selection rate including a minimum percentage of instances relative to user selection of content items for at least one or the other entity.
- the selected content item is provided to a user device associated with the first user ( 308 ).
- the content management system 120 can provide the content item 212 , such as an advertisement for Brand X Shoes.
- the content item that is provided to the user device can be customized in some way based on follower information.
- the content item can be annotated to insert information associated with the entity, e.g., including the name of the entity, products and/or services associated with the entity, links to web pages or other resources associated with the entity, or other information.

Abstract
Methods, systems and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium for selecting keywords for resources are disclosed. In one aspect, a search query is received associated with a first user. A determination is made that the first user is a follower of an entity feed that is provided by a first entity and that is provided through a social network. A content item is selected having distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that submit the search query. The selected content item is provided for the first user.
Description
This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/894,645, filed May 15, 2013, which is incorporated by reference.
This specification relates to data processing and content distribution.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content items to be provided with the resources and presented in content item slots. For example, a web page can include advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented. These advertisements slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes receiving a search query associated with a first user. The method further includes determining, by the one or more data processing apparatus, that the first user is a follower of an entity feed that is provided by a first entity and that is provided through a social network. The method further includes selecting, by the one or more data processing apparatus, a content item having distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that submit the search query. The method further includes providing, by the one or more data processing apparatus, the selected content item to a user device associated with the first user.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a primary follower of the entity feed based on information indicating that a request was made to receive the entity feed, and the first user's request to receive the entity feed can be independent of the first entity requesting to receive the first user's feed. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a secondary follower of the entity feed based on information that the secondary follower follows a primary follower of the entity feed. The method can further include receiving, from a content item provider, distribution parameters specifying that the content item is eligible for distribution to users that submit a search query matching a distribution keyword and are followers of the entity feed; receiving a bid specifying a maximum amount that the content item provider will pay for distribution of the content item based on the distribution parameters being met; and determining that the received search query matches the distribution keyword. The method can further include determining that the first entity and a second entity are correlated entities based on similarities between online activity related to both of the first and the second entity, and providing, in response to determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities, a content item for the second entity based on the user being a follower of the entity feed for the first entity. Determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities can include determining that a search page co-occurrence rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold search page co-occurrence rate, where the search page co-occurrence rate is based on a number of search result pages in which both the first entity and the second entity are referenced relative to a total number of search results pages in which at least one of the first entity or the second entity are referenced. Determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities can include determining that a user co-selection rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold user co-selection rate, where the user co-selection rate is based on a number of users that have interacted with content items provided by each of the first entity and the second entity relative to a total number of users that have interacted with a content item provided by one of the first entity or the second entity.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more data processing apparatus, cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations including receiving a search query associated with a first user; determining that the first user is a follower of an entity feed that is provided by a first entity and that is provided through a social network; selecting a content item having distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that submit the search query; and providing the selected content item to a user device associated with the first user.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a primary follower of the entity feed based on information indicating that a request was made to receive the entity feed, and the first user's request to receive the entity feed can be independent of the first entity requesting to receive the first user's feed. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a secondary follower of the entity feed based on information that the secondary follower follows a primary follower of the entity feed. The instructions can further include instructions for receiving, from a content item provider, distribution parameters specifying that the content item is eligible for distribution to users that submit a search query matching a distribution keyword and are followers of the entity feed; receiving a bid specifying a maximum amount that the content item provider will pay for distribution of the content item based on the distribution parameters being met; and determining that the received search query matches the distribution keyword. The instructions can further include instructions for determining that the first entity and a second entity are correlated entities based on similarities between online activity related to both of the first and the second entity, and providing, in response to determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities, a content item for the second entity based on the user being a follower of the entity feed for the first entity. Determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities can include determining that a search page co-occurrence rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold search page co-occurrence rate, where the search page co-occurrence rate is based on a number of search result pages in which both the first entity and the second entity are referenced relative to a total number of search results pages in which at least one of the first entity or the second entity are referenced. Determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities can include determining that a user co-selection rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold user co-selection rate, where the user co-selection rate is based on a number of users that have interacted with content items provided by each of the first entity and the second entity relative to a total number of users that have interacted with a content item provided by one of the first entity or the second entity.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system for providing content. The system includes: a first data store storing entity definitions for a plurality of entities; a second data store storing follower information for users who follow entity feeds associated with the plurality of entities; a third data store storing distribution parameters for eligible content items, the distribution parameters identified by at least content sponsors and specifying conditions for selecting content items from among the eligible content items for presentation to users that follow the entity feeds; and data processing apparatus configured to interact with the data stores, the data processing apparatus being further configured to perform operations. The operations include receiving a search query associated with a first user; determining, by the one or more data processing apparatus and using the second data store, that the first user is a follower of an entity feed that is provided by a first entity and that is provided through a social network; selecting, by the one or more data processing apparatus and using information in the third data store, a content item having distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that submit the search query; providing, by the one or more data processing apparatus, the selected content item to a user device associated with the first user.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a primary follower of the entity feed based on information indicating that a request was made to receive the entity feed, and the first user's request to receive the entity feed can be independent of the first entity requesting to receive the first user's feed. Determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a secondary follower of the entity feed based on information that the secondary follower follows a primary follower of the entity feed. The operations can further include receiving, from a content item provider, distribution parameters specifying that the content item is eligible for distribution to users that submit a search query matching a distribution keyword and are followers of the entity feed; receiving a bid specifying a maximum amount that the content item provider will pay for distribution of the content item based on the distribution parameters being met; and determining that the received search query matches the distribution keyword. The operations can further include determining that the first entity and a second entity are correlated entities based on similarities between online activity related to both of the first and the second entity, and providing, in response to determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities, a content item for the second entity based on the user being a follower of the entity feed for the first entity. Determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities can include determining that the search page co-occurrence rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold search page co-occurrence rate, where the search page co-occurrence rate is based on a number of search result pages in which both the first entity and the second entity are referenced relative to a total number of search results pages in which at least one of the first entity or the second entity are referenced.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Content sponsors and/or entities can specify to have their content presented to and/or selected based on users who are followers of entity feeds associated with entities.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
This document describes devices, systems, and methods for distributing content items. Selection of a content item is based, at least in part, on whether a user for whom the content item is requested is a follower of an entity feed (e.g., a user that has requested content from the entity feed to be presented in the user's social network interface). For example, a user that is a follower of an entity feed for a particular entity may enter a search query in a browser. In response to the query, eligible content items matching the query are selected or identified. From the eligible content items, selection can be made of a particular content item that is associated with a distribution parameter identifying the particular entity. A user can be considered to follow an entity, for example, based on the user interacting with a “follow” element on the entity's social web page in a social networking system or requesting that content from an entity feed provided by the entity be presented in the user's social network interface. For example, a user that requests content from the entity feed be included in the user's social network feed can be considered to be a follower of the entity.
For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
A web site 104 can include one or more resources 108 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) or some other language that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements (e.g., scripts). Each web site 104 can be maintained by a publisher, e.g., a publishing entity that manages and/or owns the web property.
A resource 108 is any data that can be provided by the web site 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources 108 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name a few examples. The resources 108 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds, and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., scripts).
A user device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computing devices, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
To facilitate searching of resources 108, the search system 110 can identify the resources 108 by crawling and indexing the resources 108 provided by the publishers of the web sites 104. Data about the resources 108 can be indexed based on the resource 108 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 108 can be stored in a search index 112.
The user devices 106 submit search queries 114 to the search system 110. In response, the search system 110 accesses the search index 112 to identify responsive resources that are predicted to be relevant to the search query 114, for example, based on measures of relevance that have been computed for the responsive resources. The search system 110 selects the responsive resources, generates search results 116 that identify the responsive resources, and returns the search results 116 to the user devices 106. A search result 116 is data generated by the search system 110 that references a responsive resource for a particular search query, and includes an active link (e.g., a URL) to the responsive resource. An example search result 116 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
Search results 116 are selected to be provided to a user device 106 in response to a search query 114 based on result scores. Result scores are scores that represent a measure of relevance (e.g., a predicted relevance) of the resource 108 to a search query. For example, a result score for a resource 108 can be computed based on an information retrieval (“IR”) score corresponding to the resource 108 and, optionally, a quality score of the resource 108 relative to other available resources. A presentation order for the search results 116 can be selected based on the result scores. In turn, data that causes presentation of the search results 116 according to the presentation order can be provided to the user device 106.
The content management system 120 includes a content selection apparatus 122 that is configured to select content items to be provided with resources, such as publisher provided web pages or search results pages. Generally, the content items are selected in response to receipt of a request for a content item, which is referred to as a content item request. The content item request can include, for example, data identifying a network address of the resource with which the selected content item will be provided, data specifying a topic to which the resource is related, and in the context of a search results page, the search query in response to which the search results pages is being provided.
The content selection apparatus 122 can also select content items based, at least in part, on contextual information related to a potential recipient of the content item. For example, assume that the user device from which a content item request is received is logged into a user account. In this example, data provided by the user through the user account can be considered contextual information that can be used for content item selection. The contextual information can include, for example, whether the user is a follower of an entity feed. For example, a user who is interested in an entity may elect to follow (or stop following) an entity feed associated with an entity. The election can occur, for example, when the user selects a follow control within the social networking system 130. This can occur, for example, when the user visits a social web page associated with the entity and interacts with (e.g., clicks) the follow control. Users that explicitly request to follow the entity (e.g., by interacting with the follow control) are considered to be primary followers of the entity.
In some implementations, followers of an entity can also include secondary followers that have not explicitly requested to follow the entity, but are still considered followers based on their relationship with a primary follower of the entity. Secondary followers can include, for example, social network friends of the user who are primary follower of the entity or that may see information about the followed entity in the user's activity stream. In this example, the secondary followers are followers of the user, who are in turn followers of the entity. Other types of followers and follower relationships can exist. Further, content sponsors and/or entities can optionally specify the different types of followers and associated different ways in which content is to be selected and distributed.
In some implementations, the contextual information used by the content selection apparatus 122 to select content items includes information about followers of entity feeds. For example, as described in more detail below, the content selection apparatus 122 can use followers data 126 to identify followers of an entity feed associated with a selected one of the entities 128, and in turn, select one or more resources 108 based on that information. The resource(s) 108 can be provided, for example, to the user device 106 and distributed in a manner consistent with distribution parameters 129. For example, the distribution parameters 129 can specify that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of an entity feed associated with the content item.
In some implementations, information in the distribution parameters 129 can be used to modify the creative (e.g., the content of the advertisement), the bid, or the format (e.g., replacing a text advertisement with a video advertisement when presented to a follower, or changing the advertisement's size or presentation). For example, a content item provider can provide a baseline bid that is submitted to an auction when a particular distribution keyword is matched by data in a content item request. The content item can further specify that the bid is eligible to be increased over the baseline bid when it is determined that the user to whom the content item will be presented is a follower of a particular entity.
Additionally, or alternatively, the content item provider can specify entity specific content that can be used to populate portions of the content item when the content item request specifies that the user is a follower of a particular entity. For example, a sports equipment distributor may specify that information about a product manufactured by the particular entity be included in the content item when the user to whom the content item will be presented is a follower of that particular entity.
In a detailed example, selection of a content item can occur, for example, by first identifying at least one eligible content item (e.g., having a keyword that matches information included in a request for content). A given eligible content item can have associated with it distribution parameters 129 associated with distributing content based on whether the users to whom the content item will be distributed are followers of entity feeds. In this example, the content selection apparatus 122 can perform additional steps. Specifically, the content selection apparatus 122 can determine if the user associated with the request is a follower of an entity feed associated with the eligible content item. If so, then a bid associated with the eligible content item and based on follower information, for example, can be entered into an auction. That bid can join with bids of other eligible content items, and the auction can be performed based on the bids in order to select a content item to be provided in response to the request. In some implementations, bids can be adjusted based on the determination that a user associated with a request for content is a follower of an entity feed for an entity associated with an eligible content item.
In some implementations, followers data 126 can be determined based on information from social networks (e.g., the social networking system 130) or other sources. For example, when a user elects to follow (or stop following) an entity feed associated with an entity, such as making an selection of a follow control within the social networking system 130, the content management system 120 or some other system can update the followers data 126 to include data indicating that the user is a follower (or no longer a follower) of the entity feed. In some implementations, information in the followers data 126 can be updated or refreshed on an as-needed, e.g., to periodically update the followers data 126 with followers information from the social networking system 130 and/or other sources (e.g., web pages associated with entities).
In a detailed example, the content management system 120, for example, can receive the search query 208 from the browser 202, e.g., as a request for content to fill a content block 204 or a content item slot 206. In some implementations, a user identifier associated with the user 201 can accompany the search query 208, such as a user identifier that is maintained as part of a login service or identified in some other way (e.g., in a cookie). Using the user identifier, the follower determination apparatus 124, for example, can determine if the user 201 is a follower of any entity feeds, such as by looking up follower information for the user in the followers data 126. In this example, the user 201 can be identified as a follower of the entity feed 210 for a Brand X Shoes entity. The Brand X Shoes entity can be identified and/or distinguished from several other entities that the user 201 may follow, for example, based on the keyword “shoes” in the search query 208. In this example, the user may follow several entity feeds, including the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. For purposes of content item selection, the follower determination apparatus 124, for example, can specifically identify the user as a follower of Brand X Shoes entity feed among others because, for example, it may be the only entity feed related to shoes.
The content selection apparatus 122, for example, can select from among eligible content items having distribution parameters that condition the distribution of a content item on the distribution parameters being met. For example, the distribution parameters can specify that content items are to be provided to users who are followers of entity feeds associated with a request for content (e.g., matching the search query 208 having keywords related to “shoes”). For example, an eligible content item can have associated distribution parameters 129 (e.g., as specified by a content sponsor 109) for selecting content items based on the determination that users that will receive the content items are followers of entity feeds. In this example, the content selection apparatus 122 can select an advertisement for Brand X Shoes, e.g., from among other eligible content items. The selection can be based, for example, on the user 201 being a follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. Upon the identification of a content item by the content selection apparatus 122, the content management system 120 can provide the content item 212 (e.g., the Brand X Shoes advertisement) in response to the search query 208.
The process 300 can be implemented by one or more data processing apparatus from the environment 100, such as the content management system 120, the content selection apparatus 122, and/or the follower determination apparatus 124. The process 300 can be implemented as instructions stored on computer readable device, and execution of the instructions by data processing apparatus can cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of the process 300.
In some implementations, the process 300 includes steps for receiving and using content item provider distribution parameters for providing content items to followers of entities. These steps can occur, for example, before a request for content is received in step 302. For example, distribution parameters can be received from a content item provider that specify that the content item is eligible for distribution to users that submit a search query matching a distribution keyword and are determined to be followers of the entity feed. A bid specifying a maximum amount that the content item provider is willing pay for distribution of the content item based on the distribution parameters being met can also be received. In some implementations, the distribution parameters can include instructions, for example, for increasing bids in an auction for eligible content items when the user associated with a corresponding request for content is a follower of an entity feed. The distribution parameters can also specify entity specific content that will be used to populate the content item when the user is determined to be a follower of a particular entity.
For example, the content sponsor 109 or other content item provider associated with Brand X Shoes can define or otherwise submit distribution parameters 129 that specify that advertisements in the campaign are to be provided to users who are followers of Brand X Shoes (e.g., in one or more entity feeds) when a the distribution keyword “shoes” is part of a content item request. As part of the campaign definition process, for example, the content sponsor 109 can provide a maximum bid and/or other bidding parameters for selection of their content item according to the distribution parameters. After the search query 208 is received by the content management system 120, for example, the content selection apparatus 122 can determine that the search query 208 includes “shoes” that matches the distribution keyword “shoes” and use that information in selecting the Brand X Shoes advertisement.
A search query associated with a user is received (302). For example, the content management system 120 can receive the search query 208 (e.g., “shoes”) entered in the browser 202 on the user device 106 associated with the user 201. The search query 208 may or may not explicitly reference an entity, such as a particular brand or manufacturer of shoes. In this example, the search query 208 can be a generic query that references shoes.
A determination is made that the first user is a follower of an entity feed that is provided by a first entity and that is provided through a social network (304). For example, the follower determination apparatus 124 can determine that the user 201 is a follower of Brand X Shoes. The user 201 may also be a follower of the entity feed 210, e.g., in an activity stream or other feed, blog or resource provided by or associated with the Brand X Shoes entity that can be followed by users in a social network (e.g., the social networking system 130). The determination that the user is a follower of a particular entity can be made, for example, using information available from the social networking system 130. For example, information stored in the followers data 126 can identify the user 201 as a follower of Brand X Shoes. The information identifying the user 201 as a follower of Brand X Shoes can be included in the followers data 126, for example, based on the user having performed some action to begin following the shoe brand's social network page. For example, the user 201 may have interacted with a follow control or some other mechanism that enables the user to become a follower of Brand X Shoes.
In some implementations, determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a primary follower of the entity feed. The determination is based, for example, on information indicating that a request was made to receive the entity feed. In this example, the first user's request to receive the entity feed can be independent of the first entity requesting to receive the first user's feed. As an example, the user 201 may have decided, within a social network (e.g., the social networking system 130), to follow the social network page related to Brand X Shoes. As a result, information associated with Brand X Shoes that appears in the Brand X Shoes entity feed (e.g., activity stream) can be enabled to appear in the feed of the user 201. The fact that the user 201 follows Brand X Shoes can occur even though, for example, Brand X Shoes has not chosen to follow the feed of the user 201. As such, a one-way following can be sufficient in determining that the user 201 is a follower of the entity, but two-way following examples are also possible.
In some implementations, determining that the first user is a follower of the entity feed can include determining that the first user is a secondary follower of the entity feed. This determination can be based, for example, on information that the secondary follower follows a primary follower. As an example, consider the case in which the user 201 is not a primary follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. However, the user 201 can be considered to be a secondary follower if a social network friend of the user 201 is a follower of the entity feed 210 for Brand X Shoes. In this example, the follower determination apparatus 124 can determine that the user 201 is a follower of the Brand X Shoes entity feed by way of being a secondary or indirect follower. Specifically, while the user 201 is not a direct follower of the Brand X Shoes entity feed, the user 201 has a friend in the social network who is a primary (e.g., direct) follower of the Brand X Shoes entity feed. In some implementations, regarding this example, content sponsors 109 can elect to include distribution parameters 129 for providing their content items to secondary followers, e.g., users who may happen to see a feed of an entity in a friend's activity stream.
A content item is selected based on the search query and the determination that the first user is a follower of the first entity. The content item that is selected can have distribution parameters specifying that the content item is to be provided to users that are followers of the entity feed and that have submitted the search query (306). For example, the content selection apparatus 122 can select a shoe advertisement related to Brand X Shoes. The advertisement may be part of an advertising campaign that includes distribution parameters 129 specifying that the advertisement is to be provided to users who are followers of the Brand X Shoes social network page, e.g., including providing the advertisement when a follower of Brand X Shoes enters a query for shoes and/or in other situations. The selection of the shoe advertisement can be made in part because the advertisement is eligible for selection based on it being associated with the keyword “shoes,” e.g., by matching the “shoes” term in the search query 208, as described above. The selection is also based, for example, on the user 201 being a follower of Brand X Shoes, such as on a social network or by some other way of following the product or manufacturer. The selection of the Brand X Shoes advertisement can be made instead of other eligible content items, including other shoe-related advertisement for which there may be no associated entity feeds followed by the user 201.
Other factors in addition to follower information can be used in selecting content and bids for auctions. In some implementations, a portion of the eligible content items can be filtered out, e.g., advertisements associated with entities that are direct competitors of, e.g., the Brand X Shoes. For example, the content selection apparatus 122 can avoid selecting content for competing entities that may have products and/or services in the same category or sub-category as Brand X Shoes. In some implementations, auctions can include negative bidding, e.g., to avoid or lower a bid of a competing eligible content item, e.g., by bidding lower for an eligible content item for a cheap shoe store using information about the user 201, the search query 208, and/or the Brand X Shoes entity.
In some implementations, the process 300 further includes steps for providing content based on correlations between first and second entities. Specifically, a determination can be made that the first entity and a second entity are correlated entities based on similarities between online activity related to both of the first and the second entity. For example, the content management system 120 can make a determination that a high percentage of followers of Brand X Shoes are also followers of Brand Y Running Shorts. This correlation can be determined, for example, based on activity exhibited by the user 201 and/or other users in the social networking system 130 who may have a pattern of being associated with, following, and/or interacting with both entities in some way.
In response to determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities, a content item for the second entity can be provided based on the user being a follower of the entity feed for the first entity. Continuing with the example above, the content management system 120 can provide a Brand Y Running Shorts advertisement in addition to (or instead of) a Brand X Shoes advertisement based on the determination that these two entity are correlated entities.
In some implementations, determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities includes determining that a search page co-occurrence rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold search page co-occurrence rate, where the search page co-occurrence rate is based on a number of search result pages in which both the first entity and the second entity are referenced relative to a total number of search results pages in which at least one of the first entity or the second entity are referenced. For example, the content management system 120 can determine that the Brand X Shoes entity and the Brand Y Running Shorts entity are correlated based on search page co-occurrence rates. Specifically, the correlation between the entities can be determined to exist if both entities occur (e.g., are referenced) a minimum percentage of instances when a search results page references at least one or the other entity.
In some implementations, determining that the first entity and the second entity are correlated entities includes determining that a user co-selection rate for the first entity and the second entity meets a threshold user co-selection rate, where the user co-selection rate is based on a number of users that have interacted with content items provided by each of the first entity and the second entity relative to a total number of users that have interacted with a content item provided by one of the first entity or the second entity. For example, the content management system 120 can determine that the Brand X Shoes entity and the Brand Y Running Shorts entity are correlated based on user co-selection rates. Specifically, the correlation can be determined if content items for both entities receive a user selection rate including a minimum percentage of instances relative to user selection of content items for at least one or the other entity.
The selected content item is provided to a user device associated with the first user (308). For example, the content management system 120 can provide the content item 212, such as an advertisement for Brand X Shoes. In some implementations, the content item that is provided to the user device can be customized in some way based on follower information. For example, the content item can be annotated to insert information associated with the entity, e.g., including the name of the entity, products and/or services associated with the entity, links to web pages or other resources associated with the entity, or other information.
