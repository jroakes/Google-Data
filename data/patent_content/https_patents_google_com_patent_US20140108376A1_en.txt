Definitions
- This specification relates to associating resources with topics.
- the rise of the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of resources, e.g., video files, audio files, web pages for particular subjects, or news articles.
- Resources can be selected by a search engine in response to a user query.
- search engine is the GoogleTM search engine provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., U.S.A.
- resources can be grouped in categories based on some feature of the resource. For example, if a website is related to football, it may be associated with a sports category. Categorizing the websites individually though may be time consuming and the websites may be associated with more than one category.
- a first aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of selecting a first resource associated with a topic, the first resource accessed in a user session; selecting a second resource accessed during the user session; determining whether the second resource is associated with the topic; and increasing a relevance score of the second resource and the topic based on determining that the second resource is not associated with the topic.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of selecting a first resource associated with a topic, the first resource accessed during a user session; selecting second resources accessed during the user session; generating a relevance score for each of the second resources based on an external classifier associated with the respective second resource; calculating an average of the relevance scores of the candidate resources; assigning to the first resource the average of the relevance scores as a prediction score; for each second resource, calculating an average of the prediction score of the first resource; assigning to each second resource the average of the prediction score of the first resource as an average prediction score; determining whether the average prediction score of each second resource satisfies a threshold; and associating the respective second resource with the topic based on the determining.
- Relevance of a resource to a topic can be determined and increased by comparing the resource to other resources that are already known to be associated with the topic.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an example aggregation of new websites corresponding to a user's behavior.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing an example online environment.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing an example aggregation of websites corresponding to a user's behavior.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for associating a resource with a topic.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process for selecting resources.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart of another example process for selecting resources.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart of an example process for associating resources with topics.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram 100 showing an example aggregation of new resources (e.g., websites) and a set of known resources 102 .
- the term “resource” is used generically to describe video files, audio files, web pages and/or their corresponding websites, news articles, or any other electronic documents that are available on a network (e.g., the Internet). For convenience, a system that is configured to perform the aggregation is described in the context of FIG. 1 .
- the search engine uses the search query to select one or more resources located on the network (e.g., the Internet).
- resources located on the network e.g., the Internet
- a user can browse the Internet to identify one or more resources without first using a search engine.
- the system may create a user session that the system uses to group data regarding the user's interaction with the resources, search queries provided by the user, or other usage information regarding one or more resources on the network.
- the data grouped with a user session may include a history of resources accessed, entered search queries, or other historical data associated with the user's actions when using a web browser application.
- the user session can include data gathered during a search session where a user submits queries and receives in return one or more resources in response to the search queries.
- the user session can also include data gathered during a toolbar session where a toolbar plug-in can be installed on the user's browser application and the resources accessed by the user can be gathered.
- the user session can also be associated with a time period.
- the data grouped with a toolbar session can include a history of resources accessed and other actions taken by the user during a five minute interval of time or during an entire day.
- the data gathered from search sessions can include data gathered from any number of queries or during a predetermined period of time.
- the user session may be stored by the system on storage media attached to the network.
- the browser application may present the resources to the user and allow the user to interact with the resources in any number of conventional ways.
- Example interactions include navigating to other resources by selecting universal resource locator (URL) links, storing resources or portions of resources (e.g., images, music, and movies) on the user's computing device, entering information through one or more user interface components provided by the resource, or other interactions.
- URL universal resource locator
- a user may access (e.g., visit via t web browser) any number of resources, compose any number of search queries or interact with the browser application in any number of ways in a search session or a toolbar session.
- the data in the user sessions may be used to select resources that share similar subject matter.
- the system may associate new resources with the set of known resources 102 that are already associated with a topic.
- the set of known resources 102 are websites. However, the set of known resources 102 can be websites, web pages, other electronic documents or combinations of these. The resources in the set of known resources 102 may be used to enhance future browsing.
- known resources 102 can include resources that are related to the topic “adult-oriented” and these resources be filtered and not accessible to a minor (e.g., as determined by one more user settings and/or user identification parameters) when the minor is using the browser application to perform a search for resources in a search session or is browsing the Internet in a toolbar session.
- the system may initially be configured with a set of known resources 102 .
- the set of known resources 102 can include website addresses, web page addresses, other resource addresses, or combinations thereof. Each set of known resources 102 is associated with a topic.
- the set of known resources 102 may include a web page address, e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html, a website address e.g., www.mysite.com, or a resource address, e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html/myimage1.jpeg.
- website addresses, web page addresses, and resource addresses are contained in the same structure (e.g., HTTP addresses)
- the system determines one or more of the website addresses, web page addresses from a resource address.
- the system can use the resource address www.mysite.com/index.html/myimage1.jpeg to determine a website address (e.g., www.mysite.com) and a web page address (e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html).
- the set of known resources 102 may be used to determine additional candidate resources 110 that share a common topic with the set of known resources 102 .
- resources that are selected in response to a search query can include known resources 102 as well as new resources.
- the new resources are added to the set of candidate resources 110 and can potentially be added to the set of known resources 102 , as will be described in detail below.
- the system may store the set of known resources 102 in a database or other computer readable medium.
- the system includes any number of sets of known resources 102 and candidate resources 110 associated with any number of topics.
- the system may include a set of known resources 102 and candidate resources 110 for adult-oriented content, sports related content, politically related content, food related content, education related content, or any other related content.
- the system can create any number of user sessions to group the data regarding the user's interaction with resources.
- the system had created three user sessions 104 , 106 , and 108 .
- Each user session can also be associated with a topic, the same topic as the candidate resources 110 and the known resources 102 .
- the topic of the user session can be selected based on finding one resource from the known resources 102 in a user session.
- the known resources 102 and candidate resources 110 in FIG. 1 are associated with a topic, e.g., “adult-oriented,” and already include website A, website B, and website C. Therefore, website A, website B, and website C are known to include information that relates to the topic “adult-oriented.”
- the data gathered is associated with a search session including only one query.
- the user has entered a search query “aa.”
- the search query is provided to a search engine, which has returned a number of results in response to the search query.
- the search query “aa” returned a number of resources: website B, website D, and website E, any of which can be accessed by the user (e.g., by clicking on a corresponding URL link).
- Website B is not associated with the known resources 102 . However, because website B is included in the set of known resources 102 , and website B was returned in the search containing websites D and E, the system has added the websites D and E to the set of candidate resources 110 .
- the system can also increase a relevance score associated with each of the resources in the candidate resources 110 and the topic. For example, websites D and E may initially have a relevance score to the topic of “0”.because these websites are not associated with the known resources 102 associated with the topic “adult-oriented.” Because these websites were selected as candidate resources 110 , the score can be increased, for example, by a predetermined amount.
- the candidate resources 110 can be further analyzed by the system to determine which, if any, of the candidate resources 110 should be added to the set of known resources 102 . Various techniques for determining which candidate resources to add to the set of known resources 102 are described in more detail below.
- the data gathered reflects another search session including one query and various interactions between the user performing the query and the resources selected.
- the data shows that the user has entered a search query “bb.”
- the search engine has returned website C, website F, website G, and website J as results to the search query, any of which may be accessed by the user.
- website C is already in the known resources 102 .
- the user has clicked on a link associated with website C, website F, and website J. Because website C is in the set of known resources 102 , and website C was returned in a search containing websites F and G and website C was selected by the user, the system has added websites F and G to the set of candidate resources 110 .
- a number of user queries are gathered for a predetermined time period during a search session.
- the user provides two queries “CC” and “DD” and a number of resources are selected in response to the queries.
- Website A and website H are selected in response to the query “CC,” and website A and website M are selected in response to the query DD.
- the user has accessed links to each of these websites during the predetermined time period.
- Website A is in the set of known resources 102 . Because website H was accessed during the same time period as website A, which is included in the set of known resources 102 , the system adds website H to the set of candidate resources 110 .
- the system can also increase a relevance score of the website H to the topic associated with the known resources 102 . Because website M was accessed during the same time period as website A, the system adds website M to the set of candidate resources 110 .
- the system can analyze the set of candidate resources 110 to determine which, if any, of the candidate resources 110 should be added to the set of known resources 102 . For example, using one or more of the techniques described below, the system adds websites D, E, F, G, H, and M to the set of known resources 102 . Whether one of the candidate resources 110 is added to the set of known resources 102 can depend on, for example, whether the relevance score of each of the websites in the set of candidate resources 110 satisfies a predetermined threshold. In some implementations, the system also adds any webpage address associated with the websites D, E, F, G, H, and M to the set of known resources 102 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example online environment 200 .
- the online environment 200 may facilitate the selection and serving of resources (e.g., web pages, advertisements, or other content) to users.
- a computer network 210 e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertisers 202 a and 202 b, a search engine 212 , publishers 206 a and 206 b, user devices 208 a and 208 b, and a session processing module 204 .
- Example user devices 208 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, or television set-top boxes.
- the online environment 200 may include any number of advertisers, publishers and user devices. Additionally, the on-line environment may include any number of session processing modules 204 .
- the publishers can be general content servers that receive requests for resources (e.g., web pages or documents related to articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, other web page listings, information feeds, product reviews, or other resources), and retrieve the requested resources in response to the request.
- resources e.g., web pages or documents related to articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, other web page listings, information feeds, product reviews, or other resources
- content servers related to news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, products for sale, or any other entity that provides content over the network 210 may be a publisher.
- a user device may submit a query 209 to the search engine 212 , and search results 211 may be provided to the user device 208 a in response to the query 209 .
- the search results 211 may include a URL link to web pages provided by the publishers 206 a and 206 b.
- the search engine 212 may index the content provided by the publishers 206 (e.g., an index of web pages) for later search and retrieval of search results that are relevant to the queries.
- An exemplary search engine 212 is described in S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia (1998) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999.
- Search results may include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number (e.g., ten) of search results.
- the search engine 212 uses a set of known web pages, or websites, to filter search results corresponding to related subject matter.
- the user session can be created and defined by a number of search sessions or toolbar sessions.
- Each search session can be determined by a number of queries or a time period for any number of searches in the search session.
- Each toolbar session can be determined by a predetermined time period the user browses the Internet using a browser with a toolbar plug-in installed. For example, during a predetermined time period, multiple search queries may be submitted to the search engine 212 , and one user session can be created from the gathered data. For example, if a particular user device 208 a submits a query, a current user session can be initiated. The current user session may be terminated when the search engine 212 has not received further queries from the user for a predetermined time period (e.g., 5-10 minutes).
- a predetermined time period e.g., 5-10 minutes
- the user session is defined by a user indicating the beginning and end of a user session (e.g., by logging into a search engine interface of the search engine 212 and logging out of a search engine interface). Other ways of creating a user session may also be used.
- the search engine 212 may provide the created user sessions to the session processing module 204 .
- the session processing module 204 may store a predetermined set of known resources 102 for one or more topics in the data store 214 .
- the data store 214 may also include candidate resources 110 that have not been incorporated into the set of known resources 102 for each topic.
- the session processing module 204 may store user sessions in logs 216 .
- the session processing module 204 selects particular user sessions that can potentially be related to a particular topic. For example, if there is a set of known resources 102 that corresponds to sports related content, and a user accesses one of the resources in the set of sports related content resources (e.g., in a particular user session), the session processing module 204 can the particular user session as potentially relating to the topic sports.
- the session processing module 204 may analyze the user sessions to determine if any resources should be added to the candidate resources 110 , and if any candidate resources 110 should be added to a set of known resources 102 .
- the session processing module adds the other resources in the search results to the set of candidate resources 110 associated with the same topic.
- the user session can be associated with any number of queries as described above or a predetermined time period. Therefore, if the user session was associated with five queries, and each of those queries returned resources in the set of known queries, the rest of the resources in the search results are added to the set of candidate resources.
- the data in a user session can include search results selected in response to a single query. If the search results include at least one resource in the set of known resources 102 associated with a particular topic, and that particular resource was accessed by the user, then the session processing module 204 can add the remaining resources in the search results to the set of candidate resources 110 associated with the same topic.
- the data in a user session can be associated with one or more queries executed during a predetermined period of time. If the search results include at least one resource in the set of known resources 102 associated with a particular topic, and that particular resource was accessed b the user, then the session processing module can add the remaining resources in the search results to the set of candidate resources 110 associated with the same topic.
- the relevance score associated with the resource to the topic associated with the candidate resources 110 can be increased.
- the relevance score indicates a degree of relevance of each resource to a topic.
- the relevance score can, for example, be increased by a percentage amount or a predetermined weighted amount.
- the amount of the increase can be determined by a number of features such as for example, how far up in the search results the resource appeared.
- the relevance score can also be increased each time the candidate resource appears in another user session associated with the same topic.
- each resource in the set of known resources 102 is assigned a relevance score of 1.0, on a scale between 0 and 1.0
- Each of the resources can be assigned an initial relevance score of 0.0 until the resources are added to the candidate resources 110 .
- the relevance score of each of the resources added can be increased by a predetermined amount. For example, since website F was added to the candidate resource 110 in FIG.
- the relevance score of website F associated with the candidate resources can be increased by a weight of “0.1.” So, if the relevance score of website F as it relates to the topic associated with the candidate resources 110 was previously “0,” now the relevance score is “0.1.” If in another user session the same resource was added to the set of candidate resources 110 , the relevance score can be increase by “0.1” again so it will equal “0.2.”
- the candidate resources 110 can be added to the known resources if the relevance scores exceed a predetermined threshold. For example, if the relevance score exceeds 0.4, the resource can be moved from the set of candidate resources 110 to the set of known resources 102 .
- the session processing module 204 removes candidate resources associated with a certain topic that also appear as candidate resources associated with another topic. For example, if one or more websites have been added to candidate resources associated with the topics “baseball” as well as “Atlanta,” these websites can be removed from both the candidate resources relating to the topic “baseball” and the candidate resources relating to the topic “Atlanta.” In some implementations, removing a resource from candidate resources also decreased the relevance score of the resource to the topic by the same amount the relevance score was increased when it was initially added.
- the session processing module 204 analyzes the queries issued during a created user session to remove candidate resources 110 .
- the sequence of queries includes queries that returned resources from the set of known resources 102 , and queries that do not return resources from the set of known resources 102 .
- the queries that returned resources from the set of known resources 102 include particular search terms (designated as the set of search terms K).
- the session processing module 204 may remove candidate resources 110 that are selected but found without using at least one search term from the set of search terms K.
- the session processing module 204 removes candidate resources 110 that are found using queries that do not include all of the search terms in the set of search terms K.
- the session processing module 204 computes a topic weight for each query term that returns resources from the set of known resources 102 . For example, if a set of baseball topic terms “baseball,” “grand-slam home run,” and “seventh inning stretch” always results in search results including the set of known resources 102 , each of these terms can be associated with a topic weight of “1.” Therefore, any time these query terms are used in search queries, any of the resources returned in the search results can be added to the set of candidate resources 110 .
- the session processing module 204 computes a ranking of the candidate resources 110 according to a frequency in which the candidate resources appear in a first user session associated with a first topic versus another a second user session associated with a second topic.
- the ranking can be used to modify the relevance score associated with each candidate resource. For example, candidate resources associated with “baseball” can appear more often in a user session associated with “sports” than in a user session associated with “baseball.” Since the frequency that these candidate resources appear in the “sports” related user session is higher, these candidate resources can be demoted in ranking by a decrease in relevance score as they appear in the candidate resources associated with “baseball.”
- the ranking function may also use the topic weights for search terms, as described above. For example, candidate resources that appear in sessions that are selected using search terms associated with high topic weights may be weighted higher than candidate resources that appear in sessions that are found using the search terms that are not associated with high topic weights.
- the session processing module 204 uses classifiers associated with the candidate resources to determine if the resources should be added to the known resources 102 .
- the classifiers can include text, images, links, HTML tags, fonts, colors, titles, URLs associated with each resource. Each classifier can be associated with a different weight.
- Candidate resources associated with a known resource 102 can be assigned a relevance score based on the classifiers. For example, suppose website L and website X are known resources 102 . Website M and website N are selected in the search results along with website L, and therefore, website M and website N are candidate resources 110 . Websites M and Y selected in the search results along with website X, and therefore Y is also added as a candidate resource (website B was already added as a candidate resource.)
- Websites M, N, and Y can be assigned a relevance score based on classifiers associated with each website. If the topic of the known resources 102 was “food,” website M may be assigned a relevance score of “0.5” because of images of food on the website, website N may be assigned a relevance score of “0.7” because of the words “fruit,” and “vegetable” on the website, and website Y can be assigned a relevance score of “0.3” because of an image of oatmeal.
- the session processing module 204 can then average the relevance scores of the candidate resources related to each known resource.
- the relevance scores for website M, “0.5” and website N, “0.7” can be averaged to equal “0.6.” This average of 0.6 is assigned to website L and it is a measure of how well website L predicts the topic of its related resources.
- the relevance scores for website M, “0.5” and website Y, “0.3” can be averaged to equal “0.4.” This average is assigned to website X.
- the session processing module 204 can then average the averaged relevance scores for each candidate resource 110 . Therefore, for website M, the session processing module can average the scores of website L, which is “0.6” and website X, which is “0.4” to equal 0.5. This is the final score for M which reflects its relation to website L and website X, the relation of website L and website X to the other candidate sites, and the initial scores for these other candidate sites. For website N, there is only one averaged relevance score of “0.6” since website N was only related to website L and not X. For website Y, there exist only one averaged relevance score of “0.4” since website Y was only related to website L, not to website X.
- the session processing module 204 removes certain candidate resources that include topics that are generally considered to provide false-positive classifications for topics associated with a user session.
- an image classifier that is used to identify adult-oriented content may inadvertently classify non-adult oriented pictures with lots of skin (e.g., bikini shops, tattoo salons, or dermatology websites) as adult oriented content.
- a text classifier may be used to classify a set of resources and human raters may review the results to remove wrongfully classified resources and manually add them to the set T.
- the session processing module 204 may use an on-topic classifier to detect resources that may be on-topic. Resources that are considered to be on-topic may be removed or manually looked at by a human rater.
- the session processing module 204 determines, for each candidate resource, a set of related resources. For example, the session processing module 204 may determine a set of related resources for a particular candidate resource based on if the related resources are found using the same query as the candidate resource, or if the related resources are accessible from the candidate resource through one or more URL links. If the candidate resource's related resources have a large fraction (e.g., at least 50%) of resources in the set of topics T, then the candidate resource is probably related to off-topic material and may be either removed or further scrutinized by human raters.
- a large fraction e.g., at least 50%
- any or all of the techniques described above may be used to resolve a topic conflict. For example, consider a situation where text and image classifiers determine that a resource includes two potential topics. Any or all of the techniques described above may be executed one or more times to remove resources from the candidate resources of a first topic if the session processing module 204 selects the same resource in the candidate resources of a second topic.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing an example aggregation 300 of sports websites.
- the online environment 200 is used to describe the aggregation 300 depicted in FIG. 3 .
- the resources are described as websites.
- the example depicted in FIG. 3 relates to websites related to the topic “sports.”
- the known websites 302 related to the topic “sports” are www.football1.com, www.baseball1.com, and www.soccer1.com.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, for selecting resources associated with a common topic. In one aspect, a method includes selecting a first resource associated with a topic, the first resource accessed in a user session, selecting a second resource accessed during the user session, determining whether the second resource is associated with the topic, and increasing a relevance score of the second resource and the topic based on determining that the second resource is not associated with the topic.
Description
- This specification relates to associating resources with topics.
- The rise of the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of resources, e.g., video files, audio files, web pages for particular subjects, or news articles. Resources can be selected by a search engine in response to a user query. One example search engine is the Google™ search engine provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., U.S.A.
- Often resources can be grouped in categories based on some feature of the resource. For example, if a website is related to football, it may be associated with a sports category. Categorizing the websites individually though may be time consuming and the websites may be associated with more than one category.
- In general, a first aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of selecting a first resource associated with a topic, the first resource accessed in a user session; selecting a second resource accessed during the user session; determining whether the second resource is associated with the topic; and increasing a relevance score of the second resource and the topic based on determining that the second resource is not associated with the topic.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of selecting a first resource associated with a topic, the first resource accessed during a user session; selecting second resources accessed during the user session; generating a relevance score for each of the second resources based on an external classifier associated with the respective second resource; calculating an average of the relevance scores of the candidate resources; assigning to the first resource the average of the relevance scores as a prediction score; for each second resource, calculating an average of the prediction score of the first resource; assigning to each second resource the average of the prediction score of the first resource as an average prediction score; determining whether the average prediction score of each second resource satisfies a threshold; and associating the respective second resource with the topic based on the determining.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Relevance of a resource to a topic can be determined and increased by comparing the resource to other resources that are already known to be associated with the topic.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects and advantages of the subject matter will be apparent from the description, drawings, and claims.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram 100 showing an example aggregation of new resources (e.g., websites) and a set ofknown resources 102. The term “resource” is used generically to describe video files, audio files, web pages and/or their corresponding websites, news articles, or any other electronic documents that are available on a network (e.g., the Internet). For convenience, a system that is configured to perform the aggregation is described in the context ofFIG. 1 . - An example system is described in more detail below. In general, when a user provides a search query to a search engine, the search engine uses the search query to select one or more resources located on the network (e.g., the Internet). In addition, a user can browse the Internet to identify one or more resources without first using a search engine. The system may create a user session that the system uses to group data regarding the user's interaction with the resources, search queries provided by the user, or other usage information regarding one or more resources on the network. For example, the data grouped with a user session may include a history of resources accessed, entered search queries, or other historical data associated with the user's actions when using a web browser application.
- The user session can include data gathered during a search session where a user submits queries and receives in return one or more resources in response to the search queries. The user session can also include data gathered during a toolbar session where a toolbar plug-in can be installed on the user's browser application and the resources accessed by the user can be gathered. The user session can also be associated with a time period. For example, the data grouped with a toolbar session can include a history of resources accessed and other actions taken by the user during a five minute interval of time or during an entire day. The data gathered from search sessions can include data gathered from any number of queries or during a predetermined period of time. The user session may be stored by the system on storage media attached to the network.
- The browser application may present the resources to the user and allow the user to interact with the resources in any number of conventional ways. Example interactions include navigating to other resources by selecting universal resource locator (URL) links, storing resources or portions of resources (e.g., images, music, and movies) on the user's computing device, entering information through one or more user interface components provided by the resource, or other interactions.
- A user may access (e.g., visit via t web browser) any number of resources, compose any number of search queries or interact with the browser application in any number of ways in a search session or a toolbar session. The data in the user sessions may be used to select resources that share similar subject matter. By selecting resources that can be associated with the same topic, the system may associate new resources with the set of
known resources 102 that are already associated with a topic. - In the depicted example of
FIG. 1 , the set ofknown resources 102 are websites. However, the set ofknown resources 102 can be websites, web pages, other electronic documents or combinations of these. The resources in the set ofknown resources 102 may be used to enhance future browsing. For example,known resources 102 can include resources that are related to the topic “adult-oriented” and these resources be filtered and not accessible to a minor (e.g., as determined by one more user settings and/or user identification parameters) when the minor is using the browser application to perform a search for resources in a search session or is browsing the Internet in a toolbar session. - The system may initially be configured with a set of
known resources 102. The set ofknown resources 102 can include website addresses, web page addresses, other resource addresses, or combinations thereof. Each set ofknown resources 102 is associated with a topic. The set ofknown resources 102 may include a web page address, e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html, a website address e.g., www.mysite.com, or a resource address, e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html/myimage1.jpeg. In some implementations, because website addresses, web page addresses, and resource addresses are contained in the same structure (e.g., HTTP addresses), the system determines one or more of the website addresses, web page addresses from a resource address. - For example, the system can use the resource address www.mysite.com/index.html/myimage1.jpeg to determine a website address (e.g., www.mysite.com) and a web page address (e.g., www.mysite.com/index.html). The set of
known resources 102 may be used to determineadditional candidate resources 110 that share a common topic with the set ofknown resources 102. For example, resources that are selected in response to a search query can includeknown resources 102 as well as new resources. In one implementation, because the new resources were selected in the list containing the known resources, the new resources are added to the set ofcandidate resources 110 and can potentially be added to the set ofknown resources 102, as will be described in detail below. The system may store the set ofknown resources 102 in a database or other computer readable medium. - In some implementations, the system includes any number of sets of
known resources 102 andcandidate resources 110 associated with any number of topics. For example, the system may include a set ofknown resources 102 andcandidate resources 110 for adult-oriented content, sports related content, politically related content, food related content, education related content, or any other related content. - The system can create any number of user sessions to group the data regarding the user's interaction with resources. In the depicted example illustrated in
FIG. 1 , the system had created threeuser sessions candidate resources 110 and theknown resources 102. The topic of the user session can be selected based on finding one resource from theknown resources 102 in a user session. Theknown resources 102 andcandidate resources 110 inFIG. 1 are associated with a topic, e.g., “adult-oriented,” and already include website A, website B, and website C. Therefore, website A, website B, and website C are known to include information that relates to the topic “adult-oriented.” - In the first created
user session 104, the data gathered is associated with a search session including only one query. The user has entered a search query “aa.” The search query is provided to a search engine, which has returned a number of results in response to the search query. In the depicted example, the search query “aa” returned a number of resources: website B, website D, and website E, any of which can be accessed by the user (e.g., by clicking on a corresponding URL link). Website B is not associated with the knownresources 102. However, because website B is included in the set of knownresources 102, and website B was returned in the search containing websites D and E, the system has added the websites D and E to the set ofcandidate resources 110. - The system can also increase a relevance score associated with each of the resources in the
candidate resources 110 and the topic. For example, websites D and E may initially have a relevance score to the topic of “0”.because these websites are not associated with the knownresources 102 associated with the topic “adult-oriented.” Because these websites were selected ascandidate resources 110, the score can be increased, for example, by a predetermined amount. Thecandidate resources 110 can be further analyzed by the system to determine which, if any, of thecandidate resources 110 should be added to the set of knownresources 102. Various techniques for determining which candidate resources to add to the set of knownresources 102 are described in more detail below. - In the second created
user session 106, the data gathered reflects another search session including one query and various interactions between the user performing the query and the resources selected. The data shows that the user has entered a search query “bb.” In response, the search engine has returned website C, website F, website G, and website J as results to the search query, any of which may be accessed by the user. Of these four resources, website C is already in the knownresources 102. In this example, the user has clicked on a link associated with website C, website F, and website J. Because website C is in the set of knownresources 102, and website C was returned in a search containing websites F and G and website C was selected by the user, the system has added websites F and G to the set ofcandidate resources 110. - In the third created
user session 108, a number of user queries are gathered for a predetermined time period during a search session. In the depicted example, the user provides two queries “CC” and “DD” and a number of resources are selected in response to the queries. Website A and website H are selected in response to the query “CC,” and website A and website M are selected in response to the query DD. The user has accessed links to each of these websites during the predetermined time period. Website A is in the set of knownresources 102. Because website H was accessed during the same time period as website A, which is included in the set of knownresources 102, the system adds website H to the set ofcandidate resources 110. The system can also increase a relevance score of the website H to the topic associated with the knownresources 102. Because website M was accessed during the same time period as website A, the system adds website M to the set ofcandidate resources 110. - Once the system has generated a set of
candidate resources 110, the system can analyze the set ofcandidate resources 110 to determine which, if any, of thecandidate resources 110 should be added to the set of knownresources 102. For example, using one or more of the techniques described below, the system adds websites D, E, F, G, H, and M to the set of knownresources 102. Whether one of thecandidate resources 110 is added to the set of knownresources 102 can depend on, for example, whether the relevance score of each of the websites in the set ofcandidate resources 110 satisfies a predetermined threshold. In some implementations, the system also adds any webpage address associated with the websites D, E, F, G, H, and M to the set of knownresources 102. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example online environment 200. The online environment 200 may facilitate the selection and serving of resources (e.g., web pages, advertisements, or other content) to users. Acomputer network 210, e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectsadvertisers search engine 212,publishers user devices session processing module 204. Example user devices 208 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, or television set-top boxes. Although only two advertisers (202 a and 202 b), two publishers (206 a and 206 b) and two user devices (208 a and 208 b) are shown, the online environment 200 may include any number of advertisers, publishers and user devices. Additionally, the on-line environment may include any number ofsession processing modules 204. - The publishers can be general content servers that receive requests for resources (e.g., web pages or documents related to articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, other web page listings, information feeds, product reviews, or other resources), and retrieve the requested resources in response to the request. For example, content servers related to news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, products for sale, or any other entity that provides content over the
network 210 may be a publisher. - A user device, e.g.,
user device 208 a, may submit aquery 209 to thesearch engine 212, andsearch results 211 may be provided to theuser device 208 a in response to thequery 209. The search results 211 may include a URL link to web pages provided by thepublishers - To facilitate selection of the search results in response to queries, the
search engine 212 may index the content provided by the publishers 206 (e.g., an index of web pages) for later search and retrieval of search results that are relevant to the queries. Anexemplary search engine 212 is described in S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia (1998) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999. Search results may include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number (e.g., ten) of search results. In addition, in some implementations, thesearch engine 212 uses a set of known web pages, or websites, to filter search results corresponding to related subject matter. - In some implementations, the user session can be created and defined by a number of search sessions or toolbar sessions. Each search session can be determined by a number of queries or a time period for any number of searches in the search session. Each toolbar session can be determined by a predetermined time period the user browses the Internet using a browser with a toolbar plug-in installed. For example, during a predetermined time period, multiple search queries may be submitted to the
search engine 212, and one user session can be created from the gathered data. For example, if aparticular user device 208 a submits a query, a current user session can be initiated. The current user session may be terminated when thesearch engine 212 has not received further queries from the user for a predetermined time period (e.g., 5-10 minutes). In some implementations, the user session is defined by a user indicating the beginning and end of a user session (e.g., by logging into a search engine interface of thesearch engine 212 and logging out of a search engine interface). Other ways of creating a user session may also be used. - The
search engine 212 may provide the created user sessions to thesession processing module 204. Thesession processing module 204 may store a predetermined set of knownresources 102 for one or more topics in thedata store 214. Moreover, thedata store 214 may also includecandidate resources 110 that have not been incorporated into the set of knownresources 102 for each topic. In addition, thesession processing module 204 may store user sessions inlogs 216. - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 selects particular user sessions that can potentially be related to a particular topic. For example, if there is a set of knownresources 102 that corresponds to sports related content, and a user accesses one of the resources in the set of sports related content resources (e.g., in a particular user session), thesession processing module 204 can the particular user session as potentially relating to the topic sports. Thesession processing module 204 may analyze the user sessions to determine if any resources should be added to thecandidate resources 110, and if anycandidate resources 110 should be added to a set of knownresources 102. - In some implementations, if the data in a user sessions shows search results selected in response to a query include at least one resource in the set of known
resources 102 associated with a particular topic, the session processing module adds the other resources in the search results to the set ofcandidate resources 110 associated with the same topic. The user session can be associated with any number of queries as described above or a predetermined time period. Therefore, if the user session was associated with five queries, and each of those queries returned resources in the set of known queries, the rest of the resources in the search results are added to the set of candidate resources. - In some implementations, the data in a user session can include search results selected in response to a single query. If the search results include at least one resource in the set of known
resources 102 associated with a particular topic, and that particular resource was accessed by the user, then thesession processing module 204 can add the remaining resources in the search results to the set ofcandidate resources 110 associated with the same topic. - In other implementations, the data in a user session can be associated with one or more queries executed during a predetermined period of time. If the search results include at least one resource in the set of known
resources 102 associated with a particular topic, and that particular resource was accessed b the user, then the session processing module can add the remaining resources in the search results to the set ofcandidate resources 110 associated with the same topic. - In some implementations, each time a resource is added to the set of
candidate resources 110, the relevance score associated with the resource to the topic associated with thecandidate resources 110 can be increased. The relevance score indicates a degree of relevance of each resource to a topic. The relevance score can, for example, be increased by a percentage amount or a predetermined weighted amount. The amount of the increase can be determined by a number of features such as for example, how far up in the search results the resource appeared. The relevance score can also be increased each time the candidate resource appears in another user session associated with the same topic. - For example, each resource in the set of known
resources 102 is assigned a relevance score of 1.0, on a scale between 0 and 1.0 Each of the resources can be assigned an initial relevance score of 0.0 until the resources are added to thecandidate resources 110. After being added to thecandidate resources 110, the relevance score of each of the resources added can be increased by a predetermined amount. For example, since website F was added to thecandidate resource 110 inFIG. 1 , the relevance score of website F associated with the candidate resources can be increased by a weight of “0.1.” So, if the relevance score of website F as it relates to the topic associated with thecandidate resources 110 was previously “0,” now the relevance score is “0.1.” If in another user session the same resource was added to the set ofcandidate resources 110, the relevance score can be increase by “0.1” again so it will equal “0.2.” In some implementations, thecandidate resources 110 can be added to the known resources if the relevance scores exceed a predetermined threshold. For example, if the relevance score exceeds 0.4, the resource can be moved from the set ofcandidate resources 110 to the set of knownresources 102. - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 removes candidate resources associated with a certain topic that also appear as candidate resources associated with another topic. For example, if one or more websites have been added to candidate resources associated with the topics “baseball” as well as “Atlanta,” these websites can be removed from both the candidate resources relating to the topic “baseball” and the candidate resources relating to the topic “Atlanta.” In some implementations, removing a resource from candidate resources also decreased the relevance score of the resource to the topic by the same amount the relevance score was increased when it was initially added. - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 analyzes the queries issued during a created user session to removecandidate resources 110. For example, for a particular user session, the sequence of queries includes queries that returned resources from the set of knownresources 102, and queries that do not return resources from the set of knownresources 102. The queries that returned resources from the set of knownresources 102 include particular search terms (designated as the set of search terms K). Using the set of search terms K, thesession processing module 204 may removecandidate resources 110 that are selected but found without using at least one search term from the set of search terms K. In some implementations, thesession processing module 204 removescandidate resources 110 that are found using queries that do not include all of the search terms in the set of search terms K. - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 computes a topic weight for each query term that returns resources from the set of knownresources 102. For example, if a set of baseball topic terms “baseball,” “grand-slam home run,” and “seventh inning stretch” always results in search results including the set of knownresources 102, each of these terms can be associated with a topic weight of “1.” Therefore, any time these query terms are used in search queries, any of the resources returned in the search results can be added to the set ofcandidate resources 110. - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 computes a ranking of thecandidate resources 110 according to a frequency in which the candidate resources appear in a first user session associated with a first topic versus another a second user session associated with a second topic. The ranking can be used to modify the relevance score associated with each candidate resource. For example, candidate resources associated with “baseball” can appear more often in a user session associated with “sports” than in a user session associated with “baseball.” Since the frequency that these candidate resources appear in the “sports” related user session is higher, these candidate resources can be demoted in ranking by a decrease in relevance score as they appear in the candidate resources associated with “baseball.” - The ranking function may also use the topic weights for search terms, as described above. For example, candidate resources that appear in sessions that are selected using search terms associated with high topic weights may be weighted higher than candidate resources that appear in sessions that are found using the search terms that are not associated with high topic weights.
- In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 uses classifiers associated with the candidate resources to determine if the resources should be added to the knownresources 102. The classifiers can include text, images, links, HTML tags, fonts, colors, titles, URLs associated with each resource. Each classifier can be associated with a different weight. Candidate resources associated with a knownresource 102 can be assigned a relevance score based on the classifiers. For example, suppose website L and website X are knownresources 102. Website M and website N are selected in the search results along with website L, and therefore, website M and website N arecandidate resources 110. Websites M and Y selected in the search results along with website X, and therefore Y is also added as a candidate resource (website B was already added as a candidate resource.) - Websites M, N, and Y can be assigned a relevance score based on classifiers associated with each website. If the topic of the known
resources 102 was “food,” website M may be assigned a relevance score of “0.5” because of images of food on the website, website N may be assigned a relevance score of “0.7” because of the words “fruit,” and “vegetable” on the website, and website Y can be assigned a relevance score of “0.3” because of an image of oatmeal. - The
session processing module 204 can then average the relevance scores of the candidate resources related to each known resource. In this example, the relevance scores for website M, “0.5” and website N, “0.7” can be averaged to equal “0.6.” This average of 0.6 is assigned to website L and it is a measure of how well website L predicts the topic of its related resources. The relevance scores for website M, “0.5” and website Y, “0.3” can be averaged to equal “0.4.” This average is assigned to website X. - The
session processing module 204 can then average the averaged relevance scores for eachcandidate resource 110. Therefore, for website M, the session processing module can average the scores of website L, which is “0.6” and website X, which is “0.4” to equal 0.5. This is the final score for M which reflects its relation to website L and website X, the relation of website L and website X to the other candidate sites, and the initial scores for these other candidate sites. For website N, there is only one averaged relevance score of “0.6” since website N was only related to website L and not X. For website Y, there exist only one averaged relevance score of “0.4” since website Y was only related to website L, not to website X. Websites M, N, and X now have relevance scores of “0.5,” “0.6”, and “0.4,” respectively. If these averages are above a predetermined threshold, then therespective candidate resource 110 can be added to the set of knownresources 102 for example, if the threshold in this example was “>=0.6,” then website N, with a relevance score of “0.6,” can be added to the set of knownresources 102 related to “food.” - In some implementations, the
session processing module 204 removes certain candidate resources that include topics that are generally considered to provide false-positive classifications for topics associated with a user session. For example, an image classifier that is used to identify adult-oriented content may inadvertently classify non-adult oriented pictures with lots of skin (e.g., bikini shops, tattoo salons, or dermatology websites) as adult oriented content. Consider a set T of topics that have been selected to contain false-positives. For example, a text classifier may be used to classify a set of resources and human raters may review the results to remove wrongfully classified resources and manually add them to the set T. To ensure that each of the resources in the set T does not contain on-topic material, thesession processing module 204 may use an on-topic classifier to detect resources that may be on-topic. Resources that are considered to be on-topic may be removed or manually looked at by a human rater. - In some implementations, to reduce false-positives for topic detection, the
session processing module 204 determines, for each candidate resource, a set of related resources. For example, thesession processing module 204 may determine a set of related resources for a particular candidate resource based on if the related resources are found using the same query as the candidate resource, or if the related resources are accessible from the candidate resource through one or more URL links. If the candidate resource's related resources have a large fraction (e.g., at least 50%) of resources in the set of topics T, then the candidate resource is probably related to off-topic material and may be either removed or further scrutinized by human raters. - In some implementations, any or all of the techniques described above may be used to resolve a topic conflict. For example, consider a situation where text and image classifiers determine that a resource includes two potential topics. Any or all of the techniques described above may be executed one or more times to remove resources from the candidate resources of a first topic if the
session processing module 204 selects the same resource in the candidate resources of a second topic. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing anexample aggregation 300 of sports websites. For convenience, the online environment 200 is used to describe theaggregation 300 depicted inFIG. 3 . In the example ofFIG. 3 , the resources are described as websites. The example depicted inFIG. 3 relates to websites related to the topic “sports.” The knownwebsites 302 related to the topic “sports” are www.football1.com, www.baseball1.com, and www.soccer1.com. - A
first user session 304 is created that shows the results of a single search session. The user has provided the search query “football” tosearch engine 212 throughnetwork 210. Thesearch engine 212 may select any number of results that are responsive to the search query. In this example, a number of websites www.football1.com, www.football2.com, and www.football3.com are selected in response to the user query. Thefirst user session 304 may be transmitted to thesession processing module 204 overnetwork 210. Thesession processing module 204 may analyze the user session to generate a set ofcandidate websites 310. - For example, the
session processing module 204 has analyzeduser session 304 and added www.football2.com and www.football3.com to the set ofcandidate websites 310 because websites www.football2.com and www.football3.com are returned as search results along with a website in the set of known websites 302 (e.g., www.football1.com). Alternatively, in some implementations, thesession processing module 204 may aggregate data from multiple user session to construct the set ofcandidate websites 310. In such implementations, thesession processor module 204 stores the data from the user sessions in thelogs 216. - For example, after the
session processing module 204 received the data from thefirst user session 306 and stored it in thelogs 216, asecond user session 306 is created corresponding to the data from another search session. A search query “sports” entered by a user and the search results www.football1.com, www.hockey1.com, and www.volleyball1.com in response to the query are selected. A user has accessed a link associated with the website www.hockey1.com. Because the website www.hockey1.com was accessed, thesession processing module 204 adds the website www.hockey1.com to thecandidate website 310. Thesecond user session 306 may also be stored in thelogs 216. - Additionally, a
third user session 308 is generated that corresponds to a search session and search queries and events having occurred during a five minute period of time. During the course of the five-minute interval, the user has provided two queries, “football” and “sports,” and a number of results have been returned in response to the queries including www.football1.com and www.sports2.com. During the five minute interval, the user clicked on the website www.sports2.com, and therefore, because the website www.football1.com was returned as a search result and was in the knownwebsite 302, and www.sports2.com is added to thecandidate websites 310. - Therefore, the websites www.football2.com, www.football3.com, www.hockey1.com, and www.sports2.com are added as
candidate websites 310. Each of these candidate websites can be associated with a relevance score associating the website with the topic associated with thecandidate websites 310 and knownwebsite 302. In this example, the relevance score measures the relevance of eachcandidate website 310 with the topic “sports.” Initially these websites had a relevance score of “0” but by being added to thecandidate websites 310, each of the relevance scores can be increased by “0.10.” If these same websites are added again to thecandidate websites 310, instead of re-adding the website, the relevance score can be increased. Once the relevance score of one or more of thecandidate websites 310 exceeds or satisfies a predetermined threshold, therespective candidate website 310 can be added to the set of knownwebsites 302 relating to the topic “sports.” -
