Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications and, more particularly, to the avoidance or reduction of self-interference caused by harmonic distortion, inter-modulation (IM) distortion, or receiver images in carrier aggregation wireless communication terminals and corresponding methods.
- IM inter-modulation
- CA carrier aggregation
- UE User Equipment
- IMT International Mobile Telecommunications
- carrier aggregation can be categorized as intra-band contiguous CA, intra-band non-contiguous CA, and inter-band non-contiguous CA.
- intra-band contiguous CA two or more adjacent CCs within a single operating band are aggregated while intra-band non-contiguous CA aggregates non-adjacent CCs in the same frequency band.
- Inter-band non-contiguous CA aggregates two or more CCs from different frequency bands.
- inter-band CA UE may suffer from significant amount of self-interference caused by harmonics of one uplink component carrier from a frequency band falling into another aggregated carrier's receive band or downlink component carrier in another frequency band supported by the inter-band UE.
- Self-interference may also occur due to intermodulation products of multiple uplink carriers falling into one of its LTE receive bands or receive bands of co-located other radios such as Bluetooth and/or WLAN and/or other cellular networks.
- carrier aggregation scenario 100 of LTE Band 4 and Band 17 aggregation, B and C blocks of lower 700 MHz (uplink: 704-716 102 MHz, downlink: 734-746 MHz 104 ) and the A block of another spectrum (uplink: 1710-1720 MHz 106 , downlink: 2110-2120 MHz 108 ) may be used together.
- the uplink transmission on band 704-707 MHz of Band 17 causes self-desensitization in the downlink band of Band 4 due to the 3rd order harmonic distortion 110 , and the almost entire downlink channel band (2112-2120 MHz) in Band 4 can be affected by the harmonic interference.
- the harmonic distortion falling into the spectrum near the UE receive band of Band 4 can also cause desense due to potential intermodulation with the received signal.
- 3GPP RAN working group considers items on inter-band carrier aggregation such as Band 17+Band 4, Band 5+Band 12, Band 5+Band 17, and Band 7+Band 20, the scope of which includes simultaneous activation of two LTE uplink carriers in two bands.
- Various components at the transceiver path such as antennas, power amplifiers (PAs), connectors, and switches, can contribute to harmonics and intermodulation interference.
- PAs power amplifiers
- the reverse inter-modulation which is the leakage from one PA output mixed with the input signal of another PA when there is simultaneous transmission on both the carriers, occurs due to co-located PAs for different bands.
- the 3rd order intermodulation distortion (IMD) falling into the lower Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) band (2400-2414 MHz) can desensitize WLAN and Bluetooth receivers operated in those channels.
- IMD intermodulation distortion
- ISM Industrial-Scientific-Medical
- aggregation of more than two component carriers is likely to be supported, and intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation may be allowed, which result in more scenarios of self-interference due to intermodulation or harmonics.
- FIG. 2 Another example of the self-interference is the receiver image interference from adjacent CCs in intra-band contiguous CA 200 is shown in FIG. 2 .
- the receiver image from the adjacent CC may significantly degrade the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the victim CC if the received signal power on the adjacent CC is much higher than the received signal power on the victim carrier.
- SINR signal-to-interference and noise ratio
- the mean user throughput is likely not impacted as much.
- the 5%-tile downlink received signal level is around ⁇ 70 dBm, which is translated to ⁇ 98 dBm/15 kHz for a 10 MHz downlink. If the output power of PA is 23 dBm with uplink allocation over 180 KHz, the corresponding 3rd order harmonic response is 7.4 dBm/15 KHz—harmonic suppression capability (in dBc). If the harmonic suppression capability is less than 100 dBc, there will be degradation to the cell-edge user throughput.
- each wireless communication terminal operated in a wireless network may have different RF characteristics and performances
- applying band/channel combination specific scheduling restrictions at base station schedulers in a consistent manner in order to avoid the self-interference may limit the flexible and effective use of radio resources.
- Scheduling restrictions also cause extra burden to network equipment vendors due to the increased complexity.
- the potential desense region due to harmonics or IMD may be the entire receive band of one carrier since two wideband LTE channels are aggregated. Therefore, scheduling decision or component carrier management based on the actual self-interference level in each terminal may be beneficial for efficient use of radio resources.

- Emerging broadband wireless networks such as 3GPP LTE and LTE-Advanced must solve the problems of minimizing the PA power consumption (or peak and/or mean current drain), cost, and the complexity required to deliver a specified conducted power level and of enhancing linearity of transmitter and receiver components (e.g. PA, low noise amplifier, mixer, analog-to-digital converter, and digital-to-analog converter) in the context of new modes of system operation.
- PA and RF front-end filter performances must be optimized in the presence of numerous different frequency or spatially adjacent radio access technologies, including GSM, UMTS, WCDMA, unlicensed transmitter and receivers, among other radio access technologies.

- n PRB B4 and n PRB B17 are PRB numbers of Band 4 downlink and Band 17 uplink, respectively.
- the aggressor-victim PRB number relationship can be used to find out PRB numbers of the corresponding potential desense region for PRBs on the aggressor carrier.
- the UE determines the first set of resource blocks which are affected by self-interference and the second set of resource blocks which include self-interference free resource blocks on the first downlink channel based on a frequency relationship between a frequency location of aggressor signal on the aggressor channel and a frequency location of corresponding self-interference on the first downlink channel.
- the frequency relationship can be physical resource block (PRB) number relationship between the aggressor signal on the aggressor channel and the received signal on the first downlink channel.
- PRB physical resource block
- a UE supports a carrier aggregation band combination with one or more potential victim and aggressor carrier frequencies due to harmonics or intermodulation products. If the UE signals supported band combinations to a base station and camps on one of victim or aggressor frequencies, then the base station configures the UE for a harmonic or intermodulation self-interference measurement on the potential victim frequency through higher-layer, for example, radio resource control (RRC) signaling.
- RRC radio resource control
- a self-interference measurement is not configured if any combination of carrier frequencies supported in the network for inter-band aggregation does not cause the self-interference in the UE.
- a UE is configured for harmonic interference measurements by RRC signaling and a carrier frequency of the primary cell (PCell) is either a victim or an aggressor frequency in supported CA band combinations

- a primary cell is referred to the serving cell that provides NAS mobility information and security information to the UE.
- a UE is configured for intermodulation interference measurements by RRC signaling and a carrier frequency of the PCell is either a victim or an aggressor frequency in supported CA band combinations
- the potential victim carrier frequency is measured via one of inter-frequency or intra-frequency measurements with uplink transmission in all aggressor carrier frequencies that result in intermodulation interference on the victim frequency.
- 3GPP EUTRA LTE TS 36.133 allows a measurement gap for measuring non-configured (not configured as a secondary cell, SCell) frequencies in inter-band carrier aggregation.
- SCell secondary cell
- a UE may turn on the receive RF chain of the victim band for the measurement of the non-configured victim frequency, and maintain uplink and downlink activities in the PCell without interruption during the measurement.
- the UE can alternate between the conventional inter-frequency measurement (possibly with a measurement gap, that is, no uplink transmission on aggressor carriers) and the self-interference harmonic or intermodulation measurement for the non-configured victim frequency.
- a serving cell with Band 17 carrier is configured as the PCell and a potential victim carrier frequency in Band 4, which is not associated with any configured SCell (Secondary Cell which can be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells which the UE can use for communication with the network entity), is measured through inter-frequency measurement, the UE is configured to send uplink signal on the Band 17 aggressor carrier frequency during measurement, in order to include the 3rd order harmonic interference to the measurement results.
- SCell Secondary Cell which can be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells which the UE can use for communication with the network entity
- the inter-frequency measurement of the Band 4 carrier is likely to be feasible without measurement gap and accordingly, transmission on the Band 17 uplink carrier during inter-frequency measurement is feasible.
- the base station If the aggressor carrier is deactivated or not configured, the base station signals to the UE appropriate uplink transmission configurations with transmit power and RB allocations for the self-interference measurement.
- This uplink signal transmitted on the deactivated or non-configured aggressor carrier during the measurement may be sounding reference signal (SRS)-like signal, and the base station can use it for path loss or channel quality estimation or other purposes.
- SRS sounding reference signal
- the Band 4 carrier (victim) is configured as a PCell and the harmonic measurement is configured for the UE, then the Band 4 carrier measurement is done with Band 17 uplink transmission irrespective of whether the Band 17 aggressor carrier is configured as an SCell or not.
- the UE only performs measurement in victim Band 4 carrier frequency when an UL transmission occurs in the Band 17 aggressor carrier frequency.
- a UE If a UE is configured for harmonic or intermodulation interference measurements, the UE generates two sets of measurement values (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI), one obtained from a set of resource blocks (RBs), a significant portion of which are affected by the harmonic or intermodulation interference, and the other from a set of RBs without the harmonic or intermodulation interference.
- the harmonic/IM interference power level observed in the victim cell's receive band depends on the UE harmonic/IM suppression capability, UE transmit power level, and uplink allocation in one or more aggressor carriers.
- the average degradation of RSRQ due to the harmonic/IM interference can be obtained.
- UE sends RSRP and RSRQ obtained from harmonic/IM interference-free resource blocks and the average RSRQ offset.
- RSRQ measurement on Band 4 SCell may be configured to occur only during occasions when the UE is not transmitting on Band 17 PCell.
- the UE may be configured to perform RSRQ measurements on SCell during occasions when the UE UL is active on PCell. These measurements include the impact of the harmonics and/or intermodulation distortion which is a function of the UE transmit power and allocation.
- Such measurements may be normalized to a reference power and reference allocation size prior to reporting or averaging the measurements.
- the measurements may be further conditioned to occur only when the interference impacts a particular set of downlink resource blocks.
- the new set of measurements (RSRP, RSRQ, and CQI obtained from the harmonic/IM interference-free RBs and CQI/RSRQ offsets) obtained by the self-interference harmonic or intermodulation measurement is used by the network in order to determine whether to configure, activate, or deactivate SCell and perform SCell-to-PCell switching and handover in the inter-band combination scenario with the potential self-interference from harmonic or intermodulation distortion.
- the base station can use the new measurement reports on the UE receiver image interference for DL power control and scheduling in each component carrier, and for SCell deactivation.
- the power radiated into an adjacent frequency band and the harmonic and intermodulation distortion by a UE are governed by several design criteria related to the implementation of mobile terminal transmitters, including oscillator phase noise, digital-analog converter (DAC) noise, power amplifier linearity (in turn controlled by power amplifier mode, cost, power consumption etc.), RF front-end filter responses, among others.
- oscillator phase noise digital-analog converter (DAC) noise
- power amplifier linearity in turn controlled by power amplifier mode, cost, power consumption etc.
- RF front-end filter responses among others.
- a harmonic/IM distortion level or the receiver image level relative to aggressor uplink (for harmonic/IM) or downlink (for receiver image) transmission power can be measured for typical and the worst-case performances.
- a UE can report such measures to the serving base station as part of capability exchanges. The base station can subsequently use this information jointly with power control updates and reported DL channel measurements in order to determine resource allocation on the aggressor carriers.
- the UE receives 702 a scheduling grant allocating uplink resource.
- the UE transmits 704 its suppression capability information in a radio resource control (RRC) message, wherein the suppression capability information is one or more of a harmonic, intermodulation, or receiver image level suppression relative to aggressor signal transmission power.
- RRC radio resource control
- the suppression capability information can be one or both of typical and worst-case suppression capability information.
- the suppression capability information can be based on one or more of wireless terminal measurements, and wireless terminal manufacturer's measurements and declarations.
- the suppression capability information based on wireless terminal measurements can be semi-static information due to filter, power amplifier, or other components' performance variation over temperatures.
- the UE may transmit the suppression capability information periodically to the serving base station or network entity.
- UE estimates its harmonic/IM suppression capability, which may vary in a semi-static way due to filter/PA or other components' performance variation over temperatures, and sends it to the base station (e.g., periodically).
- UE computes RSSI from a set of RBs (Set 1) affected by the harmonic/IM interference, and another RSSI from a set of RBs (Set 2) which is harmonic/IM interference-free, adjacent to Set 1 in frequency and/or time, and has the same number of RBs as Set 1.
- UE can assume that the difference between two computed RSSI values is an estimate of the harmonic/IM interference level, I h .
- the number of RBs in Set 1 and Set 2 may be different and the RSSI is normalized by the number of RBs in the set before taking the difference to estimate the harmonic/IM interference level.
- UE can obtain the estimated harmonic/IM suppression level as follows:
- P tx is a transmit power for corresponding aggressor uplink RBs
- D 1 is the bandwidth of the harmonic/IM interference measured in number of RBs
- D 2 is the number of desense RBs within Set 1 (D 2 ⁇ D 1 )
- I h is an estimate of the harmonic/IM interference level.
- the harmonic interference levels could be different on each receive antenna port depending on UE transceiver architectures and harmonic/IM scenarios. For example, in Band 4 and Band 17 aggregation, if UE transmits on one antenna, receives with two antennas, and RF chains for Band 17 and Band 4 are derived by the common antenna, then UE has lower harmonic interference level on the receive only antenna port by the antenna isolation level between the transmit antenna and the receive antenna. Thus, the interference estimation may be done independently at each receive antenna port.
- a resource allocation is a frequency and time allocation that maps information for a particular UE to resource blocks as determined by the scheduler. This allocation depends, for example, on the frequency-selective channel-quality indication reported by the UE to the scheduler. The channel-coding rate and the modulation scheme, which may be different for different resource blocks, are also determined by the scheduler and may also depend on the reported CQI.
- a UE may not be assigned every sub-carrier in a resource block. It could be assigned every Qth sub-carrier of a resource block, for example, to improve frequency diversity.
- a resource assignment can be a resource block or a fraction thereof. More generally, a resource assignment is a fraction of multiple resource blocks. Multiplexing of lower-layer control signaling may be based on time, frequency and/or code multiplexing.
- the radio resource allocated to a schedulable wireless communication entity is based on an interference impact of the schedulable wireless communication entity operating on the radio resource allocated.
- the interference impact may be based on any one or more of the following factors: a transmission waveform type of the schedulable wireless communication entity; a maximum allowed and current power level of the schedulable wireless communication entity; bandwidth assignable to the schedulable wireless communication entity; location of the assignable bandwidth in a carrier band; radio frequency distance (path loss) relative to another wireless communications entity; variation in the maximum transmit power of the schedulable wireless communication entity for the assigned bandwidth; separation of assigned band relative to the other wireless communication entity; reception bandwidth of the victim entity, minimum SNR required for operation of the victim entity; and reception multiple access processing (e.g., CDMA, OFDM, or TDMA), among other factors.
- the base station scheduler allocates 802 radio resources of the aggressor carrier to a UE potentially having the self-interference in a manner to protect UE's reception of critical downlink signals transmitted on the victim carrier such as synchronization channel (SCH), physical broadcast channel (PBCH) carrying MasterInformationBlock (MIB), and physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) carrying SystemInformationBlocks (SIBs) or paging message.
- SCH synchronization channel
- PBCH physical broadcast channel
- MIB MasterInformationBlock
- PDSCH physical downlink shared channel
- SIBs SystemInformationBlocks
- Band 4 (victim) and Band 17 (aggressor) aggregation
- the UE if the Band 4 carrier is configured as the PCell, the UE must be able to reliably decode MIB and SIBs on the Band 4 carrier. As per EUTRA LTE Rel-10 RRC specification TS 36.331, the UE is not expected to decode MIB and SIBs on the SCell. However, even when the carrier on Band 4 is configured as the SCell, the UE must be capable of continuously monitoring neighbor cells on the Band 4 carrier and completing handover or SCell-to-PCell changes where the new PCell is on the Band 4 carrier. This would necessitate a certain minimum detection performance of SCH on the Band 4 carrier.
- PBCH and SCH are transmitted on the center 6 PRBs of the transmission band on every 10 ms and 5 ms, respectively.
- SIBs and paging messages are transmitted on the part of transmission bandwidth with periodicities of multiple of transmission time interval (TTI). Therefore, protecting DL reception over a portion of the subbands in selected subframes can make the Band 4 carrier remain schedulable on the DL.
- the self-interference problem primarily arises from physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), SRS, and physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) and uplink data modulation-reference signal (DM-RS) transmissions on the Band 17 uplink carrier.
- PUCCH physical uplink control channel
- SRS physical uplink shared channel
- PUSCH physical uplink shared channel
- DM-RS uplink data modulation-reference signal
- the base station scheduler has flexibility on resource allocation of PUSCH/uplink DM-RS/SRS in terms of allocated subframes, frequency location, number of allocated RBs, and transmit power
- PUSCH/SRS/DM-RS can be transmitted without causing the harmonic interference to the MIB/SIB/paging/synchronization signal of the Band 4 DL carrier.
- the resources allocated for PUCCH transmission are semi-statically configured by the higher layer (RRC), which may limit scheduler-based coordination approaches.
- y ⁇ ( t ) ( a 1 + 3 ⁇ ⁇ a 2 4 ⁇ ⁇ z ⁇ ( t ) ⁇ 2 ) ⁇ Re ⁇ [ z ⁇ ( t ) ⁇ e j ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ f c ⁇ t ] + a 3 4 ⁇ Re ⁇ [ z 3 ⁇ ( t ) ⁇ e j2 ⁇ ⁇ ( 3 ⁇ ⁇ f c ) ⁇ t ]
- the frequency span at 3f c is simply equal to frequency span delimited by [3f 1,f c ,3f 2,f c ] where f 1,f c and f 2,f c are the minimum and maximum frequencies associated with the contiguous RA at f c .
- the response at 3f c must be determined by computing the self-convolution above.
- PUCCH spans 3 RBs towards the band edge (RB indices 2, 3, 4 and 95, 96 and 97 in this example) and PUSCH allocation spans RB indices 10 through 49 (Note, the example 3RB PUCCH is not compliant to current LTE spec, but same behavior is expected for 1RB PUCCH). It is assumed that PUSCH is transmitted at a power below that for PUCCH such that the difference of the power spectrum density (PSD) is equal to 7 dB.
- PSD power spectrum density
- FIG. 9 shows the PSD of UL transmission at f and the effect of self-convolution at 3f c for slot 0 and slot 1 separately.
- the region of interest at 3f c is restricted to the RB range [ ⁇ 49, 50] as the response outside of this range is filtered by the UE receive path. If the victim DL center frequency is equal to 3f c where f c is the UL center frequency, clearly, a substantial portion the DL bandwidth can potentially be interfered with due to the self-convolution component.
- the PUSCH allocation is modified to span 2 clusters such that each cluster has 20 RBs. Further suppose that the PUSCH RBs adjoin PUCCH RBs.
- the responses at f c and 3f c are shown in FIG. 10( a ) .
- the PSD in dB scale of the self-convolution at 3f c over the center 30 PRBs is shown in FIG. 10( b ) .
- the DL center frequency for the high-band is at 3f c . If this is not the case, it is still possible to break single cluster PUSCH into multiple clusters in a way that transmission nulls are created over the desired narrowband as long as the PUSCH resource allocation size is within a certain limit.
- FIG. 11 shows that one embodiment for guaranteeing the reliable downlink control information for the serving cell associated with the victim carrier is to use cross-carrier scheduling, which transmits 1102 a PDCCH for indicating uplink or downlink grant on the serving cell associated with the victim component carrier on another DL component carrier.
- cross-carrier scheduling which transmits 1102 a PDCCH for indicating uplink or downlink grant on the serving cell associated with the victim component carrier on another DL component carrier.
- the serving base station transmits a PDCCH conveying the scheduling information on resources of the Band 4 UL or DL carrier for the UE on the Band 17 DL carrier.
- a PDCCH conveying the scheduling information on resources of the Band 4 UL or DL carrier for the UE on the Band 17 DL carrier.
- PHICH physical hybrid ARQ indicator channel
- FIG. 11 shows a method of communication over the downlink and uplink channels to protect the downlink control information.
- the method does not transmit 1104 aggressor PUCCH or PUSCH on a subset of symbols.
- the method also applies 1106 a Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) to some symbols of the subframe.
- the UE can determine, based on the current value of timing advance (TA), the minimum set of UL symbols ( 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 ) at the aggressor carrier that de-senses the PDCCH symbols at the victim carrier.
- TA timing advance
- the UE can then either blank 1108 these symbols or apply 1110 an MPR on these symbols different from the one being applied for that slot.
- the base station boosts 1112 the PDCCH transmit power or lowers 1114 the code rate of the PDCCH to avoid the increased rate of PDCCH false detection due to the self-interference.
- the code rate of the PDCCH can be lowered by aggregating more control channel elements (CCEs), in the victim serving cell.
- the scheduler can allocate the radio resource based on the interference impact by assigning bandwidth based on power headroom of the schedulable wireless communication entity.
- the scheduler can find a bandwidth size that reduces the self-interference such that the required power reduction does not exceed the allowed MPR and A-MPR of the schedulable wireless communication entity.
- a scheduler may also control leakage into adjacent and non-contiguous adjacent bands by scheduling mobile terminals that are “close” to the serving cell in terms of path loss with bandwidth allocations that occupy the entire carrier band or a bandwidth allocation that includes resource blocks that are at the edge of the carrier band (e.g., 5 MHz UTRA or LTE carrier) since due to power control it is very unlikely that such a terminal will be operating at or near to PMAX and therefore unlikely that its current power level would be limited by the operational maximum power (PMAX-MPR-AMPR).
- a scheduler may schedule terminals that have little or no power margin with bandwidth allocations that exclude resource blocks at the carrier band edge reducing the likelihood of the terminal being power limited by the operational maximum power.
- UE power amplifiers give rise to undesired adjacent band interference in broad proportion, for a given PA design, to the mean power offered to the PA input.
- the frequency at which interference occurs is at 3 or 5 times the frequency of the input signal components, or harmonics thereof.
- the power of such out-of-band components generally increases at 3 or 5 times the rate of increase of the input power level.
- mobile terminals may control their out of band emission levels by limiting the power to the PA.
- a mobile terminal Given a specific rated maximum output (or input) power level designed to achieve a given level of interference into an adjacent frequency band, or level of in-band distortion, a mobile terminal may elect to adjust, for example, reduce its input, power level in order to reduce such unwanted effects.
- the mobile terminal may also keep its power at a given level, but adjust its operating point (load, bias, supply, etc.) to effect adjustment of the emission levels.
- a decision to increase or decrease the input or output PA power may be subject to other criteria, including waveform bandwidth, location in a frequency band, waveform quality metric, among other considerations.
- the wireless communication terminal changes the maximum transmit power limit on a per-slot basis as means of reducing the impact of harmonic or intermodulation distortion on the receive band.
- PUCCH is transmitted on different frequency segments across slots (e.g., in the lower half transmission band relative to DC subcarrier on slot 0 and in the upper half transmission band relative to DC subcarrier in slot 1 )
- the frequency location where harmonic/IM distortions fall changes for different slots. Therefore, the UE can implement slot-based desense-MPR (D-MPR) by applying the UL power control equations as below.
- D-MPR desense-MPR
- P CMAX (n s ) the configured maximum UE transmit power set within the following bounds: P CMAX _ L ( n s ) ⁇ P CMAX ( n s ) ⁇ P CMAX _ H where
- the parameter ⁇ F _ PUCCH (F) is provided by higher layers.
- h(n CQI ,n HARQ ) is a PUCCH format dependent value, where n CQI corresponds to the number of information bits for the channel quality information and n HARQ is the number of HARQ bits.
- P O _ PUCCH is a parameter composed of the sum of a cell specific parameter, P O _ NOMINAL _ PUCCH provided by higher layers, and a UE specific component P O _ UE _ PUCCH provided by higher layers.
- g(i) is the current PUCCH power control adjustment state and where g( 0 ) is the first value after reset activated in closed-loop power control mode.
- PL is the base station to UE path loss.
- the terminal is typically configured to send reports indicating its available power headroom to assist the scheduler in the base station to allocate resources in an appropriate manner. Since the configured maximum UE transmit power, Pcmax (defined per component carrier), changes at slot boundary within a subframe for a given UL channel (i.e., PUCCH, PUSCH, SRS), it is beneficial for the base station to know the value of Pcmax in each slot so that it can assess the MPR, A-MPR, D-MPR, etc. applied by the UE in each slot. In one embodiment, the UE reports the pair of values for Pcmax (two slots) to the base station bundled in a power headroom report (PHR). Then, the base station must be able to determine the range of actual power backoff applied by the UE on a slot-wise basis to properly take into account the variation of SNR across the symbol and slot boundaries in demodulation and decoding.
- Pcmax defined per component carrier
- the UE may determine 1202 based on a downlink signal whether an uplink signal is scheduled for transmission on the uplink channel in a subframe, wherein the uplink signal spans at least two timeslots in the subframe and the uplink signal comprises a first set of resource blocks in a first timeslot and a second set of resource blocks, different from the first set of resource blocks, in a second time slot; determine 1204 a first value for power reduction for transmission of the uplink signal in the first timeslot, determine 1206 a second value for power reduction for transmission of the uplink signal in the second timeslot; and transmit 1208 the uplink signal in the subframe comprising at least the first timeslot and the second timeslot based on the first value for power reduction and the second value for power reduction.
- the UE may determine 1210 a first value of configured maximum transmission power (Pcmax( 0 )) based on the first value for power reduction applicable to the first timeslot, and determine 1212 a second value of configured maximum transmission power (Pcmax( 1 )) based on the second value for power reduction applicable to the second timeslot, and report the first configured maximum transmission power Pcmax( 0 ) and the second first configured maximum transmission power Pcmax( 1 ) to a first base station.
- Pcmax( 0 ) configured maximum transmission power
- Pcmax( 1 ) based on the second value for power reduction applicable to the second timeslot
- the UE may determine 1214 whether self-interference including harmonic and intermodulation interference can result or occur on the downlink channel based on the scheduled uplink signal transmission in the first timeslot and the second timeslot on the uplink channel and determine 1216 the first value for power reduction based on the determined self-interference in the first timeslot, and determine 1218 the second value for power reduction based on the determined self-interference in the second timeslot.
- the UE may determine whether self-interference can result on a subframe on the downlink channel, when the subframe comprises critical downlink control information including one or more of primary synchronization channel, secondary synchronization channel, Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH), System Information Block (SIB) message, and paging message.
- PBCH Physical Broadcast Channel
- SIB System Information Block
- UE may determine the first value for power reduction in the first slot and the second value for power reduction on the second slot on the uplink channel based on an indication of the severity of a harmonic or intermodulation interference on the first downlink channel resulting from uplink signal transmission in one or both of the first and second slot on the uplink channel.
- the UE may report a power headroom report to the first base station.
- the power headroom report may comprise a power headroom value for the first timeslot and/or a power headroom value for the second timeslot.
- the power headroom report may comprise a power headroom value derived from the power headroom value for the first timeslot and the power headroom value for the second timeslot.
