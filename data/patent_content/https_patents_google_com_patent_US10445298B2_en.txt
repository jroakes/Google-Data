Definitions
- This invention relates generally to data management, data protection, disaster recovery and business continuity. More specifically, this invention relates to a system and method for reading and writing data to object storage.
- Copy data systems typically use block input/output (I/O) when replicating copy data to a remote target CDS using asynchronous deduplication and dedup replication.
- Block I/O usually includes writing and reading data that is organized as logical blocks (e.g., 512 byte blocks). Block I/O maintains an address for the logical blocks, but does not keep hierarchical information about data objects associated with the logical blocks.
- object data stores organize data as objects and tracks hierarchical relationships between data objects.
- Object stores offered by both public and private cloud providers offer cost effective means for long term data retention (e.g., 7 years or more). The reliability of these object stores make them effective replacements to the existing tape technology.
- existing copy data systems use block I/O to replicate data to a remote target, existing copy data systems do not have the capability to read or write from an object data store at a remote target.
- systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable media are provided for enabling a service level agreement to specify interactions between an application and a remotely located object store that manages data as objects.
- the disclosed subject matter includes a method for receiving first data associated with a first request to write application data to an object store according to a first schedule, wherein the first data is file system data.
- a computing device creates a first snapshot associated with the first requested application at a snapshot pool.
- the computing device transmits first instructions to a cloud formatting engine to create a first virtual disk at a storage pool associated with an object store, the first disk being structured to accept file system data.
- the computing device copies the first snapshot from the snapshot pool to the first virtual disk, the first snapshot comprising file system data.
- the computing device transmits instructions to the cloud formatting engine to convert the data associated with the first snapshot into an object, and move the object from the first virtual disk to the object store, thereby enabling a service level agreement to specify interactions between an application and a remotely located object store that manages data as objects.
- the computing device receives second data associated with a second request from a requesting application to read application data from the object store at a first time. In some embodiments, the computing device transmits second instructions to the cloud formatting engine to mount a second snapshot, the snapshot associated with the second data, and present the second application image as a second virtual disk on the storage pool associated with the object store. In some embodiments, the computing device presents the second virtual disk to the requesting application at a second time.
- the computing device provides a scratch disk to cache writes associated with the second snapshot, the cache writes including identification information associated with the second snapshot.
- the difference between the first time and the second time is approximately 2 minutes.
- the object store is associated with a long-term storage of the application data.
- the computing device creates a directory structure associated with the object store, the directory structure comprising a logical representation of the object store.
- the first instructions include data associated with the directory structure.

- Systems and methods described herein enable copy data systems to read and write from an object data store.
- Service level agreements can be configured to include policies that schedule replication of data to object storage (e.g., from snapshot storage to object storage).
- the systems and methods described herein treat the object storage as another storage tier and the copy data system manages the metadata for images in the object store.
- Some embodiments also include a desktop that is used to manage both a copy data appliance and to retrieve or mount images from the object store.
- the systems and methods described herein also allow multiple vault pools each backed by an associated object store. For example, end-user can choose to move one set of applications to a first storage, (e.g., Google Nearline), and another set of applications to a second storage, (e.g., Amazon S3), all controlled by an SLA that governs the application.
- a first storage e.g., Google Nearline
- a second storage e.g., Amazon S3
- FIG. 1 is a system diagram showing the movement of snapshot data to a remote filesystem during copy data replication.
- FIG. 1 shows a primary site 102 and data replication site 104 .
- Primary site 102 includes applications 110 , copy data management system 112 , snapshot pool 114 , and dedup pool 116 .
- Disaster recovery site 104 includes copy data management system 120 , dedup pool 122 , snapshot pool 124 and replicated data 126 .
- Primary site 102 is the location of end-user's production data and applications. There is a copy data management system 112 installed on the primary site 102 .
- the copy data management system 112 manages 2 pools of storage:
- Copy data management system 112 from the primary site 102 replicates to another copy data management system 120 which is installed in the disaster recovery site 104 .
- Copy data management system 120 also contains a snapshot pool 124 and a de-duplication pool 122 .
- data is de-duplicated and compressed on the primary site 102 prior to replication.
- Replicated data lands in the de-duplication pool 122 on the disaster recovery site 104 .
- This data is then re-hydrated and moved to the snapshot pool 124 and applications 126 on the Disaster Recovery site 104 can then access this data.
- the workflow for migrating data from primary site 102 to disaster recovery site 104 begins with data being ingested either into the snapshot pool 114 or the de-duplication pool 116 on the primary site 102 . If data is ingested in the snapshot pool 114 , it is moved to the de-duplication pool where it is compressed and de-duplicated. Data is then replicated from the primary site 102 to the de-duplication pool 122 on the disaster recovery site 104 . From the de-duplication pool 122 on the disaster recovery site 104 , data is rehydrated into the snapshot pool 124 . Once data is in the snapshot pool 124 , applications 126 can access this data. Additional details describing the movement of snapshot data to a remote filesystem during copy data replication can be found in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/947,385, titled “System and Method for Managing Data with Service Level Agreements That May Specify Non-Uniform Copying of Data,” filed Nov. 16, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety.
- FIG. 2 is a system diagram showing the movement of snapshot data to a remote object storage during copy data replication, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 shows a primary site 202 and cloud object storage 206 .
- Primary site 202 includes applications 110 , copy data management system 216 , snapshot pool 114 , dedup pool 116 , vault pool 214 , scheduler 208 , unified data processing (UDP) engine 210 , and cloud formatting engine 212 .
- UDP unified data processing
- copy data management system 216 As described above, application 110 is being protected at copy data management system 216 .
- the SLA for this application is configured by copy data management system 216 (also referred to herein as copy data system and copy data appliance) to vault to object store 206 (e.g., Google Nearline Object store).
- Copy data management system 216 moves application images from snapshot pool 114 to object store 206 per a defined application SLA. For example, the application SLA can call for periodic vaulting of these application images to object store 206 .
- Unified Data Processing (UDP) Engine 210 which receives instructions from a scheduler within copy data management system 216 , coordinates the movement of application images snapshot pool 114 to object store 206 .
- the scheduler 208 executes jobs per policy in the copy data management system 216 .
- Copy data management system 216 provides policy based data management for all applications. End users can create policies that govern the life cycle of a given application. The scheduler 208 provides life to this policy by actively executing tasks (also referred to herein as jobs) to ensure that applications adhere to the policies they are assigned. Vaulting data to an object store 206 can also be specified as a policy.
- the scheduler 208 can ensure that the corresponding application data is vaulted to the object store 206 as specified in the policy. In addition to starting jobs to vault data to object store, the scheduler 208 can also look at the life cycle for vaulted data and expire jobs when data is past the retention period specified in a vault policy.
- the UDP engine 210 is the data processing entity in the copy data management system 216 .
- the UDP engine 210 receives input from the scheduler 208 for performing a variety of operations based on the source and target of the application being manipulated. For example, UDP engine 210 can receive instructions to vault data into an object store from scheduler 208 . UDP engine 210 orchestrates this data movement by invoking (e.g., sending instructions to) the cloud formatting engine 212 to perform the actual data movement. The UDP engine 210 also generates the metadata for this data movement that it persists after completion. Upon completion, the UDP engine 210 then informs the scheduler which then re-schedules this job for the next run.
- the UDP engine 210 sends an instruction to the cloud formatting engine 212 to mount the object store as a local file-system.
- UDP engine 210 then initiates the data copy into the object store by copying the source data (located in the snapshot pool 114 ) to the mount point.
- the cloud formatting engine 212 in turn moves this data to the object store, optimizing the writes for the best performance.
- writes are performed at a 64K boundary using a method that by-passes file-system caching (e.g., O_DIRECT).
- O_DIRECT for example, also avoids a typical read-modify-write scenario where a partial block write needs to fetch data from the disk modify it and then rewrite it back to disk.
- UDP engine 210 supports vault jobs.
- vault jobs move data from snapshot pool 114 to vault pool 214 , thus moving data to object stores for long term retention.
- UDP engine 210 can also manage clone and mount jobs that provide end users access to data in object store.
- Clone jobs can move entire data sets from object store 206 to snapshot pool 114 while mount jobs provide instant (or near instant) access to data on object stores 206 .
- Instant access as referred to herein refers to near instant access and is associated with certain times as described in more detail below.
- UDP engine 210 can also expire jobs from object store 206 when the data has reached its retention.
- Object store 206 is logically presented to copy data management system 216 as vault pool 214 .
- the vault pool 214 is a logical representation of the cloud based object store 206 . Unlike the snap pool 114 or the dedup pool 116 copy data management system 216 does not actively manage this storage.
- Vault pool 214 is a logical representation of the remote cloud object store that the cloud formatting engine 212 presents as a local data store. In some embodiments, an end user can have multiple vault pools each represented by a different cloud based object store.
- Cloud formatting engine 212 presents a disk like block storage interface for object store 206 .
- cloud formatting engine 212 is a file system in user space (FUSE) based program and presents a logical disk interface to an object store back-end 206 .
- Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a software interface for Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a bridge to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device.
- Cloud formatting engine 212 transfers data to object stores, keeping a catalog of objects in the object store and also provides the capability to mount data for instance access from the object store (e.g., S3Backer that interfaces to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) object store S3).
- object store e.g., S3Backer that interfaces to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) object store S3
- cloud formatting engine 212 also includes a block naming scheme for an object store (e.g., AWS). To avoid metadata processing hotspots associated with an object store, in some embodiments, consecutive block IDs do not translate to object names with common prefixes.
- the cloud formatting engine 212 includes an asynchronous option of filling out a non-zero block bitmap (used to optimize out reads/writes of zero-filled blocks). This allows for a local device to store incremental changes to a bucket on a local block device while leaving a cloud data set immutable. With this enhancement, cloud data can be presented as a read-writeable mount to a host. All writes coming from a host will be sent to the local device thus leaving the cloud data unchanged. Data in the object store, which is often used for long term retention, can be immutable thereby leaving the archive copy untouched for compliance purposes.
- cloud formatting engine 212 includes error handling to recognize error types that do not need retries and a storing bucket configuration (e.g., block size, dataset size, compression/encryption settings (on/off), etc.) in the cloud to minimize (critical) mistakes leading to the loss of data.
- cloud formatting engine 212 includes an authentication mechanism that performs authentication using native security APIs from other vendors (e.g., Google Nearline's native security APIs). Including this authentication mechanism allows the copy data management system 216 to work with object stores from different vendors (e.g., Google Nearline, which is Google's public object store).
- cloud formatting engine 212 can talk to multiple object store providers like Google, Microsoft Azure etc.
- cloud formatting engine 212 includes a separate authentication layer to authenticate with native APIs from a plurality of different vendors.
- the authentication layer includes authentication modules that are specialized for various storage backends.
- the cloud formatting engine 212 includes a security module with new interfaces that can take a generic set of parameters as deemed necessary by an object store vendor cloud formatting engine is writing to.
- the parameters can be customized per a cloud provider's requirements. For example, the parameters can include bucket-name, access-id and access-key for an Amazon S3 Backer and a bucket-name P12 certificate for Google.
- UDP engine 210 For moving data to object storage 206 , UDP engine 210 creates vault application images on the disk presented by cloud formatting engine 212 . Cloud formatting engine 212 in turn converts this application image to objects and dispatches them to the object store 206 as configured by the SLA. UDP engine 210 interacts with cloud formatting engine 212 and moves application data 110 to the vault pool 214 . As described above, vault pool 214 is a logical end point for the cloud storage 206 presented by cloud formatting engine 212 . Cloud formatting engine 212 in turn moves this data to the object store 206 as specified in the policy. The end user configures a vault pool 214 on a user interface, which is shown and described in more detail below. The vault pool 214 is backed by an object store of the user's choice.
- Each vault image is given a unique name that is unique in the global namespace of all images in that object store. Appliance ID, application ID, backup-image ID and a time-stamp make up the unique application ID for a given image.
- This directory structure is then passed to cloud formatting engine 212 for it to use as a logical end point of the object store.
- This logical end-point is the mount point for the image that is stored in the object store 206 .
- the image actually is not located in the directory but is mounted to a location specified by the directory. This establishes the link where any file transferred to that end point is automatically sent to the object store that is backed by the end point.
- Vaulting jobs run by the UDP engine 210 involves copying the data to the logical end point at which point cloud formatting engine 212 automatically moves this data to the object store backing this logical end point.
- each image that is vaulted can be assigned a specific prefix or identifier to easily find it in the object store.
- the prefix helps the object store index these images efficiently for faster access.
- the index assigned to each vault image is also stored in metadata.
- data stored in the object store is split into one or more small object files such that every volume stored in the object store is given a unique prefix.
- Copy data management system 216 protects application data along with its associated metadata when moving data from the snapshot pool to vault pool 214 .
- the metadata object describes the application data and can be used to restore this application data.
- the metadata describes the file-system type and options to mount the file-system.
- metadata can contain the database name and configuration data to recover the database.
- metadata is stored as an object in the vault object store.
- a special object name (“metadata”) can be used as prefix for the metadata objects. Metadata can also include information about data volumes.
- FIG. 3 is a system diagram showing a mount of application images from an object store, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 shows similar elements as FIG. 2 , which operate in a similar fashion as described above.
- copy data management system 216 enables a mount of that image with very limited data movement.
- An advantage to mounting with limited data movement is nearly instant access to data stored at the object store 206 .
- a mount is initiated when the end-user wants a second or an older copy of application data 110 that has been moved to object store 206 .
- UDP engine 210 receives an instruction associated with a user request through a user interface to present a volume of data as a disk to a specified host.
- the UDP engine 210 in copy data appliance 216 looks up in its metadata and determines that the image being asked for has been vaulted to the object store 1009 .
- the UDP engine 210 also fetches from the metadata the prefix associated with this image.
- the UDP engine 210 then invokes cloud formatting engine 212 with the image name and prefix and sends instructions to the cloud formatting engine 212 with a request to present a logical mount of this image to a logical end point in the vault pool 214 on the appliance that represents remote object store 206 .
- Copy data management system 216 then makes a logical mount of that application image as a disk on itself and then presents that disk via a local-area or wide-area network (e.g., iSCSI) to the application requesting the mount.
- UDP engine 210 can also present a scratch device to this mount to cache all the writes that come from the host. In some embodiments, the writes are cached and saved until the host holds on to the mount. These writes and the scratch disk itself are discarded once the host releases the mount using the un-mount operation.
- near instant access as described herein can be associated with certain timings.
- the time associated with cloud formatting engine 212 completing the request to mount a volume from the object store can be approximately one minute or less (e.g., 5-60 seconds).
- the time associated with presenting the disk can be approximately a few seconds (e.g., 1-10 seconds).
- the time associated with processing metadata can be approximately a few seconds (e.g., 30-60 seconds).
- the total time associated with a user requesting a copy of application data at an object store to the time the requested data is mounted at the specified host can be approximately 2 minutes.
- the time for mounting data of any size be it a few megabyte file or a few terabyte file is the same.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating techniques for backing up an image to object storage, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- UDP engine 210 receives instructions from scheduler 208 to move application images into the snapshot pool 114 per a configured SLA 402 .
- an SLA can specify a schedule for taking snapshots of application data (e.g., once every hour, once a day, once a week).
- UDP engine 210 receives a request to vault application data 404 .
- the request includes a specification of a vault pool.
- UDP engine 210 sends an instruction to cloud formatting engine to create a logical file-system at the specified vault pool representing the object store 214 406 .
- the application image is then copied to the file-system at the vault pool 408 .
- Cloud formatting engine 212 which manages the vault pool, in turn moves this data into the backing object store 206 406 .
- UDP engine catalogues the stored application images in a job catalog database.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating techniques for mounting an image from object storage, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
- UDP engine 210 invokes cloud formatting engine 212 to mount that image logically on the vault pool 214 504 .
- Cloud backer 212 looks up the application image and presents it as a disk on the vault pool 214 .
- UDP engine 210 then presents this disk to an application (specified by the end-user) via the iSCSI protocol 506 .
- UDP engine 210 also provides a scratch disk to cache all the writes coming to this image.
- Most operating systems require writing header and drive information to any disk they are mounting. Microsoft Windows, for instance, assigns drive letters to mounts, and Linux assigns IDs to drives such that the drives are unique in the system. Disks that are mounted read-only require supporting small amount of metadata writes.
- Vault jobs in contrast, write to object stores and the primary intent for long term data retention is to ensure that the written data is immutable.
- copy data appliance when mounting data from object stores, copy data appliance also provides a thin provisioned disk (referred to herein as a scratch disk) to support small metadata writes.
- the scratch disk buffers all the writes that come to the mounted disk (from the object store). This provides an application the ability to write metadata and for copy data appliance the ability to keep the data in the object store intact. Because the data in the vault can be immutable, in some embodiments, the writes to the scratch disk are discarded upon unmount.
