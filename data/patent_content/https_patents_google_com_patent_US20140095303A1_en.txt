Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to interactive maps and, more specifically, to personalizing interactive maps.
- Interactive maps are often used to obtain information about geographically distributed features, such as roads, cities, states, businesses, rivers, lakes, and the like.
- the interactive map is viewed on a user device, such as in a web browser or mapping application of a laptop or smart phone, and the viewed information is provided by a remote server over the Internet.
- users interact with the map by commanding (e.g., by touching or clicking on the interface) the map to pan, zoom, or otherwise change the geographic extent depicted in the map viewport, and the remote server provides information responsive to these interactions.
- users often enter search terms to cause the interactive map to depict a responsive geographic extent or request a map depicting the user's current location as determined by, for example, a GPS device in a smartphone.
- Some aspects include a process for personalizing an interactive map that includes the following: receiving a user request to view an interactive map; determining a map extent responsive to the request; obtaining a profile of the user; generating, with a computer, a personalized interactive map based on the profile; and presenting the personalized map to the user.
- Generating the personalized map based on the profile may include obtaining candidate features within a geographic extent specified by the user request from a geographic information system, the candidate features having a prominence ranking determined without regard to the user profile before receiving the user request; adjusting the prominence ranking of some of the candidate features based on the user profile; for each candidate feature, using the adjusted prominence ranking to determine whether to depict the respective candidate feature; and for each depicted feature, using the adjusted prominence ranking to format the corresponding depiction.
- Some aspects include a system having one or more processors and memory storing program code that when executed by the one or more processors causes the one or more processors to perform the above-described process.
- Some aspects include a tangible, machine-readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a data processing apparatus causes the data processes apparatus to perform the above-described process.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of an interactive map system in accordance with some embodiments
- FIG. 2 illustrates a process for personalizing an interactive map in accordance with some embodiments
- FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate interactive maps of identical map extents personalized for two different users in accordance with some embodiments
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a computer system by which various portions of the above described system and processes may be implemented.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of an interactive map system 10 having a map server 12 capable of personalizing interactive maps on user devices 14 based on corresponding user profiles in a user profile data store 16 .
- the maps are personalized in order to account for a limited user appetite for, and capacity to process presented information, so the map does not overwhelm the user with excessive information of little interest or obscure information in which the user is likely to be interested.
- the map server 12 has access to substantially more information about a geographic area depicted in an interactive map (i.e., a map extent) than is of interest to a user, so the map server 12 determines which information is presented and how prominently that information is presented within the interactive map. Embodiments make these determinations on a person by person basis, using corresponding user profiles stored in the data store 16 . Thus, different users with different profiles are presented with different information and differently visually formatted information even when viewing an identical map extent at the same time.
- Maps are personalized in a variety of different ways by modifying a variety of different aspects of the map, but a specific example is illustrative.
- a given user profile may indicate a preference for Indian cuisine (e.g., due to the user rating restaurants in this category above a threshold rating), that the user resides in the United States (e.g., as indicated by an average location of the user's location history), and that the user has recently searched for hotels in London (e.g., according a search history in the user profile).
- map server 12 in response to a query from the user for “London England,” some embodiments of the map server 12 present the user with an interactive map of London England with Indian restaurants and sites of interest to tourists displayed and visually formatted relatively prominently, for example with a font size and color selected for emphasis, while a user submitting the same query but without a profile would not be presented with this information in this format.
- a different user profile may indicate that a user resides in London and has recently searched for dog parks.
- An interactive map of the same extent but for the second user does not depict the Indian restaurants or sites of interest to tourists, but does depict features likely to be of interest to a resident of the city who has a dog, such as a pet grooming business near (e.g., within a threshold distance of) the user's residence and a recently opened (e.g., within a threshold time) restaurant near a bar that the user frequently checks into, according to the second user's profile.
- a pet grooming business near (e.g., within a threshold distance of) the user's residence and a recently opened (e.g., within a threshold time) restaurant near a bar that the user frequently checks into, according to the second user's profile.
- identical requests for interactive maps yield information selected and visually formatted to direct the user's attention to features that are likely to be relevant to the individual user (but not necessarily to users in general) and avoid cluttering the map with information that is likely to be a little interest to the user, as indicated by the user's profile.
- the map server 12 obtains information to be presented from a geographic information system 18 and an advertisement server 20 .
- the geographic information (GIS) 18 is operative to identify features within a map extent based on stored associations between feature names and their geographic location and stored relationships between features, e.g., which features, such as a business, are within an area of another feature, such as a city.
- the identified features are each associated with an age of the feature, indicating when the feature was added to the GIS 18 , a value which is used identify newer features likely to be of interest to residents of an area.
- the map server 12 requests features from the GIS 18 and determines which features are presented in a map and how those features are formatted visually in the presentation.
- the features stored in the GIS 18 are assigned a default rank that, in maps that are not personalized according to user profiles, affects (e.g., is the sole determinant or is one factor among others) which features are presented and the visual formatting of those features.
- interstate highways in the United States have a relatively low rank (multiple features within a map may have the same rank, such as multiple interstate highways), and smaller roads, such as a neighborhood road ending in a cul-de-sac, have a relatively high default rank.
- the lower ranking interstate highway may be presented, while the higher ranking smaller roads is omitted from the map to avoid clutter, except at relatively detailed zoom levels, i.e., at relatively small map extents.
- the advertisement server 20 is operative to provide advertisements to be presented with the interactive map based on, e.g., the map extent, the request that caused the map to be presented, or the corresponding user's profile, in response to a request from the map server 12 or a user device 14 . After presenting an ad, the entity operating the map server 12 is compensated by an advertiser.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the system 10 .
- the illustrated system 10 includes three user devices 14 , but embodiments are consistent with substantially more user devices. These devices may be any of a variety of different computing devices, examples of which are described below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the user devices 14 include an operating system and may include a browser in which the interactive map is rendered for a user and through which the user interacts with the interactive map by, for example, requesting that the map be zoomed in or out, panned, or that a map corresponding to a map search query be presented.
- a special-purpose mapping application executes on the user devices, displays the map to the user, and receives user commands.
- User devices 14 communicate with the map server 12 in sessions, which begin when a user initially requests an interactive map and end when the user navigates away from the map server.
- the user profile contains both data from previous sessions of the user with the interactive map and data from user interactions with other services than those provided by the map server 12 .
- Other services include web-based or special-purposes applications in which a user device 14 communicates with a remote server and by which users review places or rate places, interact with social networks, record places and web resources of interest to the user (e.g., bookmarked places or websites), check in to places on location-based social networks.
- the user profile contains a user's search history from user queries submitted to a universal search engine that is responsive to topics other than those relating to maps and user selections of search results.
- the profile may also include user preferences (e.g., types of events, cuisine, or activities in which the user is interested) and attributes (e.g., the location of user's residence or work) provided by the user to facilitate better personalization of maps.
- the data store 16 stores a plurality of user profiles, and each profile is associated with (e.g. uniquely matched to) a user device, a user account, or other value by which users are distinguished from one another by the map server 12 .
- the map server 12 communicates with user devices 14 , the user profile data store 16 , the GIS 18 , and the advertisement server 20 via, for example, the Internet 22 or various networks, such as local-area networks, wireless area networks, and cellular networks.
- the map server 12 of this embodiment includes a map search engine 24 , a user identifier module 26 , a map personalizer 28 , and a presentation module 34 .
- These components, and the other components of the system 10 are illustrated as discrete functional blocks, but program code and hardware by which the functional blocks are implemented may be conjoined, distributed, subdivided, intermingled, or otherwise differently organized relative to the arrangement of FIG. 1 .
- Program code by which the functionality described herein is implemented may be stored on a tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium, and when this program code is executed by a data processing apparatus, such as one or more computer systems, that data processing apparatus performs the operations described herein.
- the map search engine 24 of this embodiment is operative to receive a user query for an interactive map, such as a query expressed in text by the user and naming a place, and determine a map extent that is responsive to that query.
- the map search engine 24 cooperates with the GIS 18 to identify terms within the query corresponding to geographic locations and a map extent corresponding to the query. For instance, a query for “Austin, Tex.,” or a query for “capital of Texas” received by the map search engine 24 causes the map search engine 24 to determine a map extent corresponding to Austin Tex., a place for which the location (including bounding area) and names are associated by the GIS 18 .
- the user identifier module 26 is operative to determine whether a user profile is associated with the received query and, if so, identify (e.g., uniquely identify among the stored user profiles) the corresponding user profile. For example, the user identifier 26 determines whether the user is logged in to the map server 12 or whether another identifier associated with the request, for instance an Internet protocol address, is associated with a user profile. The user identifier module 26 further determines whether user specified privacy controls indicate a user preference for using the user profile information in the manner described here and, in response, selectively permits the use of user profile information in accordance with the privacy controls.
- the map personalizer 28 of this embodiment is operative to receive the user profile, the map extent, and features within the identified map extent and personalize an interactive map. To this end, the map personalizer 28 determines, based on the user profile, which features within the map extent will be presented and a visual weight, or prominence, of those features by selecting visual formatting attributes, such as fonts, line weight, drop shadows, font color, font size, and the like, among a plurality of candidate settings for such visual attributes. In some embodiments, the map personalizer 28 performs this determination in real-time (e.g. within less than one second of receiving the user's request for interactive map).
- the features received from the GIS 18 are each associated with a default rank.
- Some embodiments of the map personalizer 28 adjust this default rank based on the user profile if a profile is available.
- Features likely to be relevant to the user, as inferred from the user profile are adjusted by decreasing the rank of those features, making the features more prominent and more likely to be depicted at a given zoom level.
- features likely to be of little relevance to the user, as inferred from the user profile are adjusted by increasing their rank.
- a flyfishing equipment store may have a relatively high default rank, making it unlikely that that flyfishing equipment store would appear in a map of the state of California, i.e., at a relatively low granularity zoom level, but a user profile indicating a strong interest in flyfishing (e.g., one having more than a threshold amount of queries including the term “flyfishing” in the user's search history) may cause the rank of that flyfishing equipment store to be decreased to the point at which the store appears in a map depicting the entire state of California.
- a user profile indicating a strong interest in flyfishing e.g., one having more than a threshold amount of queries including the term “flyfishing” in the user's search history
- the map personalizer 28 includes a feature selector 30 and a visual formatter 32 .
- the feature selector 30 is operative to determine which features are presented in the interactive map among the set of features within the map extent.
- the feature selector 30 receives a map extent, a plurality of candidate geographic features within that map extent, and the user profile. Based on the user profile, some of the candidate geographic features are added to a result set of geographic features to be presented in the interactive map and some of the candidate geographic features are omitted from the result set of features to be presented. Examples of this determination are described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the illustrated visual formatter 32 is operative to determine a visual format with which the geographic features are presented in the interactive map based on the user profile.
- the visual formatter 32 selects a visual format—such as a font size, a font color, a drop shadow, a line weight, a feature color, a transparency, a feature size, a three dimensional feature presentation, or other format attributes, including various sub combinations of the listed attributes.
- the visual format is selected from among a plurality of candidate combinations of format attributes (e.g., from among candidate styles each defining a group of visual formatting options applied together).
- the selection of a visual format is based on the inferred relevance of the corresponding feature derived from the user profile, e.g., based on an adjusted rank corresponding to a candidate style. Examples of this selection are described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the presentation module 34 is operative to receive the selected features and visual formatting from the map personalizer 28 and, in response, present a responsive interactive map to the corresponding user device 14 from which the request was received.
- the presentation module 34 renders images depicting the selected features (and omitting the unselected features) with the selected visual formatting and transmits the rendered images (which may be rendered in real-time) to the corresponding user device 14 along with instructions to display the images within the interactive map. Examples of the interactive map are described in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a process 36 for personalizing an interactive map based on a user profile.
- the process 36 is performed by embodiments of the map server 12 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- program code that, when executed by a data processing apparatus, causes the data processing apparatus to perform the process 36 , is stored on a tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium.
- the process 36 includes receiving a user request to view an interactive map, as shown by block 38 , and determining a map extent responsive to the request, as shown by block 40 .
- determining a map extent includes parsing a text query, querying the GIS 18 for geographic features corresponding to the parsed query terms, and identifying the location of those geographic features in a response from the GIS 18 .
- the map extent is determined in the received user requests, for example in a request to show the user's current location and a predefined amount of surrounding area.
- the map extent may be expressed in a variety of formats, for example as a center point and a zoom level or as latitudes and longitudes of the vertices of a bounding box.
- the process 36 further includes obtaining a profile of the user from whom the request was received, as indicated by block 42 .
- the profile is obtained from the user profile data store 16 , which in some embodiments, includes a plurality of different data stores, each data store corresponding to a different service with which the user interacts over the Internet.
- Examples of data in the profile include places that the user has labeled on the interactive map in previous sessions, places that the user has rated, places that the user has identified as their home or their work, places for which the user has searched, places the user has identified in search results (e.g., by clicking on a link corresponding to the place), places that the user has saved in user-created maps, places identified in a location history of the user's device, events that the user has indicated to be of interest, categories of features that the user has indicated to be of interest, or user check-ins on location-based social networks. Further examples include any of the preceding sources of data from an adjacent node to the user in a social network, provided that the use and provision of such data is consistent with privacy controls of the other user.
- the user profile includes data from a plurality of different services with which the user interacts over the Internet, such as a map search engine, a universal search engine responsive to topics other than those relating to location, a social network that documents connections between users (e.g. friends, family, coworkers, or shared interests), a location-based social network that documents check-in's to locations, user account data documenting user-provided information including the user's address and preferences (e.g. cuisine preferences, event preferences, and place preferences), and services by which the user can map their location history and document places that have been of interest to the user (e.g., by recording a unique identifier of the place that distinguishes the place from other places and some attribute assigned by the user to the place, such as a favorite designation).
- a map search engine e.g. friends, family, coworkers, or shared interests
- a location-based social network that documents check-in's to locations
- user account data documenting user-provided information including the user's address and preferences (e.g
- the process 36 further includes personalizing the interactive map by determining whether to depict geographic features within the map extent based on the profile and formatting a depiction of the features to have a prominence determined based on the profile, as indicated by block 44 .
- some embodiments perform this step by first receiving a set of candidate features from the GIS 18 along with a default ranking of those candidates features, where the ranking determines whether a feature is depicted at a given zoom level and the prominence arising from the visual formatting of the feature.
- the default rankings of the candidate features are then adjusted based on the user profile.
- the adjusted rank is then used to determine whether a feature is shown, with lower ranking features given priority over higher ranking features.
- the rank is further used to determine the appearance of a feature, with ranked features being given a higher prominence.
- the rank may be adjusted based on a variety of signals.
- a user's familiarity with an area is inferred with a familiarity score based on previous interactions with the interactive map.
- the area that a user views in the interactive map during each session is logged, and views of an area are summed or otherwise aggregated over a preceding duration, such as over the preceding six months, to determine the familiarity score.
- Areas the user has viewed relatively frequently are likely areas with which the user is familiar.
- relatively old places such as major road near the user's residence, are raised in rank.
- the default rank of a feature is obtained with a feature age, indicating when the feature was added to the geographic information system, and the default rank is adjusted based on the feature age and the familiarity score such that newer features are lowered in rank and higher familiarity scores increase the effect of feature age. For example a new restaurant near the home of a user may be more likely to be displayed than a historic building having a lower default rank.
- categories of places in which the user is likely to be interested are determined based on the user profile, and the default rank is adjusted when a place category matches one of the categories.
- the user profile includes user entered preferences for categories, such as restaurants of a particular cuisine, types of clothing stores, types of hobbies, and the like. Or preferences for categories are inferred from other data in the user profile, for example from the user rankings of restaurants or other places.
- profiles of friends of the user are used to adjust the default feature rank.
- the user profile includes identifiers of adjacent nodes to the user in a social network graph, and those adjacent nodes are each associated with a user profile of a different corresponding user, e.g., friends of the user who submitted the request for a map.
- the process 36 includes obtaining the profiles of the adjacent nodes and adjusting rank based on the data in those profiles. For example, the default rank of a particular place may be decreased in response to a friend of the user giving the particular place a favorable review, the friend's review being logged in the friend's user profile.
- users are given control over both the collection and use of personal information. Thus, users can control whether their personal information is used in the manner described.
- calendar entries in the user profile are used to adjust the default rank. For instance, a scheduled appointment at a particular address within a threshold duration of time in the future causes the rank of the feature associated with that address to be decreased, making the feature more likely to appear and to appear prominently. For example, a calendared doctor's appointment for later in the day when the request for a map was received causes the doctor's office to be lowered in rank.
- the process 36 includes inferring based on context what a user intends to do in an area being depicted. For example, an intent to engage in tourism may be inferred by determining that a location of the user is more than a threshold distance from the map extent requested. In response, the rank of features associated with tourism in the GIS 18 is decreased, such that points of interest to a tourist are more likely to appear and to appear prominently in the interactive map. In another example, the residence or location of adjacent users in the social network is inferred to indicate that the user submitting the request is interested in the residence or location of a friend, and this feature is lowered in rank, making the feature more likely to appear and to appear prominently.
- rank is adjusted based on the search history of the user. For example, features within the map extent having a name appearing in the search history may be decreased in rank, or features may be decreased in rank in response to determining that the features have a name appearing in a website that the user clicked on in search results.
- the prominence of a depiction of a feature is determined by a variety of attributes of the depiction, which may be selected individually or in combination. Examples of such attributes include the font, the font size, the font color, a drop shadow, transparency, a feature color, a feature transparency, depiction of the feature in 3-D (e.g. an isometric view), line weight, line color, and the like.
- each feature rank corresponds to a different style of depicting that feature, and each style defines a group of visual formatting attributes applied as a group.
- the process 36 further includes presenting the personalized map to the user, as indicated by block 46 .
- presenting the personalize map includes rendering images depicting the map or portions of the map based on results of step 44 . In one example, only those features determined in step 44 to be low enough ranking to be depicted at a given zoom level are presented, and the prominence of those features is selected based on the prominence determined in step 44 .
- the presented personalize map is received at the user device and displayed on a screen of the user device, for example in a browser window or in a special-purpose mapping application executing on the user device.
- FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate examples of interactive map websites 48 and 50 , respectively.
- the map websites 48 and 50 each include a map 52 or 54 , respectively, that is personalized based on a user profile of the user requesting the map 52 or 54 .
- the maps 52 and 54 depict an identical map extent, but because the maps are personalized, the features presented and prominence of the features differs.
- map 52 includes a road 56 that does not appear in map 54 .
- the road 56 is depicted in response to the user for FIG. 3 having calendared an appointment at a doctor's office at feature 58 , the appointment being on the day the user requested the map 52 .
- Maps 52 and 54 both include feature 60 corresponding to Joe's pizza restaurant, but the feature 60 in map 52 has a higher prominence, with a larger font, in response to the user of FIG. 3 having reviewed restaurants in the cuisine category of pizza more favorably in the aggregate than the user of FIG. 4 .
- the map 52 further includes a drycleaners 62 and a gas station 64 in response to to the user of FIG. 3 having entered data into their user profile identifying their residence as being within the extent of map 52 , causing features in categories more likely to be of interest to a resident to have an increased prominence and be more likely to be shown.
- the user of FIG. 4 is viewing the map 54 from a location more than a threshold distance away from the area depicted in map 54 (e.g. more than 500 miles) and has a search history including searches for hotels in the area of map extent 54 , indicating that the user of FIG. 4 likely intends to engage in tourism in the map extent.
- map 54 includes tourist related features 66 that are not depicted in FIG.
- Map 54 further includes a feature 69 with an associated indicator 71 of the reason the feature 69 has a decreased rank, which in this case is because an adjacent nodes in the user's social graph gave the corresponding restaurant a favorable review (e.g., exceeding a threshold score, such as more than three out of five stars).
- the interactive map websites 48 and 50 further include links 68 to other services, the use of which by the user updates the user's profile, and interfaces by which the user requests changes to the map 52 or 54 , including a text search input box 70 for submitting queries, a panning tool 72 for requesting that the map be panned, and a zoom tool 74 for requesting a higher or lower zoom level.
- some embodiments personalize maps based on user profiles. Personalizing maps reduces the burden on users otherwise viewing information likely to be of little interest to the user. And personalization highlights for the user features in which the user is likely to be interested, potentially alerting the user to areas of interest of which the user was not aware. Personalized maps improve the user experience relative to systems that present the same information to every user.

Abstract
Provided is a process for personalizing an interactive map that includes the following: receiving a user request to view an interactive map; determining a map extent responsive to the request; obtaining a profile of the user; personalizing, with a computer, an interactive map based on the profile; and presenting the personalized map to the user. Personalizing includes determining whether to depict geographic features within the map extent in the personalized map based on the profile, and formatting a depiction of the features to have, for each respective feature, a prominence determined based on the profile.
Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- The present invention relates generally to interactive maps and, more specifically, to personalizing interactive maps.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Interactive maps are often used to obtain information about geographically distributed features, such as roads, cities, states, businesses, rivers, lakes, and the like. The interactive map is viewed on a user device, such as in a web browser or mapping application of a laptop or smart phone, and the viewed information is provided by a remote server over the Internet. Typically, users interact with the map by commanding (e.g., by touching or clicking on the interface) the map to pan, zoom, or otherwise change the geographic extent depicted in the map viewport, and the remote server provides information responsive to these interactions. Further, users often enter search terms to cause the interactive map to depict a responsive geographic extent or request a map depicting the user's current location as determined by, for example, a GPS device in a smartphone.
- The following is a non-exhaustive listing of some aspects of the present techniques. These and other aspects are described in the following disclosure.
- Some aspects include a process for personalizing an interactive map that includes the following: receiving a user request to view an interactive map; determining a map extent responsive to the request; obtaining a profile of the user; generating, with a computer, a personalized interactive map based on the profile; and presenting the personalized map to the user. Generating the personalized map based on the profile may include obtaining candidate features within a geographic extent specified by the user request from a geographic information system, the candidate features having a prominence ranking determined without regard to the user profile before receiving the user request; adjusting the prominence ranking of some of the candidate features based on the user profile; for each candidate feature, using the adjusted prominence ranking to determine whether to depict the respective candidate feature; and for each depicted feature, using the adjusted prominence ranking to format the corresponding depiction.
- Some aspects include a system having one or more processors and memory storing program code that when executed by the one or more processors causes the one or more processors to perform the above-described process.
- Some aspects include a tangible, machine-readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a data processing apparatus causes the data processes apparatus to perform the above-described process.
- The above-mentioned aspects and other aspects of the present techniques will be better understood when the present application is read in view of the following figures in which like numbers indicate similar or identical elements:

FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of aninteractive map system 10 having amap server 12 capable of personalizing interactive maps onuser devices 14 based on corresponding user profiles in a userprofile data store 16. The maps are personalized in order to account for a limited user appetite for, and capacity to process presented information, so the map does not overwhelm the user with excessive information of little interest or obscure information in which the user is likely to be interested. Themap server 12 has access to substantially more information about a geographic area depicted in an interactive map (i.e., a map extent) than is of interest to a user, so themap server 12 determines which information is presented and how prominently that information is presented within the interactive map. Embodiments make these determinations on a person by person basis, using corresponding user profiles stored in thedata store 16. Thus, different users with different profiles are presented with different information and differently visually formatted information even when viewing an identical map extent at the same time. - Maps are personalized in a variety of different ways by modifying a variety of different aspects of the map, but a specific example is illustrative. A given user profile may indicate a preference for Indian cuisine (e.g., due to the user rating restaurants in this category above a threshold rating), that the user resides in the United States (e.g., as indicated by an average location of the user's location history), and that the user has recently searched for hotels in London (e.g., according a search history in the user profile). Given this profile, in response to a query from the user for “London England,” some embodiments of the
map server 12 present the user with an interactive map of London England with Indian restaurants and sites of interest to tourists displayed and visually formatted relatively prominently, for example with a font size and color selected for emphasis, while a user submitting the same query but without a profile would not be presented with this information in this format. A different user profile may indicate that a user resides in London and has recently searched for dog parks. An interactive map of the same extent but for the second user, in some embodiments does not depict the Indian restaurants or sites of interest to tourists, but does depict features likely to be of interest to a resident of the city who has a dog, such as a pet grooming business near (e.g., within a threshold distance of) the user's residence and a recently opened (e.g., within a threshold time) restaurant near a bar that the user frequently checks into, according to the second user's profile. Again, the information that is presented, and the visual weight, or prominence, depends on the profile of the user who requested information. In these two examples, identical requests for interactive maps yield information selected and visually formatted to direct the user's attention to features that are likely to be relevant to the individual user (but not necessarily to users in general) and avoid cluttering the map with information that is likely to be a little interest to the user, as indicated by the user's profile. - In some embodiments, the
map server 12 obtains information to be presented from ageographic information system 18 and anadvertisement server 20. The geographic information (GIS) 18 is operative to identify features within a map extent based on stored associations between feature names and their geographic location and stored relationships between features, e.g., which features, such as a business, are within an area of another feature, such as a city. In some embodiments, the identified features are each associated with an age of the feature, indicating when the feature was added to theGIS 18, a value which is used identify newer features likely to be of interest to residents of an area. Themap server 12 requests features from theGIS 18 and determines which features are presented in a map and how those features are formatted visually in the presentation. - In some embodiments, the features stored in the
GIS 18 are assigned a default rank that, in maps that are not personalized according to user profiles, affects (e.g., is the sole determinant or is one factor among others) which features are presented and the visual formatting of those features. For example, interstate highways in the United States have a relatively low rank (multiple features within a map may have the same rank, such as multiple interstate highways), and smaller roads, such as a neighborhood road ending in a cul-de-sac, have a relatively high default rank. Consequently, absent personalization of the map, at a given zoom level, the lower ranking interstate highway may be presented, while the higher ranking smaller roads is omitted from the map to avoid clutter, except at relatively detailed zoom levels, i.e., at relatively small map extents. - Further, in some embodiments, the
advertisement server 20 is operative to provide advertisements to be presented with the interactive map based on, e.g., the map extent, the request that caused the map to be presented, or the corresponding user's profile, in response to a request from themap server 12 or auser device 14. After presenting an ad, the entity operating themap server 12 is compensated by an advertiser. - In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the
system 10. - The illustrated
system 10 includes threeuser devices 14, but embodiments are consistent with substantially more user devices. These devices may be any of a variety of different computing devices, examples of which are described below with reference toFIG. 5 . Theuser devices 14 include an operating system and may include a browser in which the interactive map is rendered for a user and through which the user interacts with the interactive map by, for example, requesting that the map be zoomed in or out, panned, or that a map corresponding to a map search query be presented. In another example, a special-purpose mapping application executes on the user devices, displays the map to the user, and receives user commands.User devices 14 communicate with themap server 12 in sessions, which begin when a user initially requests an interactive map and end when the user navigates away from the map server. User requests during such a session are not considered part of the user profile for purposes of personalizing the map (e.g., a map is not personalized merely because the map is responsive to a single user query in the current session), though such requests are logged in the user profile and used to personalize the map during subsequent sessions. - Provided that data acquisition and use is consistent with user privacy controls, the user profile contains both data from previous sessions of the user with the interactive map and data from user interactions with other services than those provided by the
map server 12. Other services include web-based or special-purposes applications in which auser device 14 communicates with a remote server and by which users review places or rate places, interact with social networks, record places and web resources of interest to the user (e.g., bookmarked places or websites), check in to places on location-based social networks. In other examples, the user profile contains a user's search history from user queries submitted to a universal search engine that is responsive to topics other than those relating to maps and user selections of search results. The profile may also include user preferences (e.g., types of events, cuisine, or activities in which the user is interested) and attributes (e.g., the location of user's residence or work) provided by the user to facilitate better personalization of maps. Thedata store 16 stores a plurality of user profiles, and each profile is associated with (e.g. uniquely matched to) a user device, a user account, or other value by which users are distinguished from one another by themap server 12. - The
map server 12 communicates withuser devices 14, the userprofile data store 16, theGIS 18, and theadvertisement server 20 via, for example, the Internet 22 or various networks, such as local-area networks, wireless area networks, and cellular networks. Themap server 12 of this embodiment includes amap search engine 24, auser identifier module 26, amap personalizer 28, and apresentation module 34. These components, and the other components of thesystem 10, are illustrated as discrete functional blocks, but program code and hardware by which the functional blocks are implemented may be conjoined, distributed, subdivided, intermingled, or otherwise differently organized relative to the arrangement ofFIG. 1 . Program code by which the functionality described herein is implemented may be stored on a tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium, and when this program code is executed by a data processing apparatus, such as one or more computer systems, that data processing apparatus performs the operations described herein. - The
map search engine 24 of this embodiment is operative to receive a user query for an interactive map, such as a query expressed in text by the user and naming a place, and determine a map extent that is responsive to that query. Themap search engine 24 cooperates with theGIS 18 to identify terms within the query corresponding to geographic locations and a map extent corresponding to the query. For instance, a query for “Austin, Tex.,” or a query for “capital of Texas” received by themap search engine 24 causes themap search engine 24 to determine a map extent corresponding to Austin Tex., a place for which the location (including bounding area) and names are associated by theGIS 18. - The
user identifier module 26 is operative to determine whether a user profile is associated with the received query and, if so, identify (e.g., uniquely identify among the stored user profiles) the corresponding user profile. For example, theuser identifier 26 determines whether the user is logged in to themap server 12 or whether another identifier associated with the request, for instance an Internet protocol address, is associated with a user profile. Theuser identifier module 26 further determines whether user specified privacy controls indicate a user preference for using the user profile information in the manner described here and, in response, selectively permits the use of user profile information in accordance with the privacy controls. - The
map personalizer 28 of this embodiment is operative to receive the user profile, the map extent, and features within the identified map extent and personalize an interactive map. To this end, themap personalizer 28 determines, based on the user profile, which features within the map extent will be presented and a visual weight, or prominence, of those features by selecting visual formatting attributes, such as fonts, line weight, drop shadows, font color, font size, and the like, among a plurality of candidate settings for such visual attributes. In some embodiments, themap personalizer 28 performs this determination in real-time (e.g. within less than one second of receiving the user's request for interactive map). - As noted above, the features received from the
GIS 18 are each associated with a default rank. Some embodiments of themap personalizer 28 adjust this default rank based on the user profile if a profile is available. Features likely to be relevant to the user, as inferred from the user profile, are adjusted by decreasing the rank of those features, making the features more prominent and more likely to be depicted at a given zoom level. Conversely, features likely to be of little relevance to the user, as inferred from the user profile, are adjusted by increasing their rank. For example, a flyfishing equipment store may have a relatively high default rank, making it unlikely that that flyfishing equipment store would appear in a map of the state of California, i.e., at a relatively low granularity zoom level, but a user profile indicating a strong interest in flyfishing (e.g., one having more than a threshold amount of queries including the term “flyfishing” in the user's search history) may cause the rank of that flyfishing equipment store to be decreased to the point at which the store appears in a map depicting the entire state of California. - In some embodiments, the
map personalizer 28 includes afeature selector 30 and avisual formatter 32. Thefeature selector 30 is operative to determine which features are presented in the interactive map among the set of features within the map extent. In an example, thefeature selector 30 receives a map extent, a plurality of candidate geographic features within that map extent, and the user profile. Based on the user profile, some of the candidate geographic features are added to a result set of geographic features to be presented in the interactive map and some of the candidate geographic features are omitted from the result set of features to be presented. Examples of this determination are described in greater detail below with reference toFIG. 2 . The illustratedvisual formatter 32 is operative to determine a visual format with which the geographic features are presented in the interactive map based on the user profile. In some embodiments, thevisual formatter 32 selects a visual format—such as a font size, a font color, a drop shadow, a line weight, a feature color, a transparency, a feature size, a three dimensional feature presentation, or other format attributes, including various sub combinations of the listed attributes. The visual format is selected from among a plurality of candidate combinations of format attributes (e.g., from among candidate styles each defining a group of visual formatting options applied together). And the selection of a visual format is based on the inferred relevance of the corresponding feature derived from the user profile, e.g., based on an adjusted rank corresponding to a candidate style. Examples of this selection are described in greater detail below with reference toFIG. 2 . - The
presentation module 34 is operative to receive the selected features and visual formatting from themap personalizer 28 and, in response, present a responsive interactive map to thecorresponding user device 14 from which the request was received. In some embodiments, thepresentation module 34 renders images depicting the selected features (and omitting the unselected features) with the selected visual formatting and transmits the rendered images (which may be rendered in real-time) to thecorresponding user device 14 along with instructions to display the images within the interactive map. Examples of the interactive map are described in greater detail below with reference toFIGS. 3 and 4 . -
FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of aprocess 36 for personalizing an interactive map based on a user profile. Theprocess 36 is performed by embodiments of themap server 12 described above with reference toFIG. 1 . In some implementations, program code that, when executed by a data processing apparatus, causes the data processing apparatus to perform theprocess 36, is stored on a tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium. - In this embodiment, the
process 36 includes receiving a user request to view an interactive map, as shown byblock 38, and determining a map extent responsive to the request, as shown byblock 40. In some cases, determining a map extent includes parsing a text query, querying theGIS 18 for geographic features corresponding to the parsed query terms, and identifying the location of those geographic features in a response from theGIS 18. In some embodiments, the map extent is determined in the received user requests, for example in a request to show the user's current location and a predefined amount of surrounding area. The map extent may be expressed in a variety of formats, for example as a center point and a zoom level or as latitudes and longitudes of the vertices of a bounding box. - The
process 36 further includes obtaining a profile of the user from whom the request was received, as indicated byblock 42. The profile is obtained from the userprofile data store 16, which in some embodiments, includes a plurality of different data stores, each data store corresponding to a different service with which the user interacts over the Internet. Examples of data in the profile include places that the user has labeled on the interactive map in previous sessions, places that the user has rated, places that the user has identified as their home or their work, places for which the user has searched, places the user has identified in search results (e.g., by clicking on a link corresponding to the place), places that the user has saved in user-created maps, places identified in a location history of the user's device, events that the user has indicated to be of interest, categories of features that the user has indicated to be of interest, or user check-ins on location-based social networks. Further examples include any of the preceding sources of data from an adjacent node to the user in a social network, provided that the use and provision of such data is consistent with privacy controls of the other user. - The user profile includes data from a plurality of different services with which the user interacts over the Internet, such as a map search engine, a universal search engine responsive to topics other than those relating to location, a social network that documents connections between users (e.g. friends, family, coworkers, or shared interests), a location-based social network that documents check-in's to locations, user account data documenting user-provided information including the user's address and preferences (e.g. cuisine preferences, event preferences, and place preferences), and services by which the user can map their location history and document places that have been of interest to the user (e.g., by recording a unique identifier of the place that distinguishes the place from other places and some attribute assigned by the user to the place, such as a favorite designation).
- The
process 36 further includes personalizing the interactive map by determining whether to depict geographic features within the map extent based on the profile and formatting a depiction of the features to have a prominence determined based on the profile, as indicated byblock 44. As described above, some embodiments perform this step by first receiving a set of candidate features from theGIS 18 along with a default ranking of those candidates features, where the ranking determines whether a feature is depicted at a given zoom level and the prominence arising from the visual formatting of the feature. The default rankings of the candidate features are then adjusted based on the user profile. The adjusted rank is then used to determine whether a feature is shown, with lower ranking features given priority over higher ranking features. The rank is further used to determine the appearance of a feature, with ranked features being given a higher prominence. - The rank may be adjusted based on a variety of signals. In one example, a user's familiarity with an area is inferred with a familiarity score based on previous interactions with the interactive map. The area that a user views in the interactive map during each session is logged, and views of an area are summed or otherwise aggregated over a preceding duration, such as over the preceding six months, to determine the familiarity score. Areas the user has viewed relatively frequently are likely areas with which the user is familiar. In response, relatively old places, such as major road near the user's residence, are raised in rank. In some embodiments, the default rank of a feature is obtained with a feature age, indicating when the feature was added to the geographic information system, and the default rank is adjusted based on the feature age and the familiarity score such that newer features are lowered in rank and higher familiarity scores increase the effect of feature age. For example a new restaurant near the home of a user may be more likely to be displayed than a historic building having a lower default rank.
- In another example, categories of places in which the user is likely to be interested are determined based on the user profile, and the default rank is adjusted when a place category matches one of the categories. In some embodiments, the user profile includes user entered preferences for categories, such as restaurants of a particular cuisine, types of clothing stores, types of hobbies, and the like. Or preferences for categories are inferred from other data in the user profile, for example from the user rankings of restaurants or other places.
- In another example, profiles of friends of the user are used to adjust the default feature rank. The user profile includes identifiers of adjacent nodes to the user in a social network graph, and those adjacent nodes are each associated with a user profile of a different corresponding user, e.g., friends of the user who submitted the request for a map. The
process 36, in some embodiments, includes obtaining the profiles of the adjacent nodes and adjusting rank based on the data in those profiles. For example, the default rank of a particular place may be decreased in response to a friend of the user giving the particular place a favorable review, the friend's review being logged in the friend's user profile. As noted above, users are given control over both the collection and use of personal information. Thus, users can control whether their personal information is used in the manner described. - In another example, calendar entries in the user profile are used to adjust the default rank. For instance, a scheduled appointment at a particular address within a threshold duration of time in the future causes the rank of the feature associated with that address to be decreased, making the feature more likely to appear and to appear prominently. For example, a calendared doctor's appointment for later in the day when the request for a map was received causes the doctor's office to be lowered in rank.
- In some embodiments, the
process 36 includes inferring based on context what a user intends to do in an area being depicted. For example, an intent to engage in tourism may be inferred by determining that a location of the user is more than a threshold distance from the map extent requested. In response, the rank of features associated with tourism in theGIS 18 is decreased, such that points of interest to a tourist are more likely to appear and to appear prominently in the interactive map. In another example, the residence or location of adjacent users in the social network is inferred to indicate that the user submitting the request is interested in the residence or location of a friend, and this feature is lowered in rank, making the feature more likely to appear and to appear prominently. - In another example, rank is adjusted based on the search history of the user. For example, features within the map extent having a name appearing in the search history may be decreased in rank, or features may be decreased in rank in response to determining that the features have a name appearing in a website that the user clicked on in search results.
- The prominence of a depiction of a feature is determined by a variety of attributes of the depiction, which may be selected individually or in combination. Examples of such attributes include the font, the font size, the font color, a drop shadow, transparency, a feature color, a feature transparency, depiction of the feature in 3-D (e.g. an isometric view), line weight, line color, and the like. In some embodiments, each feature rank corresponds to a different style of depicting that feature, and each style defines a group of visual formatting attributes applied as a group.
- The
process 36 further includes presenting the personalized map to the user, as indicated byblock 46. In some embodiments, presenting the personalize map includes rendering images depicting the map or portions of the map based on results ofstep 44. In one example, only those features determined instep 44 to be low enough ranking to be depicted at a given zoom level are presented, and the prominence of those features is selected based on the prominence determined instep 44. The presented personalize map is received at the user device and displayed on a screen of the user device, for example in a browser window or in a special-purpose mapping application executing on the user device. -
