Definitions
- This specification relates to digital information retrieval, and particularly to processing video resources to facilitate search operations.
- Internet search engines provide information about Internet accessible resources (e.g., Web pages, images, sounds, text documents, multimedia content, and other content) that are responsive to a user's search query by returning a set of search results in response to the query.
- a search result includes, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and a snippet of information for resources responsive to a query.
- the search results can be ranked (i.e., put in an order) according to scores assigned to the search results by a scoring function.
- the scoring function ranks the search results according to various signals, for example, where (and how often) query terms appear in the search results and how common the query terms are in the search results indexed by the search engine.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of deriving a plurality of functions based on correlations between different data sets each representative of user interactions with different resources over a period of time; evaluating the functions for a specific resource and combining weighted results of the evaluations to create a quality signal for the resource; providing the quality signal to a ranking process for the resource when the resource is a search result for a query; and wherein deriving, evaluating and providing are performed by one or more data processing apparatus.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs.
- a resource can be a video.
- a function in the plurality of functions can be a correlation between user ratings of the resources and watch times for the resources.
- a function in the plurality of functions can be a correlation between view counts for the resources and user ratings of the resources.
- a function in the plurality of functions can be a correlation between rankings of the resources and user ratings of the resources.
- the combining can produce a weighted sum.
- a function in the functions can be a sigmoid function.
- a weight in the weights can be calculated from a sigmoid function of one of the data sets wherein a data set comprises one of user ratings, watch times, view counts, and rankings.
- the deriving can comprise fitting a curve to a correlation between two different data sets.
- the quality of a video is used to limit the number of videos that are selected for scoring for a search operation, and thus fewer processing resources are required to process a search operation.
- the quality of the video can also be used to adjust a relevance score of the video that is used to determine a ranking of a corresponding search for the video relative to search results to other videos, and thus separate quality scores for selecting the videos for scoring and for scoring the videos are not required.
- a validation process validates a predictor model based on a positive correlation of quality score to user feedback, thus ensuring the predictor model correlates with the subjective tastes of the users.
- a quality function is derived that determines a query-independent quality signal for a video or other content based on noisy input signals.
- Input signals to the quality function can be based on user feedback and can include false data such as “spam”.
- the quality function suppresses noise and “spam” and can also be derived based on small sample data sets.

- the web page 100 includes a text entry field 102 which accepts queries from users when a search button 104 is selected, for instance.
- Queries are text (e.g., “palm tree”) or speech that specifies general or specific video topics or other information.
- queries can comprise images or videos.
- a submitted query is transmitted to a search engine which identifies videos that are responsive to the query in an index of resources (e.g., web pages) of the world wide web or other corpus and then transmits video search results 106 , 108 and 110 to the web browser for presentation in region 112 of the web page 100 .
- index of resources e.g., web pages
- resource is any data that can be provided by a website over a network and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, videos, electronic games, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts).
- Each search result can include summary information such as a representative frame from the video (e.g., frame 106 a ), the video's title (e.g., title 106 b ), a textual summary (e.g., synopsis 106 d ), the running time of the video (e.g., time data 106 c ), and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other identifier specifying the location of the video (e.g., identifier 106 e ).
- time data 106 c includes duration and the date on which the video was uploaded. Other search result information is possible.
- a video may be stored at the location (e.g., identifier 106 e ) in a portion of a file that holds other content, in a single file dedicated to the video in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- a video may, but need not, correspond to a file.
- a user can select a search result (e.g., frame 106 a or identifier 106 e ) with a mouse click, a finger gesture on a touch-sensitive surface, a speech command to a microphone, or by way of another input device, for example, in order to play the video identified by the search result.
- Search results 112 can be ranked according to traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources that contain videos in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or other provided information may be determined by any appropriate scoring technique.
- FIG. 1B illustrates an example video player as displayed in an example web page 150 as presented in a web browser or other software application.
- the video player is a stand-alone software application.
- the video player includes a playback window 152 for displaying a video.
- Different video formats are possible including, but not limited to, HD, HDV, DVD, Blu-Ray, HD-DVD, HD-VMD, CH-DVD, HDTV, Adobe Systems Incorporated Flash, MPEG, MPEG-4, and Apple Inc.
- Quicktime A play button 160 a starts and pauses the video playback while a progress bar indicator 160 b indicates how much of the video has been played.
- the current time offset into the playback is displayed at 160 c and the total running time of the video is displayed at 160 d .
- a rating 162 indicates the average rating (e.g., three out of five stars) of all user ratings of the video and the total number of ratings (e.g., fourteen).
- a video rating system can have rating values of one, two, three, four or five stars, with one star indicating strong dislike and five stars indicating strong enjoyment on the part of the user rating the video. Other rating systems are possible, however.
- the total number of users who have viewed the video (or “view count”) 164 in part or in its entirety is also presented.
- view means that the video is played back on a user device without interruption, e.g., without navigating to another web page, or causing the browser window in which the video is being played back to become an inactive window.
- Other definitions can also be used.
- a system described below with reference to FIG. 3 maintains user ratings, watch times, and view counts for videos. Each time a user rates a video, the rating is logged as a rating for the video. Each time a user watches a video, the amount of time that the video was played is logged as a watch time for the video. In some implementations, the watch time for a video is the total time users spent watching the video. In further implementations, the watch time for a video is accumulated regardless of whether the users watched portions of the video out of sequence, skipped portions, or viewed a portion more than once.
- the watch time for a video is not known (e.g., because the video is not hosted by a system that keeps track of user watch times), the watch time can be estimated based on when users navigate off of the web page for the video. For example, a web browser plug-in or other software can monitor when users navigate off of web pages and record this information. If the system hosting the video does not programmatically provide a view count for the video (e.g., through an application programming interface), the view count can be detected by a plug-in or other software that analyzes the web page for text indicating the view count, for example.
- the system can also determine a query-independent rank for a video.
- the world wide web's link structure can be used to determine a video's rank.
- a link e.g., hyperlink
- resource A is interpreted as a vote, by resource A, for resource B.
- the resource that casts the vote is also considered. Votes cast by resources that are themselves “important” weigh more heavily and help to make other resources “important”. If the pointing resources are in turn the targets of links from other important resources, they can be considered more “important”, and the first resource can be considered particularly important because it is the target of important (or even highly relevant) resources.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a resource's importance or one of multiple determinants. Appropriate techniques can also be taken to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the importance of a video.
- Signals such as user ratings, watch times, view counts, ranks for videos, and other signals, can be used to derive a query independent quality signal Q for video.
- Q is calculated as a weighted sum:
- k is the number of input signals
- P is a predictor function for the input signal s i
- V is a voting function (or weight) for the input signal s i
- B represents the sample base of the input signal s i .
- Other forms of Q are possible.
- the predictor function P is a general sigmoid predictor function for an input signal s (e.g., average user rating, watch time, view count, or rank) which fits a correlation of the input signal s to another signal, referred to as a “ground truth”:
- P ⁇ ( s ) P 1 ( 1 + e P 2 ⁇ x - P 3 ) + P 4
- P1, P2, P3 and P4 are constants that move the sigmoid function to fit a correlation curve for each input signal s
- x is the value of s used in the function.
- the value of x is as indicated in TABLE I. (Note: “ln” denotes the natural logarithm.) However, other values of x are possible. Other forms of P are possible including non-sigmoid forms.
- the predictor function P can be used to fit the correlations between data sets depicted in FIGS. 2A-D .
- results from different videos in bins within the same range of the x-axis are clustered and represented as one point with the average or median x value of the bin and the average or median of the clustered results' y-axis values are plotted in FIGS. 2A-D .
- FIG. 2A is an example plot correlating the average user ratings in each bin to the natural logarithm of median average watch times in each bin for a set of videos.
- FIG. 2B is an example plot correlating the natural logarithm of median user watch times in each bin to average user ratings in each bin for a set of videos.
- FIG. 2C is an example plot correlating the natural logarithm of view counts in each bin to average user ratings in each bin for a set of videos.
- FIG. 2D is an example plot correlating average ranks in each bin to an average user ratings in each bin for a set of videos. Others correlations are possible, such as video length to average user rating, and so on.
- the voting function V measures the overall variance of the predictor function P.
- V is defined as a general sigmoid function:
- V ⁇ ( s ) V 1 ( 1 + e V 2 ⁇ x - V 3 ) + V 4
- V1, V2, V3 and V4 are constants that move the sigmoid function to fit a curve for each input signal s, and where x is the sample base of the signal s.
- Other forms of V are possible, including non-sigmoid forms.
- the value of x is as indicated in TABLE 2.
- a raters per view signal is calculated as the number of users who have rated a video divided by the number of times a video has been viewed. If raters per view is too large (e.g., >1/400), this implies that there is potentially spam activity (e.g., click spam which artificially raises the rating of a video). In order to counteract the effects of spam, the number of raters can be artificially reduced. In some implementations, the following formula can be used to reduce the number of raters:
- raters ′ raters ⁇ ( 0.0025 ratersperview ) penalty where the penalty is 2, for instance. For example, if there are 4,000 views and 20 raters (i.e., a raters per view equal to 0.005), using the above formula raters' would be 20 ⁇ 0.5 2 or 5. Recalculating raters per view using raters' results in a value of 0.00125 rates per view.
- provider credit is the average rating of all videos uploaded by a provider excluding top ratings (e.g., 5 star ratings).
- top ratings e.g., 5 star ratings.
- the video ratings can be weighted by the raters per view anti-spam technique described above.
- a further technique for counteracting spam is to ignore ratings where the corresponding watch time is short.
- Q, P and V functions can be derived for resources other than videos where user ratings and user behavior towards the resource content (e.g., time spent with the content) come into play.
- resource content e.g., time spent with the content
- other resources can include audio content (e.g., music, newscasts, podcasts, sports events, shows, audio books), streamed television or other video content, electronic games, and web pages.

Abstract
Description
where k is the number of input signals, P is a predictor function for the input signal si, V is a voting function (or weight) for the input signal si, and B represents the sample base of the input signal si. Other forms of Q are possible.
where P1, P2, P3 and P4 are constants that move the sigmoid function to fit a correlation curve for each input signal s, and where x is the value of s used in the function. In some implementations, the value of x is as indicated in TABLE I. (Note: “ln” denotes the natural logarithm.) However, other values of x are possible. Other forms of P are possible including non-sigmoid forms.

where V1, V2, V3 and V4 are constants that move the sigmoid function to fit a curve for each input signal s, and where x is the sample base of the signal s. Other forms of V are possible, including non-sigmoid forms. In some implementations, the value of x is as indicated in TABLE 2.

where the penalty is 2, for instance. For example, if there are 4,000 views and 20 raters (i.e., a raters per view equal to 0.005), using the above formula raters' would be 20×0.52 or 5. Recalculating raters per view using raters' results in a value of 0.00125 rates per view.
