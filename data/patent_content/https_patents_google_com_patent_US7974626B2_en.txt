Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a technique for improving the success rate and time of call-setup for a mobile station experiencing high-interference.
- a network's coverage area is divided into a number of cells, and each cell is served by a particular base station belonging to that cell.
- the mobile stations located in each cell can be registered with the base station of that particular cell.
- the cell acts as a serving cell for all the registered mobile stations in that cell, and the base station of the serving cell is called the serving base station.
- the serving cell and the serving base station keeps changing in a process generally known as handoff or reselection. Handoff occurs when a mobile is engaged in an active call and moves to another cell. On the other hand, reselection occurs when the mobile is in an idle mode and moves to another cell.
- MTSO mobile telephone switching office
- LAI Location Area Identifiers
- the MTSO sends the notification information of the incoming call to all the base stations having the current location area identifier of the mobile station. All the base stations in that location area, further, broadcast the incoming call notification information at pre-determined times over their respective paging channels.
- the mobile station already knows the particular times in the paging channel when the base station might broadcast information for that mobile station.
- the mobile station subsequently, decodes the paging channel only of its serving cell, at pre-determined intervals, to check if there is an incoming call intended for it.
- the pre-determined intervals at which the mobile station tries to decode the paging channel is based upon a network parameter BS_PA_MFRMS.
- BS_PA_MFRMS provides the number of multi frames between two transmissions of the same page to the mobile stations.
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access
- the pre-determined interval is based upon a parameter Slot Cycle Index (SCI).
- SCI Slot Cycle Index
- the mobile station may fail to correctly decode the paging channel of the serving base station.
- the Received Signal Strength Indication may be low, and subsequently, the mobile station is not able to correctly decode the paging channel of the serving base station.
- the mobile station performs a conventional reselection algorithm and switches to another base station with a better RSSI and then decodes the paging channel of another base station to read a subsequent page.
- the decoding failure may occur, not due to a low RSSI, but because the mobile station is experiencing high-interference. While experiencing high-interference, the mobile station may fail to decode the paging channel due to high bit error rate (BER) caused by interference, improper system planning, etc.
- BER bit error rate
- the conventional mobile station decrements a counter and again tries to decode the paging channel of the serving base station. In the case of GSM, this counter is called the Downlink Signaling Counter (DSC) and is derived by the mobile station using the information received from the base station in the parameter BS_PA_MFRMS.
- DSC Downlink Signaling Counter
- the mobile station Whenever the mobile station is unable to correctly decode the paging channel of the serving cell when RSSI is adequate, then the mobile station decrements the counter and tries decoding the paging channel again. After the value of the counter becomes less than zero, the mobile station triggers a full scan and switches to another base station. Thus, in a high-interference situation, the mobile station may not be able to correctly decode the paging channel for a duration that is equal to the time for “n” successive decoding failures plus the time taken by the mobile station for scanning the whole network, re-camping to another base station, and decoding the paging channel of the newly selected base station. This leads to longer call-setup times because the call is set up only after the mobile station is able to correctly decode an incoming call notification on the paging channel.
- the newly selected base station may belong to a new location area identifier.
- the newly selected base station will not immediately receive notification information of the incoming call for the mobile station.
- the mobile station will perform a location update with the MTSO after re-camping to the new base station, which belongs to a new location area identifier.
- the MTSO will know the current location area identifier of the mobile station and then the MTSO sends the notification information of the incoming call to all the base stations in the current location area identifier of the mobile station.
- This scenario further increases the duration for call-setup by adding the time required for a location update procedure and can lead to missed incoming call notifications.
- the mobile station may miss an incoming call notification or incur a long call-setup time. Accordingly, there is an opportunity for a method and apparatus for improving success rates and times of call-setup for mobile stations experiencing high-interference.

- a mobile station checks if the mobile station is experiencing high-interference; presumably the mobile station has failed to correctly decode a paging channel of its serving cell to read a first page. Upon determining that the mobile station is experiencing high-interference, the mobile station selects a cell from a pre-created list and synchronizes with a base station of the selected cell. The selected cell has the same location area identifier as the serving cell. After synchronizing, the mobile station decodes the paging channel of the selected cell and reads a second page from the paging channel of the selected cell.
- an MTSO pages the notification information of an incoming call for the mobile station to all the base stations having the current location area identifier of the mobile station. Therefore, the first page from the serving cell and the second page from the selected cell both include the same information. As a result, instead of unsuccessfully trying to decode the paging channel of the serving base station repeatedly until a counter decreases to zero, the mobile station makes use of the fact that the MTSO pages the notification information of an incoming call to all the base stations having the current location area identifier of the mobile station, and decodes the paging channel of the selected cell to read the page.
- the mobile station may improve success rates of call-setup and reduce call-setup times.
- FIG. 1 is a system diagram of a wireless communication system 100 with various cells and base stations in different location areas and a mobile station 170 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the coverage area of the wireless communication system 100 is divided into a number of cells 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 112 , 114 , 116 , 152 , 154 , 156 , 158 and each cell is served by a particular base station 103 , 105 , 107 , 109 , 113 , 115 , 117 , 153 , 155 , 157 , 159 .
- FIG. 1 is a system diagram of a wireless communication system 100 with various cells and base stations in different location areas and a mobile station 170 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the coverage area of the wireless communication system 100 is divided into a number of cells 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 112 , 114 , 116 , 152 , 154 ,
- different cells 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 112 , 114 , 116 , 152 , 154 , 156 , 158 are served by their respective base stations 103 , 105 , 107 , 109 , 113 , 115 , 117 , 153 , 155 , 157 , 159 .
- the base stations 103 , 105 , 107 , 109 , 113 , 115 , 117 , 153 , 155 , 157 , 159 are further connected to an MTSO (not shown).
- a few of the cells 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 112 , 114 , 116 are grouped in a first location area (the location area identifier for the first location area is LA 1 ) 110 and a few other cells 152 , 154 , 156 , 158 are grouped in a second location area (the location area identifier for the second location area is LA 2 ) 150 .
- the wireless communication system 100 of FIG. 1 also includes a mobile station 170 present in a cell 114 and served by a base station 115 of the cell 114 .
- the mobile station 170 and the base station 115 communicate with each other using a radio link 190 . Therefore, the cell 114 is the serving cell and the base station 115 is the serving base station for the mobile station 170 .
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart 200 of a method for a mobile station (such as the mobile station 170 shown in FIG. 1 ) to improve success rate and call-setup time when experiencing high-interference in accordance with some embodiments.
- the method starts when the mobile station is in idle mode 205 .
- the mobile station is in idle mode when the mobile station is synchronized with a serving base station (such as the base station 115 shown in FIG. 1 ) and the mobile station is not in any call.
- a serving base station such as the base station 115 shown in FIG. 1
- the mobile station In idle mode 205 , the mobile station maintains 210 a list of a number of neighboring cells (such as the cells 104 , 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ). Then, the mobile station scans 215 all the cells in the list to determine the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values of all the neighboring cells. In one example, the mobile station reads the system information of the cells in the list and determines the RSSI values and SNR values. The system information also informs the mobile station about the location area of each cell using a Location Area Identifier (LAI).
- LAI Location Area Identifier
- the mobile station may scan the list and only determine the RSSI value and the LAI of the cells in the list (without the SNR value being determined).
- the LAI of a cell informs the mobile station about the location area of the cell. Therefore, as a result of scanning, the mobile station has information about the RSSI values, SNR values, and location area identifiers (LAIs) of all the cells in the list of neighboring cells.
- the mobile station creates 220 a list of top neighboring cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ) based on the RSSI value and the LAI of each cell.
- the mobile station creates this list of top neighboring cells by selecting cells from the list of neighboring cells that have the highest RSSI values.
- the mobile station includes at least one cell (such as cell 106 , 112 , or 116 of FIG. 1 ) belonging to the LAI (such as LA 1 110 of FIG. 1 ) of the serving cell (such as the cell 114 of FIG.
- the mobile station goes to decoding 230 the paging channel of the serving cell and reverts to conventional behavior.
- the mobile station creates this list of top neighboring cells by selecting cells from the list of neighboring cells based on different combinations of RSSI values and LAIs of each cell.
- the mobile station After creating 220 the list of top neighboring cells (that includes a cell belonging to the LAI of the serving cell), the mobile station pre-synchronizes 225 with the top neighboring cells and, subsequently, obtains the time-lag of the top neighboring cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ) with respect to the serving cell (such as the cell 114 of FIG. 1 ).
- the mobile station as a result of obtaining the time-lag, is able to correctly predict the re-occurrence of a page in the base stations of the cells having the same location area identifier as the serving cell of the mobile station. In other words, the mobile station is able to evaluate the time required before an identical page is repeated in one of the cells with the same location area identifier as the serving cell.
- the time-lag is a resolution of a quarter bit (Q_bit) lag 473 and a frame number (FN) lag 476 as shown in FIG. 4 .
- Knowledge of the FN lag provides coarse timing adjustments and knowledge of the Q_bit lag provides fine timing adjustments.
- FIG. 4 is an example of multi-frames 400 on beacon carriers of two base stations.
- FIG. 4 shows the multi-frames 410 of the serving base station (such as the base station 115 shown in FIG. 1 ) and the multi-frames 450 of a neighboring base station (such as the base station 113 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- each multi-frame 410 , 450 includes 51 frames, numbered from 0 to 50.
- the first two frames (frame 0 and frame 1 ) of the beacon carriers are allocated for cell synchronization purposes (logically called a Frequency Correction CHannel (FCCH) and a Synchronization CHannel (SCH)) and the block of next four frames (frame 2 to frame 5 ) are allocated for cell system information (logically called a Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH)).
- FCCH Frequency Correction CHannel
- SCH Synchronization CHannel
- BCCH Broadcast Control CHannel
- the mobile station receives the parameter BS_PA_MFRMS in frames 2 to 5 , which are allocated for cell system information. All the other frames (frame 6 onwards) are used for access grant and paging (logically called an Access Grant CHannel (AGCH) and a Paging CHannel (PCH)).
- frame 6 to frame 9 may be a paging message block (i.e., a paging channel that may contain notification information about an incoming call)
- frame 10 and 11 may be allocated for cell synchronization purposes
- frame 12 to frame 19 that is, two blocks
- frame 12 to frame 19 may be two paging message blocks, and so on. This whole format repeats in each multi-frame (i.e., after 51 frames).
- each mobile station knows in which of the 9 blocks, its serving base station sends paging information for that particular mobile station.
- the BS_PA_MFRMS indicates to the mobile station the number of multi-frames (of 51 frames each) to skip before its paging frame is repeated.
- the mobile station uses the BS_PA_MFRMS and the individual paging block information, the mobile station knows when to tune in the channel and receive the paging information.
- the same location for the paging information is applicable for all the cells belonging to the LAI of the serving cell. Therefore, as long as there is a time lag between the serving base station and another same-LAI base station, the mobile station with knowledge of the time-lag can always get the same paging information from the other base station.
- FIG. 5 is an example of a table 500 showing time-lag between the serving base station and the top neighboring base stations.
- the table includes different columns showing a cell identity 510 , a location area identifier 520 , a Q_bit lag 530 , an FN lag 540 , and a total time-lag 550 of each of the top neighboring cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ).
- the cell with the identity 106 having the same location area identifier LA 1 has a +1000 Q_bit lag, 8 FN lag, and 41000 total time-lag.
- FIG. 5 the example of FIG.
- the cell with the identity 112 having the same location area identifier LA 1 has a ⁇ 2600 Q_bit lag, 11 FN lag, and 52400 total time-lag.
- the cell with the identity 116 having the same location area identifier LA 1 has a +2520 Q_bit lag, 10 FN lag, and 52520 total time-lag.
- the cell with the identity 152 having the same location area identifier LA 2 has a +2000 Q_bit lag, 9 FN lag, and 47000 total time-lag.
- the cell with the identity 154 having the same location area identifier LA 2 has a +2500 Q_bit lag, 6 FN lag, and 32500 total time-lag.
- all the neighboring cells have been shown to have a positive time-lag, which means that all the neighboring cells get their specific frame after a positive delay from the same specific frame in the serving base station.
- a negative time-lag may also be possible in the field for some of the neighboring cells having the same location area identifier LA 1 .
- the mobile station After pre-synchronizing and obtaining 225 the time-lag between the serving base station and all the top neighboring cells, the mobile station decodes 230 a paging channel of the serving cell to read a first page.
- the first page may include data about incoming call notification for the mobile station.
- the MTSO sends this data about the incoming call notification to all the base stations of the cells having the same location area identifier as the serving cell of the mobile station. Therefore, by knowing the time-lag of all the top neighboring cells, the mobile station knows the exact Q_bit and the exact frame in the multi-frames where the identical information data (indicating call notification) will recur in the top neighboring cells having the same location area identifier as the serving cell.
- the mobile station determines 235 if a decoding failure has occurred. If the mobile station determines that no decoding failure has occurred and the mobile station is able to correctly decode the paging channel of the serving cell and read the first page, then the mobile station checks 237 if the page indicates a mobile terminated call. If the page indicates a mobile terminated call, then the mobile station sends an acknowledgement 238 to the base station of the serving cell on a Random Access CHannel (RACH) and, subsequently, receives a message 239 from the base station of the serving cell on an Access Grant CHannel (AGCH). The message informs the mobile station about a dedicated traffic channel in the serving cell and, finally, the mobile station establishes the call 240 . Otherwise, if the page does not indicate a mobile terminated call, than the mobile station again goes back to decoding 230 the paging channel of the serving cell.
- RACH Random Access CHannel
- AGCH Access Grant CHannel
- the mobile station decrements a counter 245 of the serving base station.
- this counter is called Downlink Signaling Counter (DSC) and is derived by the mobile station using the information received from the serving base station in a parameter BS_PA_MFRMS.
- the initial value of this counter is always greater than zero.
- the mobile station checks if the counter is less than a pre-determined value. This pre-determined value may be set by a manufacturer of the mobile station or by the serving base station. In the example of FIG. 2 , the pre-determined value is set to zero.
- the mobile station determines 250 that the counter is not less than zero, then the mobile station checks 255 if it is experiencing high-interference. In one example, the mobile station determines that it is experiencing high-interference if there has been no sudden drop in RSSI value of the serving base station. In another example, the mobile station determines that it is experiencing high-interference, if there is a sudden drop in RSSI value of the serving base station, but there is a more drastic drop in the SNR value of the serving base station. In yet another example, the mobile station may store the RSSI values and the SNR values of the serving base station over a period of time and run an algorithm on the stored values to determine if the mobile station is experiencing high-interference. It is understood for those skilled in the art that a number of different algorithms may be used on the RSSI values and the SNR values (and possibly additional or alternate variables) to determine if the mobile station is experiencing high-interference.
- the mobile station determines that it is not experiencing high-interference, then the mobile station runs the conventional re-selection algorithm 257 and selects a new cell and a corresponding new base station. Note that if the reselection algorithm results in selection of a completely new serving cell, the flowchart 200 can restart at step 205 . If the reselection algorithm results in selection of the same serving cell as the “new” serving cell, the flow can go directly to step 230 (i.e., the mobile station can skip performing 210 , 215 , 220 , and 225 ).
- the mobile station selects 260 a set of cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG. 1 ) from the list of top neighboring cells based on the location area identifier (such as LA 1 of FIG. 1 ).
- the mobile station only selects the cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG. 1 ) having the same LAI (such as LA 1 of FIG. 1 ) as the serving cell (such as the cell 114 of FIG. 1 ), from the top neighboring cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ).
- the set of cells in certain circumstances, may contain as few as one cell.
- the mobile station selects 265 a cell (such as the cell 106 of FIG. 1 ) from the set of cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG. 1 ).
- the mobile station selects the cell based on the time-lag of the cells. That is, the mobile station compares the time-lag of all the cells in the set of cells and selects the cell with the shortest time-lag. When comparing the time-lags, the mobile station should not consider the cells from the set, whose time-lag is less than the radio frequency switching time of the mobile station.
- the RF switching time of the mobile station is the time that the mobile station takes to switch from the serving cell carrier frequency to another cell carrier frequency.
- the time-lag is always considered positive, i.e., an identical page is repeated in another cell having the same LAI as the serving cell after the occurrence of the page in the serving cell.
- An identical page occurs earlier in a cell with the negative time-lag compared to the time at which the page occurs in the serving cell. Therefore, based on a previous decoding failure on a paging channel of a serving cell or based on determining that the mobile station is experiencing high-interference independently (i.e., without currently decoding the paging channel of the serving cell to read a page 230 ), the mobile station may select a cell from the set of cells with a negative time-lag.
- the mobile station may try to decode a paging channel of the selected cell before attempting to decode the paging channel of the serving cell to decode an identical page.
- high interference lasts for several seconds (or more)
- selecting a cell with a negative time-lag allows yet another opportunity for the mobile station to decode a paging channel to read a page.
- all the cells in the list of top neighboring cells having the same location area identifier as the serving cell may have negative time-lag.
- the first occurrence of the identical page in all these cells has already passed.
- the re-occurrence of the page in a cell with negative time-lag will occur before the re-occurrence of the page in the serving cell.
- the mobile station after facing a decoding failure on the paging channel to read a page in the serving cell, may select a cell with a negative time-lag to read the re-occurrence of the page that will occur earlier in time compared to the re-occurrence of the page in the serving cell (instead of decoding the paging channel of the serving cell to read the re-occurrence of the page in the serving cell).
- the mobile station selects the cell based on the time-lag and RSSI value and/or SNR value of the cells. In one case, if the time-lag of a particular cell is the shortest in the set of cells, but its RSSI value and/or SNR value is less compared to another cell in the set, whose time-lag is greater (compared to the former cell), then the mobile station may select the other cell. It is understood for those skilled in the art that a number of different algorithms may be used on the RSSI values, the SNR values, and the time lags to select a best candidate cell for synchronization.
- the mobile station After selecting a cell (such as the cell 106 of FIG. 1 ), the mobile station synchronizes 270 with a base station (such as the base station 107 of FIG. 1 ) of the selected cell. In one example, the mobile station may immediately synchronize 270 with a base station of the selected cell, after selecting the cell. In another example, after selecting a cell, the mobile station may wait for a duration of time until the identical page is about to occur on the paging channel of the selected cell, and then synchronize 270 with a base station of the selected cell. While synchronizing, the mobile station switches from the serving cell carrier frequency to the selected cell carrier frequency.
- a base station such as the base station 107 of FIG. 1
- the serving base station of the mobile station does not change (for example, the base station 115 remains the serving base station of the mobile station 170 as shown in FIG. 1 ; i.e., the mobile station does not perform a reselection into the selected base station 107 ).
- the mobile station After synchronizing, the mobile station decodes 275 the paging channel of the selected cell to read a second page.
- the second page includes the same information data as the first page. And the mobile station knows the exact timing of the second page in the frames on the paging channel of the selected cell, as a result of obtaining time-lag information previously.
- the mobile station checks 280 if the page is correctly decoded or if a decoding failure has occurred. If the mobile station is able to correctly decode the paging channel (PCH) of the selected cell and read the second page, then the mobile station checks 285 if the page indicates a mobile terminated call. If the page indicates a mobile terminated call, then the mobile station sends an acknowledgement 290 to the base station of the selected cell on a Random Access CHannel (RACH) and subsequently, receives a message 295 from the base station of the selected cell on an Access Grant CHannel (AGCH). The message informs the mobile station about a dedicated traffic channel in the same selected cell and, finally, the mobile station establishes the call 240 . Otherwise, if the page does not indicate a mobile terminated call, then the mobile station again goes back to decoding 230 the paging channel of the serving cell.
- PCH paging channel
- the mobile station checks if selecting another cell is feasible 283 .
- the mobile station determines if decoding the paging channel of another cell provides sufficient time benefit compared to the next page occurrence in the serving cell. If the mobile station determines that there is a time benefit and decides to select another cell, then the mobile station selects 265 another cell from the set of cells, different from the earlier selected cell and reads a third page. The third page also includes the identical information data as the first page and the second page. Otherwise, if the mobile station determines that there is no time benefit and decides not to select another cell, then the mobile station again goes back to decoding 230 the paging channel of the serving cell.
- the mobile station decrements the counter and checks if the counter is less than zero. If the counter is not less than zero than the mobile station determines if it is experiencing high-interference. Upon determining that the mobile station is experiencing high-interference, the mobile station selects another cell and reads the page from the paging channel of the selected cell. This reduces the call-setup time as every failed attempt to read a page from the serving base station creates an opportunity for a successful attempt to read identical information of the page by decoding a paging channel of the selected cell.
- the mobile station checks 250 the counter and determines that it is less than zero, then the mobile station synchronizes 252 with the last selected cell.
- the last selected cell is the last cell that the mobile station selected from the set of cells and with which the mobile station synchronized to read a page.
- the mobile station also reselects to the last selected cell (i.e., the last selected cell now becomes the serving base station of the mobile station).
- the mobile station After synchronizing and reselection (if applicable), the mobile station decodes 254 the paging channel (PCH) of the selected cell and reads a page.
- PCH paging channel
- the mobile station while decoding the PCH of the selected cell, the mobile station performs conventional searching in the background to select a better cell. Therefore, the mobile station does not miss any page because it decodes the PCH of the selected cell. Additionally, the mobile station saves time by performing the rigorous conventional searching in the background.
- the mobile station uses the steps 210 , 215 , 220 , 225 , 260 , and 265 of flowchart 200 to select a better cell.
- the mobile station uses the steps 210 , 215 , 220 , 225 , 260 , and 265 of flowchart 200 to select a better cell.
- the mobile station when the value of the counter (DSC) becomes less than zero, the mobile station triggers a full scan and switches to another base station.
- the mobile station is not able to correctly decode the paging channel for a duration that is equal to the time for “n” successive decoding failures plus the time taken by the mobile station for scanning the whole network, re-camping to another base station, decoding the paging channel of the newly selected base station, and maybe the time required for a location update procedure.
- the flowchart 200 and synchronizing 252 with the base station of the last selected cell when the counter (DSC) becomes less than zero the mobile station skips the traditional full network scan and significantly reduces the time for reading a page and subsequently, setting-up a call.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram 300 of a mobile station 370 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the mobile station 370 is the mobile station 170 of FIG. 1 .

- the antenna 390 receives and transmits signals.
- the antenna 390 is connected to the transceiver 380 .
- the mobile station 370 works according to the method of FIG. 2 .
- the transceiver 380 , the user interface 385 , the memory 360 , the SNR value comparator 355 , the RSSI value comparator 350 , the time-lag comparator 340 , the high-interference determiner 320 , and the selector 330 are coupled to the processor 310 .
- the transceiver 380 , the user interface 385 , the memory 360 , the SNR value comparator 355 , the RSSI value comparator 350 , the time-lag comparator 340 , the high-interference determiner 320 , and the selector 330 may be partially or completely implemented within the processor 310 .
- the processor 310 When the mobile station 370 is camped to its serving cell and is in idle mode, the processor 310 maintains a list of neighboring cells and stores the list in the memory 360 . Then, the transceiver 380 scans the list of neighboring cells to determine an RSSI value, an SNR value, and a location area identifier of each cell in the list of neighboring cells. In one example, the transceiver 380 provides this information (such as the RSSI value, the SNR value, and the location area identifier of each cell) to the processor 310 and the processor 310 stores it in memory 360 .
- the RSSI value comparator 350 coupled to the processor 310 , compares the RSSI values of each cell in the list of cells and creates a list of top neighboring cells based on the RSSI value for each cell in the list of neighboring cells.
- the processor 310 ensures that the list of top neighboring cells always includes at least one cell having the same location area identifier as the serving cell.
- the RSSI value comparator 350 ensures that the list of top neighboring cells always includes at least one cell belonging to the location area identifier of the serving cell.
- the mobile station 370 keeps trying to decode the paging channel of the serving cell and falls back to conventional behavior.
- the processor 310 After creating the list of top neighboring cells, the processor 310 , using the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 , pre-synchronizes with all the cells from the list of top neighboring cells and obtains a time-lag of each cell in the list of top neighboring cells. The processor 310 stores the obtained time-lags in the memory 360 .
- the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 try to decode the paging channel of the serving cell to read a first page and the processor 310 checks if the decoding was successful. If the processor determines that the decoding was successful, then the processor 310 checks if the page indicates a mobile terminated call. If the page indicates a mobile terminated call, then the processor 310 establishes the call. Otherwise, if the page does not indicate a mobile terminated call, than the processor 310 again goes back to decoding the paging channel of the serving cell using the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 .
- the processor 310 determines that it is not able to correctly decode the paging channel of the serving cell, the processor 310 decrements a counter of the serving base station.
- this counter is called Downlink Signaling Counter (DSC) and is derived by the processor 310 using the information received from the serving base station in a parameter BS_PA_MFRMS.
- the initial value of this counter is always greater than zero.
- the processor 310 stores the initial as well as the decremented value of the counter in the memory 360 .
- the processor 310 checks if the counter is less than a pre-determined value. This pre-determined value may be set by a manufacturer of the mobile station or by the serving base station. In the example of FIG. 3 , the pre-determined value is set to zero.
- a high-interference determiner 320 coupled to the processor 310 , checks if the mobile station 370 is experiencing high-interference. In one example, the high-interference determiner 320 determines that the mobile station 370 is experiencing high-interference if there has been no sudden drop in RSSI value of the serving base station. In another example, the high-interference determiner 320 determines that the mobile station 370 is experiencing high-interference if there is a sudden drop in RSSI value of the serving base station but there is a more drastic drop in the SNR value of the serving base station.
- the high-interference determiner 320 may store the RSSI values and the SNR values of the serving base station in the memory 360 over a period of time and run an algorithm on the stored values to determine if the mobile station 370 is experiencing high-interference.
- the processor 310 runs a conventional re-selection algorithm and selects a new base station.
- the selector 330 selects a set of cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG. 1 ) from the list of top neighboring cells based on the location area identifier (such as LA 1 of FIG. 1 ). At this point, the selector 330 only selects the cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG.
- the serving cell such as the cell 114 of FIG. 1
- the top neighboring cells such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 , 152 , 154 of FIG. 1 ).
- the selector 330 further selects a cell (such as the cell 106 of FIG. 1 ) from the set of cells (such as the cells 106 , 112 , 116 of FIG. 1 ). In one example, the selector 330 selects the cell based on the time-lag of the cells. In this example, the time-lag comparator 340 , coupled to the processor 310 , compares the time-lag of all the cells in the set of cells and stores the results in the memory 360 . The selector 330 , coupled to the processor 310 , selects the cell with the shortest time-lag that is greater than the mobile station's radio frequency switching time.
- the selector 330 selects the cell based on the time-lag and RSSI value and/or SNR value of the cells. In one case, if the time-lag of a particular cell is the shortest in the set of cells (yet greater than the radio frequency switching time), but its RSSI value and/or SNR value is less compared to another cell in the set, then the selector 330 may select the other cell.
- the time-lag is always considered positive, i.e., an identical page is repeated in another cell belonging to the LAI of the serving cell after the occurrence of the page in the serving cell.
- there may be a no cell in the set of cells with a positive time-lag but there may be a cell in the set of cells with a negative time-lag.
- An identical page occurs earlier in a cell with the negative time-lag compared to the time at which the identical page occurs in the serving cell.
- the selector 330 may select a cell from the set of cells with a negative time-lag.
- the processor 310 After selecting a cell (such as the cell 106 of FIG. 1 ) by the selector 330 , the processor 310 , using the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 , synchronizes with a base station (such as the base station 107 of FIG. 1 ) of the selected cell. After synchronizing, the processor 310 , using the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 , decodes the paging channel of the selected cell to read a second page. The second page includes identical information data as the first page. And the processor 310 knows the exact timing of the second page in the frames on the paging channel of the selected cell, as a result of obtaining time-lag information.
- a base station such as the base station 107 of FIG. 1
- the processor 310 checks if the page is correctly decoded or if a decoding failure has occurred. If the processor 310 determines that it is able to correctly decode the paging channel of the selected cell and read the second page, then the processor 310 checks if the page indicates a mobile terminated call. If the page indicates a mobile terminated call, then the processor 310 establishes the call. In one example, the processor 310 sends an acknowledgement to the base station of the selected cell on a Random Access CHannel (RACH) and, subsequently, receives a message from the base station of the selected cell on an Access Grant CHannel (AGCH). The message informs the processor 310 about a dedicated traffic channel in the selected cell and, finally, the processor 310 establishes the call. Otherwise, if the page does not indicate a mobile terminated call, than the processor 310 again goes back to decoding the paging channel of the serving cell.
- RACH Random Access CHannel
- AGCH Access Grant CHannel
- the processor 310 determines that it is not able to correctly decode the paging channel of the selected cell, then the processor 310 checks if there is an opportunity to select another cell. If the processor 310 determines that selecting another cell is feasible, then the selector 330 selects another cell from the set of cells, different from the earlier selected cell, and reads a third page. The third page also includes identical information data as the first page and the second page. Otherwise, if the processor 310 determines that selecting another cell is not feasible, then the processor 310 goes back to the idle mode.
- the processor 310 decrements the counter and checks if the counter is less than zero. As a result of decrementing the counter at every decoding failure, eventually the counter may become less than zero. In such a scenario, when the processor 310 checks the counter and determines that it is less than zero, then the processor 310 , using the transceiver 380 and the antenna 390 , synchronizes with the last selected cell. The last selected cell is the most recent cell that the selector 330 selected from the set of cells and with which the processor 310 synchronized to read a page.
- the processor when the counter becomes less than zero, then the processor also camps to the last selected cell (i.e., the last selected cell now becomes the serving base station of the mobile station). After synchronizing and camping, the processor 310 decodes the paging channel of the selected cell and performs conventional background searching with the opportunity to camp to a better base station.
- the mobile station can decode the paging channel of another cell, having the same location area identifier, to read a copy of the page.
- the mobile station is able to improve success rate of call-setup and reduce the call-setup time because every failed attempt to read a page from the serving base station can be followed by an attempt to read identical information of the page by decoding a paging channel of another cell.
