Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to antenna tuning and, more particularly, to compensating for phase shifts that result from antenna tuning.
- Antenna tuning involves matching the impedance of the load of the components connected to an antenna to the impedance of the antenna itself.
- the antenna impedance may be affected by the state of the communication device (e.g., cell phone), which can be based on a variety of factors, including the position of the communication device with respect to the user's body.
- the impedance of the antenna changes, it is desirable to tune the antenna (e.g. by changing the impedance of the load) in order to keep the impedances as closely matched as possible.
- the phase of the signals travelling to and from the antenna also tends to change.
- phase changes in mobile communication signals are interpreted as meaningful data, which can degrade the reception of the signal and lead to garbled transmissions.
- impedance changes and the associated phase changes can be anticipated and tolerated by the communication system.
- the channel being used for communication changes the transmit modulator and receive modulator generally perform a channel estimate, which is used to set up the channel for use by the communication device. Should the phase change occur before the channel estimate, or occur while the transmitter is not emitting a signal, then the phase change will have no affect on the signal received at the base station. Subsequent insertion phase changes of the channel such as those due receiver mobility and multipath channel fading are also tolerated by the receiver.
- abrupt changes in impedance occur during the transmission of data (from antenna impedance tuning, for example), it is much more difficult for the base station receiver to react to the resulting phase shift and the quality of the received signal could be degraded.

- Tx transmission
- Rx receiver
- the duplexor 118 combines and separates the signals coming from and going to the Rx demodulator 122 and the Tx modulator 120 respectively, enabling the mobile device 102 to both transmit and receive simultaneously.

- the data is in the form of one or more baseband signals (referred to collectively as “a baseband signal”).
- a baseband signal In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2A , the Tx modulator 120 , under the control of the modulation processor 123 , converts the baseband signal into radio frequency (RF) signal and provides the RF signal to the duplexor 118 .

- FIGS. 1A , 1 B, 2 A, and 2 B a description of how the communication device 102 changes the state of the tuning network 112 to tune the antenna 110 (e.g., in response to a tuning event), as well as how the communication device 102 compensates for resulting phase shift according to an embodiment of the invention will now be described.
- This embodiment may be referred to as an “open-loop” method with respect to the phase shift compensation. It is understood that this is a high-level description and that there may be many other steps involved in the process.
- the controller 108 adjusts the tuning network 112 (in response to a tuning event, for example) the controller 108 also adjusts the phase shift network 114 .
- the controller 108 determines the adjustments that need to be made to the phase shift based on the state of the communication device 102 .
- the controller may determine the state of the communication device 102 based on data received from the sensor 111 .
- Such data may include data regarding one or more of the following characteristics of the communication device 102 : (1) the band, sub-band or channel on which the communication device is communicating (received, for example, from the transceiver module 106 ; (2) the application for which the communication device is being used, (received, for example, from the application processor 109 ; (3) the state of the antenna (received, for example, from the sensor 11 ); and (4) the state of the Tx modulator 120 and Rx demodulator (received, for example, from the modulation processor 123 of the transceiver module 106 .
- the controller 108 uses the received data to reference a look-up table.
- the look-up table contains numerical values that indicate to the controller 108 what signals to send to the tuning network 112 (to tune the antenna 110 ) and what signals to send to the phase shift network 114 (to compensate for the phase shift resulting from the tuning).
- the lookup table and the values contained therein may be stored in a memory of the controller 108 .
- the memory of the controller 108 may also contain the current settings of the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 .
- the controller 108 transmits signals to the phase shift network 114 and to the tuning network 112 .
- the tuning network will shift the phase of the RF signal by an amount P
- the phase shift network 114 will shift the phase of the RF signal (either directly, or by altering the baseband signal) by an amount ⁇ P.
- the controller 108 can account for the time it takes for the signal to propagate from the phase shift network 114 and the tuning network 112 .
- the controller 108 can adjust the settings of the phase shift network 114 at a time T, and then wait to adjust the tuning network 112 for a time delay D, where the time delay equals the propagation delay from the phase shift network 114 to the tuning network 112 .
- the controller 108 can operate the antenna tuning network 112 first at a time T2, and then adjust the phase shift network 114 after a time delay D where D is the propagation time between the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 . In this way the signal received will show minimal phase shift from the tuning network adjustment event. Either of these techniques may minimize the phase shift caused by a change in the tuning network 112 .
- the communication device 102 may compensate for phase shift in a closed-loop manner.
- the antenna tuning process is the same as discussed above in the open-loop embodiment.
- the controller 108 uses data received from the measurement module 156 (or Rx demodulator 122 ). This data indicates the actual phase shift or return loss being experienced at the output of the antenna 110 . The controller 108 uses this data to determine how much of an offsetting phase shift is needed. For example, if the actual phase shift occurring at the antenna 110 is P, then the controller 108 may control the phase shift network 114 to shift the phase of the RF signal (either directly, or by changing the baseband signal) by an amount ⁇ P.
- the appropriate adjustments to the phase shift network 114 may be contained in the look-up table.
- the look-up table may contain values that correlate the actual phase shift data to settings that the phase shift network 114 needs in order to compensate.
- the look-up table may contain values that correlate the return loss values to settings that the phase shift network 114 needs in order to compensate.
- the communication device 102 uses a closed-loop method for compensating for phase shift, as described above, and distinguishes between tuning events that occur during “protected periods”—e.g., periods of time during which a gradual phase shift is needed, such as during a transmission by or receipt of a signal by the communication device 102 and “regular periods”—e.g., periods of time during which a gradual phase shift is not needed, such as when no transmission or receipt is occurring.
- “protected periods” e.g., periods of time during which a gradual phase shift is needed, such as during a transmission by or receipt of a signal by the communication device 102
- regular periods the communication device 102 tunes the antenna 110 (by, for example, adjusting the tuning network 112 ) at a first rate.
- the communication device tunes the antenna at a second rate. In this embodiment, the first rate is faster than the second rate.
- the communication device 102 may carry out antenna tuning during a regular period using one or more of the techniques previously discussed, and may
- the antenna tuning and the phase compensation process may be carried out as follows.
- the controller 108 determines that a tuning event has occurred during a protected period, the controller 108 wakes up the measurement module 156 .
- the controller 108 waits for the measurement module 156 to settle (e.g., power up).
- the controller 108 determines how to adjust the tuning network 112 required for the tuning network 112 to reach a target impedance. This determination is made based on one or more of the techniques described above (e.g., determining characteristics of the communication device 102 and referencing the look-up table).
- the controller 108 also measures the pre-tuning phase shift of the signal being transmitted, as indicated by data from the measurement module 156 .
- the controller 108 divides the required adjustments into a series of steps, with each step corresponding to an incremental adjustment of the tuning network 112 . For example, if the controller 108 determines that the tuning network 112 needs to be adjusted by an amount X to reach its target impedance, it divides the adjustments into X/n, where n is the number of steps.
- the controller also determines the time increment for each step.
- the controller then adjusts the network 112 by X/n, and re-measures the actual phase shift.
- the controller adjusts the phase shift network 114 in a manner sufficient to compensate for the tuning network adjustment.
- the adjustment that needs to be made to the phase shift network by the controller may be determined using an algorithm, stored in the controller memory, which relates the measured phase shift with the adjustment required.
- the adjustment may additionally or alternatively be made using a look-up table stored in the controller memory, which contains inputs and outputs of the algorithm.
- the previously described look-up table (having the communication device characteristics) may also be used to determine the appropriate adjustment.
- the controller 108 may use return loss data obtained from the measurement module 156 to determine the required phase shift at each increment. In that case, the algorithm or the look-up table would relate return loss data to the tuning network adjustment.
- measurements regarding the actual phase shift occurring at the output of the antenna 110 may also be made by the base station 104 and transmitted to the communication equipment 102 .
- the controller 108 could use this phase shift information to carry out a closed-loop phase compensation in the same manner as if it were receiving the phase shift data from the measurement module 156 or the Rx demodulator 122 .
- the communication device 102 may, in addition to tuning the antenna 110 and compensating for a phase shift, adjust the amplitude of the transmitted RF signal in response to a tuning event. Such an adjustment may be made by changing the settings of a power amplifier of the communication device 102 .
- the lookup table may have three or more dimensions (e.g., frequency, sub-band, state of the communication device 102 ( FIGS. 1A and 1B ), state of the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 , actual measured phase shift, actual measured return loss), but is shown as a series of two-dimensional tables for the sake of clarity.
- the lookup table 1000 associates the sub-band on which the communication device 102 ( FIGS. 1A and 1B ) operates, according to one of three Tx/Rx states: Rx Favored, Balanced, or Tx Favored.
- the Tx modulator 120 ( FIGS. 2A and 2B ) is more challenged than the Rx demodulator 122 (e.g. the Tx modulator 120 is transmitting at maximum power but the Rx demodulator is below maximum power), then the Tx modulator and Rx demodulator will be in a Tx Favored state, such that the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 will need to be put into a state that minimizes the loss on the transmit frequency. If the Rx demodulator 122 is more challenged than the Tx modulator 120 (e.g.
- the Rx demodulator 120 is experiencing bit and/or frame errors as a result of it being set at a level that is too sensitive), then the Tx modulator and Rx demodulator will be in an Rx Favored mode, such that the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 will need to be adjusted to minimize the loss on the receive frequency. If the Tx modulator 120 and the Rx demodulator 122 are equally challenged then the Tx modulator and Rx demodulator are in a Balanced state.
- the lookup table 1000 also associates the tuner and sub-band of the communication device 102 with one of three application states: Left Hand Talking Position, Balanced and Right Hand Talking Position.
- the communication device 102 is said to be in a Left Hand Talking Position state when the user is holding the communication device 102 to his head with his left hand, and in the Right Hand Talking Position state when the user is holding it to his head with his right hand.
- a balanced state is when the communication device 102 is not next the user's head, but is, for example, resting on a table.
- the sensor 111 FIGS. 1A and 1B ) detects (using, for example, proximity sensing electronics) the application state and provides this information to the application processor 109 which, in turn, provides the information to the controller 108 .
- Tx and Rx states are possible in the lookup table 1000 .
- the Rx may be challenged while the Tx is enjoying very low link loss. In this mode, the antenna tuner would be adjusted to improve the Rx signal, possibly even at the expense of the transmit signal. Since the Tx signal is enjoying low loss, the transmit modulation could be set to a higher order, such as 64 QAM. In this state, the base station receiver will have heightened sensitivity to phase shifts of the Tx signal.
- the phase shift network 114 could be operated to compensate for phase shifts of the Tx signal, while the tuning network 112 is operated to improve the quality of the Rx signal.
- other criteria to describe the communication state of the communication device 102 may be used to index the lookup table 1000 (e.g., be used as a row, column or as page labels), including the state of the antenna 110 .
- the sensor 111 detects the state of antenna 110 directly by measuring electrical properties of the antenna 110 , and provides this information to the application processor 109 which, in turn, provides the information to the controller 108 .
- the controller 108 receives antenna 110 measurement data and uses the received data to reference a look-up table.
- the look-up table contains numerical values that indicate to the controller 108 what signals to send to the phase shift network 114 and to the tuning network 112 .
- the lookup table and the values contained therein may be stored in a memory of the controller 108 .
- Sensor 111 can detect an electrical property of the antenna 110 , such as delivered power, reflected power, return loss or impedance using, for example, a directional coupler and measurement receiver. In this way, the electrical properties of the antenna 110 are measured directly to determine of the desired state of tuning network 112 and phase shift network 114 ,
- Controller 108 can include a closed loop controller for controlling tuning network 112 and phase shift network 114 .
- the sensor 111 can provide complex return loss data to the controller 108 , which translates the complex return loss to a corresponding value of insertion phase.
