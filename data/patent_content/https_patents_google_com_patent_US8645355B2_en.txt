- a portion of process 300 is described below with reference to FIGS. 4A-4E .
- process 300 may include determining sets of identifiers for addresses of different indexes (block 310 ).
- processing server 170 may retrieve addresses from first search index 140 and addresses from second search index 160 .
- Processing server 170 may determine sets of identifiers for the addresses of first search index 140 and for the addresses of second search index 160 .
- Each set of identifiers may include one or more identifiers.
- processing server 170 may determine a domain contained within the address and/or identify one or more parameters contained within the address.
- the address may include a parameter located between a first symbol and a second symbol or next to only one of the symbols.
- a symbol may include, for example, one of a slash, a question mark, an equal sign, a pound sign, and/or any other type of symbol that may be used before a parameter.
- the identifier may include one or more parameters.
- Processing server 170 may identify the parameters to include in the identifier based on the domain, a form of the address, and/or a rule associated with the domain, as described further below in reference to FIG. 5 .
- Processing server 170 may determine the form of the address based on the domain.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an example address 410 that may be retrieved from first search index 140 and an example address 420 that may be retrieved from second search index 160 .
- Address 410 includes a domain (“example.com”), a first parameter (“product”), and a second parameter (“1234”).
- Address 420 includes a domain (“example.com”), a first parameter (“get.php”), a second parameter (“Exampledb”), a third parameter (“44”), a fourth parameter (“1234”), and a fifth parameter (“1”).
- Processing server 170 may determine a set of identifiers 412 ( FIG. 4B ) for address 410 based on the identified parameters. As shown in FIG.
- set of identifiers 412 may includes a first identifier (“product”) and a second identifier (“1234”).
- Processing server 170 may also determine a set of identifiers 422 ( FIG. 4B ) for address 420 .
- set of identifiers 422 includes a first identifier (“get.php”), a second identifier (“Exampledb”), a third identifier (“44”), a fourth identifier (“1234”), and a fifth identifier (“1”).
- Process 300 may further include eliminating identifiers that are associated with multiple addresses in an index (block 320 ). For example, after determining the sets of identifiers for the addresses of first search index 140 , processing server 170 may eliminate identifiers that are common to sets of identifiers associated with multiple addresses in first search index 140 . In other words, processing server 170 may determine that an identifier is in a first set of identifiers for a first address of first search index 140 . Processing server 170 may eliminate the identifier from the first set of identifiers if processing server 170 determines that the identifier is also in a second set of identifiers for a second address of first search index 140 .
- processing server 170 may eliminate the identifier from the first set of identifiers, from the second set of identifiers (i.e., common to a set of identifiers associated with the first address and a set of identifiers associated with the second address), and from any other set of identifiers associated with address in first search index 140 .
- processing server 170 may eliminate identifiers from the sets of identifiers that are associated with multiple addresses of second search index 160 .
- processing server 170 retrieves a different address (e.g., http://www.example.com/product/1211) from first search index 140 .
- Processing server 170 may determine a different set of identifiers for this different address.
- Processing server 170 may determine that set of identifiers 412 ( FIG. 4B ) and the different set of identifiers, which are both associated with addresses in first search index 140 , include “product” as an identifier.
- processing server 170 may eliminate the product identifier from set of identifiers 412 and the different set of identifiers.
- FIG. 4C illustrates set of identifiers 412 after the product identifier is eliminated from set of identifiers 412 .
- Processing server 170 may determine a different set of identifiers for this different address.
- Processing server 170 may determine that set of identifiers 422 ( FIG. 4B ) and the different set of identifiers, which are both associated with addresses in second search index 160 , include “get.php,” “Exampledb,” “44,” and “1” as identifiers.
- processing server 170 may eliminate the identifiers (“get.php,” “Exampledb,” “44,” and “1”) from set of identifiers 422 and the different set of identifiers.
- FIG. 4C illustrates set of identifiers 422 after the identifiers (“get.php,” “Exampledb,” “44,” and “1”) are eliminated from set of identifiers 422 .
- processing server 170 may eliminate an identifier when the identifier is associated with addresses in more than a particular quantity (e.g., three or more) of addresses in an index (e.g., first search index 140 or second search index 160 ).
- the particular quantity may vary, for example, based on a type of the index, domain(s) of the addresses associated with the identifier, and/or other information associated with the index.
- process 300 may include mapping identifiers to the addresses (block 330 ).
- processing server 170 may produce mappings between the identifiers of the sets of identifiers and the addresses associated with the sets of identifiers.
- processing server 170 may produce a mapping 414 by mapping an identifier 416 , of set of identifiers 412 , to address 410 , which is associated with set of identifiers 412 , as shown in FIG. 4D .
- Processing server 170 may produce a mapping 424 by mapping an identifier 426 , of set of identifiers 422 , to address 420 , which is associated with set of identifiers 422 , as shown in FIG. 4D .
- Process 300 may also include mapping the addresses of the different indexes based on matching identifiers (block 340 ). For example, while mapping the identifiers to the addresses, processing server 170 may associate identifier 416 and identifier 426 with the same key (e.g., 1234 or example.com 1234) since identifier 416 is equivalent to identifier 426 . Processing server 170 may produce a mapping 430 ( FIG. 4E ) that maps address 410 to address 420 because address 410 and address 420 share a common domain (e.g., example.com) and are both mapped to identifiers that are associated with the same key (e.g., 1234).
- a mapping 430 FIG. 4E
- Process 300 may also include verifying the mapping of the addresses (block 350 ).
- processing server 170 may retrieve, from first search index 140 , first information about a document associated with address 410 .
- the first information may include content of the document, metadata (e.g., a language used for the document, a length of the document, a quantity of links to/from the document, etc.), and/or any other information associated with the document (e.g., a title associated with the document).
- Processing server 170 may retrieve, from second search index 160 , second information about a document associated with address 420 .
- the second information may include content of the document, metadata (e.g., a language used for the document, a length of the document, a quantity of links to/from the document, etc.), and/or any other information associated with the document (e.g., a title associated with the document).
- metadata e.g., a language used for the document, a length of the document, a quantity of links to/from the document, etc.
- any other information associated with the document e.g., a title associated with the document.
- processing server 170 may use address 410 to retrieve the first information from data server 120 .
- processing server 170 may use address 420 to retrieve the second information from data server 120 .
- Processing server 170 may determine whether one or more portions of the first information match one or more corresponding portions of the second information. Processing server 170 may verify that mapping 430 is correct when the one or more portions of the first information match the one or more corresponding portions of the second information. For example, processing server 170 may verify that mapping 430 is correct when a title, included in the first information, matches a title, included in the second information; when a length of a document, included in the first information, matches a length of a document, included in the second information; etc.
- Process 300 may also include transmitting mappings of addresses, with data from index entries of the addresses, to servers associated with the indexes (block 360 ).
- processing server 170 may retrieve first data of an entry, of first search index 140 , that is associated with address 410 .
- the first data may include, for example, a snippet of the document identified by address 410 and/or any other information associated with the document.
- Processing server 170 may retrieve, second data of an entry, of second search index 160 , that is associated with address 420 .
- the second data may include, for example, information provided by an operator of data server 120 , along with address 420 , to submission server 150 and/or any other information associated with the document.
- the information provided by the operator may include an identifier of a product, a brand of the product, a type of a product, a price of a product, etc.
- Processing server 170 may transmit, to first search index 140 , information about mapping 430 and the second data or a portion of the second data. Processing server 170 may transmit, to second search index 160 , the information about mapping 430 and the first data or a portion of the first data.
- search engine server 180 later retrieves, from first search index 140 , a search result that is associated with address 410
- the search result may include one or more components of the second data (e.g., price of the product) that were not originally included in first search index 140 , as described further below in reference to FIGS. 6A and 6B .
- search engine server 180 later retrieves, from second search index 160 , a search result that is associated with address 420
- the search result may include one or more components of the first data that were not originally included in second search index 160 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example representation of a rule 500 stored for a particular domain.
- Processing server 170 may determine rule 500 after retrieving and processing one or more addresses with the same domain and/or form of address. For example, processing server 170 may receive and process a first address,
- processing server 170 identifiers the following identifiers for the first address: Exampledb, 44, 4568, and 1. Assume that processing server 170 identifiers the following identifiers for the second address: Exampledb, 44, 1234, and 1. Assume that processing server 170 maps the first address to a third address, of a different index, based on identifier 4568 , and maps the second address to a fourth address, of the different index, based on identifier 1234 .
- processing server 170 may determine that when an address includes a particular domain (e.g., example.com) and has a form 510 (where W, X, Y, and Z represent different parameters), only a particular portion (e.g., parameter Y) of the address is relevant to match the address to an address of the different index. Based on this determination, processing server 170 may produce rule 500 .
- Rule 500 may specify that when an address includes domain example.com and is in form 510 , a set of identifiers associated with the address only includes an identifier 520 , which includes parameter Y.
- processing server 170 does not have to determine a set of identifiers for the address
- Processing server 170 may determine a particular identifier (e.g., example.com 1211) based on rule 500 , which is associated with form 510 .
- the set of identifiers associated with the address may include the particular identifier determined based on the rule.
- FIG. 6A illustrate an example result 610 provided in response to a search query before a mapping of a web search index to a product search index.
- a user enters a search query “Example Company Telephone” into a web search engine that uses the web search index.
- the web search engine may return results, including result 610 .
- FIG. 6B illustrate an example result 620 provided in response to the search query after the mapping of the web search index to the product search index.
- the product search index may store price data 625 (e.g., $24) in association with the second URL.
- the web search index may receive price data 625 from the product search index, and may store price data 625 in association with the first URL.
- the web search engine may return results, including result 620 for the first URL.
- Result 620 may include price data 625 , which is now stored in association with the first URL.
- Implementations described herein may provide mappings between addresses of different indexes. Each mapping may indicate that addresses associated with the mapping identify the location of the same document.
- component may include hardware, such as a processor, an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), or an FPGA (field programmable gate array), or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., software running on a general purpose processor—creating a specific purpose processor).
- ASIC application-specific integrated circuit
- FPGA field programmable gate array
