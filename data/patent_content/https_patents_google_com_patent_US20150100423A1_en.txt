Definitions
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet. These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements, or “ads”) to be provided along with the resources.
- a Web page can include slots in which ads can be presented. The slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers).
- An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In an auction, content providers can provide bids specifying amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- this disclosure features method performed by one or more processing devices.
- the method includes receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and using the one or more processing devices to estimate a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page.
- the method also includes outputting data to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition, and determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- the disclosure features a system that includes a learning engine and a pricing engine.
- the learning engine includes at least one processor, and is configured to receive a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and estimate a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page.
- the learning engine is also configured to providing a control signal to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition.
- the pricing engine is configured to determine a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- the disclosure features a computer readable storage device having encoded thereon computer readable instructions.
- the instructions upon execution by a processor, cause a processor to perform operations that include receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and estimating a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page.
- the operations also include outputting data to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition, and determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- Implementations of any of the above aspects can include one or more of the following.
- the conversion can be one of: a purchase, a phone call, a newsletter sign-up, a page visit, an interaction and a download, associated with the sponsored content item.
- Estimating the parameter can include determining an increment in the likelihood of the conversion due to displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page, as compared to the sponsored content item being absent from the particular content page.
- the likelihood can be determined based on historical conversion data for the sponsored content item.
- the likelihood is determined based on conversion data for content items substantially similar to the sponsored content item.
- the likelihood can be determined using a machine-learning process.
- the particular content page can include organic search results, and estimating the parameter can include determining whether the organic search results include an item associated with the sponsored content item.
- Estimating the parameter can include determining, within the organic search results, a position of the item associated with the sponsored content item.
- the threshold condition can specify the increment in the likelihood to be at least 25%.
- the charge can be a fraction of the bid price, the fraction being related to the estimated parameter, and less than or equal to unity.
- the parameter representing the likelihood of conversion can be computed also based on an estimated brand impact factor associated with the sponsored content item.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one, or more of the following advantages.
- Sponsored contents or ads can be presented only when they are likely to be effective for their intended purposes. For instance, an ad can be presented in a particular webpage only if a likelihood of conversion is above a predetermined threshold.
- Search results that are not sponsored, but generated by a search system in response to a query or search term provided by a user are often referred to as organic search results.
- the sponsored content may be presented if the organic results do not include an item related to the sponsored content, or do not include an item related to the sponsored content within a predetermined number of top ranked results.
- the incremental advantage of presenting the sponsored content with organic search results can therefore be taken into account, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the sponsored content.
- the advertisers can be charged based not only on the bid price, but also a factor or parameter that represents a likelihood of conversion, thereby making the advertisements more cost-effective.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for delivering content.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting examples of subsystems associated with a content management and delivery system.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for delivering sponsored content.
- FIG. 4 is an example of a computer system on which the processes described herein may be implemented.
- Sponsored content such as advertising
- advertising an “ad”
- a search engine which operates on the network, may receive input from a user. The input may include one or more of the keywords.
- a content management and delivery system which serves ads, may receive the keywords from the search engine, identify the ad as being associated with one or more of the keywords, and output the ad to the user, along with content that satisfies the initial search request.
- the content that satisfies the initial search request is often referred to as the organic search results, and can be distinguished from sponsored content (e.g. the ads) provided therewith.
- the organic and sponsored content are displayed on a computing device.
- the sponsored content is incorporated into an appropriate slot on the results page.
- the user may select the ad by clicking on the ad.
- a hyperlink associated with the ad directs the user to another web page.
- the Web page to which the user is directed may be the home page for ABC Travel Company.
- This activity is known as click-through.
- a “click” is not limited to a mouse click, but rather may include a touch, a programmatic selection, or any other action by which the ad may be selected or interacted with.
- a content auction can be run to determine which content is to be output in response to an input, such as one or more keywords.
- content providers e.g. advertisers
- a sporting goods ads provider may associate words such as “baseball”, “football” and “basketball” with their ads.
- the content provider may bid on those keywords in the content auction, for example, on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis. That is, the content provider's bid is an amount that the provider will pay (the cost) in response to users clicking on their displayed content. So, for example, if a content provider bids five cents per click, then the content provider pays five cents each time their content is clicked by a user.
- CPC cost-per-click
- payment need not be on a CPC basis, but rather may be on the basis of other factors such as brand impact, or other conversions, e.g., viewing or interacting with an impression, an amount of time spent on a landing page, a purchase, and so forth.
- Bidding in a content auction typically takes place against other content providers bidding for the same keywords. So, for example, if a user enters keywords into a search engine (to perform a search for related content), a content management system may select content items from different content providers, which are associated with those same keywords or variants thereof. The content auction is then run, e.g., by the content management system, to determine which content to serve along with the search results or any other requested content.
- an auction is based on the value (or return on investment, or effectiveness) that the advertiser expects to generate from ad placement.
- the value of a sponsored content item can depend on other content present on the same page.
- the value of the sponsored content item can depend on whether or not the organic search results include an item related to the sponsored content item. For example, if the first page of organic search results provided in response to a search query (e.g. “footwear”) includes an item (e.g.
- the company may not be interested in also placing an ad on the same page, particularly if the item is featured as one of the top ranked organic results.
- the company may be more interested in placing an ad on that particular page to attract traffic to the company website.
- the perceived value of placing a sponsored content item alongside organic search results can be represented by a parameter referred to as incrementality.
- Incrementality can be associated with, for example, an increase in clicks that are caused by a lack of similar organic results.
- the total number of clicks on the organic result or the sponsored content item may be one hundred and twenty-five.
- the twenty-five (i.e. 25%) additional clicks generated in the presence of the associated sponsored content item can be considered to be incremental.
- Incrementality can also depend on the position or rank of the associated organic result on the page.
- the incrementality may be only 25%. However, for the same sponsored content item, the incrementality can increase significantly when the ranking of the associated organic result is at a lower rank or position. For example, the incrementality may increase to over 90% when the associated organic result is ranked fifth or lower in the organic search results.
- the value of a sponsored content item can therefore depend on whether (and/or at what position) a corresponding item appears among the organic search results.
- information on incrementality associated with a sponsored content item can be taken into account when presenting the sponsored content item alongside organic search results.
- the information on incrementality can be used, for example, to present the sponsored content item on pages where they are likely to be clicked on, and hence more valuable and effective.
- the information can also be used to charge the content providers or advertisers in accordance with an estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item. For example, the price of an ad presented on a page without any corresponding organic results can be higher price than, for example, the price of the same ad when presented on a page including a highly-ranked corresponding organic result.
- an advertiser may bid by incremental click such that the advertiser pays for a click on an advertisement only if an estimated probability of the ad leading to a site visit is above a threshold and the site visit would likely not have occurred otherwise.
- the estimated probability can depend on various factors, including for example, time of day, user interests, and/or the presence of competing ads on the same page.
- the threshold can be zero, or a non-zero value between 0 and 1. Under these conditions, a higher correlation between displaying an ad and a site visit leads to the advertiser being charged a higher fraction of the bid price.
- an ad can be shown only when there is a reasonable probability of the ad leading to a conversion such as a site visit.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content in accordance with the methods and systems described in this document.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management and delivery system 110 for selecting and providing content to user devices.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), content publishers 109 , and the content management and delivery system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and content publishers 109 .
- a content repository 126 can store content items that are created by content sponsors 108 .
- the content items can include advertisements or other sponsored contents each of which may be associated with one or more keywords.
- the content management and delivery system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content (e.g. a resource 105 ) from a user, identify one or more eligible content items or resources 105 , and provide a content item or resource 105 responsive to the request.
- a request for content e.g. a resource 105
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to provide organic search results and/or sponsored content items in response to one or more search terms provided by a user through a user device 106 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can deliver sponsored content to user devices 106 responsive to a request for displaying a website.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to select sponsored content items to provide alongside the organic search results or websites requested from user devices 106 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to select sponsored content items such that the likelihood of the sponsored content items being clicked is high, for example, above a predetermined threshold value. For example, if delivering a particular ad to a user group that has previously demonstrated interest in fishing is likely to lead to a click (or another type of conversion), the ad can be delivered to that user group, but optionally suppressed for others.
- the likelihood of occurrence of a click can be represented using a parameter such as the incrementality associated with the corresponding sponsored content items.
- the sponsored content items selected for delivery are chosen based on the likelihood of being clicked, the effectiveness or value of the sponsored content items can be enhanced.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher 109 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a content publisher 109 can have one or more slots or positions within a website for displaying sponsored contents. The content publisher 109 can sell the slots (for example, via an auction) to content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers) for displaying sponsored contents within the slots.
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the resources 105 can include sponsored content provided by the content sponsors 108 .
- the resources 105 can include an advertisement, a deal or a special offer sponsored by a content sponsor 108 .
- a resource 105 can include search results 118 that are generated in response to one or more queries 116 provided by a user.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones, tablet computers, e-readers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDA)), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the user device 106 can be configured to execute applications that are configured to receive/generate/manage sponsored or other content items from the content management and delivery system 110 .
- applications can include third-party applications and can be downloaded to the user device 106 from an applications repository.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by, for example, crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed (and, optionally, cached) resources 115 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the cache 114 or index to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can include organic search result data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can generate the search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a reservation process a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response. For example, the content management and delivery system 110 can select one or more sponsored content items that are served along with search results 118 , in response to a user query 116 . In some implementations, the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to select the sponsored content item based on a parameter representing an estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item to trigger a conversion or click associated with the sponsored content item.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided to the user device 106 based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management and delivery system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate or prioritized delivery of the content items, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for delivery (or selection) of their content to a user device 106 either independently or with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the content management and delivery system can be configured to charge a content sponsor 108 a fraction of the price the content sponsor 108 has offered to pay, based on, for example, the parameter representing the estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item.
- an incrementality associated with a sponsored content item can be used to weight the bid price.
- the corresponding content sponsor can be charged only one half (or some other appropriate fraction) of the bid price.
- the content sponsor can be charged a larger fraction of the bid price.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, initiating a phone call, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, signing up for a newsletter, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by delivering content that is more likely to be of interest to the user.
- content items e.g., ads, special offers or daily deals
- user preferences represented in corresponding interest profiles 128 can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting examples of subsystems associated with a content management and delivery system.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be connected to a conversion data repository 208 that stores information related to conversions associated with sponsored content items stored in the content repository 126 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can also be connected to, for example, a web server 204 , and a content server 206 (e.g. an ad server).
- the web server 204 and the content server can be operable to communicate with publishers 109 , content sponsors 108 and user devices 106 , over one or more networks 102 (e.g., the Internet, intranet, Ethernet, wireless network).
- networks 102 e.g., the Internet, intranet, Ethernet, wireless network.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to access information stored in the conversion data repository 208 to estimate a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying a sponsored content item on a particular page.
- the likelihood of conversion can be estimated from, for example, historical conversion data stored in the conversion data repository.
- the historical data can be related to the sponsored content item for which the estimation is done.
- the conversion data repository 208 can store information on incrementality of a particular ad, when previously shown on a page that also includes a related organic search result among the top three entries.
- the historical data can be related to content items similar to the sponsored content item for which the estimation is done. For example, to estimate a likelihood of conversion of a sponsored content item related to shoes, the content management and delivery system 110 can access historical incrementality data of other content items related to shoes and footwear.
- the information stored in the conversion data repository 208 can be accumulated in various ways.
- incrementality data related to a sponsored content item can be estimated using controlled data collection. For example, user devices 106 receiving a particular set of organic search results can be split (for example, using cookies) into two groups. One of the groups is shown a particular sponsored content item related to the organic search results. The particular sponsored content item is not shown to the second group. From the conversions occurring from the two groups, an incrementality associated with the sponsored content item can be estimated. The estimated incrementality data can be stored in the conversion data repository 208 and made available to the content management and delivery system 110 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can include a learning engine 212 configured to estimate a likelihood of conversion of a sponsored content item.
- the learning engine 212 can be configured to estimate incrementality associated with a sponsored content item.
- the incrementality (or another parameter representing a likelihood of conversion) can be computed by the learning engine 212 based on, for example, previously collected conversion data related to the same or similar content items.
- the learning engine 212 may implement various machine learning processes including, for example, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or semi-supervised learning.
- Various machine learning tools such as artificial neural networks, genetic programming, support vector machines, multi-armed bandit analysis, or Bayesian networks can be used in the learning engine 212 .
- the learning engine can estimate the likelihood of conversion for a given sponsored content item based on various characteristics and attributes of content items, including, for example, landing pages, keywords, time of the day at which the content items are displayed, graphical attributes (e.g., color scheme), nature of conversions, incrementality data and financial turnover.
- the learning engine 212 can be configured to estimate incrementality of a sponsored content item based on one or more characteristics or attributes of similar content items. For example, an online logistic regression algorithm or support vector machine can predict incrementality even if a particular ad has not been previously shown. In such cases, characteristics of substantially similar previously shown ads can be correlated with measured incremental conversions to make a prediction. Linear regression can be used to determine which characteristics are more correlated than the others, and the characteristics can be chosen, for example, based on a ranking of their level of correlations. The number of characteristics chosen can vary based on the available computing power.
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to deliver a sponsored content item to a user device 106 on determining that an estimated parameter (e.g., incrementality) related to the content sponsor item satisfies a threshold condition. For example, a particular ad can be provided on a page of organic search results only if the incrementality associated with displaying the ad exceeds 50%. In some cases, an organic result related to the sponsor of the ad can be within the first few positions in the search result page, thereby pushing the incrementality of the ad below the stipulated threshold of 50%. In such cases, the content management and delivery system 110 can decide not to display the ad on that particular search result page.
- an estimated parameter e.g., incrementality
- the content management and delivery system 110 can be configured to select the ad for delivery to a user device 106 . Selecting a sponsored content item based on a threshold condition, as described above, can enhance an effectiveness of the sponsored content item thereby increasing their worth to the content sponsors 108 .
- the content management and delivery system 110 can include a pricing engine 214 to determine a charge for a sponsored content item delivered to a user device 106 .
- the pricing engine 214 can be configured to determine the charge for a sponsored content item based on an estimated parameter representing an effectiveness of the sponsored content item. For instance, a content sponsor 108 (e.g. an advertiser) can be charged for an ad based on an estimated incrementality of the ad.
- a content sponsor 108 e.g. an advertiser
- the pricing engine 214 can determine the charge for displaying the ad on that page to be the full bid price, or a high percentage thereof.
- the pricing engine 214 can determine the charge for displaying the ad on that page to be one half (or another appropriate fraction) of the bid price.
- the pricing engine can be configured to determine a charge for displaying a sponsored content item as a function of the bid price and a parameter (e.g., incrementality) representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item.
- a publisher 109 can request a sponsored content item (e.g., an ad) from the content server 206 .
- a sponsored content item e.g., an ad
- one or more ads can be sent to the publisher 109 .
- the ads sent to the publisher 109 can be selected based upon an auction.
- the bids are based upon multiple bidding paradigms (e.g., Cost-per-Acquisition (CPA), Cost-per-Click (CPC), or Cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM))
- the bids can be converted to a common bidding paradigm and the winning bid can be identified.
- the ads can be selected from the content repository 126 based on the winning bid.
- the ad(s) can also be selected to be displayed on a web property owned or operated by the publisher 109 (e.g., a web site), based upon, for example, a determination that a parameter representing an effectiveness of the ad (e.g., an incrementality parameter) satisfies a threshold condition.
- a parameter representing an effectiveness of the ad e.g., an incrementality parameter
- a user of the user-device 106 clicks an ad served by the content server 206 , the user is directed to a landing page on web property (e.g., a web site) of the respective content sponsor 108 .
- the user may then perform a conversion event at the website (e.g., make a purchase, register).
- the conversion event generates conversion data which is sent to the content management and delivery system 110 , and stored in the conversion data repository 208 . In this manner, a conversion history can be accumulated and maintained for each ad or ad group featuring substantially similar ads.
- a content sponsor 108 may access the content management and delivery system 110 through the network 102 and a web server 204 using, for example, a web browser (e.g., Microsoft® Internet Explorer, MozillaTM, FirefoxTM, or the like).
- the web server 204 can be configured to serve the content sponsor 108 one or more web pages or other interface to allow management of ad campaigns.
- the interface or webpage presented through the web server 204 can allow a content sponsor to present a bid, select keywords, and enter or adjust threshold conditions for displaying sponsored content items. For example, if using an incrementality threshold of 60% generates insufficient conversions, the content sponsor 108 can adjust the threshold to a lower value (e.g., 40%) to have the corresponding sponsored content item delivered on additional pages.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management and delivery system 110 that may be more relevant to (or likely to be clicked on by) the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating monetizable parameters (e.g., monetizable demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content management and delivery system 110 .
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for delivering sponsored content items.
- the process 300 can be performed by the content management and delivery system 110 , for example, using the content repository 126 and the conversion data repository 208 .
- FIGS. 1 and 2 are referenced to provide examples related to the process 300 .
- Operations can include receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item ( 302 ).
- the bid price can be received, for example, through an auction.
- Bidding paradigms used in the auction can include, for example, CPM, CPC, or CPA.
- Information on the bid price received for a particular sponsored content item e.g., an ad
- the bid price can be for displaying the sponsored content item on a particular web-page or web-site.
- Operations can include estimating one or more parameters representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page ( 304 ).
- the one or more parameters can include a parameter representing an incrementality associated with the sponsored content item.
- the conversion can be an event that leads to a condition beneficial to the corresponding content sponsor 108 .
- a conversion can include a click, a purchase, a phone call, a newsletter sign-up, a page visit, or a download resulting from displaying the sponsored content item.
- the one or more parameters can be chosen to represent an increment in the likelihood of the conversion due to displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page.
- the likelihood of conversion for a particular sponsored content item can be determined, for example, based on historical conversion data associated with the same sponsored content item, or content items with similar characteristics.
- the likelihood of conversion can be determined using a machine learning process, for example one implemented using the learning engine 212 .
- estimating the one or more parameters representing the likelihood of conversion is computed also based on an estimated brand impact factor associated with the sponsored content item. For example, if the sponsored content item is associated with a brand that is well recognized, the content item may be more likely to be clicked by a user.
- the brand impact factor associated with a content item can be determined, for example, using a machine learning process on substantially similar content items.
- the brand impact factor associated with a sponsored content item may be determined based on data obtained from a third-party source such as an organization that conducts research on impact factors of different brands and products.
- the brand impact factor is a numerical value that is used in estimating the one or more parameters representing the likelihood of conversion.
- Operations can include displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition ( 306 ).
- the threshold condition can be related to an incrementality associated with displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page. For example, if the content page is a search result page 118 that includes an organic search result related to an ad, the ad may be displayed only if displaying the ad is estimated to increase the incrementality by a factor of 50% or more. In some cases, if the organic search result associated with the ad is within the top three (or another predetermined number) organic search results, the content management and delivery system 110 may decide not to show the ad because of the associated incrementality being below a threshold condition.
- Operations also include determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter ( 308 ).
- the charge can be determined based on the estimated likelihood of conversion. For example, if the incrementality associated with displaying an ad on a content page is estimated to be 90%, displaying the ad is likely to be very effective, and the advertiser may be charged the full bid price (or a suitably high fraction thereof) for displaying the ad. On the other hand, if the incrementality is determined to be around 30%, displaying the ad is likely to be less effective, and the advertiser may be charged only one third (or another suitably low fraction) of the full bid price.
- the content sponsors are charged based both on the bid price and the estimated parameter, the content sponsors can expect to receive more value for the amount they are charged. In some cases, this may obviate the need for the content sponsors to conduct extensive research on the effectiveness of their sponsored contents. This may also reduce the amount of resources that a provider of the content management and delivery system employs in order to provide information on effectiveness of the sponsored contents. Using the methods and systems described in this document, effectiveness of the sponsored contents can be enhanced, thereby leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and stronger relationships between a provider of the content management and delivery system and the content sponsors.

Abstract
This specification describes methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage device, for providing a content item. The subject matter of the specification is embodied in a method that includes receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and using the one or more processing devices to estimate a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page. The method also includes outputting data to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition, and determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet. These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements, or “ads”) to be provided along with the resources. For example, a Web page can include slots in which ads can be presented. The slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers). An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In an auction, content providers can provide bids specifying amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- In general, in one aspect, this disclosure features method performed by one or more processing devices. The method includes receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and using the one or more processing devices to estimate a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page. The method also includes outputting data to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition, and determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- In another aspect, the disclosure features a system that includes a learning engine and a pricing engine. The learning engine includes at least one processor, and is configured to receive a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and estimate a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page. The learning engine is also configured to providing a control signal to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition. The pricing engine is configured to determine a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- In another aspect, the disclosure features a computer readable storage device having encoded thereon computer readable instructions. The instructions, upon execution by a processor, cause a processor to perform operations that include receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item, and estimating a parameter representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page. The operations also include outputting data to display the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition, and determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter.
- Implementations of any of the above aspects can include one or more of the following.
- The conversion can be one of: a purchase, a phone call, a newsletter sign-up, a page visit, an interaction and a download, associated with the sponsored content item. Estimating the parameter can include determining an increment in the likelihood of the conversion due to displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page, as compared to the sponsored content item being absent from the particular content page. The likelihood can be determined based on historical conversion data for the sponsored content item. The likelihood is determined based on conversion data for content items substantially similar to the sponsored content item. The likelihood can be determined using a machine-learning process. The particular content page can include organic search results, and estimating the parameter can include determining whether the organic search results include an item associated with the sponsored content item. Estimating the parameter can include determining, within the organic search results, a position of the item associated with the sponsored content item. The threshold condition can specify the increment in the likelihood to be at least 25%. The charge can be a fraction of the bid price, the fraction being related to the estimated parameter, and less than or equal to unity. The parameter representing the likelihood of conversion can be computed also based on an estimated brand impact factor associated with the sponsored content item.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one, or more of the following advantages. Sponsored contents or ads can be presented only when they are likely to be effective for their intended purposes. For instance, an ad can be presented in a particular webpage only if a likelihood of conversion is above a predetermined threshold. Search results that are not sponsored, but generated by a search system in response to a query or search term provided by a user are often referred to as organic search results. When presenting an ad or sponsored content on a page that includes organic search results, the sponsored content may be presented if the organic results do not include an item related to the sponsored content, or do not include an item related to the sponsored content within a predetermined number of top ranked results. The incremental advantage of presenting the sponsored content with organic search results can therefore be taken into account, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the sponsored content. The advertisers can be charged based not only on the bid price, but also a factor or parameter that represents a likelihood of conversion, thereby making the advertisements more cost-effective.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for delivering sponsored content. -
FIG. 4 is an example of a computer system on which the processes described herein may be implemented. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Sponsored content, such as advertising, may be provided to user devices based on various parameters such as demographics, keywords and interest. For example, advertising (an “ad”) may be associated with one or more keywords that are stored as metadata along with the ad. A search engine, which operates on the network, may receive input from a user. The input may include one or more of the keywords. A content management and delivery system, which serves ads, may receive the keywords from the search engine, identify the ad as being associated with one or more of the keywords, and output the ad to the user, along with content that satisfies the initial search request. The content that satisfies the initial search request is often referred to as the organic search results, and can be distinguished from sponsored content (e.g. the ads) provided therewith. The organic and sponsored content are displayed on a computing device. When displayed, the sponsored content is incorporated into an appropriate slot on the results page. The user may select the ad by clicking on the ad. In response, a hyperlink associated with the ad directs the user to another web page. For example, if the ad is for ABC Travel Company, the Web page to which the user is directed may be the home page for ABC Travel Company. This activity is known as click-through. In this context, a “click” is not limited to a mouse click, but rather may include a touch, a programmatic selection, or any other action by which the ad may be selected or interacted with.
- A content auction can be run to determine which content is to be output in response to an input, such as one or more keywords. In the auction, content providers (e.g. advertisers) may bid on specific keywords (which are associated with their content). For example, a sporting goods ads provider may associate words such as “baseball”, “football” and “basketball” with their ads. The content provider may bid on those keywords in the content auction, for example, on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis. That is, the content provider's bid is an amount that the provider will pay (the cost) in response to users clicking on their displayed content. So, for example, if a content provider bids five cents per click, then the content provider pays five cents each time their content is clicked by a user. In other examples, payment need not be on a CPC basis, but rather may be on the basis of other factors such as brand impact, or other conversions, e.g., viewing or interacting with an impression, an amount of time spent on a landing page, a purchase, and so forth.
- Bidding in a content auction typically takes place against other content providers bidding for the same keywords. So, for example, if a user enters keywords into a search engine (to perform a search for related content), a content management system may select content items from different content providers, which are associated with those same keywords or variants thereof. The content auction is then run, e.g., by the content management system, to determine which content to serve along with the search results or any other requested content.
- In the case of online advertising, ideally, an auction is based on the value (or return on investment, or effectiveness) that the advertiser expects to generate from ad placement. In some implementations, the value of a sponsored content item can depend on other content present on the same page. When a sponsored content item is served or provided alongside a list of organic search results, the value of the sponsored content item can depend on whether or not the organic search results include an item related to the sponsored content item. For example, if the first page of organic search results provided in response to a search query (e.g. “footwear”) includes an item (e.g. a hyperlink to the website) related to a given company (e.g., “ABC Shoes”), the company may not be interested in also placing an ad on the same page, particularly if the item is featured as one of the top ranked organic results. On the other hand, if a particular page of organic results does not include an item related to the company, or if the item is not featured as one of the top ranked organic results, the company may be more interested in placing an ad on that particular page to attract traffic to the company website.
- In some implementations, the perceived value of placing a sponsored content item alongside organic search results can be represented by a parameter referred to as incrementality. Incrementality can be associated with, for example, an increase in clicks that are caused by a lack of similar organic results. Consider the example of an organic result that generates a hundred clicks in the absence of an associated sponsored content item. When a corresponding sponsored content item is also present, the total number of clicks on the organic result or the sponsored content item may be one hundred and twenty-five. In this example, the twenty-five (i.e. 25%) additional clicks generated in the presence of the associated sponsored content item can be considered to be incremental. Incrementality can also depend on the position or rank of the associated organic result on the page. For example, for a given sponsored content item, if the associated organic result has the topmost ranking within the organic search results, the incrementality may be only 25%. However, for the same sponsored content item, the incrementality can increase significantly when the ranking of the associated organic result is at a lower rank or position. For example, the incrementality may increase to over 90% when the associated organic result is ranked fifth or lower in the organic search results.
- When sponsored content items are provided alongside organic search results, for some content providers or advertisers, the value of a sponsored content item can therefore depend on whether (and/or at what position) a corresponding item appears among the organic search results. In some implementations, information on incrementality associated with a sponsored content item can be taken into account when presenting the sponsored content item alongside organic search results. Employing methods and systems described in this document, the information on incrementality can be used, for example, to present the sponsored content item on pages where they are likely to be clicked on, and hence more valuable and effective. The information can also be used to charge the content providers or advertisers in accordance with an estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item. For example, the price of an ad presented on a page without any corresponding organic results can be higher price than, for example, the price of the same ad when presented on a page including a highly-ranked corresponding organic result.
- In some implementations, an advertiser may bid by incremental click such that the advertiser pays for a click on an advertisement only if an estimated probability of the ad leading to a site visit is above a threshold and the site visit would likely not have occurred otherwise. The estimated probability can depend on various factors, including for example, time of day, user interests, and/or the presence of competing ads on the same page. The threshold can be zero, or a non-zero value between 0 and 1. Under these conditions, a higher correlation between displaying an ad and a site visit leads to the advertiser being charged a higher fraction of the bid price. In some implementations, with permission from an advertiser, an ad can be shown only when there is a reasonable probability of the ad leading to a conversion such as a site visit.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content in accordance with the methods and systems described in this document. Theexample environment 100 includes a content management anddelivery system 110 for selecting and providing content to user devices. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),content publishers 109, and the content management anddelivery system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andcontent publishers 109. Acontent repository 126 can store content items that are created by content sponsors 108. For example, the content items can include advertisements or other sponsored contents each of which may be associated with one or more keywords. - In some implementations, the content management and
delivery system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content (e.g. a resource 105) from a user, identify one or more eligible content items orresources 105, and provide a content item orresource 105 responsive to the request. For example, the content management anddelivery system 110 can be configured to provide organic search results and/or sponsored content items in response to one or more search terms provided by a user through auser device 106. In some implementations, the content management anddelivery system 110 can deliver sponsored content touser devices 106 responsive to a request for displaying a website. The content management anddelivery system 110 can be configured to select sponsored content items to provide alongside the organic search results or websites requested fromuser devices 106. The content management anddelivery system 110 can be configured to select sponsored content items such that the likelihood of the sponsored content items being clicked is high, for example, above a predetermined threshold value. For example, if delivering a particular ad to a user group that has previously demonstrated interest in fishing is likely to lead to a click (or another type of conversion), the ad can be delivered to that user group, but optionally suppressed for others. The likelihood of occurrence of a click can be represented using a parameter such as the incrementality associated with the corresponding sponsored content items. When the sponsored content items selected for delivery are chosen based on the likelihood of being clicked, the effectiveness or value of the sponsored content items can be enhanced. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by acontent publisher 109, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. In some implementations, acontent publisher 109 can have one or more slots or positions within a website for displaying sponsored contents. Thecontent publisher 109 can sell the slots (for example, via an auction) to content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers) for displaying sponsored contents within the slots. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). In some implementations, theresources 105 can include sponsored content provided by the content sponsors 108. For example, theresources 105 can include an advertisement, a deal or a special offer sponsored by acontent sponsor 108. In some implementations, aresource 105 can includesearch results 118 that are generated in response to one ormore queries 116 provided by a user. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones, tablet computers, e-readers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDA)), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. In some implementations, theuser device 106 can be configured to execute applications that are configured to receive/generate/manage sponsored or other content items from the content management anddelivery system 110. In some implementations, such applications can include third-party applications and can be downloaded to theuser device 106 from an applications repository. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by, for example, crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed (and, optionally, cached)resources 115 can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to the search system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, the search system 112 accesses thecache 114 or index to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. The search system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can include organic search result data generated by the search system 112 that identifies aresource 105 responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to theresource 105. In some implementations, the content management anddelivery system 110 can generate the search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, the content management anddelivery system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response. For example, the content management anddelivery system 110 can select one or more sponsored content items that are served along withsearch results 118, in response to auser query 116. In some implementations, the content management anddelivery system 110 can be configured to select the sponsored content item based on a parameter representing an estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item to trigger a conversion or click associated with the sponsored content item. - The content management and
delivery system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided to theuser device 106 based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management anddelivery system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate or prioritized delivery of the content items, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for delivery (or selection) of their content to auser device 106 either independently or with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. In some implementations, the content management and delivery system can be configured to charge a content sponsor 108 a fraction of the price thecontent sponsor 108 has offered to pay, based on, for example, the parameter representing the estimated effectiveness of the sponsored content item. In some implementations, an incrementality associated with a sponsored content item can be used to weight the bid price. For example, if the estimated incrementality associated with displaying a sponsored content item on a particular page is 50%, the corresponding content sponsor can be charged only one half (or some other appropriate fraction) of the bid price. However, if the same sponsored content item is displayed on a page where the estimated incrementality is 90%, the content sponsor can be charged a larger fraction of the bid price. Selection and pricing of sponsored content items by the content management anddelivery system 110 are described below in additional details with reference toFIG. 2 - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, initiating a phone call, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, signing up for a newsletter, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by delivering content that is more likely to be of interest to the user. For example, content items (e.g., ads, special offers or daily deals) that are delivered to a
user device 106 can be selected in part based on user preferences represented in corresponding interest profiles 128, which can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting examples of subsystems associated with a content management and delivery system. For example, the content management anddelivery system 110 can be connected to aconversion data repository 208 that stores information related to conversions associated with sponsored content items stored in thecontent repository 126. The content management anddelivery system 110 can also be connected to, for example, aweb server 204, and a content server 206 (e.g. an ad server). Theweb server 204 and the content server can be operable to communicate withpublishers 109, content sponsors 108 anduser devices 106, over one or more networks 102 (e.g., the Internet, intranet, Ethernet, wireless network). - The content management and
delivery system 110 can be configured to access information stored in theconversion data repository 208 to estimate a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying a sponsored content item on a particular page. The likelihood of conversion can be estimated from, for example, historical conversion data stored in the conversion data repository. The historical data can be related to the sponsored content item for which the estimation is done. For example, theconversion data repository 208 can store information on incrementality of a particular ad, when previously shown on a page that also includes a related organic search result among the top three entries. In some implementations, the historical data can be related to content items similar to the sponsored content item for which the estimation is done. For example, to estimate a likelihood of conversion of a sponsored content item related to shoes, the content management anddelivery system 110 can access historical incrementality data of other content items related to shoes and footwear. - The information stored in the
conversion data repository 208 can be accumulated in various ways. In some implementations, incrementality data related to a sponsored content item can be estimated using controlled data collection. For example,user devices 106 receiving a particular set of organic search results can be split (for example, using cookies) into two groups. One of the groups is shown a particular sponsored content item related to the organic search results. The particular sponsored content item is not shown to the second group. From the conversions occurring from the two groups, an incrementality associated with the sponsored content item can be estimated. The estimated incrementality data can be stored in theconversion data repository 208 and made available to the content management anddelivery system 110. - In some implementations, the content management and
delivery system 110 can include alearning engine 212 configured to estimate a likelihood of conversion of a sponsored content item. For example, thelearning engine 212 can be configured to estimate incrementality associated with a sponsored content item. The incrementality (or another parameter representing a likelihood of conversion) can be computed by thelearning engine 212 based on, for example, previously collected conversion data related to the same or similar content items. Thelearning engine 212 may implement various machine learning processes including, for example, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or semi-supervised learning. Various machine learning tools such as artificial neural networks, genetic programming, support vector machines, multi-armed bandit analysis, or Bayesian networks can be used in thelearning engine 212. The learning engine can estimate the likelihood of conversion for a given sponsored content item based on various characteristics and attributes of content items, including, for example, landing pages, keywords, time of the day at which the content items are displayed, graphical attributes (e.g., color scheme), nature of conversions, incrementality data and financial turnover. In some implementations, thelearning engine 212 can be configured to estimate incrementality of a sponsored content item based on one or more characteristics or attributes of similar content items. For example, an online logistic regression algorithm or support vector machine can predict incrementality even if a particular ad has not been previously shown. In such cases, characteristics of substantially similar previously shown ads can be correlated with measured incremental conversions to make a prediction. Linear regression can be used to determine which characteristics are more correlated than the others, and the characteristics can be chosen, for example, based on a ranking of their level of correlations. The number of characteristics chosen can vary based on the available computing power. - In some implementations, the content management and
delivery system 110 can be configured to deliver a sponsored content item to auser device 106 on determining that an estimated parameter (e.g., incrementality) related to the content sponsor item satisfies a threshold condition. For example, a particular ad can be provided on a page of organic search results only if the incrementality associated with displaying the ad exceeds 50%. In some cases, an organic result related to the sponsor of the ad can be within the first few positions in the search result page, thereby pushing the incrementality of the ad below the stipulated threshold of 50%. In such cases, the content management anddelivery system 110 can decide not to display the ad on that particular search result page. Continuing with the same example, if the incrementality of the ad is over the stipulated 50% (e.g., because there are no related organic results on the page), the content management anddelivery system 110 can be configured to select the ad for delivery to auser device 106. Selecting a sponsored content item based on a threshold condition, as described above, can enhance an effectiveness of the sponsored content item thereby increasing their worth to the content sponsors 108. - In some implementations, the content management and
delivery system 110 can include apricing engine 214 to determine a charge for a sponsored content item delivered to auser device 106. Thepricing engine 214 can be configured to determine the charge for a sponsored content item based on an estimated parameter representing an effectiveness of the sponsored content item. For instance, a content sponsor 108 (e.g. an advertiser) can be charged for an ad based on an estimated incrementality of the ad. For example, if an ad for “ABC Shoes” is displayed on a search result page that does not include any organic results directed to the website of “ABC Shoes”, the incrementality of the ad would likely be high, and thepricing engine 214 can determine the charge for displaying the ad on that page to be the full bid price, or a high percentage thereof. On the other hand, if the ad is shown on a search result page where one of the top three organic search results points to the website of “ABC Shoes”, the incrementality will likely be lower (e.g., 40%), and thepricing engine 214 can determine the charge for displaying the ad on that page to be one half (or another appropriate fraction) of the bid price. In general, the pricing engine can be configured to determine a charge for displaying a sponsored content item as a function of the bid price and a parameter (e.g., incrementality) representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item. - As an example of workflow, a
publisher 109 can request a sponsored content item (e.g., an ad) from thecontent server 206. In response to the request, one or more ads can be sent to thepublisher 109. The ads sent to thepublisher 109 can be selected based upon an auction. In those instances where the bids are based upon multiple bidding paradigms (e.g., Cost-per-Acquisition (CPA), Cost-per-Click (CPC), or Cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM)), the bids can be converted to a common bidding paradigm and the winning bid can be identified. The ads can be selected from thecontent repository 126 based on the winning bid. The ad(s) can also be selected to be displayed on a web property owned or operated by the publisher 109 (e.g., a web site), based upon, for example, a determination that a parameter representing an effectiveness of the ad (e.g., an incrementality parameter) satisfies a threshold condition. - In some implementations, when a user of the user-
device 106 clicks an ad served by thecontent server 206, the user is directed to a landing page on web property (e.g., a web site) of therespective content sponsor 108. The user may then perform a conversion event at the website (e.g., make a purchase, register). The conversion event generates conversion data which is sent to the content management anddelivery system 110, and stored in theconversion data repository 208. In this manner, a conversion history can be accumulated and maintained for each ad or ad group featuring substantially similar ads. - If a particular ad is displayed on a webpage of the publisher, the
pricing engine 214 can determine a charge for the same and convey information about the charge to the respective content sponsor. In some implementations, acontent sponsor 108 may access the content management anddelivery system 110 through thenetwork 102 and aweb server 204 using, for example, a web browser (e.g., Microsoft® Internet Explorer, Mozilla™, Firefox™, or the like). Theweb server 204 can be configured to serve thecontent sponsor 108 one or more web pages or other interface to allow management of ad campaigns. For example, the interface or webpage presented through theweb server 204 can allow a content sponsor to present a bid, select keywords, and enter or adjust threshold conditions for displaying sponsored content items. For example, if using an incrementality threshold of 60% generates insufficient conversions, thecontent sponsor 108 can adjust the threshold to a lower value (e.g., 40%) to have the corresponding sponsored content item delivered on additional pages. - For situations in which the systems and methods discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management and
delivery system 110 that may be more relevant to (or likely to be clicked on by) the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating monetizable parameters (e.g., monetizable demographic parameters). For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content management anddelivery system 110. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for delivering sponsored content items. Theprocess 300 can be performed by the content management anddelivery system 110, for example, using thecontent repository 126 and theconversion data repository 208.FIGS. 1 and 2 are referenced to provide examples related to theprocess 300. - Operations can include receiving a bid price associated with displaying a sponsored content item (302). The bid price can be received, for example, through an auction. Bidding paradigms used in the auction can include, for example, CPM, CPC, or CPA. Information on the bid price received for a particular sponsored content item (e.g., an ad) can be stored, for example, in the
content repository 126. The bid price can be for displaying the sponsored content item on a particular web-page or web-site. - Operations can include estimating one or more parameters representing a likelihood of conversion resulting from displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page (304). The one or more parameters can include a parameter representing an incrementality associated with the sponsored content item. The conversion can be an event that leads to a condition beneficial to the corresponding
content sponsor 108. For example, a conversion can include a click, a purchase, a phone call, a newsletter sign-up, a page visit, or a download resulting from displaying the sponsored content item. In some implementations, the one or more parameters can be chosen to represent an increment in the likelihood of the conversion due to displaying the sponsored content item on a particular content page. The likelihood of conversion for a particular sponsored content item can be determined, for example, based on historical conversion data associated with the same sponsored content item, or content items with similar characteristics. In some implementations, the likelihood of conversion can be determined using a machine learning process, for example one implemented using thelearning engine 212. - In some implementations, estimating the one or more parameters representing the likelihood of conversion is computed also based on an estimated brand impact factor associated with the sponsored content item. For example, if the sponsored content item is associated with a brand that is well recognized, the content item may be more likely to be clicked by a user. The brand impact factor associated with a content item can be determined, for example, using a machine learning process on substantially similar content items. In some implementations, the brand impact factor associated with a sponsored content item may be determined based on data obtained from a third-party source such as an organization that conducts research on impact factors of different brands and products. In some implementations, the brand impact factor is a numerical value that is used in estimating the one or more parameters representing the likelihood of conversion.
- Operations can include displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page upon determining that the estimated parameter satisfies a threshold condition (306). In some implementations, the threshold condition can be related to an incrementality associated with displaying the sponsored content item on the particular content page. For example, if the content page is a
search result page 118 that includes an organic search result related to an ad, the ad may be displayed only if displaying the ad is estimated to increase the incrementality by a factor of 50% or more. In some cases, if the organic search result associated with the ad is within the top three (or another predetermined number) organic search results, the content management anddelivery system 110 may decide not to show the ad because of the associated incrementality being below a threshold condition. - Operations also include determining a charge for displaying the content item based on the bid price and the estimated parameter (308). In some implementations, the charge can be determined based on the estimated likelihood of conversion. For example, if the incrementality associated with displaying an ad on a content page is estimated to be 90%, displaying the ad is likely to be very effective, and the advertiser may be charged the full bid price (or a suitably high fraction thereof) for displaying the ad. On the other hand, if the incrementality is determined to be around 30%, displaying the ad is likely to be less effective, and the advertiser may be charged only one third (or another suitably low fraction) of the full bid price. This way, because the content sponsors are charged based both on the bid price and the estimated parameter, the content sponsors can expect to receive more value for the amount they are charged. In some cases, this may obviate the need for the content sponsors to conduct extensive research on the effectiveness of their sponsored contents. This may also reduce the amount of resources that a provider of the content management and delivery system employs in order to provide information on effectiveness of the sponsored contents. Using the methods and systems described in this document, effectiveness of the sponsored contents can be enhanced, thereby leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and stronger relationships between a provider of the content management and delivery system and the content sponsors.
