- a digital assistant component can receive audio input that can include speech.
- the speech can include a request for content.
- the digital assistant component can request the content from a third-party responsive to the audio input. Delivery of the content to the digital assistant component can require authorization.
- It can be challenging to authenticate devices that the use a voice-based interface. For example, some input can be difficult or insecure to provide through a voice-based interface, such as credit card numbers or passwords that the end user may not want to speak aloud for privacy and security concerns.
- authorization through the non-voice-based interface of a second device can result in wasted network resources as the end user often abandons the request rather than switching to interface through a second device.
- Systems and methods of the present technical solution enable for a delayed, two- factor authentication to occur in networked devices that improves the delivery of requested digital components while reducing computing resource utilization, network bandwidth, or remote procedure calls.
- the systems and methods of the present technical solution enable the immediate delivery of digital components, which results in fewer abandoned requests, while the digital component delivery is authorized through a delay two- factor authentication process.
- voice-driven (and hands free) digital assistant devices can be used to request digital components.
- the digital components can be provided through a subscription-based service (e.g., a streaming music service) or may require payment authorization (e.g., purchasing a song). Delivery of the digital component to the digital assistant can require authorization at a second, non-voice-driven client device.
- This system of the present technical solution can include a state machine. The state machine can track both the enabled state of the services providing the digital component (for the digital assistant) and the authentication state of the digital assistant.
- the system can provide the requested content to the digital assistant even if the state of the state machine is in a non-authenticated state.
- the system can transmit an authorization request to a second client device that is associated with the digital assistant.
- the system can provide the second client device with a predetermined amount of time to respond to the authorization request. During this predetermined amount of time, the digital assistant can render or present the requested digital component.
- the second device can show a notification with a confirm option and a reject option, or the notification might open a dialog with those options.
- the second client device can automatically approve the authorization request based on local device state, such as if the second client device is within a
- the second client device can send the system an authentication token and a unique action identifier.
- the system can use the authentication token and the unique action identifier to change the digital assistant’s state machine to an authorized state.
- a primary engagement action will enable a disabled service ephemerally and syndicate a notification to a second device.
- This change of state will also include a timestamp denoting when the ephemeral state is no longer valid.
- This notification will include a payload with an action that has two sets of parameters, the first parameter is an instruction to authenticate the user and a dialog component (or reference to dialog component) which informs the user about which specific action is being authenticated, and the second parameter is a specific action or event identifier for the action to be authenticated.
