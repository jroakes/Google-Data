Embodiment
As shown in fig. 1, process 100 creates the synonym mapping table from document library.Document can be HTML (HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)) document, PDF (portable document format) document, text document, word processing document (for example, Microsoft
Process 100 also can be applied to the resource that the text of other kind can be searched for, for example the media resource by metadata identification.
The synonym mapping table comprises the word as the common form of key, and each in the word of described common form is associated with one or more variants.For example, consider only to find therein bilingual: the simple storehouse of French and English.If " elephant " is the clauses and subclauses of the common form in the synonym mapping table, if then find variant " elephant ", " é l é phant " and " el é phant " in the storehouse, these variants will be associated with these clauses and subclauses as value.Each value also comprises additional information: the language of the document that the example of variant occurs therein, and variant is with the number of times of this language appearance.Continue this example, in the storehouse, " el é phant " may be in being considered to the document of English found 90 times, and in being considered to the document of French found 300 times.
In one embodiment, with known and consistent character code to the training and search library in each document coding, described character code is such as 8 unified format transformations (UTF-8), it can come any character code with Unicode standard (that is, most of known character and ideograph).Document inconsistent or unknown coding must encoded conversion.In one embodiment, the storehouse is that the web crawl device is from the set of the document of Web discovery.
The language of each document in the recognition training storehouse.The language of determining each document can be the part (step 120) of process 100 clearly.As an alternative, the language of document can be included in the part of the information in the training storehouse.The language of document or word is not necessarily simply corresponding to natural language.Language can comprise any diacritic language system by its spelling, grammer, vocabulary or morphology definition.For example, the Rome indian languages, the equivalents of the romanization mark with phonetic symbols of one group of language (for example Bengali and Hindi) can be considered to be at the language that is independent of Bengali and Hindi in the tradition spelling font.
The document language testing process is used Statistical Learning Theory.In one embodiment, its use naive Bayesian (
Bayes) disaggregated model calculates the possibility of possible kind and the kind that prediction has maximum likelihood.Kind is that language/coding is right, for example English/ASCII, Japanese/Shift-JIS or Russian/UTF8, and document can be with described language/coding to representing.Some language is corresponding with a plurality of kinds, because can be with Multi-encoding to described speech encoding, and some coding be corresponding with a plurality of kinds, because described coding can be used to represent multilingual.
Model-naive Bayesian is used to determine most probable kind based on the text of page of text and (alternatively) URL(uniform resource locator) (URL) for page of text.
Determine the coding of page of text with model-naive Bayesian, described model-naive Bayesian is predicted the coding of maximum likelihood based on the pairing of the byte of performance text.If the URL of page of text is available, suppose text from a certain TLD (that is, the decline of internet domain name) then this model also with the probability calculation of specific coding interior.
When effective language detects, text is converted to Unicode from its original coding, and use characteristic is carried out this language detection.Typically, the natural language word is the best features that will use, therefore text segmentation is become word.Given language, model-naive Bayesian calculates the probability of each word and comes to be text prediction maximum possible language based on this probability.
Can use with a large amount of electronic document sample training of various codings and language and test model-naive Bayesian.The training model-naive Bayesian is in fact that calculated characteristics is for the probability of given language.
For each language, can define predetermined character blacklist.The blacklist of character is the tabulation of the common character that can not occur in the document of this language.The blacklist of character not necessarily reflects the strict inherent characteristics of language.For example, ' w ' do not occur in the French word, therefore it can be added to the French blacklist.Yet use and the external word that comprises ' w ' occurs enough repeatedly in the French document, can get rid of from the French blacklist ' w '.Can be fully or partly manually determine tabulation.As an alternative, can analyze the occurrence number of character in being known as the document of language-specific, to inform artificial process or automatically to produce the blacklist of character with adding up.
According to the mapping specific to language word is mapped to common form.Each mapping specific to language is the set of one or more character conversion mapping tables.One or more output characters that each conversion mapping table specifies one or more input characters and one or more input character to be mapped to.Process 100 substitutes the maximal sequence (or prefix) of the character that is complementary with the input of changing mapping table with one or more output characters of mapping table.Other character copies constant.For any given word, the result of this character conversion process generates the common form of this word.The data structure that longest prefix match is helped in design can be used to store the mapping (for example, search tree (trie) or prefix trees) specific to language.
For example, be mapped to " в о д к а " (changing) from " the в о д к а " of Russian document, and " в о д к а " in the Serbian document is mapped to " vodka ".Be intended to catch the author's of those language expection specific to the conversion of language.Although this has reflected that Russian writer may provide " в о д к а ", Serbian custom hint in search inquiry Cyrillic language word more the equivalents of Chang Zuowei romanization mark with phonetic symbols provide.
Appointment is the special circumstances that comprise the conversion of the word that can collapse loigature for mapping more than the conversion mapping table of an input character.Can collapse loigature is two character combinations, and it can be expressed as character single, that usually read again in some language.For example, if German conversion hint
Can not be set type, then ' Ue ' or ' UE ' is suitable alternative body.Therefore the German document can be pieced together work " ueber " with word " ü ber ".During being mapped to common form, two character conversion mapping tables will often collapse the loigature that can collapse and the result will be removed stress.For example, in one embodiment, German conversion mapping table all is converted to " uber " with " ueber " and " ü ber ".
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment for the process 200 that creates synonym mapping table (step 150 of Fig. 1).Process 200 comprises reception common form clauses and subclauses, as mentioned above (step 210).From the synonym mapping table, omit any common form clauses and subclauses (step 220) that only comprise a variant identical with its common form.Such clauses and subclauses do not provide synonym for common form.
In language-specific, if comprising, variant collapses the variant that loigature and its stressed equivalents neither be used for key, then process 200 is omitted this variant (step 240) for this key.
Some variant only depends on its stress just may have different connotations.For fear of the undesirable pollution of such variant to the synonym mapping table, can define the word blacklist specific to language.It should not be the word list of the variant that is associated with given language that each blacklist comprises.If variant is on the blacklist of language, then this language is by from the variant disassociation.For example, if " the " on the French blacklist, then its common form is that the variant of " the " can not be associated with French.This has prevented obscuring between English " the " and French " th é ".
For each key, calculate each variant at the relative frequency (step 250) of all variants that are used for language-specific.In order to calculate the relative frequency of any given variant in given language, for identical key, the number of times that this variant is occurred in this language is divided by the sum of the appearance of all variants in same-language.For example, if key is " elephant ", and " é l é phant " occurred respectively in English and French 100 and 1000 times; And " el é phant " occurred respectively in English and French 90 and 300 times, and then the relative frequency of " é l é phant " is 52% (that is, 100/ (100+90)) in English.In one embodiment, the relative frequency for each each variant of language is stored in the synonym mapping table.
For illustrative purpose, process 200 has been described to for example by remove the process that clauses and subclauses or variant change this existing synonym mapping table from existing synonym mapping table.As an alternative, during the initial construction of synonym mapping table by not comprising that at first some clauses and subclauses or variant can obtain identical effect.
Figure 4 illustrates illustrative example synonym mapping table.This diagram hypothesis storehouse is by four kinds of language Symbols: English, French, Rome Dard and Bengali.This mapping table comprises three keys: " elephant ", " liberte " and " nityananda ".Each key is associated with a plurality of variants.Particularly, variant " nity.a-nanda " (410) occurs in the document that is identified as Rome Dard and Bengali from the storehouse.Yet this variant only occurs in each language 6 times.If specified absolute threshold greater than 6 for each language, then will from the synonym mapping table, remove these language and variant.
Variant
Can utilize one of useful thing that the synonym mapping table carries out is to increase to the inquiry of search engine with this synonym mapping table.
As shown in Figure 3, process 300 can be used to increase inquiry to merge the synonym from the synonym mapping table.In fact, receive the usually not perfect user's of description the inquiry of wanting of inquiry of (step 310).The user is subjected to the limitation of input media and accurately indicates the not toilet of the language of inquiry to retrain.Desirable synonym is reflection user those words with the content that provides under desirable environment.Process 300 is intended to by to marking to approach desirable synonym with respect to the variant in the synonym mapping table of the word in the inquiry and the language that means of user, and the language that described user means is approached by the language of inquiry.
Determine that the inquiry possibility is to use the language identical with interface languages to carry out with the inquiry in past.If Search Results has been sent in the inquiry in past, the result's that the inquiry of then passing by can be selected subsequently based on the user language by automatic classification for using language-specific.Below hypothesis is rational: the language of inquiry is identical with the language of the document that user selection is checked, if especially selection represents the extracts that comprises from search result document.Its language is determined in inquiry that also can the hand inspection past.Automatic and artificial technology can be combined: be used as the seed of use during automatically determining with the raising degree of accuracy by manual sort's inquiry.The result of automatic categorizer can inform the follow-up adjustment of sorter.The adjustment of artificial definite seed and query classifier can be repeated repeatedly with further raising degree of accuracy.The whole past inquiry that receives with same interface of current inquiry is complementary, and generated query is possibility score value or the probability of using the language identical with interface languages.
For example the word that occurs with many different language of proprietary name (for example the Internet) may excessive influence be used for the score value vector of inquiry.If find such word in query terms, then the score value of described word can be arranged to show that this word may be to use interface languages arbitrarily.As an alternative, such word can be left in the basket.
Will be from all multiplication of vectors of previous steps.Composite vector and inquiry are that the probability (or score value) with the language at interface multiplies each other, and produce and inquire about probability (or score value) vector.This inquiry probability vector comprises for each language, and inquiry is the probability (or score value) with this language.The speech selection that will have maximum probability (or score value) is the query language that belongs to this inquiry.
Each word (step 330) that process 300 is simplified in the inquiry.In simplifying each word, process collapses loigature, remove stress and to the character mark with phonetic symbols in each word.This is to finish from training the storehouse to obtain the identical mode of common form with aforesaid.Yet, this particular conversion mapping table that makes to simplify looking up words in some aspects from creating the synonym mapping table in the conversion mapping table that uses different.Particularly, simplify each word and usually be independent of language.
Yet in particular case, how the query language of identifying simplifies looking up words if can affecting.This is even more important when the result of word simplification is meaningless in query language.For example, ' ue ' is the meaningless substitute for ' ü ' in Turkish, from different in the German.It will be undesirable for the Turkish user " T ü rk " being reduced to " Tuerk ".
Usually, the simplification word from inquiry is used to use each the simplification word as key to search and retrieve variant (step 340) from the synonym mapping table.Each variant is the potential synonym of original query word.Relative frequency under the key of each variant in each language is used to estimate whether this variant is supposed to as the synonym (step 350) of the key that is used for each language.This estimation is by suing for peace to calculate to following product: for each language, inquiry is to multiply each other with the relative frequency of the probability of this language with variant in this language.For example, consider when " é l é phant " number of times of 52% in English be variant and when 77% number of times is variant in French.Then for inquiry, being determined may be that to have in English 70% probability and be determined may be gallice to have 30% probability, is used for synthetic being estimated as of " é l é phant ": 52% * 70%+77% * 30%=59.5%.If the estimation of calculating surpasses synonym probability threshold value (for example 50%), then this variant is selected to the amplification inquiry.The probability that language statistics in the given synonym mapping table and query language sorter provide selects specific synonym probability threshold value that good results is provided.Be to collapse in result's the special circumstances of loigature in given language at variant, then when calculating the estimation of this variant, reduce the relative frequency (for example becoming 1/4th) of this variant.This punishment reflection of the relative frequency of variant has been collapsed irrelevantly the potential risk of the loigature of variant.
Add each selected variant to inquiry (step 360), do not occur in possible query language unless variant is stop word and variant: such variant is left in the basket.Be used for each selected variant of each original word from inquiry this original word that increases.Each variant is added as the associating with original word.For example, inquiry " el é phant trunk " is amplified as " (el é phant or elephant or é l é phant) trunk ", supposes that wherein elephant and é l é phant are selected as the variant for el é phant.
Process is searched for search library (step 370) with the inquiry of having increased.Search library comprises and is in that it is original, the document of unaltered form.Except the impact of amplification inquiry, from library searching and provide the result can be not influenced in addition.
Query language if possible is the language (that is, the very small scale of whole documents) that is not fully showed in the search library, then may not wish to comprise the variant from the synonym mapping table.Adding variant to search inquiry has increased and the risk that is complementary from the outer document of desirable language, makes potentially the document that has been full of a large amount of other Languages among the result.Yet, when the original query word only comprises the letter of anacrusis and when not comprising the loigature (for example, " ueber " is reduced to " uber ") that can collapse, should not consider that possible query language seeks variant.In one embodiment, the decision that comprises variant is depended on interface languages but not query language.
The embodiment that Fig. 5 A to Figure 34 shows to shine upon the word in the training storehouse or is used for simplifying the conversion mapping table of the word in the search inquiry.Each illustrates the name group of one or more conversion mapping tables.Each conversion mapping table is shown as the delegation in the row among the figure.The conversion mapping table is illustrated as having at least and aforesaid input character and output character.In addition, the row that are labeled as " UCS " show the hexadecimal value of the coding of character according to universal character set (UCS).When not providing the UCS value, each character is in 95 printable ascii characters.
According to convenient or convention and the inessential grouping that comes control conversion mapping table: one or more conversion mapping table groups can be configured for the mapping specific to language of language-specific.The combination that is used for the group of language-specific can depend on whether described group be used to shine upon the word in training storehouse or be used for simplifying word in the inquiry.

As shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, some conversion mapping table is also specified the stressed equivalents (the in the drawings row of Attach Title " A.E. ") of the loigature that collapses.These mapping tables have two character inputs (loigature that can collapse) and outputs (loigature that collapses).This information can be used to determine the loigature whether two characters (input) can collapse.As an alternative, also to indicate specific character (output) possibility be the result of the loigature that can collapse to this information.
