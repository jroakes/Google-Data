- Ring-based network topologies such as multi-dimensional torus and twisted torus networks, are typically used in on-chip and off-chip networks. These network topologies may suffer from deadlock.

- the technology described herein is directed to improving the performance of ring-based network topologies while ensuring deadlock-free operation by shortening dependency chains and efficiently load balancing the virtual channel (VC) resources of the network.
- the dependency chains may be shortened by adding an additional dateline such that the two datelines are separated by half the diameter of the ring.
- Increasing the efficiency of the load balancing between the VC resources may include switching a data packet to a second VC at any time, so long as that data packet will not cross one of the datelines.
- nodes that form the network may be connected via physical links, such as wires, cables, traces, etc.
- Each physical link may carry data packets on any number of VCs.
- each physical link between a pair of nodes can communicate data packets via one or more VCs.
- each node pair is connected via a physical link.

- FIG. 1 illustrates the VCs only for connections 102 and 108 , but it should be understood that the other connections, including connections 104 , 106 , 110 , and 112 also include virtual channels VC0 and VC1.
- ring network 100 includes only six nodes (0-5) and two virtual channels (VC0 and VC1) a ring network may include any number of nodes and any number of virtual channels.

- nodes may include computers, servers, mobile devices, processors, cores, routers, memory, cards (e.g., accelerator cards), FIFOs, or other such queues, etc.
- nodes may include a collection of computing resources, such as processors with routers, etc.
- Selection of the VC on which to transmit a data packet may be static.
- the routes may be predetermined and fixed.
- the static routes can be stored in tables, such as within RAM memory within the node.
- the destination of a packet may be used to index a table and lookup the route to the destination.
- dateline routing is used to designate one physical link in each direction of a ring as a dateline.
- the physical links may be bidirectional links, such that both directions in a ring can be treated separately.
- Queueing structures are typically programmed to transmit each data packet on a first channel. In the event the data packets cross the dateline, the data packets are moved to the second virtual channel until the data packets reach their respective destination nodes.
- a dateline 220 is positioned between nodes 211 and 201 .
- the ring network 200 includes six nodes 201 - 211 , and physical links between each adjacent node, including physical links 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , and 212 .
- Each physical link includes two virtual channels VC0 (illustrated as a solid line) and VC1 (illustrated as a dashed line), with the exception of physical link 212 , which may be considered a transition link that transfers the data packets between VC0 and VC1.
- FIG. 2 illustrates physical link 212 , between node5 211 and node0 201 , as a single line, with the line being solid on the left side of dateline 220 and dashed on the right side of dateline 220 .
- a routing algorithm may initially route the data packets on VC0. However, in the event a data packet crosses the dateline 220 , the routing algorithm may switch the data packet to VC1 and subsequently route the data packet on VC1 to its destination node. As most data packets reach their respective destination nodes prior to passing the dateline 220 , a spiral-like chain of acyclic VC dependencies is created. This chain of acyclic dependencies is sufficient to ensure that ring network 200 is deadlock-free. However, the dateline routing creates a chain of VC dependencies longer than the ring network itself.

- the routing algorithm may initially route the data packets on VC0. However, in the event a data packet crosses the first dateline 320 or the second dateline 322 , the routing algorithm may switch the routing of the data packet to VC1. The routing algorithm may then route the data packet on VC1 to its destination node.
- a data packet may traverse, at most, two physical links on VC0 before being transitioned to VC1. For example, a data packet may be transmitted from node0 301 to node5 311 . In this example, the data packet may traverse physical links 302 and 304 on VC0, but then be transitioned to VC1 when crossing the first dateline 320 at physical link 306 .
- the data packet may then traverse physical links 308 and 310 on VC1 before reaching destination node5 311 .
- a data packet may traverse five physical links before transitioning from VC0 to VC1.

- Balanced VC usage may be determined based on an assumed traffic pattern.

- a network with an all-to-all traffic pattern may have different balancing needs than a network with all-to-one or other such traffic patterns.
- global all-to-all traffic patterns are discussed.
- each network node can receive data packets from every other network node and transmit data packets to every other network node.
- Queuing structures may route data packets through the network.
- networks may use these queuing structures to direct data packets as the data packets traverse the network.
- the turn queue may be used to direct data packets as they turn from one dimension of the torus network to the next. For instance, the turn queue may be used to direct a data packet received by a node on a first dimension onto another dimension.
- Dimension queues may direct data packets continuing along a single dimension of the network and on a virtual channel. For instance, the dimension queue may direct a data packet from one node to another along the same dimension and on a common virtual channel, such as VC0 or VC1.
- the queuing structures may be part of the node or a component connected to the node. For instance, the queueing structures may be part of a router or other network interface integrated into a node.

- the data packet is then transmitted to turn queue 417 in node 407 , where it is subsequently transmitted out, as indicated by arrow 449 .
- the data packet in the example shown in FIG. 4 makes three “hops.”
- a hop is a transmission from one node to another node.
- the three hops are the transmission from node 401 to node 403 , from node 403 to node 405 , and from node 405 to node 407 .
- the data packet would be limited to using turn queues.
- the data packet would not use any dimension queues, as the data packet would be egres sing or ingressing dimensions of the torus ring network using turn queues.
- the dimension queues in each node 501 , 503 , 505 , 507 , and 509 may be assigned a virtual channel for routing along a dimension of the ring network.
- dimensions queues 521 , 523 , 525 , 527 , and 529 of nodes 501 - 509 , respectively are assigned VC1.
- Dimension queues 541 , 543 , 545 , 547 , and 549 of nodes 501 - 509 , respectively, are assigned VC0.
- Data packets traveling between nodes on the same virtual channel, e.g., VC0 or VC1 would pass between dimension queues having the same assigned virtual channel.
- a data packet passing between node 503 and 505 on virtual VC0 would pass from dimension queue 543 to dimension queue 545 .
- a data packet passing between node 503 and 505 on virtual channel VC1 would pass from dimension queue 523 to dimension queue 525 .
- the data packets For data packets traveling h ⁇ 2 hops, the data packets use h ⁇ 1 dimension queue(s) along their routes. As all-to-all traffic is symmetric, the total usage of the dimension queues may be determined by summing over the routes that are at least two hops:
- h is the number of hops and t(h) is the fraction of traffic that travels h hops along the dimension queues.
- the units of this sum are the average number of data packets that enter the dimension queues on a node when a single packet is injected at each node in the ring network.
- the routing algorithm may have a threshold T defined. Any data packet with T or fewer hops remaining in its route, and not going to pass a dateline, may be placed into VC1. Otherwise, the data packet may use VC0.

- From dimension queue 527 the data packet is transmitted to turn queue 529 of node 509 , where it is subsequently taken off of the network 500 .
- data packet 1 is initially routed onto VC0 in node 503 , as data packet 1 has 2-hops remaining. It is not until data packet 1 reached node 505 , when data packet 1 has 1-hop remaining, equaling the threshold value of 1, that it gets routed onto VC1. If the threshold value were 2-hops, data packet 1 would have been routed onto VC1 at node 503 .
- the data packet is immediately routed onto VC1, since data packet 2 has a 1-hop remaining, equaling the threshold value of 1 when it reaches node 507 .
- the number of datelines a packet may cross may be determined by performing a table lookup.
- the number of datelines along a route to a destination node may be stored in the RAM memory table routes. Accordingly, the number of datelines to be traversed by a data packet to a destination node may be determined by using the destination of the data packet to index a table and lookup the number of datelines along the route to the destination, as stored in the table.
- the total load on the dimension queues may be divided into the load contributed by data packets with h hops remaining, which is defined as:
- r(1) t(1)+t(2)+ . . .
- summing over r(h) recovers the total load as computed above:
- a T may then be selected to minimize the imbalance between the two VCs:
- Example values of threshold T have been computed using the above equations for different sized rings in table 1 , below:
- a threshold value (T) for values of k ⁇ 64 may be determined using one of the following equations:
- threshold round(0.175 ⁇ k ⁇ 0.15) (1)

Abstract
Systems and method for routing data packets in ring network. A data packet being transmitted to a destination node may be received by a first structure at a first node. The first node may determine a number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node and compare the determined number of hops to a threshold hop value to determine whether the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value. If the number of hops is greater than the threshold, the data packet may be transmitted to a dimension queuing structure for a first virtual channel within a second node, otherwise, the data packet may be transmitted to a dimension queuing structure for a second virtual channel or a turn queuing structure within the second node.
Description
- Ring-based network topologies, such as multi-dimensional torus and twisted torus networks, are typically used in on-chip and off-chip networks. These network topologies may suffer from deadlock. Deadlock occurs when a chain of packets is waiting on each other to make progress through the network and the chain forms a cycle that prevents any of the packets from progressing. Typical approaches to ensure a deadlock-free network topology include using a dateline or a red-rover algorithm, both of which rely on virtual channels. However, the use of virtual channels may result in reduced performance of the network topology due to imbalanced distributions of the data packets throughout the network. Moreover, the use of a dateline may create long virtual channel dependency chains, which can lead to compounding unfairness and loss of throughput as the number of nodes per dimension increases.
- This technology is directed to routing data packets through a ring-based network without deadlock. In one aspect, the technology is directed to a method of routing data packets within a ring network, the method includes receiving, at a first queueing structure within a first node of the ring network, a data packet to be transmitted to a destination node. The method may also include determining, by the first node, a number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node of the ring network. The method may also include comparing, by the first node, the number of hops to a threshold hop value to determine whether the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.
- The method may also include transmitting, by the first node, the data packet to (i) a dimension queuing structure for a first virtual channel within a second node of the ring network if the number of hops is greater than the threshold hop value, or (ii) a dimension queuing structure for a second virtual channel or a turn queuing structure within the second node if the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.
- In some instances, the first queueing structure within the first node is a turn queueing structure.
- In some instances, the data packet is transmitted to the turn queueing structure within the second node when the second node is the destination node.
- In some instances, the network includes a first dateline and a second dateline. In some examples, the first dateline and the second dateline are each positioned between a pair of network nodes on the ring network, wherein a number of nodes positioned between the first dateline and the second dateline matches a number of nodes positioned between the second dateline and the first dateline.
- In some examples, the first node may also further determine whether the data packet will traverse a dateline as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node. In some examples, the data packet is transmitted to the dimension queueing structure for the first virtual channel within the second node when it is determined the data packet will traverse the dateline.
- In some instances, the method further includes: determining, by the second node after receiving the data packet, a second number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the second node to the destination node of the ring network; comparing, by the second node, the number of hops to the threshold hop value to determine whether the second number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value; and transmitting, by the second node, the data packet to: (i) a dimension queuing structure for the first virtual channel within a third node of the ring network if the number of hops is greater than the threshold hop value; or (ii) a dimension queuing structure for a second virtual channel or a turn queuing structure within the third node if the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.

- In another aspect, the technology may include a ring network including a first node having a first queueing structure. The ring network may include a second node having a dimension queuing structure for a first virtual channel and a dimension queuing structure for a second virtual channel. The ring network may also include a destination node, where the first node is configured to receive, at the first queueing structure, a data packet to be transmitted to the destination node. The ring network may also include a destination node. The first node may be configured to determine a number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node of the ring network; compare the number of hops to a threshold hop value to determine whether the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.
- The first node of the ring network may be configured to transmit the data packet to (i) the dimension queueing structure for the first virtual channel if the number of hops is greater than the threshold hop value, or (ii) the dimension queuing structure for the second virtual channel if the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.
- In some instances, the first queueing structure within the first node of the ring network may be a turn queueing structure.
- In some instances, the ring network may include a first dateline and a second dateline. In some examples, the first dateline and the second dateline are each positioned between a pair of network nodes on the ring network, wherein a number of nodes positioned between the first dateline and the second dateline matches a number of nodes positioned between the second dateline and the first dateline. In some examples, the ring network includes more than eight nodes.
- In some instances, the first node may be further configured to determine whether the data packet will traverse a dateline as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node.
- In some instances, the second node may be configured to: determine, after receiving the data packet, a second number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the second node to the destination node of the ring network; compare, by the second node, the number of hops to the threshold hop value to determine whether the second number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value; and transmit the data packet to: (i) a dimension queuing structure for the first virtual channel within a third node of the ring network if the number of hops is greater than the threshold hop value; or (ii) a dimension queuing structure for the second virtual channel or a turn queuing structure within the third node if the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value.
- In some instances, the data packet is transmitted to the turn queue structure within the third node when the third node is the destination node.

- Other technical features may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

FIG. 6 illustrates data packets traversing a ring network in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for transmitting data packets over a network, according to aspects of the disclosure. - The technology described herein is directed to improving the performance of ring-based network topologies while ensuring deadlock-free operation by shortening dependency chains and efficiently load balancing the virtual channel (VC) resources of the network. In this regard, the dependency chains may be shortened by adding an additional dateline such that the two datelines are separated by half the diameter of the ring. Increasing the efficiency of the load balancing between the VC resources may include switching a data packet to a second VC at any time, so long as that data packet will not cross one of the datelines.
- In a ring-based network topology, nodes that form the network may be connected via physical links, such as wires, cables, traces, etc. Each physical link may carry data packets on any number of VCs. In this regard, each physical link between a pair of nodes can communicate data packets via one or more VCs. For example, and as illustrated in the
ring network 100 of FIG. 1, each node pair is connected via a physical link. For instance,node0 101 is connected to node1 103 viaphysical link 102,node1 103 is connected tonode2 105 viaphysical link 104,node2 105 is connected tonode3 107 viaphysical link 106,node3 107 is connected tonode4 109 viaphysical link 108,node4 109 is connected to node5 111 viaphysical link 110, andnode5 111 is connected to node0 101 viaphysical link 112. Each physical link 110-112 inring network 100 includes two virtual channels VC0 and VC1, as illustrated bycallouts connections FIG. 1 illustrates the VCs only forconnections connections ring network 100 includes only six nodes (0-5) and two virtual channels (VC0 and VC1) a ring network may include any number of nodes and any number of virtual channels. - Nodes may include any type of computing resource capable of communicating with other computing resources. For instance, nodes may include computers, servers, mobile devices, processors, cores, routers, memory, cards (e.g., accelerator cards), FIFOs, or other such queues, etc. In some instances, nodes may include a collection of computing resources, such as processors with routers, etc.
- Selection of the VC on which to transmit a data packet may be static. In static routing, the routes may be predetermined and fixed. Mechanically, the static routes can be stored in tables, such as within RAM memory within the node. The destination of a packet may be used to index a table and lookup the route to the destination.
- In ring-based network topologies, dateline routing is used to designate one physical link in each direction of a ring as a dateline. In this regard, the physical links may be bidirectional links, such that both directions in a ring can be treated separately. Queueing structures are typically programmed to transmit each data packet on a first channel. In the event the data packets cross the dateline, the data packets are moved to the second virtual channel until the data packets reach their respective destination nodes.
- For example, and as illustrated in
ring network 200 ofFIG. 2 , which may be compared toring network 100, adateline 220 is positioned betweennodes ring network 200 includes six nodes 201-211, and physical links between each adjacent node, includingphysical links physical link 212, which may be considered a transition link that transfers the data packets between VC0 and VC1. To illustrate the transition from VC0 to VC1,FIG. 2 illustratesphysical link 212, betweennode5 211 andnode0 201, as a single line, with the line being solid on the left side ofdateline 220 and dashed on the right side ofdateline 220. - As data packets traverse the
network 200, a routing algorithm may initially route the data packets on VC0. However, in the event a data packet crosses thedateline 220, the routing algorithm may switch the data packet to VC1 and subsequently route the data packet on VC1 to its destination node. As most data packets reach their respective destination nodes prior to passing thedateline 220, a spiral-like chain of acyclic VC dependencies is created. This chain of acyclic dependencies is sufficient to ensure thatring network 200 is deadlock-free. However, the dateline routing creates a chain of VC dependencies longer than the ring network itself. - While no individual packet will travel along the entirety of the chain, created by VC0 and VC1, a sequence of dependent packets can be blocked along the chain. To advance blocked data packets, queuing structures of
network 200 may implement an arbitration algorithm, such as a locally fair or globally fair arbitration algorithm. - To reduce the length of the dependency chain, a second dateline may be introduced. The two datelines, referred to herein as “dual-datelines,” may be separated by half the diameter of the ring network. For example, and as illustrated in
ring network 300 ofFIG. 3 , which may be compared toring networks first dateline 320 is positioned after the third node (305) and thesecond dateline 322 is positioned after node5 311 of the six-node ring network 300. In this regard, thefirst dateline 320 is positioned betweennode2 305 andnode3 307, and thesecond dateline 322 is positioned betweennode5 311 andnode0 301. Thus, there are three nodes positioned on each side of the datelines, withnodes second dateline 322 and thefirst dateline 320 andnodes first dateline 320 and thesecond dateline 322. - Like
ring network 200,ring network 300 includes six nodes 301-311, and physical links between each adjacent node, includingphysical links transition links - As data packets traverse
network 300, the routing algorithm may initially route the data packets on VC0. However, in the event a data packet crosses thefirst dateline 320 or thesecond dateline 322, the routing algorithm may switch the routing of the data packet to VC1. The routing algorithm may then route the data packet on VC1 to its destination node. A data packet may traverse, at most, two physical links on VC0 before being transitioned to VC1. For example, a data packet may be transmitted fromnode0 301 tonode5 311. In this example, the data packet may traversephysical links first dateline 320 atphysical link 306. The data packet may then traversephysical links destination node5 311. In contrast, and referring toFIG. 2 , a data packet may traverse five physical links before transitioning from VC0 to VC1. In this regard, a data packet may be transmitted on VC0 over the physical links fromnode0 201 tonode5 211, includingphysical links FIG. 3 illustrates only two datelines inring network 300—thefirst dateline 320 and thesecond dateline 322—ring networks may include any number of datelines, BALANCING - Better balancing of data packet traffic on the virtual channels may be achieved by routing data packets that will not cross a dateline to the second virtual channel VC1. In this regard, data packets that will not cross a virtual channel may be transitioned from VC0 to VC1 when the data packet is N hops from its destination node. The value of N may be based on the size of the ring network (e.g., the number of nodes in the ring network) and the expected packet traffic patterns.
- Balanced VC usage may be determined based on an assumed traffic pattern. In this regard, different types of traffic patterns may use each VC differently. For example, a network with an all-to-all traffic pattern may have different balancing needs than a network with all-to-one or other such traffic patterns. In the examples used herein, global all-to-all traffic patterns are discussed. In a network implementing a global all-to-all traffic pattern, each network node can receive data packets from every other network node and transmit data packets to every other network node.
- Queuing structures, including turn and dimension queues, may route data packets through the network. In this regard, networks may use these queuing structures to direct data packets as the data packets traverse the network. The turn queue may be used to direct data packets as they turn from one dimension of the torus network to the next. For instance, the turn queue may be used to direct a data packet received by a node on a first dimension onto another dimension. Dimension queues may direct data packets continuing along a single dimension of the network and on a virtual channel. For instance, the dimension queue may direct a data packet from one node to another along the same dimension and on a common virtual channel, such as VC0 or VC1. The queuing structures may be part of the node or a component connected to the node. For instance, the queueing structures may be part of a router or other network interface integrated into a node.

FIG. 4 illustrates queuing structures withinnodes network 400. As shown, each node includes queuing structures. In this regard,node 401 includesturn queues dimension queue 421,node 403 includesturn queues dimension queue 423,node 405 includesturn queues dimension queue 425, andnode 407 includesturn queues dimension queue 427. Turnqueues - As further illustrated in
FIG. 4 , an example data packet is shown as entering, progressing through, and exiting thenetwork 400 byarrows arrow 441 illustrates the datapacket entering node 401 viaturn queue 441. The data packet is transmitted fromnode 401 todimension queue 423 innode 403, as illustrated byarrow 443. Fromnode 403, the data packet is transmitted todimension queue 425 ofnode 405, as illustrated byline 445. The data packet is then transmitted to turnqueue 417 innode 407, where it is subsequently transmitted out, as indicated byarrow 449. - The data packet in the example shown in
FIG. 4 makes three “hops.” A hop is a transmission from one node to another node. InFIG. 4 , the three hops are the transmission fromnode 401 tonode 403, fromnode 403 tonode 405, and fromnode 405 tonode 407. In instances where a data packet is limited to 0 or 1 hops along a network, the data packet would be limited to using turn queues. In this regard, the data packet would not use any dimension queues, as the data packet would be egres sing or ingressing dimensions of the torus ring network using turn queues. - Referring to
network 500 inFIG. 5 , the dimension queues in eachnode dimensions queues Dimension queues node dimension queue 543 todimension queue 545. Similarly, a data packet passing betweennode dimension queue 523 todimension queue 525. - For data packets traveling h≥2 hops, the data packets use h−1 dimension queue(s) along their routes. As all-to-all traffic is symmetric, the total usage of the dimension queues may be determined by summing over the routes that are at least two hops:
-
Total dimension queues=sum_{h>1}(h−1)*t(h) - where h is the number of hops and t(h) is the fraction of traffic that travels h hops along the dimension queues. The units of this sum are the average number of data packets that enter the dimension queues on a node when a single packet is injected at each node in the ring network.
- For all-to-all traffic in a torus ring network, with an even number of nodes k along its dimensions:
-
- To balance load between the two VCs dedicated to the dimension queues VC0 and VC1, the routing algorithm may have a threshold T defined. Any data packet with T or fewer hops remaining in its route, and not going to pass a dateline, may be placed into VC1. Otherwise, the data packet may use VC0.
-
FIG. 5 shows a 3-hop route ofdata packet 1, illustrated by arrows labeled DP1 overnetwork 500. In this regard,data packet 1 entersnode 501 into theturn queue 531.Data packet 1 is then transmitted tonode 503 by theturn queue 531 todimension queue 543 and onto VC0. From thedimension queue 543,data packet 1 is transmitted todimension queue 525 ofnode 505 and onto VC1. Fromdimension queue 525,data packet 1 is transmitted to turnqueue 517 ofNode 507, where it is subsequently taken off of thenetwork 500. -
FIG. 5 further shows a 2-hop route ofdata packet 2, illustrated by arrows labeled DP2, overnetwork 500. In this regard, data packet entersnetwork 500 vianode 505 intoturn queue 535. Fromturn queue 535data packet 2 is transmitted todimension queue 527 ofnode 507 and onto VC1. Fromdimension queue 527 the data packet is transmitted to turnqueue 529 ofnode 509, where it is subsequently taken off of thenetwork 500. - The routing of
data packet 1 anddata packet 2 is based on the routing algorithm ofnetwork 500 having a threshold of T=1. Thus,data packet 1 is initially routed onto VC0 innode 503, asdata packet 1 has 2-hops remaining. It is not untildata packet 1 reachednode 505, whendata packet 1 has 1-hop remaining, equaling the threshold value of 1, that it gets routed onto VC1. If the threshold value were 2-hops,data packet 1 would have been routed onto VC1 atnode 503. - With reference to the 2-hop route of
data packet 1, the data packet is immediately routed onto VC1, sincedata packet 2 has a 1-hop remaining, equaling the threshold value of 1 when it reachesnode 507. - As
network 500 is not shown to include a dateline, no consideration of a dateline is made in the routing of the data packets overnetwork 500. However, if a date line were present,data packets - To compute a threshold value that balances load between the dimensions VC0 and VC1, the total load on the dimension queues may be divided into the load contributed by data packets with h hops remaining, which is defined as:
-
r(h)=sum_{i>h}t(i). - Every packet that travels two or more hops, for example, will eventually have one hop remaining. Thus, the sum of the fraction of the traffic for each of these hops (i.e., r(1)=t(1)+t(2)+ . . . ) may be determined to find the utilization of the dimension queues contributed by packets with one hop remaining. Since every packet has some number of hops remaining, summing over r(h) recovers the total load as computed above:
-
total=sum_{h>0}r(h) - A T may then be selected to minimize the imbalance between the two VCs:
-
minimize|sum_{h>T}r(h)−sum_{0<h≤T}r(h)| - Example values of threshold T have been computed using the above equations for different sized rings in table 1, below:
-
TABLE 1 Ring Size (k) Threshold (T) 4 0 8 1 12 1 16 2 24 3 32 4 - Empirically, there is a linear relationship between ring size and the calculated threshold value (T). Thus, selecting a threshold value, where (T)=round(0.145−k−0.3) may yield a result for rings where k is a multiple of 4 and where the network includes up to 64 nodes.
- The concepts from the previous section can be extended to twisted tori with appropriate definitions for the t(h) function. Example values of threshold T for twisted tori networks have been computed using the equation for different size rings in table 2, below:
-
TABLE 2 Threshold (T) Ring Size (k) 2k × k × k 2k × 2k × k 4 1 1 8 1 2 12 2 3 16 3 3 24 4 5 32 5 7 - As with torus ring networks, there is a linear relationship between ring size and the calculated threshold value (T) for twisted tori networks. In this regard, a threshold value (T), for values of k≤64, may be determined using one of the following equations:
-
2k×k×k: threshold=round(0.175·k−0.15) (1) -
2k×2k×k: threshold=round(0.222·k−0.1) (2) - In some instances, datelines may be removed from a ring network routing algorithm. By removing datelines, improved throughput through the network may be achieved, in particular when direct memory access (DMA) size increases. Certain conditions may be met before datelines are removed. These conditions may include (1) the network includes eight or fewer nodes in the ring (this corresponds to k≤4 for twisted tori network); (2) VC usage is balanced using the balancing techniques described herein; and (3) when there are eight nodes in the ring (also applies to k=4 twisted tori), the nodes alternate between positive direction and negative direction tiebreaking for the routes that go exactly halfway around the ring.
- In networks having more than 8 nodes, networks where VC balancing is disabled, or networks where tiebreaking does not alternate, the acyclic dependencies of the VC are lost and VC0 to VC0 dependencies appear between all nodes, necessitating a dateline (or other approach) to break the VC0 cycle.
- In some embodiments, nodes may include queuing structures with input and output queues. In this regard, and unlike input or output queued architectures, such as described in
FIGS. 4 and 5 , a data packet at each hop travels through an input and an output queue. These pairs of queues may be split into their associated dimension. For instance, and as illustrated inFIG. 6 , within the combined input-output queuing architecture ofnetwork 600, the nodes may include a turn from a previous dimension, such as turns 631, 633, 635 ofnodes nodes structures nodes nodes structures - As further shown in
FIG. 6 , each queueing structure may be split into input queues, identified by “(i)” and output queues, identified by “(o)”. For instance,dimension queueing structure 621 includes VC1 (i), the input queue, and VC1 (o), the output queue. During the transmission of a data packet, the data packet passes through both an input queue and an output queue. For instance,data packet 1, labeled DP1 inFIG. 6 , passes through theturn 631 queueing structure, including through the input queue, labeled as T(i) and the output queue, labeled as T(o). - As also shown in
FIG. 6 , a transition between VCs occurs when a packet goes from an input queue to an output queue. In this regard, DP1 may pass from VC0 (i) (an input queue) to VC1(o) (an output queue) innode 603. VC1 (o) may subsequently pass DP1 to input queue VC1 (i) ofnode 605. Withinnode 605, the data packet may be passed to T(o). -
FIG. 7 illustrates a flow diagram 700 for routing data packets in a network. Inblock 702, a data packet is received at a first queueing structure within a first node of the ring network. The data packet is to be transmitted to a destination node on the network. Inblock 704, the first node determines a number of hops the data packet will traverse as it is transmitted from the first node to the destination node of the ring network. Inblock 706, the first node compares the number of hops to a threshold hop value to determine whether the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value. Inblock 708, the first node transmits the data packet to (i) a dimension queues structure for a first virtual channel within a second node of the ring network if the number of hops is greater than the threshold hop value; or (ii) a dimension queues structure for a second virtual channel or a turn queuing structure within the second node if the number of hops is equal to or less than the threshold hop value. - Although the foregoing examples illustrate ring networks, such as
ring networks - Unless otherwise stated, the foregoing alternative examples are not mutually exclusive, but may be implemented in various combinations to achieve unique advantages. As these and other variations and combinations of the features discussed above can be utilized without departing from the subject matter defined by the claims, the foregoing description of the embodiments should be taken by way of illustration rather than by way of limitation of the subject matter defined by the claims. In addition, the provision of the examples described herein, as well as clauses phrased as “such as,” “including,” and the like, should not be interpreted as limiting the subject matter of the claims to the specific examples; rather, the examples are intended to illustrate only one of many possible embodiments.
