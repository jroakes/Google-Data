- a website 208 is one or more resources 212 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 208 is maintained by a publisher 222 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 208 .
- a user device 206 can request resources 212 from a website 208 .
- data representing the resource 212 can be provided to the user device 206 for presentation by the user device 206 .
- the data representing the resource 212 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a webpage) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- the environment can include a search system 214 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 208 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in an indexed cache 216 .
- User devices 206 can submit search queries 220 to the search system 214 over the network 204 .
- the search system 214 accesses the indexed cache 216 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 220 .
- the search system 214 identifies the resources in the form of search results 218 and returns the search results 218 to the user devices 206 in search results pages.
- a search result 218 is data generated by the search system 214 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result 218 can include webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the URL of the webpage.
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- the advertisement system 102 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with the resource 212 , from a publisher 222 , or search results 218 .
- the request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the advertisement system 102 .
- the advertisement system 102 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”).
- eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 220 .
- advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 220 are selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement system 102 .
- advertisements associated with advertisement images with features matching images associated with a resource or webpage may be selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement system 102 .
- a targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 220 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 220 .
- an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “daisy” can be an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the resource keyword “daisy.”
- the advertisement can be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the search query “daisy.”
- a targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a search query 220 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword or search query 220 despite having different text than the targeting keyword.
- an advertisement having the targeting keyword “daisy” may also be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including a resource keyword or search query for “flowers” because daisy is a type of flower, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “flowers.”
- Search system 214 may provide functionality to users including image search functionality, audio search functionality, and video search functionality.
- a user may search for images by entering a search query 220 including one or more keywords. For example, the user may enter the search query “handbag” and be presented with a selection of one or more images of handbags or purses. Upon selecting an image, the image may then be associated with the search query term “handbag” as the text label for that image. The image may be provided as part of a publisher webpage. Accordingly, the advertisement system may use this text label to identify relevant advertisements in response to a request for advertisements.
- a user may search for audio content or video content by entering a search query 220 including one or more keywords.
- a search query 220 including one or more keywords.
- the user may enter the search query “sports car” and be presented with a selection of one or more videos of sports cars or race cars.
- the video may then be associated with the search query term “sports car” as the text label for that video.
- the video may be provided as part of a publisher webpage. Accordingly, the advertisement system may use this text label to identify relevant advertisements in response to a request for advertisements.
- the advertisement system 102 can select the eligible advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a resource based on results of an auction. For example, the advertisement system 102 can receive bids from advertisers and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction.
- the bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement with a resource or search results page.
- a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a “conversion” following selection of the advertisement.
- the highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from advertisement performance, landing page scores, and the like.
- a conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- advertisements may be computer display advertisements.
- An advertiser 210 may provide data associated with one or more advertisements, such as an advertiser name, text to be included in an advertisement, keywords, and other information.
- the advertisement system 202 may generate computer display advertisements based on the received data. For example, the advertisement system 202 may combine the received data into a creative for the advertisement, and generate a computer display advertisement responsive to the keywords specified by the advertiser.
- computer display advertisements may be provided by advertisers 210 .
- FIGS. 3-5 Examples of providing image advertisements based on the content of a resource are described with reference to FIGS. 3-5 . A system that can be used to implement these examples is then described with reference to FIG. 6 .

Abstract
Systems and methods for extracting audiovisual features from online document elements are described herein. A computing device can identify a first audiovisual content element on an online document and can retrieve a second audiovisual content element from a content provider database. The computing device can extract an image, video, or audio feature from the first and the second audiovisual content elements by applying image feature, video frame feature, or audio fingerprint detection. The computing device can determine a match between the features extracted from the first and the second audiovisual content elements. The computing device can select the second audiovisual content element for display on the online document based on the match. The computing device can transmit the second audiovisual content element for insertion in a content slot of the online document.
Description
This application is a continuation of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/295,507, titled “CONTENT-BASED ADVERTISEMENT QUALITY USING MULTIMEDIA ELEMENTS” and filed Nov. 14, 2011, the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference.
Electronic online documents can include content elements. These content elements can be defined for presentation with or within a webpage. Text content of the webpage can be used to identify relevant content. However, some text content may not be relevant to the topic of the webpage. Furthermore, some webpages may lack text content.
At least one aspect is directed to a system for extracting audiovisual features from online document elements. A recognition engine executed on a data processing system having one or more processors can identify a first audiovisual content element on an online document, the first audiovisual content element including image data. The recognition can retrieve a second audiovisual content element from a content provider database, the second audiovisual content element including image data.

These and other aspects and implementations are discussed in detail below. The foregoing information and the following detailed description include illustrative examples of various aspects and implementations, and provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed aspects and implementations. The drawings provide illustration and a further understanding of the various aspects and implementations, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.
Embodiments are described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers may indicate identical or functionally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is generally indicated by the left-most digit in the corresponding reference number.
Embodiments are described herein with reference to illustrations for particular applications. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments. Those skilled in the art with access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the embodiments would be of significant utility.
An advertisement or an “ad” may refer to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations, or other items are identified and promoted or otherwise communicated. Ads are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. An ad may be a public service announcement or any other type of notice, such as a broadcast or a public notice published in printed or electronic press. In some implementations, an ad may be referred to or included in sponsored content.
Ads (or promotional or digital content items generally) may be communicated via various mediums and in a number of forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of the foregoing formats, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads also may be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
The term “ad” can refer to both a single “creative” and an “ad group.” A creative can refer to any entity that represents one ad impression. An ad impression can refer to any form of presentation of an ad, such that the ad is viewable or receivable by a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. An ad group can refer, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same ad targeting criteria. Ad groups can be used to create an ad campaign. For convenience, advertisements and creatives are collectively referred to as “advertisements” herein.
Ads may be included on resources provided by publishers. For example, a publisher may specify one or more areas on a resource, such as a webpage, where advertising is to be displayed. A publisher may also provide a resource such as an application to user devices, and may allow advertisements to be displayed in the application. Relevant advertisements may be identified based on text content included on the resource. Some resources include more multimedia content, such as image content, audio content, or video content, than text content. The text content may not be related to the multimedia content. Thus, irrelevant advertisements may be provided. Further, certain resources include no text content. Embodiments identify relevant advertisements based on multimedia content included on a resource provided by a publisher.
The advertisement system 102 includes a recognition engine 104 Recognition engine 104 may recognize one or more features of image 111. In one embodiment, the images are sent with the request for advertisements to the advertisement system 102. In another embodiment, features associated with the images are sent to the advertisement system 102. Further, recognition engine 104 may identify features that match between recognized features in image 111 and features of images associated with one or more advertisements 106. For example, recognized features of image 111A may match features of advertisement image 107. Image features may include, for example and without limitation, edges, corner features, interest points, blobs or regions of interest, or ridge features. Based on matching features between image 111 and the images associated with advertisements 106, a relevant advertisement may be identified and provided to the publisher to be displayed on publisher webpage 110 in one of the ad slots 112A or 112B.
In FIG. 1B , a second user may request a second publisher resource, such as publisher webpage 160. Publisher webpage 160 includes one or more multimedia elements, such as video 161 and image 163, and may include text content. Publisher webpage 160 also includes one or more advertisement slots 162A and 162B. When a user requests the publisher webpage 160, a request for advertisements may be sent to an advertisement system 102, which accesses one or more advertisements 106. Each advertisement 106 may be associated with one or more advertisement keywords. For example, advertisement 106C is associated with advertisement keyword 109C. Further, each advertisement 106 may be associated with one or more text labels for an advertisement multimedia element associated with an advertisement. For example, advertisement 106D may be associated with image 107D, which is associated with a text label.
In one embodiment, the multimedia elements are sent with the request for advertisements to the advertisement system 102. In another embodiment, text labels associated with the multimedia elements are sent to the advertisement system 102. Recognition engine 104 may identify a text label associated with video 161. Text labels associated with images and multimedia elements may be, for example and without limitation, query terms input by a user, which resulted in the images or other multimedia elements being displayed to a user and selected by the user. Text labels may also include metadata associated with a multimedia element. Further, text labels or keywords associated with advertisements 106, or text labels associated with multimedia elements associated with advertisements 106 may be identified. For example, recognition engine 104 may identify keyword 109C as being responsive to a text label associated with video 161. For example, text label “daisy” can match keyword “daisy”, or be identified as responsive to keyword “flower”. Based on the identification of responsiveness, advertisement 106C may be identified as a relevant advertisement and provided to the publisher to be displayed on publisher webpage 160 in one of the ad slots 162A or 162B.
A website 208 is one or more resources 212 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 208 is maintained by a publisher 222, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 208.
A resource 212 is any data that can be provided over the network 204. A resource 212 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 212. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
A user device 206 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 204. Example user devices 206 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 204. A user device 206 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 204. User devices 206, such as mobile communication devices, may also include other user applications, such as text message applications, gaming applications, news applications, book and magazine reader applications, and other applications provided by publishers 222. Applications provided by publishers 222 may also be known as resources.
A user device 206 can request resources 212 from a website 208. In turn, data representing the resource 212 can be provided to the user device 206 for presentation by the user device 206. The data representing the resource 212 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a webpage) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment can include a search system 214 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 208. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in an indexed cache 216.
When a resource 212 provided by a publisher 222 or search results 218 are requested by a user device 206, the advertisement system 102 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with the resource 212, from a publisher 222, or search results 218. The request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the advertisement system 102.
For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the advertisement slot is defined, a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to the advertisement system 102. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 220 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the advertisement system 102 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the resource or search query 220. Further, images and multimedia elements that are associated with the resource may be provided to the advertisement system 102.
Based on data included in the request for advertisements, the advertisement system 102 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”). For example, eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 220. In some implementations, advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 220 are selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement system 102. As described with respect to embodiments, advertisements associated with advertisement images with features matching images associated with a resource or webpage may be selected as eligible advertisements by the advertisement system 102.
A targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 220 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 220. For example, an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “daisy” can be an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the resource keyword “daisy.” Similarly, the advertisement can be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including the search query “daisy.”
A targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a search query 220 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword or search query 220 despite having different text than the targeting keyword. For example, an advertisement having the targeting keyword “daisy” may also be selected as an eligible advertisement for an advertisement request including a resource keyword or search query for “flowers” because daisy is a type of flower, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “flowers.”
As described herein with reference to embodiments, the advertisement system can use features of multimedia elements provided in the request for advertisements from the publisher to identify relevant advertisements. The advertisement system may also use text labels associated with multimedia elements provided in the request for advertisements to identify relevant advertisements.
Similarly, a user may search for audio content or video content by entering a search query 220 including one or more keywords. For example, the user may enter the search query “sports car” and be presented with a selection of one or more videos of sports cars or race cars. Upon selecting a video, the video may then be associated with the search query term “sports car” as the text label for that video. The video may be provided as part of a publisher webpage. Accordingly, the advertisement system may use this text label to identify relevant advertisements in response to a request for advertisements.
The advertisement system 102 can select the eligible advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a resource based on results of an auction. For example, the advertisement system 102 can receive bids from advertisers and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a “conversion” following selection of the advertisement. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from advertisement performance, landing page scores, and the like.
Advertisers can also specify budgets for their advertisement campaigns. A budget is a specified amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for distribution of content over a specified budget period. The specified period can be, for example, a specified time (e.g., one day, one week, or one year), a specified number of events (e.g., a number of impressions or clicks), or some other delineation of time or events. Once the amount the advertiser is charged for distribution of content during the budget period matches or exceeds the budget amount, the campaign can be prevented from providing content for the remainder of the budget period unless the advertiser increases or overrides its specified budget.
A conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
In one embodiment, advertisements may be computer display advertisements. An advertiser 210 may provide data associated with one or more advertisements, such as an advertiser name, text to be included in an advertisement, keywords, and other information. The advertisement system 202 may generate computer display advertisements based on the received data. For example, the advertisement system 202 may combine the received data into a creative for the advertisement, and generate a computer display advertisement responsive to the keywords specified by the advertiser. In another embodiment, computer display advertisements may be provided by advertisers 210.
In embodiments, advertisement system 102 (and its recognition engine 104) may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof on one or more computing devices. For example, advertisement system 102 may be part of or may be implemented with a computing device, such as, a processor-based computing device. A computing device can be any type of device having one or more processors. For example, a computing device can be a workstation, mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, tablet or laptop), computer, server, compute cluster, server farm, game console, set-top box, kiosk, embedded system or other device having at least one processor and memory. Embodiments may be software executed by a processor, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof in a computing device.
Examples of providing image advertisements based on the content of a resource are described with reference to FIGS. 3-5 . A system that can be used to implement these examples is then described with reference to FIG. 6 .
In step 302, a request for advertisements for a publisher resource is received. The request for advertisements may be received in response to a user requesting a publisher webpage from the publisher, or requesting a resource from a publisher such as an application. The request for advertisements may include one or more multimedia elements displayed on the publisher resource, as well as keywords associated with the content of the publisher resource.
In step 304, one or more multimedia elements displayed on the resource are identified. Further, features of each of the one or more multimedia elements may be extracted. Multimedia elements may include, but are not limited to, images, audio data, video data, animation data, interactive elements of the resource, or other data that may be included on a publisher resource. Feature extraction is further described below.
In step 306, an advertisement associated with an advertisement multimedia element is identified. As described with reference to step 304, advertisement multimedia elements may include, but are not limited to, image, audio data, video data, animation data, interactive elements, or other data. The advertisement can be identified by matching features of the advertisement multimedia element with features of the one on more multimedia elements displayed on the resource. For example, if the multimedia element is an image, one or more edges, corner features, line features, interest points, blobs, regions of interest, or ridges in an image displayed on the publisher resource may match one or more of such features in an advertisement image. Based on this matching, the advertisement associated with the advertisement image may be identified.
In one embodiment, features may be extracted from the images displayed on the publisher's resource using a feature detection technique. Features may include, but are not limited to, edges, corner features, interest points, blobs or regions of interest, or ridges. Feature detection techniques may include, but are not limited to, canny edge detection, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), speeded up robust feature (SURF), and other known feature detection techniques. Further, in one embodiment, features may be extracted from advertisement images when an advertisement with an associated advertisement image is provided by an advertiser, such that the features can be matched in response to a request for advertisements.
In one embodiment, an advertisement may be identified if the number of features that match between an image on a publisher resource and an advertisement image meets a threshold. For example, an advertisement may be identified only if five or more features match between an advertisement image associated with the advertisement and an image on the publisher resource. Defining such a threshold may, increase the likelihood that the identified advertisement corresponds to the image content of the publisher resource.
In one embodiment, features of the multimedia elements displayed on the publisher's resource may include text label data. As described above, when a user performs a query for images, video, audio, or other content, the query terms that result in the multimedia element may be associated with the multimedia element after the user selects or clicks on the multimedia element. The query terms may become text label data associated with the multimedia element.
In one embodiment, features of audio data included on a publisher resource may be matched with features of audio data associated with an advertisement. For example, features of the audio data included on the publisher resource may be matched with features of audio data associated with an advertisement by using audio search technique. Such a technique may extract a feature, such as a unique fingerprint of the audio data included on the publisher resource, and compare the unique fingerprint to a fingerprint of audio data associated with an advertisement. If the unique fingerprint matches the fingerprint of audio data associated with an advertisement in part or in whole; the advertisement associated with the audio data may be identified.
In one embodiment, features of video data included on a publisher resource may be matched with features of video data associated with an advertisement. For example, features of video data included on the publisher resource may be extracted and matched with features of video data associated with an advertisement, using a video matching technique. Such a technique may extract individual still frames of each video and compare the still frames to determine whether a video on a publisher resource matches a video associated with an advertisement. If a threshold number of frames matches between the videos, the advertisement associated with the video may be identified. Similarly, image matching techniques as described herein may match individual flames of video data associated with an advertisement to images displayed on a publisher resource. If edges, corner features, or other features of the individual frames of video data associated with an advertisement match features in the image displayed on the publisher resource, the advertisement may be identified.
In one embodiment, the format of the advertisement multimedia element is the same as the format of the multimedia element displayed on the publisher resource. For example, an advertisement associated with a video as its advertisement multimedia element may be identified in response to a request for advertisements from a publisher resource displaying a video. In another embodiment, the format of the advertisement multimedia element is different than the format of the multimedia element displayed on the publisher resource. Thus, for example, an advertisement associated with an image of shoes as its advertisement multimedia element may be identified in response to a request for advertisements from a publisher resource displaying a video of sports players wearing the same or similar shoes. Such an advertisement may be identified using image matching techniques as described above.
In step 308, the advertisement is provided to the publisher associated with the publisher resource. The advertisement may be provided over a computer network to the publisher. The advertisement may then be displayed on the publisher resource along with the content of the publisher resource,
In step 402, a request for advertisements for a publisher resource is received. The request for advertisements may be received in response to a user requesting a publisher resource from the publisher, or requesting a resource from a publisher such as an application, and may include one or more multimedia elements displayed on the publisher resource or other content of the publisher resource.
In step 404, text label data associated with each of the one or more multimedia elements is identified. As described above, query terms associated with a multimedia element may be used as text label data for the multimedia element. Text label data may further be a label associated with the multimedia element which describes the multimedia element. For example, metadata or data associated with the image may be used as text label data. For example, the “alt” or “title” attribute of an HTML image tag may allow a publisher to specify text that is displayed instead of an image or along with an image. Text included in the “alt” attribute may be used to find relevant advertisements.
In step 406, an advertisement associated with a keyword responsive to the text label data is identified. The advertisement can be identified by matching text label data of the multimedia element displayed on the publisher resource to keywords of an advertisement. For example, the advertisement may be associated with a keyword that exactly matches the text label data. Additionally, the advertisement may be associated with a keyword related to the text label data.
In step 408, the advertisement is provided to a publisher associated with the publisher resource. The advertisement may then be displayed on the publisher resource along with the content of the publisher resource.
In one embodiment, the publisher associated with the publisher resource is compensated for displaying the advertisement. For example, the publisher associated with the publisher resource may be compensated an amount corresponding to the bid amount of the provided advertisement.
According to an embodiment, steps 302, 304, 306, and 308 may be performed by the recognition engine 104. Further, steps 402, 404, 406 and 408 may be performed by the recognition engine 104.
In box 504, a user device requests a resource, such as a webpage. A publisher 222 may receive the request in box 506 and in response may transmit a request for advertisements to advertisement system 102 in box 508. The request may include multimedia elements displayed on the publisher webpage. In box 510, the advertisement system 102 receives the request for advertisements, and in box 512, the advertisement system 102 identifies features of multimedia elements displayed on the publisher webpage, as described herein.
In box 514, the advertisement 102 may match identified features to features of advertisement multimedia elements received in box 502. Based on matching features, in box 516, a computer display advertisement may be identified by advertisement system 102. The advertisement system 102 may then transmit the computer display advertisement to publisher 222 in box 518.
In box 520, the publisher may receive the computer display advertisement, which may then be displayed on the requested webpage in box 522 for presentation to the user device.
