The face of the people of description and theme part can be the facial parts of received image.System determine facial parts be used as to
The replacement of insertion is come a possibility that replacing the one or more in time received future image afterwards to correspond to facial parts.Such as
A possibility that fruit determines is greater than predetermined threshold, then the facial parts are stored in image buffer storage by system.The image buffer storage is available
It can be used to replace by the high quality facial parts of the corresponding face in the received future image of system in searched.These and its
His feature can allow for the part (such as facial) of image to be obtained from any one of various other images and source
The higher quality version of those parts (face of such as same people) is replaced, and largely handles time or memory without requiring.
In some exemplary implementations, system can will act as the replacement being inserted into based on facial parts to replace afterwards
A possibility that lower quality facial parts in time received image, caches facial parts (or other image subject parts).
In each example, in order to determine the possibility, the system can check social data related with user and determination with
The social connections of the user of the people described in facial parts, and/or can check the previously stored image in the set of user
And determine the appearance of the people described in facial parts frequency and/or appearance it is recency.A possibility that as replacement
It being capable of these factors based on one or more.In addition, system can have the facial parts of at least minimum quality, dimension by caching
Protect the image buffer storage of high quality face, and if caching be it is full, can be cached with the covering of the new facial parts of better quality
In old facial parts.The facial parts for caching can be obtained from each provenance for including server and client side's equipment.
Some features can allow for the more desirable higher-quality corresponding face obtained from other images or other themes
Replace the less desired face and other themes of image.For example, the undesirable face in photo can be with from more early photo
Same people higher quality face replacement.Image buffer storage described herein can effectively store theme (such as facial) most
It is expected that being used as the replacement of future image with best quality image section, and storage lower quality image section is not needed.Figure
As caching can include being thus not restricted to replacement (such as one in short time frame from the largely not homologous image with time frame
The continuous shooting function of a little cameras) in the image that captures.Thereby, it is possible to obtain a large amount of high quality replacement faces or other themes.In addition,
Effectively tissue caching needs to be stored in most probable in the following photo captured by the equipment as the higher quality figure replaced
As part, the waste in the buffer by image section inappropriate or being rarely employed storage is thus reduced.In addition, image buffer storage is non-
Often it is suitble to the equipment for such as capturing image, such as portable client device, because can be in the smaller storage sky of those equipment
Between middle realization image buffer storage.The feature, which allows to cache execution image section on the client device with limited client-side, to be replaced
It changes, instead of sending images to server to handle, this is prioritized quick execution image procossing for portable client device
The battery life of operation and the such portable device of protection is critically important.Therefore, image as disclosed herein is edited automatically
Technical effect includes reducing the user manual editing of image, therefore saves on user time for obtaining higher quality image, energy
Source and resource.Another technical effect is that by being obtained with from largely each provenances and being estimated quality higher quality partial replacement image
Lower quality part generate higher quality image.Another technical effect is that reduction maintenance and use are very suitable for replacement figure
System resource needed for the caching of the image section of the corresponding lower quality part of picture.

Some or all.In the example, realization system include one or more processors or processing circuit and one or
Multiple storage equipment, such as database 106, client storage or other storages.In some implementations, one or more servers
And/or the different components of client are able to carry out the different masses or other parts of method 200.Method 200 can be by passing through one
Or multiple processors (such as microprocessor or other processing circuits) execute and can be stored in computer program product (including
Computer-readable medium, such as magnetic, optical, electromagnetic or semiconductor storage medium, including semiconductor or solid-state memory, tape, can
Mobile computer hard disk, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, hard disc, CD, solid-state storage
Device etc.) on software, program instruction or code realize.Program instruction can also be included in electric signal and be provided as telecommunications
Number, such as the software i.e. form of service (Saas) to be delivered from server (such as distributed system and/or cloud computing system).
As an alternative, these methods can be realized in hardware (logic gate etc.) or in the combination of hardware and software.It can be by method
200 execute a part or component of the application to run in system, or execute as collaboration other application and operating system
Application or software.
It in some implementations, can be by equipment or system automatically initiating method 200.It in some implementations, can be by side
Method 200 is embodied as the image of processing capture, image, the received image of storage etc..In other examples, it can regularly hold
Row or based on such as newly upload or by equipment access one or more original images particular event or at one of equipment or
The condition specified in the customized preferences of multiple users executes method 200.In a non-restrictive example, camera, cellular phone
Or other portable client devices are able to carry out method 200.Furthermore or as an alternative, client device can will be caught on network
The image caught is sent to server and server is able to use method 200 to handle image.Some realizations can be based on user
Input carrys out initiating method 200.For example, user can be from interface, such as social network interface, Application Program Interface or other interfaces
The initiation of selection method 200 (or any piece of method 200).
In the block 202 of method 200, this method may have access to the theme part of the image in image and by theme by detecting
Part storage comes to sow son to image buffer storage in the buffer.Image (and its part) can be by being for example made of multiple pixels
Digital image, and can be from one or more storage device access of system or can (storage such as connected is set by system
The storage equipment connected in standby or system, such as local memory device or network) access.It in various implementations, can be by the party
Method, which is automatically carried out, caches sowing to face, such as when system or equipment initializes or becomes able to processing in this, all
Such as when installing and/or activating application software.As an alternative, the user of the equipment of perfoming block 202 can select to initiate block 202.
In some implementations, image buffer storage is in the limited amount system of its image section that can be stored and described herein
Feature can be determined whether based on each feature of image should by image section store in the buffer.Hereinafter, will
With reference to Fig. 3, the exemplary details of block 202 are more fully described.
" the theme part " of image as quoted in this article is the part for describing the image of theme of image.Described herein
Several examples in, theme be the people described in the picture face and theme part be image facial parts.Equally
Ground, in these examples, image buffer storage are the face cachings of the facial parts of the image for the face that people is described in storage.In other realities
In existing, theme and theme part can be other kinds of themes, and are able to detect other kinds of theme part and deposit
Storage is in image buffer storage.For example, such as theme of terrestrial reference, monument or other Landscape Characteristics can be detected in the picture and incited somebody to action
It is stored in image buffer storage.In another example, theme can be cognizable object, the spy of the full figure of such as people, vehicle
Determine brand and model, animal, equipment, structure, landscape object or sundry item.
In block 204, it is new to be replaced with the theme part of caching corresponding with part is replaced that method handles new images
New theme part in image, and/or new portion is stored in image buffer storage.For example, method can determine in new images
Facial parts quality is low, therefore, searches the facial parts of better quality and the face insertion (instead of) by caching in the buffer
The new facial "upper" of new images.This method also checks whether that new portion should be stored in image buffer storage.Hereinafter, it refers to
Fig. 6, some exemplary realizations of description block 204.
Some realizations of method 200 are very suitable for being used in client device, are such as operable as capturing the portable of image
On formula client device.In some implementations, memory space, thus the image buffer storage in such equipment in terms of memory capacity
It is restricted, therefore, cache feature as described herein can be benefited from.In one example, client device creates image buffer storage,
Such as face caching (is not captured by the client device such as to make expectation, related, high quality face get out replacement photo
With storage those of photo) in low quality face.In other implementations, one or more features as described herein can be used in
Other equipment, on such as non-portable client device and server.
Fig. 3 is the stream of illustrative methods 300 of the diagram for as above generating image buffer storage described in the block of Fig. 2 202
Cheng Tu.For illustrative purposes, in the example and in subsequent example method, theme image section is the people described in image
Face facial parts and image buffer storage be described as facial caching.As indicated by the other places this paper, by method 300,
It is able to use other kinds of image subject.
In block 302, method detects the face that be stored in face caching to the various source inspections image to be checked.This
A little sources can include local and remote storage.Hereinafter, reference Fig. 4 is described this method can be to the source of its check image
Some examples.In other implementations, method 300 can be received from the source of connection, such as operation method 300 and network or its
The image pushed on his communication link from the client device that server receives one or more images.
In block 304, method checks whether the image for finding and checking so as to caching.If do not found, method returns to block
302 check again for image.If finding image, in block 306, whether method check image describes one or more faces.
For example, being able to use very well known face detection technique and/or facial recognition techniques to determine whether to depict in the picture
Any face.If method returns to block 302 without face.
If there is the face that one or more is described, in block 308, this method selects a face in image.In block
310, this method determines the metadata of (such as extract or generate) for the selected facial parts of image.Metadata can retouch
State the various features of selected face.For example, the position of the face in image can be extracted or be otherwise determined that as coordinate base
It is quasi-.Other metadata can include light attribute (such as brightness, contrast etc.), the acutance, exposure, face of facial image portion
Color characteristic (such as colour temperature, white balance, colour cast etc.), pixel resolution and facial geometry.Facial geometry can indicate
The visual angle of face or orientation (posture), such as angle of the face relative to positive front view, thereby indicate that face just sees elevational views
Either side amount.Metadata can include face attribute, and whether such as face smiles, closes one's eyes or open eyes, mouth closure is gone back
It is opening or other faces subordinate's property.In some implementations, facial attribute can indicate the degree of attribute, such as from knitting one's brows in
Property is to the smile for attribute of smiling.Metadata can also include be the fingerprint for belonging to particular person by face recognition, wherein can
Using fingerprint according to the identity of people come tissue and index face.In some implementations, fingerprint can be the people for belonging to the face
The identity actually identified, real name, user name, e-mail address etc., such as from database or such as, social networks is taken
The service determination of business.In other implementations, fingerprint does not need any actual identity of reference the people, and simply by the people
Face distinguished with other people face, for example, unique face structure generation based on face.In other implementations, block 310
It is omitted from method 300, or is executed in the different phase of method 300 or 200.For example, can be caching face in the latter half
It extracts or generates metadata, such as constantly when checking or comparing caching face to replace in method 600 of figure 6.
In some cases or realization, from being for example previously created or determine and member is written by other processes or equipment
The metadata fields (or other associated storages) of image in data field extract the metadata determined in block 310.In other realities
In existing, method 300 (such as block 310) can analyze selected face and/or its image and determine metadata.For example, institute
The face of selection can be provided with reference picture dimension in the coordinate position at its appropriate center.By the pixel characteristic for checking pixel
With the facial characteristics of the identification of selected face and image, pixel and character metadata, such as light category can determine
Property (brightness, contrast etc.), acutance, resolution ratio etc..It is able to use feature (such as nose, mouth, the eye that can identify face
Eyeball, forehead etc.) facial feature detection method determine facial geometry and facial attribute, and determine facial orientation and face
The degree of subordinate's property (smile, frown) and such facial attribute.It can be based on the face checked in accessible database
Identity, such as compare with the known image of the user of obtainable identification in social networking service or other network services
Relatively come the name for determining the people, Fingerprint Identity can determine.In some implementations, fingerprint can not know the identity of the people
In the case of be generated as unique identifier, such as the combination based on the unique facial characteristics of particular person, such as facial characteristics are (such as
Eyes, nose and mouth) the distance between and their positions relative to the edge of face, eyes, nose and mouth it is big
Small and eyes and the color of skin etc..
In block 312, this method is based on side portion to be used to replace in new, the following image of time check later
It is corresponding face a possibility that, determine be used for selected face total score.For example, total score can be to the instruction possibility
Property the summation of individual score value that determines of the multiple signals of difference and/or feature.Hereinafter, Fig. 5 will be referred to, describes to determine individual
Some examples of score value and total score.
Corresponding face can be the face with same personal part, for example, the face of same people.Corresponding face
Due to the angle of picture catching, the condition of picture catching, camera properties it is enough etc. may in different images it is visually different.Other
The theme part (object such as described) of type can be corresponding based on their identity, if the object described visually has been seen
Come be it is unique, for example, famous monument correspond to different pictures in that monument.Some objects can be based on type
Rather than it is corresponding by particular instance, for example, the different objects with appearance similar to each other still are able to correspond to.For example, describing the
The image subject part of one apple, which can correspond to describe, seem similar with the first apple (such as identical approximate size, face
Color, texture etc.) difference, the second apple different themes part.
As used herein, " future image " or " new images " is that the image checked by the block 204 of Fig. 2 is determined those
Whether the image section of image should be replaced by the one or more image sections stored in image buffer storage.For example, in method
In 300, which can be occurred later having evaluated the face currently selected with being inserted into image buffer storage, thus ginseng as follows
It examines described in Fig. 6, currently selected face is allowed to be suitable as the replacement for the image section in future image.
In block 314, this method examines whether the total score from block 312 is higher than predetermined threshold.The threshold value is used to refer to institute
Whether the face of selection is qualified to be stored in face caching.As a result, if total score is not higher than the threshold value, this method retaining surface
Current image portion in portion's caching, without storing selected face wherein, and proceeds to block 324 and comes as described below
Other faces for whether having inspection in the picture checked.In some implementations, the threshold value used in a block 314 can be in method
300 different phase changes.For example, can reduce threshold value to during caching sowing to allow image section to be easier to deposit
It stores up in the buffer, and when examining the new images for storing in the buffer (such as in the block of Fig. 6 606 and 624), Neng Gouti
High threshold.
If total score is higher than threshold value, selected face is qualified to be stored in during face caches, and in block 316,
This method checks whether face caching has expired.If it is not, then have the space for selected face in the buffer, and
Block 318, this method is by selected face and its metadata storage in the buffer and according to the fingerprint for the people for belonging to the face
Or other identity index the face.In some implementations, whole image is stored in face caching, including selected face
Portion part.In other implementations, only the facial parts of image corresponding with selected face are stored in face caching.
In other implementations, the facial parts of mouth, eyes, nose etc. can be stored in the buffer.Some realizations can be another
It outside or as an alternative will be to facial image portion or the reference of the image including facial parts (such as is directed toward the institute of storage facial parts
The server of connection and/or the pointer of other storages on client device) storage is in the buffer.Then, method proceeds to block
324, wherein whether this method inspection has another face that check with caching in the picture, as described below.
In some implementations, can based on facial characteristics by buffer organization at different buckets (bucket).For example, can be with
Front view face is grouped in the bucket of themselves, the face on 0 to 30 ° of the left side towards center is grouped in one barrel, and
By towards the face on 0 to 30 ° of the right at center be grouped in one barrel it is medium.In such an implementation, the face of selection is stored in slow
In the appropriate bucket deposited.Some specific facial directions of realizations meeting preference, for example, the bucket for front view face can be much larger than all
Angled or lateral plan bucket, because front view face is more reliable higher-quality replacement.
If block 316 caching be it is full, method proceeds to block 320, wherein check selection face whether than previous
The one or more face being stored in caching is more qualified to be stored in the buffer.In order to whether more determine selected face
It is qualified, can it is selected face and caching in face between check and more various characteristics of image.For example, can compare
More facial quality.Qualitative character can include pixel resolution, wherein high-resolution indicates better quality.Quality can also
Enough light or brightness (such as shade instruction lower quality) by such as compared with one or more threshold values, not can recognize face,
Height distortion or fuzziness (such as higher than threshold value), undesirable perceptual property (such as frown, close one's eyes), geometric direction (such as
Front face viewing quality is higher than side view) etc. feature indicate quality.
If it find that selected face is more qualified than the face of one or more caching, then in block 322, this method will
Selected face storage in the buffer, covers previously stored face, and according to its fingerprint or other identity come indexed facet
Portion.Capped previously stored face can be the minimum quality face in caching.There are different facial characteristics in the buffer
Bucket realization in, selected face can cover the minimum quality in the bucket of selected face face.Then, this method
It proceeds to block 324 and whether to have in check image other to be checked face, as described below.
In some implementations, when determining which caching face is compared with selected face and may be capped
When, use the caching face for the same people for belonging to selected face.For example, first will be selected facial slow with same people
Face is deposited to be compared.It, can will be selected if the not no lazy weight of the caching face of the caching face or that people of the people
The face selected is compared with the caching face of other people (for example, the people with a large amount of faces stored in the buffer).At it
During he realizes, selected face can be compared with all faces in face caching.
Whether there is another face that check with caching in block 324, this method check image.If so, then method is returned
Block 308 is returned to select the difference face for processing.If to be processed without more faces in the picture in block 324,
Block 326, this method inspection caching in whether there are enough faces effectively to operate so that caching.The quantity of face enough can
It is predetermined value or range, such as based on test.By in some realizations of the buffer organization at bucket, each bucket can be required to have most
A small amount of face meets block 326.If in the buffer without face enough, this method is searched more back to block 302
Image.If having enough faces in caching, this method terminates.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart of the illustrative methods 400 for the block 302 that diagram realizes Fig. 3, wherein to be to various source inspections
The image that face is checked to cache.In this example, image procossing as described herein can occur in the client by user's operation
In end equipment.For example, portable phone, camera, tablet computer, vehicle computer, wearable device or other portable visitors
Family end equipment can cache sowing to face and search image to handle.It in other implementations, can be all in other equipment
On such as server apparatus, desktop computer, method 400 or similar method are executed.Can in any order and/or part or
All simultaneously execute the block of method 400.
In some implementations, this method can check all images in the storage of each of each source place.At other
In realization, this method can based on the various features of image, such as size, distribution of color, timestamp or other metadata and/
Or based on the content for identifying and identifying described in the picture, such as people, face or object, check the son of the image of storage
Collection.In some implementations, user is capable of providing or specifies the one or more features of examined image, and/or can refer to
Surely the image source to be checked.
In the user images that block 402, this method inspection store on a client device.It can be in the image collection of user
These images are provided and are stored it in one or more storage equipment of client, such as are grouped, such as photograph album.If
Such as the inspection of block 404, this method finds image to be checked, then method 400 terminates and method 300 continues, as shown in Figure 3.
If this method does not find image, in block 406, this method checks that the caching of user and one or more remotely connect
Other images on the server connect.For example, the face caching for the user can save on the server, such as Web clothes
Account on business, social networking service, home server or other servers.In some implementations, which caches
The face caching that can be greater than on client device, thereby, it is possible to store great amount of images.In some implementations, client device
The caching of the user on server can regularly be checked to update the face caching on client device, for example, for such as existing
In Fig. 3, sowing is cached to face, and/or replace or check using new or update the face from server buffer
The face of client's end face portion caching.(as an alternative, or in addition, server can regularly send images to client sets
It is standby).In block 406, this method can also check storage on the server and other images collected by user.If such as block
It is checked in 408, this method finds image to be checked, then method 400 terminates and method 300 continues, as shown in Figure 3.
In some implementations, individually the image buffer storage based on server can store their own theme part collection
It closes, it is such as facial, and can ratio is for example client-based is cached with bigger memory capacity.Phase is cached with client device
Than such server buffer can be buffered in relation to which image section has less stringent standard.In some implementations,
Client's end face portion caching can be the best quality subset of server face caching.For example, server is able to use a standard
Set will be stored in its face caching to assess which face, and based on tightened up standard set (for example, using this paper institute
The feature stated) come determine its caching face the subset as best quality.Server can send visitor for the face subset
Family end equipment is also stored by client device or client device can request facial subset from server.Can regularly,
When each server obtains new images, and/or when correlated condition changes, when the social connections of such as user change, executing should
It determines and communicates.
If this method does not find image, in block 410, this method checks other users caching and one or more services
Image on device.For example, can permit user access other users account or server on store data acquisition system (for example,
Pass through the license from those other users), and can check those set.In some implementations, these other users are very
It may be with the user social contact close relation, it is thus possible to have the user known or is connected to many images of the people of the user,
It thus is potentially relevant face.If as block 412 examine, this method finds image to be checked, then method 400 terminate and
Method 300 continues, as shown in Figure 3.
In block 414, this method can check that the client of the other users in the range of client device of user is set
It is standby.For example, run in the equipment of user and realize feature as described herein application program can at other
The same or like interapplication communications run in the equipment of user, such as via wirelessly or non-wirelessly connecting, and be directly connected to
Or network connection.If other users allow, the client device of user can be checked to be set in the client of those other users
The face caching and image collection of standby upper storage and retrieve interested image.For example, two clients in range each other
End equipment can share facial cache image each other, if appropriate.In some cases, two visitors of face caching are shared
Family end equipment can all be possessed by the user, for example, user equipment is transmitted to data cached by the new of user's acquisition earlier
Equipment.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart of the illustrative methods 500 for the block 312 that diagram realizes Fig. 3, wherein is based on selected face
Portion is used to replace a possibility that corresponding face in the future image checked by the method 600 of Fig. 6, determines and divides for the face
Value.For example, the caching face on client device can include being determined in the realization executed on portable client device
To be more likely to for replacing those of the face in the following photo captured by that client device face.Therefore, this method
It can suitably predict in the image for the image collection who is more likely to appear in user (for example, not set by the client
The standby picture for capturing them), therefore, it is easier to cache the face of those people or be prioritized the caching of the face of those people.One
In a little realizations, future image can also be in image buffer storage in method 600 of figure 6 and will be examined for use in face replacement
The image of any other storage.
In block 502, this method evaluates the matter of selected face based on the image of selected face and facial characteristics
Amount, and score value is determined based on the quality.The image of better quality is more likely to be used as the replacement for future image.It can make
The quality of face is measured with various features.For example, characteristics of image and predetermined threshold or scale can be compared to determine
Score value.In some implementations, one or more characteristics of image can be metadata, or can be from the metadata determined in block 310
It obtains, as described above.In some implementations, in the block 502 of method 500, some features be can determine.For example, characteristics of image
It can include light (dark face belongs to lower quality), saturation degree (for example, extremely high or low saturation degree belongs to compared with low-quality
Amount), clarity or fuzziness, pixel resolution (for example, low resolution is lower quality), the size relative to picture frame
The size (for example, face is bigger with image ratio, then quality is higher) of selected face and other similar characteristic.It cannot
The face for easily identifying or identifying can be considered lower quality.It can also be determined based on the facial expression of selected face
Quality, wherein the expression such as frowned and closed one's eyes is lower quality, and smile and eye opening belong to better quality.It can be to these
Some or all of different characteristic assigns individual score value, is summed to obtain quality score.
In block 504, this method estimation belongs to the social connections of people (" relevant people ") and user of selected face, and
Determine score value.It can such as be related to social connections and message from social data, store or taking on user client device
The social networking service of the contacts list stored in the associated account of user on business device or user group, the society of other services
Intersection graph and user list, the user group of other users and contacts list show depositing for communication between user and other users
The historical communication data and call log of storage and one or more sources in other similar social data determine social connection
System." sociodistance " between associated people and user it is smaller (for example, the social connections of associated people and user it is stronger or
It is closer), the score value for selected face is bigger.For example, being indicated by connection, message and other social datas checked
, with the closer people of the user social contact photo for being more likely to make to describe them is stored not carrying out the equipment by the user, because
This should be more likely to cache theirs compared with the user is without the people of social connections (sociodistance is bigger) in face caching
Face.In some implementations, in order to search related social connections, this method can be for example using face recognition skill as described above
Art determines the true identity of the people of selected face.This method is determined social based on the social connections feature of the determination
It is score value.
In block 506, this method assesses the history dependence of people associated with selected face and determines score value.It goes through
History correlation can be based on the photo and image for storing and/or storing in the equipment of user in user's set be checked, with true
Whom is determined most likely to be collected by user or by the theme in the future image of systems inspection.The different characteristic energy of first image
It is enough to be examined and history relevance score is searched to their individual score value summation.In some implementations, history dependence can
The time of the appearance of associated people in image based on user, wherein closer appearance indicates that people is more likely to appear in
In future image.For example, this method can check the image stored in the set of user metadata timestamp (including when
Between, date etc.) determine when image is captured by user and/or be stored in his or her equipment.If in nearest image
Describe associated with selected face people, then by that people be considered it is more relevant and it is more likely that future image theme,
And selected face receives more high score.On the contrary, if only describe in more early image a people (such as 1 year or other when
Between capture before section (such as user specify period) or storage), then that people be unlikely to be future image theme and
Selected face receives lower score value.In some instances, the size of the score value can be related with time quantum.
Another history correlated characteristic that this method can check is the frequency in the image for the storage that the people appears in user.
In general, people appears in, the number in the image of user is higher, and the people is more likely to appear in is collected by user or is examined later by system
In the future image looked into.For example, if only one or two associated people of image description in the set of user, then it is false
Being scheduled in future image is less likely to describe them, and correspondingly, their face is more had few opportunities buffered.This method is based on this
One or more of (prior images) feature determines history dependence score value a bit.
In block 508, this method determines total score, can be the summation of the individual score value determined in block 502-506.?
In some realizations, individual score value can be differently weighted, thus allows in determining total score special characteristic more to account for leading.It is some
Realization can allow for user to individual score value or the desired weighting scheme of feature selecting.
In some realizations of method 300 and 500, some pieces can be changed or eliminated.For example, block 312 can be based on such as
The quality of facial parts in block 502 determines total score, and omits block 506 and 508.In one example, method 300
Block can estimate that the face of detection and at least part of metadata determine the quality of detected face, and respond
It is higher than predetermined threshold in quality, the face that can be will test or its reference are stored in face caching.In other implementations, equally
Block 502 can be omitted.
Fig. 6 is the flow chart for illustrating the illustrative methods 600 of the block 204 for realizing Fig. 2, wherein new images are processed
To use the theme part of caching partial replacement new images, and the part of new images can be stored in image buffer storage.?
In the example, image subject part is the face of the people described in the picture.As previously indicated, it can be made by method 600
With the other kinds of theme in image section.
In block 602, this method obtains (such as search, retrieve or receive) new images.It is new to scheme from the viewpoint of method 300
As that can be " future image ".For example, it is logical that new images can be user if realizing this method on portable client device
Cross the result that client device captures photo.In other situations, at the equipment for executing method 300, in communication channel and/or
New images are received on network.In some cases, which can be found that in the another of such as server or other client devices
Image and user or equipment at one source determine retrieval image.In some cases, new images can be retrieved as such as literary
A part of other data of shelves, Email or text message etc..
In block 604, this method checks whether new images will become a part of the image collection of user.For example, by user
The image that the picture of capture or user's selection download to the equipment, which can be considered user's expectation, becomes the one of his or her set
Partial image.By the way or a part of received image as other data may be not desired by a user the set for becoming user
A part can be from for that may be omitted in the processing of replacement face as a result, according to current method.In some implementations, such as
Fruit new images in relation to its state be it is fuzzy, then can prompt whether user should become the one of set of user in relation to the image
Part.Other conditions can also be defined by user or system omit new images from the processing of method 600, for example, describing
Specific subject, the image from particular source etc..If a part that the image does not become the set of user (or is not located
Reason), then this method does not handle face replacement the image and proceeds to block 606.In block 606, this method checks whether will be new
Face in image is cached in face caching.For example, this method can the block 306 of Fig. 3 start with check face and
Image is handled in method 300.This facial parts for allowing not to be used for the image of the processing of possible face replacement potentially makes height
Quality face partial contribution is cached in face.Then, this method returns to block 602.
If image is in the set of user (or qualified) to be stored, it can be processed for face and replace
It changes.In block 608, this method checks new images and checks whether new images describe one or more faces.As referred to Fig. 3 institute
It states, is able to use face detection or facial recognition techniques.If new images are searched without face, this method back to block 602
Or receive another image.If new images describe one or more faces, in block 610, this method selects the face in new images.
In block 612, this method extracts the metadata for being used for selected face, similar as described in the method 300 of Fig. 3.
In block 614, this method checks whether selected face is lower than threshold quality.It is one or more special by checking
Sign, light, saturation degree, distortion, identifiability, resolution ratio etc. can measure the quality of selected face, with above-mentioned matter
Measurement is similar.If selected face is greater than predetermined threshold quality, enough high quality are considered as, are not needed by coming from
The face replacement of face caching.Since selected face has high quality (such as higher than threshold quality), this method is proceeded to
Block 624 should cache selected face in face caching to check whether.For example, this method can proceed to the block of Fig. 3
312 come determine whether to cache it is selected face and execute method 300.After block 624, this method can be then proceeded to
Whether check to block 630 has another face to be checked in new images.If so, this method is selected back to block 610
Another face.If it is not, this method returns to block 602.In alternative realization, block 614 can be omitted and always checked slow
It deposits, as described below.
If selected face is lower than predetermined threshold quality, it is regarded as being potentially suitable for by from face caching
Face replacement.This method proceeds to block 616, wherein is compared selected face with the caching face of same people.?
, can be by the identity or fingerprint of inspection (or acquirement) selected face in some realizations, and have being directed toward with all over the body
Part all cachings face, such as same people all cachings face caching index in find same identity or fingerprint,
The caching face compared can be found.In block 618, this method creation has the caching face with selected facial like attribute
Candidate list.For example, this method can search the caching face with light similar with selected face and geometrical orientation.
This can allow for particular cache face to be easier and easily replace selected face, because they have similar feature.
In block 620, candidate face is compared to each other and determines the best face for being used for replacing in candidate face by this method.
Various technologies are able to use, executes and one in candidate face is selected as best face.For example, this method can check candidate
Several different characteristics of face and the score value that each candidate is determined for each feature.The weighting of some features can be higher than
Other features, thus more strongly impact fraction.In some instances, can check surface subordinate's property, such as smile still not micro-
It laughs at (such as neutral or frown) scale, open eyes to eye closing scale etc., wherein for each of these scales, one extreme
Situation (such as smile and open eyes) be scored it is higher, and another extreme case (such as frown and close one's eyes) be scored it is lower.One
It is a little to realize, user preference can indicate which facial attribute score value is higher and which facial attribute score value it is lower (for example,
Beard wears glasses to not wearing glasses to no beard).
Can also the similitude based on special characteristic Yu selected face, to each candidate face score.Such as, it is desirable that
Fewer transformation is commented to become the similar candidate face with selected facial (and/or image district of selected facial surroundings)
Divide higher.In some instances, geometrical orientation (such as face angle) closer candidate face can score higher, Neng Gouzuo
For the candidate face with similar light characteristics, color characteristic etc..
In block 622, whether the best face that this method inspection is found in candidate list is better than selected face.Example
Such as, the quality of each of these faces can be estimated as score value, it is similar to the above, and the quality score of best face
Check whether it is higher than the quality score of selected face.If it is not, then this method do not replace it is selected face and
Proceed to block 624, herein for example by proceeding to the block 312 of Fig. 3, check whether should be cached in face caching it is selected
Face.Then, this method returns to block 602.In some implementations, omit block 622 and block 620 by it is selected face with
All candidate faces are compared.
If best face is better than selected face, selected face is replaced.In block 626, this method transformation
Best face is to be suitble to new images.For example, selected face can be matched using color and gamma correction on best face
Portion.It can reduce that blood-shot eye illness, skin are smooth or other are fuzzy etc. to match on best face using face polishing filter
Selected face.Some realizations can change the angle of best face later to be suitble to the angle of selected face.For example,
Rotation or the best face of deformation can be determined how using three-dimensional or two-dimensional transform to match selected face.
In block 628, by the best facial suture of transformation or " merging " (insertion) into new images, instead of selected face
Portion.It is able to use any one of various technologies.For example, some realizations can be by the face of best face and the new face being replaced
Facial marker feature or point (center of eyes, the center of nose, the endpoint of eyebrow, mouth endpoint etc.) matching are to suitably align most
Good face and image.Can by the edge of best face with it is selected around image part mix or it is smooth together with come
Any discontinuous or seam between the best face of removal and surrounding image pixel.The synthesis of gray scale domain can will be from the thin of image
Section and texture are moved to best face, and best face can be made extremely to match with the color of image and light.Then, the party
Method proceeds to block 624, here, this method, which is checked whether, caches selected face in face caching, for example, with the block of Fig. 3
312 start.Then, this method proceeds to block 630 to check whether there is another face in new images.If it is, this method is returned
Block 610 is returned to select another face in new images.If having checked all faces in image, then this method in block 630
Back to block 602.
It should be noted that the quality of above-mentioned various operations and methods estimation or movement images part.In some implementations, can
The feature, threshold value and/or scale for defining quality are set or changed for example in preference or setting by user.
Can by it is various it is specific in a manner of realize above method 200-600.For example, in some implementations, instead of in block 628
Each replacement face is sutured every time, and can first all faces in image be found with the replacement face of all cachings, then,
Same step or stage are by all these replacement facial sutures into image.In the realization of some alternatives, instead of will most in block 626
Good face, which is transformed into, seems similar with new images, can transform the image into and seem similar with best face (for example, working as
When only describing a face in new images, this may be most practical).
It can be realized using each alternative of features described above.In some implementations, instead of storing, selecting and locating as described above
The entire face of reason, is capable of handling a part of face, mouth, nose, eyes, eyebrow etc..It can be by each type
Facial parts be stored in image buffer storage their own type or bucket in.Instead of replacing entire face, as described above, if really
It periodically hopes, can individually replace these parts of face.
In some implementations, it is capable of handling the other kinds of image subject in addition to face (or as the additional of face).
For example, terrestrial reference or monument can be identified in the picture.It, can be with from image buffer storage if these landmark image quality are low
The better quality image of those terrestrial references replaces them, and above with respect to similar described in face.The image of caching can be come from
The relatively morning or original image of the set of user and/or the terrestrial reference from other sources (website, reference data etc.).Similarly,
The object described in the picture or project can be similarly processed.
It can be from shown different sequence and/or to be at least partly performed simultaneously each piece of method 200-600 and grasp
Make, as long as if appropriate.For example, some realizations can at least partly be performed simultaneously block 202 and 204.In some implementations, it grasps
