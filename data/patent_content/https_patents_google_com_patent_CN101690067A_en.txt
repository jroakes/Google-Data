Distribute power is shaped again
In one embodiment, distribute power in making the OFDMA symbol be shaped again and the OFDMA system that redistributes in, each distribute power 120,122 couples of DL-MAP 206 of module that are shaped again separate the equal power of never expectation and the problem of identical modulation/coding scheme with UL-MAP 230.Should be noted that the present invention also is applicable to following any system, the bandwidth spectrum of distributing is divided into the frequency window (or tone, or subcarrier) of specific width in this system and wherein these windows are mutually orthogonal.In one embodiment, the distribute power of OFDM/OFDMA symbol is the distribute power between the frequency sub-carrier in the OFDM/OFDMA symbol.Each distribute power module 120,122 that is shaped again is shaped distribute power again based on the selection of 116,118 pairs of modulation of the base station dispatcher of correspondence and encoding scheme and redistributes.The present invention does not change the modulation/coding of DL-MAP 206 and UL-MAP 230 or distributes to the gross power of OFDMA symbol, is shaped again but the different I E 220 that are used for different connections are carried out distribute power.Be shaped again the connection that being shaped again of module 120,122 allow to have good channel condition of each distribute power correctly receives its control channel IE and not have surplus power above its required SNR.
Be shaped the again connection at the cell edge place that also allows to have poor channel condition of distribute power receives its control channel IE with the SNR that increases.Improve bit error rate (BER) by utilizing the surplus power of saving from IE with better channel condition.In addition, as reducing the result of surplus power of IE that channel condition is better than the IE at cell edge place, other sub-districts or presence of intercell interference have been reduced.
Fig. 3 is according to an embodiment of the invention such as the block diagram of the OFDMA transceiver of the base station of base station 108 and 110.Fig. 3 has described distribute power and has been formed in again and where takes place and distribute power is shaped how relevant with decision such as the base station dispatcher of base station dispatcher 116 and 118 again.In Fig. 3, the input and output of medium access control (MAC) module 308 management data business.Scheduler 310 is coupled to MAC 308 communicatedly and can is MAC308 function (a plurality ofs') a part, and its coding and modulation to burst is made decision, the parked position of decision burst in Frame, and form DL-MAP and UL-MAP.
At emission pusher side 304, transceiver comprises forward error correction (FEC) module 312 that is coupled to MAC 308 communicatedly.Symbol-modulated module 306 is shown as has the QPSK modulation, but also can use other modulation such as 16QAM or 64QAM.The distribute power module 314 that is shaped again is coupled to symbol-modulated module 306 communicatedly.Be shaped again data burst modulation scheme that module 314 points out based on the IE among DL-MAP and the UL-MAP of distribute power makes OFDM power symbol distribute from initial Q PSK modulation power to be configured as combined power again and to distribute.Scheduler is used as input to the decision of data burst modulation scheme and is applied to distribute power shaping Algorithm module 316 again, and the output of the power shaping Algorithm that obtains is applied to the distribute power module 314 that is shaped again.Invert fast fourier transformation (IFFT) module 318 makes data scatter arrive orthogonal frequency sub-carriers.Fig. 3 also shows typical radio frequency (RF) module 320 of transmitter, its with subcarrier-modulated to the RF carrier wave.The DUX module 322 that is coupled to this RF module can be the RF duplexer that is used for the RF switch of TDD system or is used for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) (FDD) system.
At receiver side, transceiver comprises the RX module 302 and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) module 324 of data transaction being gone back to the territory identical with the applied territory of the transmitter of these data of expression RF circuit.Demodulate/decode module 326 expression receiver sides are used to the demodulator and the decoder of the correspondence of the data recovering to launch.The output of this module provides input to scheduler 310 and MAC 308.In one embodiment, as shown in Figure 3, base station dispatcher 116 is made its decision based on the channel condition feedback that receives at base station receiver 302 places.Should be noted that parts shown in Figure 3 can reside in site controller 112 and/or 110 places, base station.
In order to keep the unified power of each modulation symbol (non-OFDMA symbol), make the average modulation symbol energy equal 1, no matter it is QPSK, 16QAM or 64QAM, be used to make the normalized digital gain of different modulation symbols to be defined as follows:
1. order of modulation=2 if (QPSK), then
2. order of modulation=4 if (16-QAM), then
3. order of modulation=6 if (64-QAM), then
Should be noted that at modulation symbol map level 306 places of the emission pusher side 304 of Fig. 3 and these normalized gains are counted.Therefore, the distribute power that is proposed becomes form class to have as the modulation symbol of importing again, and this modulation symbol has the gain based on its modulation scheme bi-directional scaling.And, in each DL-MAP 206 and UL-MAP 230, have the standing part that comprises the Overhead that is applied to all connections and exist to connect specific IE.Because scheduler 116 is not made any decision to these standing parts of DL-MAP 206 and UL-MAP 230, so these standing parts keep its initial equal power to distribute.Yet, connecting specific IE as fruit part and be in the single OFDMA symbol, applied power distributes and to be shaped again and it is considered as poor channel conditions situation.
In one embodiment, total available subcarrier number of OFDMA symbol is N, and it does not comprise boundary belt subcarrier and DC (DC component with zero frequency, or subcarrier 0) subcarrier.In one example, because pilot sub-carrier is set to power than the high 2.5dB of data subcarrier usually, so distribute power is shaped again and comprises the pilot sub-carrier in the subchannel is kept its ratio with respect to the ambient data subcarrier.In the OFDMA symbol, can suppose to exist i independent IE altogether, i=1,2 ..., n, it has defined n burst.Therefore:
Formula (1)
For each burst, base station dispatcher 116,118 is based on CQI 226 Information Selection specific coding and modulation schemes.In one embodiment, suppose that multiple Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) symbol is defined as:
b
I, j=Re (b
I, j)+jIm (b
I, j) formula (2) and
Are overhead channels (QPSK modulation) and do not have the OFDMA symbol that distribution is shaped again that for its all the elements its gross power is:
Formula (3)
This has the hypothesis of unified energy based on modulation symbol.The distribute power of carrying out by the module 120 that is shaped again by distribute power is shaped again, and distributing again, the gross power of the OFDMA symbol of shaping is:
Formula (4)

Depend on the gain map strategy, some modulation and encoding scheme can be grouped in together, make gain can cover the modulation and the code rate of certain scope.And, should be noted that these are relative gains, and they being used for making distribute power to be shaped again between subcarrier, the information points of this subcarrier has the different modulation and the data burst of encoding scheme.As discussed above, in one embodiment, need make the total OFDMA symbol power that obtains constant after distribute power is shaped again, promptly

Formula (6)
Target is, improves the BER of the specific overhead channel IE of minority and reduces the transmitting power of the specific IE of remaining burst, keeps total OFDMA symbol power constant simultaneously, as having the situation that equal power is distributed.Have two different strategies of calculated gains, it can have different results.First strategy is, makes the IE gain of poor channel conditions constant, reduces the gain of the IE that is used to have good channel condition simultaneously.Then, another gain application to all IE, is made that final OFDMA symbol power is constant.The ratio of gains between the good and poor channel conditions that the result is fixed.
Second strategy is, increases the gain of the IE that is used to have poor channel conditions, reduces the gain of the IE that is used to have good channel condition simultaneously, makes that total symbol power is constant.The benefit of second strategy is, can be depending on the ratio about the good and poor channel conditions of this OFDMA symbol, and distribute power is shaped again.Better the number of channel condition IE is high more, and then for the IE with poor channel conditions, BER improves many more.Another benefit of second strategy is, the amount of the energy that reduces at good channel is known, and therefore, can determine that the SNR that obtains at difference channel improves.
And for table 1, base station dispatcher 116,118 is based on the information such as channel quality information (CQI) 226 or receiver signal-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR), make the decision about the selection of the modulation of data traffic burst and encoding scheme, it is shown in first row of table 1.These modulation and encoding scheme cause gaining to the selection of the mapping of the corresponding IE among DL-MAP 206 and the UL-MAP 230.
Discuss below and how to find the gain shown in the table 1.Module 120 is shaped distribute power to another modulation and encoding scheme from a modulation and encoding scheme again based on the modulation and the coding of business datum burst because distribute power is shaped again, and therefore what the power gain ratio that need find out from a modulation/coding scheme to another modulation/coding scheme is.In one embodiment, determine this ratio by table 2 and the table 3 hereinafter listed.

Yet for simplifying and illustrative purposes, an embodiment uses minority modulation and encoding scheme based on following hypothesis.For DL/UL-MAP, modulation and coding are to have
1/
2The QPSK of rate codeization adds 4 repetitions.By the QPSK modulation, for complex symbol, the normalized gain of each subcarrier is set to
Suppose only to consider QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM modulation under the situation of code rate disregarding that if distribute the data traffic burst of the correspondence of this connection by 16QAM, then for this modulation symbol, the normalized gain of each subcarrier is set to approximately
On this basis, all subcarriers for its IE among the MAP keep
ratio
Should be noted that IE counts the normalized gain of QPSK.If distribute the data traffic burst of the correspondence of this connection by 64QAM, then this is than being
For repetition, if desired, can exist the 3dB ratio of gains to reduce for each repetition.Owing to do not consider different code rates in certain embodiments, therefore can not need to consider this repetition yet.
In the more general discussion of distribute power manufacturing process again, by the QPSK with different coding speed, the 16QAM and the 64QAM that consider as example is as shown in table 1, the number of gain can be expanded to above 3.Then the ratio of gains can be defined as:
Wherein i is i the ratio of gains formula (7) about i modulation and encoding scheme
λ wherein
iBe gain g
iReciprocal value, the gain g
iCan be selected from table 1, i=1,2,3 ..., m, m be corresponding to the number of employed modulation scheme, and
Formula (8)
Wherein
Here, suppose g
0It is the maximum gain that is used for all gains of different modulation and encoding scheme.For the simplification distributional assumption that only has modulation, and for only three stage gains of QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM, distributing is shaped again can be defined as,
Formula (10)
Wherein
Here the hypothesis gain that is used for QPSK is g
1Above the distribute power of Zhi Hanging is shaped again and has following advantage.The specific IE that happens suddenly is the grouping of fixed dimension.For fixed OFDM A symbol power, each IE shares the part with the proportional total OFDMA symbol power of the size of IE.If particular mobile station is in extraordinary channel condition, then do not need to utilize the power that surpasses the corresponding required SNR of IE to send this corresponding IE.The transmitting power of minority IE by reducing the cell edge place can greatly reduce these the potential interference from " other sub-districts ", and other mobile radio stations at cell edge place have better chance and correctly receive its signal thus.(consider PUSC, the subcarrier permutation sequence that each sub-district has himself can not drop on the same sub-carrier for the different districts common signal channel thus.
Yet,, still utilize the power emission identical to have the IE of good channel condition with these IE with poor channel conditions (such as the cell edge mobile radio station) for the equal power launch scenario.Thus, the IE with good channel condition can disturb the IE with poor channel conditions.Therefore, being shaped again to improve BER by making the distribute power in the OFDMA symbol, is the BER that improves these IE with poor channel conditions under the situation of the BER performance of not sacrificing the IE with good channel condition.Total OFDMA symbol power is identical when not carrying out that distribute power is shaped again, and even the distribute power interference level that module 120,122 does not increase other sub-district mobile radio stations that is shaped again is the increase of the signal power of the IE with poor channel conditions on the cell edge.Because higher signal power arrives cell edge, therefore the invention provides the better cell edge performance.
For the benefit that other area interference that further quantize the cell edge place gain, can carry out following observation.For the IE among DL-MAP 206 and the UL-MAP 230, they use the QPSK with specific number of repetition
1/
2Rate codeization is as indicating in the 802.16d/e standard.Although there is the sub-district particular permutation sequence of using by each sub-district, be used to avoid such as FCH, accurately overlapping mutually with the control channel of standing part of DL-MAP 206 and so on, but the specific IE of the connection among the DL-MAP 206 is directly overlapped with the standing part from the control channel of other sub-districts.Therefore, no matter the type of control channel how, the average signal-to-noise ratio at cell edge place (SNR) is at most zero dB.
By using distribute power discussed above manufacturing process again, the average SNR gain at cell edge place equals
With dB is the average SNR gain=10log λ with respect to QPSK of unit
iFormula (12)
λ wherein
iBe the ratio of gains of definition in the formula (7) and the type that depends on the modulation/coding scheme of business datum burst.The gain of these average SNR is quantified as negative gain, makes in the sub-district and at the cell edge place, for each modulation and type of coding, presence of intercell interference reduces this dB number.
As long as exist at least one to have the IE of better channel condition, the overall gain that then is used for the QPSK modulated sub-carriers increases
Formula (13)
Here the gain that can suppose to be used for the QPSK modulation is g
1Should be noted that the gain that realizes in the formula (13) will make the SNR increase about these connections at cell edge place.
Another consideration is to carry out the burst that mixed automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmits.Because this retransmits the error probability that reduces combination receiver place afterwards, the required SNR minimizing 1 at the receiver place after therefore considering to retransmit is to 3dB.Should be noted that and to use higher modulation/coding speed.Add scheduler modulation and code rate selection course to by HARQ being retransmitted gain, can consider the more conservative gain reduction of distribute power in being shaped again.This be because, do not have the HARQ process for DL-MAP 206 and UL-MAP 230, they need the higher SNR at receiver place thus.This is converted into the less λ of selection in formula (7)
i, cover potential HARQ gain thus.
In addition, if the IE among the MAP (being DL-MAP 206 or UL-MAP 230) is carried out encode by the code that does not have the piece separation, the IE among this MAP that then sorts as follows, the IE that promptly points to the data burst with QPSK modulation is arranged in the first place of this MAP.The IE that sensing has the data burst of 16QAM is positioned at second subsequently, and the IE that points to the data burst with 64QAM is positioned at last.The IE that will have a higher-wattage ranks the first and the IE that will have a lower-wattage comes and do not influence the decode procedure that expection is used for these high power bits of these cell edge mobile radio stations at last.For the mobile radio station in the sub-district, they can be decoded to these lower-wattages IE and higher-wattage IE.
The distribute power example that is shaped again
Fig. 4 illustrates the distribute power example that is shaped again, and Fig. 5 is that diagram has the chart that the distribute power of 10 overhead control channel IE combinations is shaped again.Suppose the 10MHz bandwidth, have 720 usable data subcarriers.For 30 subchannels, then each subchannel has 24 subcarriers.For each subcarrier of 2 bits, each of about 44 bits connects specific IE, can support to have 30 each OFDMA symbols (supposing that specific OFDMA symbol is used in the specific IE of connection by whole the branch) that connect specific IE.Also hypothesis is used QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM modulation scheme, uses three stage gains, thus set omega
1Comprise many QPSK modulation IE, set omega
2Comprise many 16QAM modulation IE, and set omega
3Comprise many 64QAM modulation IE.
Because all IE have same size, so N

3=24.And, n=10, it is the sum of IE.By use formula (7), (8), (9) and (10)
Formula (14)

i, i=1,2,3 function.By changing the size combinations of these set, can obtain one group of gain, its show as shown in Figure 5 be the dynamic gain excursion of unit with dB based on the various combination of the IE in the OFDMA symbol.
Therefore, as seeing, the invention provides following advantage by above discussing.Provide a kind of and coding and the modulation decision that connects particular burst made distribute power manufacturing process again based on base station dispatcher.This distribute power is shaped again and distribute power between the different burst phase related control information element (IE) in the OFDMA symbol is shaped again and redistributes.This is shaped again and causes, and under the situation of the required received signal quality of the correspondence of not sacrificing the wireless device place, reduces unnecessary transmitting power.And, except saving surplus power, improve the desired signal quality of these mobile radio stations at cell edge place.Another advantage of the present invention is to reduce presence of intercell interference.All these advantages are provided under the situation that does not increase general objective OFDMA symbol power.
