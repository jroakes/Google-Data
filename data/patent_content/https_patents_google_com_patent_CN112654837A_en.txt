Abstract
A system determines a geographic area of interest to present to a user in a digital map. The system identifies a general set of POIs based on one or more signals that are not relevant to the user, and in a first instance, places respective indicators of the general set of POIs on a digital map of the geographical area of interest. In a second example, the system identifies a personalized set of POIs that may be relevant to the user based on a user-specific and geography-independent signal, and places respective indicators of the personalized set of POIs on a digital map of the geographic area along with some, but not all, of the indicators of the general set of POIs so that a density of the indicators does not exceed a certain threshold.
Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to digital maps, and more particularly, to generating a digital map including information of particular interest to a user viewing the digital map.
Background
Today, many electronic devices such as personal computers, tablets, mobile phones, navigators, etc. provided as dedicated devices or embedded in the head unit of a vehicle are capable of providing digital maps of geographic areas and stepping directions for navigating over geographic areas by driving, walking, cycling, or using public transportation. Specialized map applications or "apps" as well as general-purpose applications such as web browsers can provide digital maps and/or navigation directions.
Digital maps typically include information that is expected to be of interest to all users. For example, the digital map can include major landmarks, important roads, hot spots, and the like. However, users are often interested in different content when viewing maps of the same geographic area (when viewing static maps or when viewing maps accompanying navigation routes).
Furthermore, for typical geographical areas, the amount of information available today for display in the form of indicators (e.g., icons, symbols, logos) is often too high to avoid visual clutter or overlap between the indicators.
Disclosure of Invention
The system of the present disclosure determines which point of interest (POI) indicators should be placed on the digital map in view of general or non-personalized signals such as importance, popularity, rating, etc. of the corresponding location and personalized signals such as a profile of a user viewing the digital map. In some cases, when POIs that are generally not visible at a particular zoom level are likely to match the user's interests, the system "raises" or raises the priority of those POIs. The system supports discovery of unexpected harvests in this manner. Also, the system solves the technical problem of efficiently managing limited screen real estate (real estate) when placing POI indicators on a digital map. Because the density of available information for a typical geographic area is too high to show all available POIs, the system selects POIs in a particular way to avoid collisions between indicators or to avoid exceeding a certain density threshold for spatial cells.
One example embodiment of these techniques is a method for generating a personalized digital map for display on a user device. The method includes determining a geographic area of interest to present to a user in a digital map, and selecting a general set of points of interest (POIs) based on one or more signals that are not relevant to the user. In a first example, the method includes placing respective indicators of a general set of POIs on a digital map of a geographic area of interest. In a second example, the method includes selecting a second set of personalized POIs that may be relevant to the user based on a user-specific and geographically-independent signal, and placing respective indicators of the set of personalized POIs on a digital map of the geographic area and placing at least several indicators of the set of general POIs, including not placing at least one POI in the set of general POIs in a portion of the digital map where a density of the indicators exceeds a certain threshold.
Another example embodiment of these techniques is a system that includes one or more processing units and computer-readable storage instructions. When executed by one or more processing units, the instructions cause the computing system to determine a geographic area of interest to present to a user in a digital map, and select a general set of points of interest (POIs) based on one or more signals not relevant to the user; in a first example, respective indicators of a general set of POIs are placed on a digital map of a geographical area of interest; and in a second instance, selecting a second set of personalized POIs that may be relevant to the user based on the user-specific and geographically-independent signals, and placing respective indicators of the set of personalized POIs on a digital map of the geographic area and placing at least several indicators of the set of general POIs, including not placing at least one POI in the set of general POIs in a portion of the digital map where a density of the indicators exceeds a certain threshold.
Another example embodiment of these techniques is a method for generating a personalized digital map for display on a user device. The method includes receiving, by one or more computing devices, an indication of a geographic area of interest to be presented to a user in a digital map. The method further comprises the following steps: the method includes executing a first query to determine a first set of personalized POIs that may be relevant to a user based on a personal profile of the user, determining an amount of space available to the POIs after the first set of POIs are placed on a digital map of a geographic area, executing a second query to determine a second set of POIs to be placed on the digital map of the geographic area based on one or more signals that are not relevant to the user, and providing the first and second sets of POIs to a client device for display of the digital map of the geographic area by one or more processors.

Detailed Description
In general, the system of the present disclosure identifies personalized points of interest (POIs) in a certain geographic area that may be specifically relevant to a user and provides corresponding indicators on a digital map. The user can allow the system to generate various suggestions and recommendations based on the user's profile and activities, for example, by operating certain controls or installing certain applications, and the system can identify POIs based on geographic and non-geographic signals in the user's profile. In some cases, the system uses, for example, direct references to geographic locations, such as where the user explicitly marked on a map or for which the user previously requested navigation directions. In other cases, the system identifies geographic locations that may be of interest to the user based on general, non-geographic topics that the user appears to like (e.g., music, cars, boats). Signals related to general, non-geographic topics can come from non-geographic applications such as web browsers, calendars, and so forth.
When selecting personalized POIs, the system can promote (i.e., increase its priority or ranking) certain POIs that are not typically visible at a particular zoom level. For example, an indicator of a certain commercial may typically appear on a digital map at zoom level N. The system may determine that, because of the user-specific signal, the commercial indicator should appear numerically at a lower zoom level M (i.e., when the digital map contains a larger geographic area).
In some implementations, the system assigns different weights to the signals in the user profile when determining whether and to what extent the POI should be promoted. For example, the system can assign a relatively large weight to the user's direct reference to a geo-located business (e.g., the user has recently searched for "Museum Art Museum" and the digital map provided by the system to the user includes the location of the Museum), a smaller weight to a non-geographic signal (e.g., the user has previously searched for documents related to the current Art and the digital map provided by the system to the user includes the location of the Museum that includes the current Art), and an even smaller weight to a signal from the user's social graph (e.g., a person in the user's social graph has recommended a business at the location included in the digital map).
In some cases, the system can provide a marker to indicate why the POI was included in the digital map. For example, the digital map can include the label "last year search" or "bookmarked in the browser". Alternatively or additionally, the indicators of POIs corresponding to different sources can have different shapes, colors, and effects (e.g., flashing). Thus, the indicator of a generic POI can have a different visualization than the indicator of a personalized POI, and the indicator of a personalized POI can also be different to provide further guidance to the user.
In various scenarios, the user can select the geographic area where the system identifies the POI, for example, by selecting the geographic area via an interface of a mapping application or by requesting navigation directions.
Additionally, the system of the present disclosure addresses the problem of generating a digital map populated with POI indicators without exceeding a certain threshold density. In some implementations, the system first identifies personalized POIs for a geographic region by identifying general topics of interest for the geographic region (e.g., "fishing"), and running a set of geographic queries based on these general topics of interest, boosting the search results so that corresponding indicators appear on a digital map of the geographic region, and then determining the remaining space available for indicators corresponding to general POIs identified based on user-independent signals. In the absence of user-specific signals, the system selects these POIs for placement on the digital map based on a priority ranking that can be based on such signals (e.g., popularity, prominence, importance, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the system can place the indicator of the personalized POI and the indicator of the general POI on respective virtual layers of the information, overlay the virtual layers on the digital map, and resolve conflicts between the indicators by comparing the respective priorities of the personalized POI and the general POI. In this manner, the system is able to efficiently manage screen real estate.
Consider next an example computing system in which these techniques can be implemented.
Referring to the block diagram of fig. 1, in an example computing system 10, a map data server 12 provides map data and POI data to a client device 14 via a communication network 16. The map data server 12 is coupled to a map database 18 that stores map data, a POI database 20 that stores indications of various locations along with corresponding rankings or priorities, and a user profile database 22 that stores profiles of various users.
The map data server 12 can be implemented as a single device or a group of devices. One or more of these devices can include one or more processors 30, a network interface 32, a database interface 33, and a non-transitory computer-readable memory 34 storing instructions executable on the one or more processors 30. The instructions can implement, among other software components, a server-side POI controller 36 that determines which POIs should be placed on the digital map, as discussed in detail below. More generally, the map data server 12 can include any suitable type of processing hardware configured to generate map image layers for the present disclosure.
The client device 14 can be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, another type of portable device (such as a smartphone, a wearable device, etc.). More generally, the techniques of the present disclosure for placing POIs on a digital map can be utilized in any suitable computing device. The client device 14 can include a network interface 42 configured to communicate with the map data server 12 and other devices via the network 16 using any suitable protocol, the network 16 can be a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), etc., and can include any suitable number of wired and/or wireless links. The client device 14 can also include a touch screen 44, the touch screen 44 configured to receive typed and gesture-based input and display images generated by various applications executing on the client device 14, including a geographic application 46. In other implementations, the client device 14 can include an output-only display and receive input via a keyboard, mouse, microphone, sensor configured to detect 2D and/or 3D gestures, and so forth. In addition, client device 14 can include one or more general purpose processors 40, non-transitory computer readable memory 48, and a graphics card 50 (e.g., including one or more graphics processing units, or GPUs) having buffers and program memory that stores vertex and pixel shaders. The memory 48 can include persistent components (e.g., hard disk) as well as non-persistent components (e.g., RAM). In other implementations, client device 14 may include additional components, or conversely, not include some of the components shown in fig. 1.
In the example embodiment shown in fig. 1, the geographic application 46 is stored in the memory 48 as a set of instructions executed by the one or more processors 40. The geographic application 46 is capable of generating interactive digital maps and, depending on the implementation and/or scenario, obtaining navigational directions, providing data related to geo-located businesses, retrieving and displaying geo-commerce data such as coupons and bids, and the like. Depending on the implementation, the geographic application 46 can operate as a standalone application or as a component of another application, such as a web browser, for example. The geographic application 46 includes a client-side POI controller 60 that operates on POI data 52.
The POI generation system of the present disclosure can include a server-side POI controller 36 and/or a client-side POI controller 60. According to an embodiment, the server-side POI controller 36 or the client-side POI controller 60 determines which POIs should be indicated with indicators on the digital map displayed by the geographic application 46, which POIs should be omitted, how conflicts between indicators should be resolved, and so on. The POI generation system can generally distribute this functionality between the controllers 36 and 60 in any suitable manner.
With continued reference to FIG. 1, the map database 18 can be implemented in a single storage device or multiple storage devices. The map database 18 can store map data that includes descriptions of the geometry of various map features, such as buildings and other structures, roads, parking lots, bodies of water, and so forth. In addition to roads designed for vehicles, map data can describe cycling paths, footpaths, railroad paths, shipping routes, airline routes, and the like. Map features can be defined in a vector graphics format, according to which images are described in terms of geometric primitives based on mathematical expressions, or another suitable scalable format. According to embodiments, map features can be defined only in two dimensions (2D), in three dimensions (3D) as a wire frame to which grating textures are applied, in "two and a half" dimensions (2.5D) as a 2D polygon "squeezed" into a third dimension, and so on. In some cases, the map data can also include, for example, a raster image in a bitmap format. In addition, the map data can also include text labels and various forms of metadata, such as links to remote resources.
In addition, the map data server 12 can use map tiles (tiling) to organize and provide map data to client devices. Map tiles generally correspond to a 2D organization of geospatial data into quadtrees. Up to the highest magnification level, each tile at a given zoom level is divided into four tiles at the next level. Similarly, a 3D organization of geospatial data can be implemented using octree, where a cube volume contains map geometry at a certain zoom level and is subdivided into eight cube volumes at the next zoom level, where each of the eight cube volumes typically contains more detailed map geometry. To map the surface of the earth onto a plane for 2D representation, an inkercator or another suitable projection can be used. Although the following examples refer to map data organized into map tiles, the LOD and style parameter determination techniques of the present disclosure can be extended to 3D map data organized into octrees.
The POI database 20 can store the geographical coordinates of various locations. The POI database 20 can also store business data for some locations, such as business hours, descriptions of products and services offered, user reviews, etc. The POIs need not always correspond to businesses and can also include landmarks (e.g., monuments, fountains), prominent buildings and other structures, locations of events, and so forth. In some implementations, the POI database 20 can store an indication of the type (e.g., hotel, restaurant, theater) for each POI so that the POI generation system can determine which icon to place on the digital map. In addition, the POI database 20 can store for each POI an indication of a priority or ranking, e.g., a numerical score corresponding to the estimated importance of the POI. Thus, major landmarks such as Frank Loaded Reid buildings can have relatively high priority, while nearby restaurants can have relatively low priority. When the user views the digital map of the corresponding area at a certain zoom level, the POI generation system can determine that it can include an indicator of one of the POIs, but not both, and the POI generation system can use the priority value to determine which POI to represent on the digital map.
The user profile database 22 can include profile data for individual users. The user of the client device 14 can instruct the POI generation system to personalize the digital map with signals included in the user's profile data by operating certain controls or installing certain applications. The POI generation system is accordingly able to use both geographic signals and non-geographic signals. Examples of geographic signals can include previous geographic queries (e.g., "cafes near me") as well as user selections of particular search results, navigation directions to certain locations, comments submitted for physical business, and so forth. These geographic signals need not be limited to the geographic application 46 and come from other applications, such as a web browser when a user bookmarks a website related to a particular location, a messaging application via which the user can reference a particular location, a mail application, and so forth. Examples of non-geographic signals include bookmarks that are not relevant to a particular geographic location but are relevant to a subject for which the POI can exist. For example, a user can bookmark a venue for a band that schedules a live performance at a particular location. As another example, the user can bookmark a website dedicated to jazz music, and in some cases, the POI generation system can promote an indicator of jazz clubs in view of the signal.
Referring now to fig. 2, a POI generation system can implement a method 200, for example, for generating a personalized map for a user with indications of general and personalized POIs as a set of instructions executable by one or more processors. For clarity, the following discussion references the POI generation system of fig. 1, which includes POI controller 36 and/or POI controller 60. However, the method 200 can be implemented in any suitable computing system, on a server and/or a client.
At block 202, the POI generation system can determine a geographic area of interest to present in the digital map. The user can select a geographic region by placing a map viewport (viewport) over a region, by explicitly identifying a region (e.g., "seattle, washington") via the map application 46, or by requesting navigational directions from a certain starting location to a destination, where the geographic region of interest corresponds to a region around the current location of the user device 14.
At block 204, the POI generation system can determine a general set of POIs based on the user-independent signals. Referring to fig. 4, for example, a layer 402 of generic POIs can include labels for cities and towns (412 and 418, respectively), routes (416) and bodies of water (410), and POIs of some well-known importance represented by indicator 414. Some of the markers and indicators in the layer 402 represent an entire geographic area, such as a lake, and in these cases the POI can, for example, correspond to the geometric center of such an area, or in another embodiment the POI generation system can process the geographic markers of lakes, roads, parking lots, etc. separately from the general POI.
At block 206, the POI generation system is operable in a first instance to display only general POIs on the digital map, and not personalized POIs. Referring again to fig. 4, for example, the POI generation system can apply the layer 402 of general POIs to the map layer 406 to generate a version of the digital map in which an indicator of each general POI in the upper layer 402 of the digital map is visible.
However, in another example, the POI generation system can use the user-specific signal to identify a personalized set of POIs (block 208). As discussed above, in some cases, POI generation systems can utilize geographically independent signals. An example of a personalized POI collection in the format of a virtual layer is depicted in fig. 4 as layer 404. In this example, the POI 430 can correspond to a prior search for a particular event and location, and accordingly the POI generation system can assign a relatively large weight to the POI. On the other hand, POIs 432 and 434 can correspond to places that generally appear to correspond to a user's interest in fishing, and thus the POI generation system can assign less weight to these POIs. The POI generation system can then elevate the POIs 430, 432, and 434 according to a specified weight, where a greater weight results in a greater increase in priority. In some implementations, the POI generation system can also visually indicate the difference in weight by using different sizes, colors, or effects of the indicators.
At block 210, the POI generation system places on the digital map respective indicators of personalized POIs and some general POIs. In particular, the POI generation system determines whether the density of indicators for a certain spatial cell (e.g., the S2 cell, a map tile at a zoom level) exceeds a predefined threshold. Referring again to fig. 4, the POI generation system can place layers 402 and 404 onto layer 406 to generate a digital map 408 with generic and personalized POIs.
In this example, placing indicators of both general POIs 414 and personalized POIs 430 on a digital map results in an excessive density of POIs in the corresponding portion of the map. In one example embodiment, the POI generation system resolves the conflict between POIs 414 and 430 by comparing the priority of the generic POI 414 with the priority of the POI 430 increased by promotion as discussed above.
In another example embodiment, the POI generation system always resolves conflicts between general POIs and personalized POIs in favor of personalized POIs. In this case, the POI generation system first places the indicators of all POIs in layer 404 on the digital map, determines the amount of space remaining, and places those indicators of general POIs in layer 402 on the digital map, which does not result in excessive indicator density.
For further clarity, fig. 3 illustrates a method 300 for determining which POIs should be placed in a portion of a digital map in view of spatial constraints, e.g., the POI generation system can perform the method at block 210 of method 200.
The method 300 begins at block 302 where the POI generation system selects the next POI from the list of general POIs and the list of personalized POIs. The POI generation system can check whether the indicator placing the next selected POI will cause the density of the indicators to exceed a certain threshold. When the density threshold is not exceeded, the POI generation system places an indicator on the digital map and flow continues to block 302. Otherwise, if the density threshold is exceeded, flow continues to block 306. At block 306, the POI generation system resolves the conflict between the indicators that resulted in excessive density, and flow returns to block 302.
Fig. 5 is a flow diagram of another example method 500 that can be implemented in the system of fig. 1 for generating a personalized map for a user with indications of general and personalized POIs. Similar to the method 200, the method 500 can be implemented in any suitable computing system, on a server and/or client, but for clarity the following discussion refers to the POI generation system of fig. 1.
At block 502, similar to block 202 discussed above, the POI generation system can determine a geographic area of interest to present in the digital map. Next, at block 504, the POI generation system executes a first query to determine personalized POIs based on the user's profile. The first query can include a plurality of component queries, such as "at-interest I1Finding a location in a matched specified geographic region, "" in association with interest I2Find a place in the specified geography that matches, "find a place in the specified geographic area where the user requested navigation directions in the last 12 months," "find a place in the specified geographic area referenced in the user's browser bookmark," and so forth. The first query can result in a personalized set of POIs such as those shown in layer 402 in fig. 4.
Next, at block 506, the POI generation system can determine an amount of space available after the indicator of the personalized POI is placed on the digital map. In particular, the POI generation system can determine the amount of space for each map tile, for the entire map visible in the map viewport, or for any suitable spatial unit.
The POI generation system can then execute the second query to produce a set of generalized POIs (block 508). However, the POI generation system can execute the second query subject to the spatial constraints determined at block 506. For this reason, the POI generation system can, for example, execute a query only for important general POIs. As a more specific example, for a certain geographic area depicted at zoom level Z, the POI generation system is generally capable of executing a query to determine a general set of POIs by querying any POI ranked or prioritized above N in the POI database 20 (see fig. 1); however, at block 508, the POI generation system can execute the query to determine a general set of POIs that are ranked or prioritized over M, where M > N. In this manner, the POI generation system is able to obtain a smaller set of POIs in response to the second query and thus reduce the amount of memory necessary to execute the query and the number of operations required to resolve the conflict.
According to another approach, the POI generation system executes at least some queries in advance as a batch job to avoid executing real-time queries and thus slow down the process of generating a digital map with POI indicators. For example, for a certain geographic area that the user often visits, the POI generation system can perform queries to the personalized POI to prepare the layer 402 (see fig. 4) in advance.
At block 510, the POI generation system can place indicators of personalized and general POIs on the digital map.
As another example, fig. 6 depicts an example digital map with a visualization of a navigation route and personalized POIs that a general POI system is capable of generating. The digital map 600 includes a visualization of a navigation route 602. In this example, the POI generation system identifies the POI Eichstgaten as the location to which the user bookmarks via a web browser. The POI generation system accordingly places an indicator 604 in the form of a generic location icon on the digital map along with indicia indicating the source of the POI.
POI generation further identifies POI Audi Museum based on prior searches by the user. The POI generation system accordingly places an indicator 606 in the form of a museum icon on the digital map along with a marker indicating the source of the POI. In addition to indicating that personalized POIs are identified based on prior searches, in this case the POI generation system also indicates how recently the search occurred.
Additional considerations
The following additional considerations apply to the discussion above. Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement a component, an operation, or a structure described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed in parallel, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. The structures and functions of the separate components presented in the example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter of the present disclosure.
Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as comprising logic or a number of components and modules. The modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code stored on a machine-readable medium) or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in some manner. In an example embodiment, one or more computer systems (e.g., standalone, client, or server computer systems) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) to operate hardware modules for performing certain operations as described herein.
In various embodiments, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., a dedicated processor such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., contained within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision whether to implement a hardware module in a dedicated and permanently configured circuit or in a temporarily configured circuit (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.
The term hardware should therefore be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be it a physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), entity for operating in a certain manner and/or performing certain operations described herein. As used herein, "hardware-implemented module" refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which the hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), it is not necessary to configure or instantiate each hardware module in any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules include a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured at different times as respective different hardware modules. Accordingly, software may be configured on the processor, for example, to form a particular hardware module at one instance in time and to form different hardware modules at different instances in time.
A hardware module can provide information to other hardware modules and receive information from other hardware modules. Thus, the described hardware modules may be considered to be communicatively coupled. In the case where a plurality of such hardware modules coexist, communication can be achieved by signal transmission (for example, by an appropriate circuit and bus) connecting the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communication between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, by storage and retrieval of information in memory structures accessed by the multiple hardware modules. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of the operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. Additional hardware modules may then access the memory device at a later time to retrieve and process the stored output. The hardware module may also initiate communication with the input/output device and may be capable of performing operations on the resource (e.g., collection of information).
The methods 200, 300, and 500 may include one or more functional blocks, modules, independent functions or routines in the form of tangible computer-executable instructions that are stored in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium and executed using a processor of a computing device (e.g., a server, a personal computer, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a smartwatch, a mobile computing device, or other personal computing device, as described herein). The methods 200, 300, and 500 may be included, for example, as part of any back-end server (e.g., a map data server, a navigation server, or any other type of server computing device, as described herein), a portable device module of an example environment, or as part of a module external to such an environment. Although a diagram may be described with reference to other diagrams for ease of explanation, the methods 200, 300, and 500 can be utilized with respect to other objects and user interfaces. Furthermore, although the above explanation describes the steps of methods 200, 300, and 500 as being performed by a particular device, the following is done for illustrative purposes only.
Various operations of the example methods described herein may be performed, at least in part, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such a processor may constitute a processor-implemented module that operates to perform one or more operations or functions. In some example embodiments, the modules referred to herein comprise processor-implemented modules.
Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be implemented at least in part by a processor. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The execution of certain operations may be distributed among one or more processors, and not solely reside within a single machine, but rather are deployed over a number of machines. In some example embodiments, one or more processors may be located at a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or as a server farm), while in other embodiments processors may be distributed over a number of locations.
The one or more processors may also be operable to support performance of related operations in a "cloud computing" environment or as SaaS. For example, as indicated above, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as an example of a machine including a processor), which may be accessed via a network (e.g., the internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., APIs).
Still further, the figures depict some embodiments of the example environment for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.
Upon reading this disclosure, those skilled in the art will understand still additional alternative structural and functional designs for placing POIs on digital maps by the principles disclosed herein. Thus, while particular embodiments and applications have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to the precise construction and components disclosed herein. Various modifications, changes, and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement, operation, and details of the methods and apparatus disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope defined in the appended claims.
