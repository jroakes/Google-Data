As shown in Figure 6, if the test result of step 607 and 609 is false, perhaps after step 606 has been provided with the correction sign, realize a logic that prevents to revise counter long-term " shake ".Realize this hysteresis logic so that prevent minimal frequency deviation long-term accumulated, cause an illegal pressure correction.Processing is wherein tested to determine to revise the nearest correction Counter Value (last_update_cnt) whether counter equals back 6 frames (HYSTER_CNT_THLD) from step 610.In optimum embodiment, 6 frames are used as threshold value, but can realize any number of frames.If the test result of step 610 is true, then remove and revise counter, and processing is withdrawn into next frame in step 612 in step 611.If the test result of step 610 is false, then handle directly being withdrawn into next frame in step 612.The pseudo-code of step 610-612 is as follows:
if(update_cnt＝＝last_update_cnt)
hyster_cnt＝hyster_cnt+1
else
hyster_cnt＝0
last_update_cnt＝update_cnt
if(hyster_cnt＞HYSTER_CNT_THLD)

ThParameter is imported into module 715, tests in this module with definite voice and whether measures v (m) greater than the voice metric threshold.Utilize the Eq.4.1.2.4-1 of IS-127 to determine the voice metric threshold.Importantly measure v (m) and can not change, but the voice metric threshold can change in RDA 248 according to the present invention from the voice of noise suppressing system output.
With reference to the step 715 of Fig. 7,, then determine that in step 718 sending signal s ' speed (n) is 1/8 speed if voice are measured v (m) less than the voice metric threshold.This determine after, realize a hangover in step 721.Hangover generally is realized as at a slow speed the decay voice that " covering " may be divided into noise, and perhaps striding across may be by the little gap in the voice of active voice motion detection reduction quality.After in step 721, realizing the hangover, guarantee to carry out the transmission of correct speed in step 736.In this, signal s ' (n) is encoded with 1/8 speed according to the present invention and send to suitable movement station 115.
If measure v (m) greater than the voice metric threshold, then carry out another test and whether measure v (m) greater than a weighting (by a value α) voice metric threshold to determine voice in step 724 at step 715 voice.This is handled and allows to encode with 1/2 pair of voice signal near noise-floor of speed, and advantage wherein is to have reduced mean data rate and kept high voice quality.Be not more than weighting voice metric threshold if measure v (m), then handle proceeding to step 727, in this step, send signal s ' speed (n) and be determined to be 1/2 speed at step 724 voice.If but measure v (m) greater than weighting voice metric threshold at step 724 voice, and then handle proceeding to step 730, in this step, send signal s ' speed (n) and be determined to be speed 1 (also being known as full rate).In both cases (by step 727 send with 1/2 speed or by step 730 at full speed rate send), handle proceeding to the step 733 of determining the hangover.After determining the hangover, handle proceeding to the step 736 of assurance with correct speed rates.In this, signal s ' (n) is encoded with 1/2 speed or full rate according to the present invention and send to suitable movement station 115.
Also can arrive step 733 with reference to the step 715 of following pseudo-code key diagram 7:
if(υ(m)＞υth){ if(υ(m)＞αυth){ /* α＝1.1 */ rate(m)＝RATE1 }else{ rate(m)＝RATE1/2 } b(m)＝b(m-1)+1 /* increment burst counter */ if(b(m)＞bth){ /* compare counter with threshold */ h(m)＝hcnt /* set hangover*/ } }else{ b(m)＝0 /* clear burst counter */ h(m)＝h(m-1)-1 /* decrement hangover */ if(h(m)≤0){ rate(m)＝RATE1/8 h(m)＝0 }else{ rate(m)＝rate(m-1) } }
The illegal rate transition that defines among the following pseudo-representation IS-127.Needing to note two 10ms squelch frames to determine a 20ms speech coder frame rate.Determine final speed according to two based on the largest frames in the RDA frame of squelch.
if(rate(m)＝＝RATE1/8?and?rate(m-2)＝＝RATE1){
rate(m)＝RATE1/2
}
The front illustrates with reference to a specific embodiment and has described the present invention that those skilled in the art are to be understood that under the prerequisite that does not depart from aim of the present invention and scope can carry out various modifications to form and details.For example, illustrated among Fig. 2 and be used for realizing determining based on speed of the present invention, the device that the infrastructure by communication system realizes, but persons of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that the device that also can in movement station 115, realize Fig. 2.In this realization, it is definite to realize based on speed of the present invention not need to change Fig. 2.
And the notion of describing at cdma communication system of determining based on speed of the present invention can be extended for the voice activity detection (vad) based on time division multiple access (TDMA) of the present invention (TDMA) communication system.In this realization, the function of RDA module 248 is replaced by the function of voice activity detection (vad) among Fig. 2, and wherein the output of VAD module 248 is possible be imported into the VAD of speech coder judgement.The speech activity of determining to leave VAD module 248 is that the step of true or false is similar to the process flow diagram of Fig. 7 and as shown in Figure 8.As shown in Figure 8, identical among step 703-715 and Fig. 7.If but the test result of step 715 is false, then determine that in step 818 VAD is false, and step proceeds to the step 721 that realizes the hangover.If the test result of step 715 is true, then determine that in step 827 VAD proceeds to the step 733 of determining a hangover for true and flow process.
