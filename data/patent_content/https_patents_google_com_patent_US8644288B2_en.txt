- any two users were randomly paired on a frame basis for the UL SDMA.
- blind/random scheduling method results in system performance degradation, which means less system throughput or capacity.
- An uplink scheduling (ULS) utility employs uplink signals, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback signal and/or an uplink sounding signal, to estimate a channel gain associated with a transmission path(s) of each user. Based on the estimated channel gain, the ULS utility is able to compute channel capacity. Based on capacity estimates of (1) the multiplexed user signals and (2) the individual user signals, signals are either multiplexed for UL SDMA or are transmitted individually. An optimal selection of multiplexed signals may be based upon: (1) a cross user interference estimate; and (2) a selection mechanism based on eigen-decomposition techniques.
- the ULS utility enables a UL scheduler to pair information signals with clear spatial distinction and minimal correlation, based on capacity evaluations.

- the (M ⁇ 1)-dimensional vector of complex signals, “x”, received by the M-element antenna array in the k-th subcarrier of the n-th OFDM symbol is constituted by the superposition of the independently faded signals associated with the L users sharing the same time-frequency resource.
- “x” may also be referred to as “x[n;k]”.
- the received signal is corrupted by noise (“n(p)” or “n”) at the array elements.
- the frequency domain channel transfer function matrix “H” of dimension M ⁇ L is constituted by the set of channel vectors of the L users, each of which hosts the frequency domain channel transfer factors between the single transmitter antenna associated with a particular user, such as user v, and the receiver via the antenna array.
- the complex data signal transmitted by each user such as signal s(v) transmitted by user v, has zero-mean and unit variance.
- the noise process n(p) at any antenna array element p exhibits zero-mean and a variance of ⁇ 2 .
- the frequency domain channel transfer function H(k) of the different users are different fading processes.
- FIGS. 3A-3F illustrate a number of equations employed in the UL SDMA pairing methods according to one embodiment of the invention.
- UL SDMA receiver 107 facilitates the subsequent separation of the different users based on the unique channel transfer function vector as observed through an antenna array.
- An estimate of the channel transfer function vector, “H” is provided by a sub-carrier “k” frequency domain channel estimate (vector “H(k) u ”) between user u and each receive antenna at base station 106 .
- Vector “H(k) u ” may be determined empirically by a sounding processing methodology or estimated by using pilots embedded in uplink signals such as the CQI feedback signal.
- ULS utility 110 computes a “ ⁇ -matrix.”
- the ⁇ -matrix is a matrix of cross-user interference measurements, “ ⁇ ”, between two users, that is, between a first user such as user u and a second user such as user v, on a sub-carrier k and across each of the M antennas, where “ ⁇ ” is provided by Equation 312:
- the “ ⁇ -matrix” can be defined as an average over the “K” subcarriers.
- ULS utility 110 pairs and schedules information signals that have a minimal correlation for UL SDMA.
- detector 117 e.g., a MMSE detector
- the selected pairings ultimately increases an ability of the detector to distinguish/de-correlate and recover each one of the individual transmitted signals from the received signals.
- Equation 301 a communication environment with an antenna array comprising a number “Mr” of receive antennas and two (2) single transmit users, that is, users' mobile devices, with a flat channel is considered.
- the SDMA transmission may be modeled as shown in Equation 301:
- the vector [s 1 s 2 ] T is the signal vector consisting of the transmitted modulated symbols from each user.
- the vector [n 1 . . . n Mr ] T is the noise vector at the receive antennas.
- Vector [y 1 . . . y Mr ] T is the received signals vector at the receive antennas.
- the channel transfer function, H may be represented as shown in Equation 302:
- Equation ⁇ ⁇ 302 each entry h i,j is the complex channel gain from a j th transmit antenna, that is, a j th user, to an i th receive antenna.
- This flat channel, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) model may be applied to each sub-carrier in the uplink.
- the variance of the received noise including interference satisfies equation 303.
- Equation 304 Using a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver with interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) on a received signal y i , a per tone signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for a data stream of the first user of the two users, that is, SINR 0 , after canceling the interference from the second stream, is provided by equation 304, where the parameters “B”, “E”, “F”, and “D” are described by Equations 305, 306, 307 and 308, respectively, and “ ⁇ ” is a cancellation factor that falls in a range 0 ⁇ 1. Equation 304 is equivalent to equation 311 which is, in turn, dependent upon “ ⁇ ” (equation 312), the normalized covariance of channel response associated with two mobile devices.
- MMSE minimum mean square error
- Equations 313 and 314 represent the SINR associated with the signals of the two users, or mobile devices, without intra-cell user interference.
- a per tone SINR for a data stream of the second user of the two users, that is, SINR 1 is provided by equation 317, where “A” is described by Equation 318. Equation 317 is equivalent to equation 319 which is also dependent upon “ ⁇ ” (equation 312), the normalized covariance of channel response associated with two mobile devices.
- “ ⁇ ” (equation 312) is used to schedule the two least correlated users, or mobile devices, in a same slot.
- Scheduler 113 at base station 106 maintains, and updates at every scheduling instance, a matrix whose (i, j) element corresponds to the “ ⁇ ” (equation 312) between a mobile ‘i’ and a mobile ‘j.’
- scheduler 113 decides which mobile devices to pair together and whether to apply SDMA to the pair of mobile devices, based on a set of SDMA switching conditions. For example, suppose ‘mobile 0’ is scheduled to transmit and ‘mobile 1’ is the paired mobile device. Based on the respective SINR in Equations 311 and 319, mobile 0 and mobile 1 may transmit at the same time (SDMA) when the (first) SDMA switching condition in equation 321 is satisfied.
- SDMA the same time
- Equation 322 is a simplification of equation 321.
- SDMA is applied only when the (second) SDMA switching condition of equation 323 is also satisfied.
- the parameter “ ⁇ ” represents the preset minimum SINR for SDMA. In other words, switching to SDMA occurs if the aggregate SDMA throughput is greater than or equal to the single user maximum available throughput provided that both users are maintained at a minimum required SINR “ ⁇ ” required by equation 323.
- Scheduler 113 may execute a similar search for a ‘mobile 2,’ a ‘mobile 3,’ and so on (sequentially through the list of possible matches).
- scheduler 113 may select mobile 0 for single signal assignment to a sub-channel for UL transmission, that is, to transmit without SDMA; otherwise, the mobile device having the highest total throughput with mobile 0 using SDMA may be paired with mobile 0 and scheduled for UL transmission.
- the aforementioned pairing and scheduling method may be extended to frequency-selective channels by using an averaged or effective SINR to represent the vector of the SINRs over the group of subcarriers.
- One embodiment of computing the effective SINR over subcarriers 1 through N is
- SINR 0 MIMO , SINR 1 MIMO and ⁇ INR 0 MIMO in equations 321, 322 and 323 are replaced by SINR 0,effective MIMO , SINR 1,effective MIMO and ⁇ INR 0,effective MIMO respectively.
- a “global optimized pairing” method/solution two additional pairing algorithms to find an optimal pair of mobile devices to be spatially multiplexed based on channel capacity are described.
- the composite channel matrix from spatial multiplexing of users ‘i’ and ‘j’ may be denoted as shown in equation 326:
- Equation ⁇ ⁇ 327 Equation ⁇ ⁇ 327 )
- ‘m’ and ‘n’ are indices to the two mobile devices being paired, that is, mobile m and mobile ‘n’. Equation 327 depicts a global optimization solution and requires searching every possible pair of mobile devices to find the optimal pair of mobile devices (m,n).
- the next, second step is to find a second, matching mobile ‘n’ (i.e., a second element to complete the pair) for the first mobile ‘m’ found in the first step. That is, the second step is to find a solution, that is, mobile ‘n,’ via equation 330:
- n arg ⁇ ⁇ max j ⁇ [ 1 ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ N ] , j ⁇ m ⁇ log 2 ⁇ det ⁇ ( I + E s N 0 ⁇ H ⁇ ( m , j ) ⁇ H H ⁇ ( m , j ) ) . ( Equation ⁇ ⁇ 330 )
- each sub-carrier may have a different MIMO channel matrix.
- the associated pairing schemes e.g., per-subcarrier pairing
- the optimization object is the aggregated capacity over the multiple sub-carriers.
- Simplification of pairing over multiple sub-carriers may be achieved by using only spatial channel information irrespective the sub-carrier.
- This simplification may be achieved via a feasible assumption that the spatial characteristics are similar across the sub-carriers in the whole band. This assumption is particularly realistic when the antenna array deployed by a base station, such as base station 106 , is a correlated array with one-half wavelength antenna spacing.
- This solution may be referred to as “wide-band pairing” to differentiate this solution from the previously introduced per-sub-carrier pairing.
- Pairing eigen-beams is one implementation of wide-band pairing.
- a correlation matrix may be obtained by averaging the frequency responses over the whole set of sub-carriers (assuming ‘K’ sub-carriers), as illustrated by equations 336, 337:
- R ⁇ ( i ) V ⁇ ( i ) H ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ V ⁇ ( i ) , V ⁇ C Mr ⁇ Mr ( Equation ⁇ ⁇ 337 )
- R is the channel covariance matrix
- V ⁇ C Mr ⁇ Mr describes V as an “Mr ⁇ Mr” (dimensional) channel matrix of eigenvectors of R over complex field C.
- the Eigen-decomposition produces a diagonal matrix, ⁇ , representing the beam gain and a unitary matrix, V(i), each column vector of which represents the spatial channel for an eigen-beam.
- ⁇ representing the beam gain
- V(i) a unitary matrix
- the simplified “global-optimal” solution may be applied, i.e., searching every pair of possible mobile devices, to achieve the best possible performance.
- the previously introduced pairing methods may be applied to these eigen-vector spatial channels to measure the orthogonality between them.
- the eigen-decomposition produces multiple eigen-vectors corresponding to the MIMO channel between one mobile device and the base station, a number of methods may be employed to facilitate the solution.
- a “Maximum Average SINR over all Eigen-Beams (Global Max-SIR WB)” solution also may be considered.
- the previous pairing solution may be enhanced to provide an estimation of a MIMO channel, more relevant in such an environment.
- the previously described Global Max-beam WB pairing algorithm considers the strongest eigen-beam.
- An enhancement of the Global Max-beam WB pairing solution for SDMA transmission considers all incident beams for both users of a pairing by measuring the mutual interference.
- a reasonable metric for measuring the mutual interference is the SINR per each incident eigen-beam, considering the interfering eigen-beams from the other user of a pair of users.
- ⁇ (i,m) the SINR for an m th incident eigen-beam for an i th user. It is worth noting that after eigen-decomposition, the obtained incident eigen-beam from the same i th user no longer constitutes interference. Then ⁇ (i,m) may then be calculated as:
- Equation ⁇ ⁇ 341 The objective function is the total SINR summed up over all eigen-beams from both users, that is,
- FIG. 1 may vary.
- other devices/components may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted.
- the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural or other limitations with respect to the present invention.
- FIG. 2 and FIG. 4 show block error rate (BLER) results for various paring methods.
- SDMA pairing requires knowledge of uplink channels of mobile devices.
- the knowledge of uplink channel may be obtained by an uplink signal, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback signal and/or an uplink sounding signal.
- CQI channel quality indicator
- the average BLER performance (averaged over multiple SDMA mobile devices) is evaluated for pairing algorithms using the non-pairing performance as a baseline.
- a number of SDMA methods are compared, including non-pairing (randomly selecting spatial multiplexing mobile devices), global optimized pairing and Max-Max pairing.
- Partial Usage of Sub-Carriers (PUSC) 5 slots configuration is simulated with both of the spatial multiplexed mobile devices having the same modulation code scheme (MCS) (QPSK with 1 ⁇ 2 coding rate) for both urban macro and urban micro channel. It is worth noting that in the simulation, the channel sounding results are modeled as a frequency domain channel response with added white noise giving 9 dB and 2 dB channel sounding SNR per receive antenna.
- MCS modulation code scheme
- FIG. 2 is a graph 200 illustrating the average BLER of various pairing methods, according to one embodiment of the invention.
- Graph 200 comprises five waveforms illustrating the average BLER for the corresponding methods for UL data transmission.
- a random pairing waveform 201 displays the BLER results for a random signal pairing.
- Graph 200 includes a first Max-Max pairing waveform 202 and a first Global pairing waveform 203 given four (4) users/mobile devices are transmitting data, in both cases.
- graph 200 includes a second Max-Max pairing waveform 204 and a second Global pairing waveform 205 given eight (8) users/mobile devices are transmitting data, in both cases.
- graph 200 the link performance for a two receive antenna configuration is illustrated.
- the average BLER comparing different pairing strategies without modeling the channel response staleness is shown.
- BLER results for random pairing as illustrated by random pairing waveform 201
- intensive/brute-force searching the maximal MIMO capacity achieved by global optimized pairing may be relatively higher than the performance levels achieved by 2 one-dimensional searching (in a “simplified” optimal pairing method).
- the SNR gain between no-pairing and simplified optimal pairing which includes the Max-Max pairing method illustrated via first Max-Max pairing waveform 202 , is 2 dB and an extra 2 dB of gain is obtained for global optimized pairing, as illustrated by first Global pairing waveform 203 .
- first Max-Max pairing waveform 202 and first Global optimized pairing waveform 203 represent a four (4) user/mobile device environment.
- Second Max-Max pairing waveform 204 and second Global optimized pairing waveform 205 represent the eight (8) user/mobile device environment.
- SINR gain of the 8 user/mobile device environment
- channel state staleness arises because the sounding is only performed once every preset number of frames (e.g., 8 times) for each user. Assuming a worst case scenario, all users' channel state has 8 frames delay. In practice, only 8 out of 64 users experience such delay and the other users experience delay varying from less than 1 frame to 8 frames delay depending on the time being scheduled with respect to the timing of sounding.
- the gain of pairing with eight receive antennas is less significant (2 dB for four mobile devices global optimized pairing algorithm). This is due to the fact that the eight receive antenna case has better spatial resolution, which may work on lower spatial separation region than the two receive antenna case. Therefore, the gain by increasing spatial separation by pairing is saturated with a given BLER target. Considering the impact of channel state information (CSI) delay, eight receive antenna is less sensitive to the CSI error, which is also due to the fact that in the eight receive antenna case there is better spatial resolution.
- CSI channel state information
- the supportable sounding SNR for cell edge users is reduced. Assuming 2 dB sounding SNR for the eight receive antenna case and comparing the performance loss (in the case without sounding delay) against a 9 dB sounding SNR case indicates that the degradation due to reduction of sounding SNR is more severe for searching among eight mobile devices with the global-optimal method. This is understandable because finer channel information (achieved by higher sounding SNR) may be only better exploited when the searching population is large and thorough. The performance degradation is around 1 dB, which indicates that 2 dB sounding SNR may provide enough spatial channel information to be exploited by pairing algorithms.
- FIG. 4 is a graph 400 illustrating the average BLER of various pairing methods including an eigen-beam pairing method, according to one embodiment of the invention.
- Graph 400 comprises three waveforms illustrating the average BLER for the corresponding waveforms for UL data transmission, that is, a Global per-tone pairing waveform 401 , a Global Max-beam WB pairing waveform 402 , and a Max-Max per-tone pairing waveform 403 .
- Graph 400 illustrates results for simulations in which eight (8) mobile users are transmitting data, in all cases. The simulation results illustrated within graph 400 use the 2 dB sounding SNR with two receive antennas in an urban macro environment.
- Global Max-beam WB 8 mobile devices For two receive antennas, one simplified OFDM channel pairing scheme, i.e., the maximal capacity over max eigen-beam (referred as Global Max-beam WB 8 mobile devices) is compared with the direct extension schemes.
- the BLER curves show that wide-band pairing achieves similar and even better performance at 10 ⁇ 2 BLER position as the per-tone pairing scheme with greatly reduced complexity.
- Global Max-beam WB pairing waveform 402 indicates better performance than Max-Max per-tone pairing waveform 403 . Similar result trends may be achieved in an eight antenna case.
- the pairing process has a prohibitive complexity when applied to OFDM channels due to the iterations incurred in pairing and the sheer number of sub-carriers, which all require the same searching process.
- Simplifications may be achieved by representing the spatial channel across all sub-carriers with eigen-vectors. There are multiple advantages of doing this simplification.
- the pairing process per sub-carrier over the whole band is reduced to perform a single iteration on eigen-beams and, therefore, a global multiple-dimensional search becomes affordable, which yields the best performance.
- using eigen-vectors to represent the OFDM spatial channel reduces the storage required for scheduling. For the users in the scheduler queue, instead of the spatial channel over all sub-carriers, a single eigen-matrix may be saved.
- optimal pairing may be performed during the scheduling stage if spatial multiplexing is supported on the uplink transmission.
- Channel sounding results may be used as the means to estimate the spatial channel of all users and the spatial channel information is stored using the eigen-decomposition results. For eight receive antennas, maximizing the average SINR may achieve the best performance, while for two receive antennas, maximizing capacity using the max eigen-beam per users may achieve reasonable performance.
- performance results indicate that significant improvement on sector throughput and even greater improvement on user throughput may be achieved when using optimal pairing over random pairing with a 1 ⁇ 3 ⁇ 3 frequency reuse scheme (FRS) for UL transmissions (e.g., File Transfer Protocol (FTP)).
- FTP File Transfer Protocol
- the optimal pairing significantly reduces the HARQ retransmissions.
- the improvement of optimal pairing is significantly less with a 1 ⁇ 4 ⁇ 2 FRS than the 1 ⁇ 3 ⁇ 3 FRS since the system having the 1 ⁇ 4 ⁇ 2 FRS is more affected by other cell interference.
- the gain of optimal pairing is most significant when the system is fully loaded, i.e., when the transmission frame is fully utilized and the cross user interference is dominant.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating a method by which the above processes of the illustrative embodiments are completed.
- the method illustrated in FIG. 5 may be described with reference to components shown in FIGS. 1-4 , it should be understood that this is merely for convenience and alternative components and/or configurations thereof can be employed when implementing the various methods. Key portions of the methods may be completed by ULS utility 110 executing within system 100 ( FIG. 1 ) and controlling specific operations of/on system 100 , and the method is thus described from the perspective of either/both ULS utility 110 and system 100 .
- the process of FIG. 5 begins at initiator block 501 and proceeds to block 502 , at which channel response estimator 112 determines the estimated uplink channel transfer function based on uplink signals, such as a CQI feedback signal, corresponding to the signal paths of a number (“L”) of users, such as user u 101 , user 1 102 , and user v 103 .
- each of the ‘L’ users transmits information signals that are received by the multiple ‘M’ antennas of a receiving base station, that is, base station 106 .
- ULS utility 110 computes a normalized pairing metric which allows a UL scheduler, such as UL scheduler 113 , to select a compatible set of signal pairings for UL collaborative SDMA.
- a ULS utility such as ULS utility 110 , initiates a decision as to whether to employ UL SDMA or single user UL transmission.
- the decision concerning whether to employ 2-user UL SDMA or single user UL transmission is determined by the outcome(s) of a number of channel capacity evaluations. These evaluations are based on mathematical models/equations which predicts/estimates (1) the aggregate throughput of each one of two signals combined as a candidate pairing for application within SDMA and (2) the single user maximum available throughput. A major component of the mathematical equations is the computed ⁇ values, i.e., the cross user interference. Selecting a candidate pair for SDMA is decided if the aggregate SDMA throughput is greater than or equal to the single user maximum available throughput, as illustrated by equation 322. In addition, SDMA is applied only when both users are maintained at the minimum required SINR, as illustrated by equation 323.
- satisfaction of the conditions expressed within equations 322 and 323 enable the user signals to be applied for UL SDMA.
- a qualification for UL SDMA may not definitively determine the actual user pairings.
- a particular user for example, user 1
- user 1 may be paired with multiple different signals and may be able to satisfy equations 322 and 323.
- user 1 may be regarded as a ‘layer 0’ user and the various potential matches are the ‘layer 1’ co-user options.
- the final SDMA and pair decision is made by picking a particular ‘layer 1’ user such that the combined throughput of this ‘layer 1’ user and the ‘layer 0’ user is maximized.
- equations 322 and 323 are not satisfied for a pair of users, each of the users may separately contend for UL SDMA with other co-user options. A failure of a particular pairing to satisfy equations 322 and 323 simply prevents that particular pairing to be applied together for UL SDMA. If each user continues to fail the qualifying conditions with all other pairing options, the users signals may be prevented from employing UL SDMA and instead may be transmitted via UL SIMO.
- ULS utility 110 determines whether one or more user signals qualify for UL SDMA. If at block 505 , ULS utility 110 determines that one or more user signals do not qualify for UL SDMA, the process proceeds to block 506 , at which ULS utility 110 assigns only one user to a particular time-frequency resource for UL transmission. Following block 506 , the process proceeds to block 509 . If, at block 505 , ULS utility 110 determines that one or more user signals qualify for UL SDMA, the process proceeds to block 507 , at which ULS utility 110 applies a pairing method to users that qualify for SDMA pairing.
- ULS utility 110 selects the final pairings for UL SDMA.
- ULS utility 110 factors any other priority considerations, for example, quality of service (QoS) requirements, into the selection of the final pairings.
- the selected SDMA signal pairs and SIMO signals utilize the appropriate time-frequency resources, that is, OFDM symbols and sub-carriers, and are detected at a number of antennas at receiver 107 , as shown at block 509 .
- detector 117 of receiver 107 is able to efficiently recover transmitted SIMO signals and SDMA signals from received signals.
- Detector 117 is able to distinguish each of the individual signals in the SDMA pairing as a result of the selection process utilized by ULS utility 110 which pairs signals which have a clear spatial distinction.
- the process ends at block 511 .

Abstract
Description
x=Hs+n, (Equation 1).
For users utilizing multiple (“K”) subcarriers, the “Φ-matrix” can be defined as an average over the “K” subcarriers.
where each entry hi,j is the complex channel gain from a jth transmit antenna, that is, a jth user, to an ith receive antenna. This flat channel, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) model may be applied to each sub-carrier in the uplink. The variance of the received noise including interference satisfies
Then the optimal pairing (for a multiplexing order of 2) may be expressed as shown in equation 327:
where ‘m’ and ‘n’ are indices to the two mobile devices being paired, that is, mobile m and mobile ‘n’.
H(i)=[h 1,i h 2,i . . . h Mr,i]T (Equation 328)
as the channel vector for an ith user, or mobile, a mobile ‘m’ with the highest SIMO capacity is obtained via equation 329:
then the optimization problem can be expressed as:
where “R” is the channel covariance matrix and VεCMr×Mr describes V as an “Mr×Mr” (dimensional) channel matrix of eigenvectors of R over complex field C. As indicated by
{tilde over (H)}(i)=√{square root over (λmax(i))}V max(i) (Equation 338),
a channel matrix for the ith and jth users may be constructed as
{tilde over (H)}(i,j)=[{tilde over (H)}(i) {tilde over (H)}(j)] (Equation 339).
Then the solution for the mobile pairing may be expressed as:
The objective function is the total SINR summed up over all eigen-beams from both users, that is,
Then the optimization solution may be expressed as follows:
