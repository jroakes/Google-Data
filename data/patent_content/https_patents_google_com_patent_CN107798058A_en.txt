The capacity of orientation of disclosed one or more aspects can take many forms, and can use in many ways.In addition, to the greatest extent
One or more examples described in the pipe disclosure are contemplated that the information of orientation and/or offer on upcoming event,
In other examples, system 100 can provide the information on topic, people, concept, entity, past event or other themes.Separately
Outside, in some instances, orientation module 262 can determine that identified interest is not enough to show to the emerging of international sports event
Interest, and in such an example, the orientation module 262 of computing system 200 can based on the interest identified to prevent to access, it is raw
Into, access, and/or output information.
Therefore, by identification may be interested in upcoming event user when use according to described mode
Experience or mass survey information, computing system 200 be able to can be avoided to multi-user excessively --- particularly to upcoming event
Those uninterested users --- send the information on the event.Therefore, computing system 200 can avoid making not feel information
The user of interest diverts one's attention, and in addition, computing system 200 can avoid passing through send user be not desired to receive information and waste the use
The time at family.In addition, by the way that to the information is sent to the uninterested user of information, computing system 200 is executable not to be grasped less
Make, and as a result, consume less electric power.In addition, by not sending the information to the user of the interest to information not, calculate
System 200 can perform less network operation, and consume less Internet resources as a result.
In addition, by identification may be interested in upcoming event user when believed using experience or mass survey
Breath, computing system 200 can more likely identify --- rather than None- identified --- to receiving the letter on upcoming event
Cease user interested.Therefore, computing system 200 can more likely to need, it is expected, pay attention to or may be otherwise
The user for benefiting from information provides the information.In addition, computing system 200 may also be able to prevent user or one or more calculate from setting
Standby 300 make extra work.For example, if computing device 300C user final will seek on will in international sports event
The information of the race of arrival, receiving the information in an automated manner in the case of without requiring information from the angle of the user is
It is easier.In addition, by providing the information in the case of the input without solicited message, at least due to processing can be avoided to use
The calculating and network operation that family is made needed for input, computing device 300C is executable less to be calculated and network operation.Therefore, such as
Fruit computing device 300 performs less calculate and operated, then computing device 300 can consume less electric power.Also, if computing device
300 perform less network operation, then less data can be transmitted by network, so as to which the influence to Internet resources or congestion is less.
In addition, by using mass survey information come identify may with have to the great interest of event the interest of correlation or
Entity and such information is incorporated in orientation algorithm, computing system 200 be able to can be identified accurately in an automated manner
User interested in event.As a result, it can avoid determining other effort of appropriate targeting criteria --- such as marketing personnel institute
Those effort performed.Marketing or such effort for making of other staff be not only it is subjectivity, time-consuming and expensive, and
And such effort is usually finally inaccurate, because some targeting criterias are probably anti-intuition or are difficult to what is expected.For
Infrequently or of short duration event, such effort is possibly even more difficult, because it is emerging to be directly related to calculating for such event
Interest (for example, based on search or browsing activity) is probably rare.
