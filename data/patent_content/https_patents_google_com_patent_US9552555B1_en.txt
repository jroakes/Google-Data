- mechanisms for recommending content items such as video content items and channels that provide video content items, using topics are provided.
- These content items and channels can be presented by a content hosting service (e.g., a video hosting service) or any other suitable content database.
- a content hosting service e.g., a video hosting service
- one or more topics associated with each of the content items can be determined.
- a channel in some embodiments, is a group of videos or video content items from a particular source. In another embodiment, a channel is a group of videos or video content items with a common attribute, such as a source, a topic, a date, etc.
- a user interest profile can be accessed to determine which content items have been accessed by the user. For example, in response to logging into a user account, a content hosting service can associate and store information relating to content items that have been accessed by the user in a user interest profile.
- the user interest profile can also include user interactions with the content items, such as pausing, fast forwarding, rewinding a particular content item, rating a particular content item, sharing a particular content item, the amount of time a particular content item is watched, etc.
- a user access log can be accessed to determine which content items have been accessed by the user.
- the topics associated with each of the content items can be determined from the user interest profile.
- topics can be derived from metadata associated with a content item (e.g., genre, category, title, actor, director, description, etc.).
- a content database e.g., a video database
- a knowledgebase can be queried to determine, for each accessed content item, the topics associated with each content item and/or other suitable topic information (e.g., an interest weight associated with each topic).
- a model of user interests can be generated using one or more machine learning techniques.
- the model of user interests derived using machine learning techniques can be used, for example, in conjunction with linear regression to provide predictions or probabilities of the likelihood that the user accesses or watches a particular content item or a particular channel that presents particular content items.
- By ranking content items based on the determined probabilities, a subset of content items or channels presenting content items can be selected for recommending to the user.
- a model of user interests can be generated using a machine learning approach, where a subset of topics, such as the top K topics, from a user interest profile can be determined and a conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items associated with a content hosting service can be determined.
- a model of user interests can be generated by using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach to create topic clusters of related topics, where a user interest profile of topics can be mapped to one or more topic clusters and a conjunction of those topic clusters and the content items associated with a content hosting service can be determined.
- a model of user interests can be generated using vector clustering approaches.
- these mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications. For example, these mechanisms can allow a content hosting service, using these models of user interests, to propagate interests in a content item or a channel that presents content items from a single user or a group of users to other users, thereby generalizing the content recommendation system beyond the preferences of a single user. In another example, these mechanisms can allow a content hosting service to recommend content items or a channel that presents content items to a user that is unaware of the availability of such a content item or channel.
- these content recommendation mechanisms can be implemented in a product search domain or commerce domain, where one or more topics associated with a user are determined from product metadata relating to products viewed by a user and a model of user interests is generated based on those topics.
- these content recommendation mechanisms can be implemented in a music search domain, where one or more topics associated with a user are determined from structured music metadata relating to media accessed by the user and a model of user interests can be generated based on those topics.
- the content recommendation mechanisms can be used in any suitable recommendation system for providing recommended content items.
- FIG. 1 is a flow chart of an illustrative process 100 for providing a content recommendation system that recommends content items based on topics in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- Process 100 can begin by determining the content items that have been accessed by a user. For example, in response to detecting that a user has logged into a content hosting service (e.g., by entering a username and password), information relating to the content items that the user has accessed can be stored in a user interest profile.
- the content recommendation system can access the user interest profile to determine the content items that have been accessed by the user.
- the content recommendation system can transmit a query to a user access log associated with the user to determine the content items that have been accessed by the user.
- the content recommendation system can retrieve multiple content identifiers associated with the content items accessed by the user (e.g., video identifiers, such as “video_id:1234,” that are associated with each video watched by the user).
- the users can be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about content items accessed by a user, a user's interactions with content items, a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about content items accessed by a user, a user's interactions with content items, a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, zip code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- the content recommendation system can determine one or more topics associated with each of the content items accessed by the user. For example, a video content item relating to the supernova SN_1987A can have the topics “SN_1987A” and “astronomy.”
- the user interest profile can include the content items accessed by the user and a list of the one or more topics associated with each of the content items accessed by the user.
- each content item on a content hosting service can be annotated with entities or topics created by a content source.
- the topics associated with the content items can be created by a community of users in a collaborative knowledgebase, such as Freebase.
- the topics associated with the content items can be generated based on content metadata, such as unique terms derived from video titles, actor names, character names, director names, genres or category information, etc.
- the content recommendation system can transmit a query to a content database (e.g., a video database, a knowledgebase having entity information or topic information, etc.) to determine, for each of the accessed content items, the topics associated with each content item.
- a content database e.g., a video database, a knowledgebase having entity information or topic information, etc.
- the topics associated with a content item can be stored along with other metadata associated with the content item.
- the topics and/or other information relating to the topics can be stored in a separate database.
- an interest weight can be associated with each topic.
- a topic corresponding to an accessed content item can be associated with an interest weight that represents the strength or degree of association of the topic for a given content item.
- the interest profile can, in some embodiments, be represented as a weighted sum of all of the topics associated with the content items accessed by the user.
- the interest weight for a particular topic in a user interest profile can be a product, sum, average, or other arithmetic function of the interest weight normalized by the frequency of the topic in the user interest profile.
- the interest weight for the topic “astronomy” can be high in comparison to the interest weights associated with other topics when the topic “astronomy” is a frequent topic of content items accessed by the user.
- the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using one or more machine learning techniques at 130 .
- a feature can be represented by feature-value pairs—i.e., a feature template and a feature value.
- the feature for a particular video content item can have the value “1234” or video_id:1234.
- the feature video_id:1234 can model the global popularity of a video content item having the video identifier “1234.” When used by itself, such a model determines the probability that a user watches the video content item having the video identifier “1234.”
- a feature can be used to model a channel (channel_id).
- the feature channel_id:ABC123 can model the global popularity that a user watches video content items presented by the channel having the channel identifier “ABC123.” Again, when used by itself, such a model determines the probability that a user watches video content items presented by the channel having the channel identifier “ABC123.”
- user modeling can include one or more input features relating to the user.
- a user feature such as user_id
- the feature user_id:XYZ can determine the probability that a user having a user identifier “XYZ” watches any video content item provided by a video hosting service.
- a model for a more discerning user can, for example, determine that the probability that the user accesses any content item provided by a content hosting service is low.
- Another input feature relating to the user can include a geographical location.
- a user feature such as user_geo
- the feature user_geo:GBR can determine the probability that users located in Great Britain (GBR) watch any video content item provided by a video hosting service.
- features can be used in conjunction with other features, where the conjunction is sometimes referred to herein as the symbol.
- a covariance matrix can be generated by taking the outer product between the features—e.g., the sum of the products of the values associated with the features over different instances or sub-portions.
- the user feature user_geo for geographical location can be used in conjunction with the feature channel_id for a particular channel to model regional preferences (e.g., USA, GBR, CAN, etc.) for the particular channel or channels.
- the feature template can be represented by “user_geo channel_id.”
- One illustrative instance of the conjunction can be “user_geo:GBR channel_id:ABC123,” which models the likelihood that a user from Great Britain (GBR) watches a video content item presented by a channel having a channel identifier “ABC123.”
- these input features and conjunctions can be used to model users. More particularly, upon determining the list of entities and topics that a user has shown interest based on viewing history (e.g., the content items accessed by the user, the content items watched for a substantial period of time by the user, the content items that the user has provided a favorable indication, the content items that the user has shared with other users, etc.), the content recommendation system can use various input features and conjunctions to generate an interest model for a user using one or more machine learning techniques.
- viewing history e.g., the content items accessed by the user, the content items watched for a substantial period of time by the user, the content items that the user has provided a favorable indication, the content items that the user has shared with other users, etc.
- FIGS. 2-5 Illustrative examples of the one or more machine learning techniques that can be used to generate a model of user interests are described herein in connection with FIGS. 2-5 .
- the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using a direct interest modeling approach. For example, the content recommendation system can determine a subset of topics in a user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items associated with a content hosting service.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for modeling user interests using a subset of topics (e.g., top K topics) based on an associated interest weight in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- the content recommendation system can access a user interest profile of topics associated with the user.
- the topics can be based on the content item accessed by the user and, in some implementations, an interest weight can be associated with each of the topics in the user interest profile. For example, an interest weight for the topic “science” can be high compared to other interest weights in response to determining that the user associated with the user interest profile watches a substantial number of video content items that are annotated with the topic “science.”
- the content recommendation system can determine a subset of topics from the multiple topics in the user interest profile. In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can determine the subset of topics based on the associated interest weight. For example, the content recommendation system can determine the top fifty topics in the user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the top fifty topics and the content items provided by the content hosting service. In another example, the content recommendation system can select a particular subset of topics from the user interest profile based on whether the associated interest weight is greater than a particular threshold value. In such an example, the threshold value can be determined such that at least a given number of topics have been selected. Additionally or alternatively, the threshold value can be adjusted by an administrative user using the content recommendation system (e.g., after inspecting the data, after inspecting the associated interest weights, etc.).
- the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items provided by the content hosting service to model the interaction of user interests and content items. For example, given a set of feature vectors representing a subset of topics, a model can be generated that indicates the probability that the user associated with the user interest profile watches a content item.
- a video content item having a video identifier “567” (video_id:567) relates to astronomy and users with the topic “science” (user_topic:science) in their user interest profile watch or are highly likely to watch the video content item, the instance for the conjunction “user_topic:science video_id:567” can have a high weight or probability value.
- the embodiments described herein generally relate to determining the conjunction between content items and a topic, a topic cluster, or any other suitable representation derived from topic information, this is merely illustrative.
- the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction between topics (e.g., user topics) and a particular channel (e.g., channel_id) to model the interaction of user interests and a particular channel.
- This conjunction can be represented as, for example, “user_topic channel_id.”
- the illustrative example shown in FIG. 2 accesses a user interest profile associated with a user and generates a model of user interests based on at least a portion of the topics from the user interest profile
- any suitable number of user interest profiles can be used.
- the content recommendation system can determine that a user has similar interests to a group of users.
- the content recommendation system can access the user interest profiles associated with the user and each user in the group of users and determine a subset of topics that are common to the multiple users and that have interest weights greater than a particular threshold value. This subset of topics can then be used in conjunction with content items that are provided by the content hosting service.
- the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using a topic clustering approach. For example, the content recommendation system can identify one or more topic clusters of related topics that are similar to the topics included in a user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the one or more topic clusters and the content items associated with a content hosting service. As opposed to directly modeling the topics associated with a user in a user interest profile, the content recommendation system can map the topics in the user interest profile to one or more topic clusters and generate an interest model based on the topic clusters.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for modeling user interests using topic clusters in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- the content recommendation system can access a user interest profile of topics associated with the user.
- the topics can be based on the content items accessed by the user and, in some implementations, an interest weight can be associated with each of the topics in the user interest profile.
- the content recommendation system can determine, for each topic, one or more related topics. Any suitable approach can be used for determining related topics. For example, the content recommendation system can use the co-occurrence of topics in user interest profiles to determine which topics are related to each other. In this example, the content recommendation system can determine across multiple user interest profiles (e.g., all of the user interest profiles in the content hosting service), pairs of topics that co-occur in at least a portion of the user interest profiles, and determine a measure of co-occurrence or any other suitable distance measure. The distance measure can, for example, indicate how often video content items on two co-occurring topics have been accessed by a user.
- the distance measure can, for example, indicate how often video content items on two co-occurring topics have been accessed by a user.
- the content recommendation system can determine related topics by querying an alternate source that specifies relationships between entities or topics, such as a knowledgebase (e.g., Freebase). For example, in response to transmitting a query that includes a topic (e.g., topic: SN_1987A) to a knowledgebase, the content recommendation system can receive a related topic graph that includes a set of related topic nodes and distance measures between the various nodes. The content recommendation can use the related topic graph for determining topic clusters, where neighboring nodes to a topic node are semantically more related than nodes with larger distance measure from the topic node.
- a knowledgebase e.g., Freebase
- the content recommendation system can cluster each topic with one or more related topics based on the distance measure.
- the content recommendation system can create topic clusters using any suitable clustering approaches, such as a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach.
- the content recommendation system can identify the topic clusters having a distance measure less than a given threshold value (e.g., grouping topics together that are closer in distance) and combine the two or more topics into a topic cluster.
- the content recommendation system can generate an interest weight for the topic cluster.
- the interest weight for the topic cluster can combine the interest weights associated with each of the topics by, for example, adding, multiplying, averaging, or applying another arithmetic or statistical function on the interest weights.
- the interest weight for the topic cluster can be normalized by, for example, the frequency of the co-occurring topics in the user interest profiles.
- the content recommendation system can map the user interest profile (that includes topics associated with content items accessed by the user) with the topic clusters to determine user cluster features. For example, the content recommendation system can determine a topic cluster corresponding to each topic in the user interest profile. As a result, the content recommendation system can determine multiple topic clusters of related topics for association with a user interest profile.
- topic clusters can be stored in the user interest profile as opposed to the topics associated with content items accessed by the user.
- topics associated with content items accessed by the user and topic clusters can be stored in the user interest profile.
- the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of the user cluster features (e.g., the topic clusters associated with the user interest profile) with content items provided by a content hosting service. That is, the content recommendation system can generate a matrix or any other suitable data representation that provides probabilities that a user of a user interest profile watches content items based on the user cluster features. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the content recommendation system can select a subset of user cluster features for modeling user interests (e.g., the topic clusters that have an interest weight greater than a particular threshold value, the topic cluster that has the highest interest weight, etc.).
- the user cluster features e.g., the topic clusters associated with the user interest profile
- the content recommendation system can select a subset of user cluster features for modeling user interests (e.g., the topic clusters that have an interest weight greater than a particular threshold value, the topic cluster that has the highest interest weight, etc.).
- the content recommendation system can also determine the conjunction between user cluster features and a particular channel (e.g., channel_id) to model the interaction of user interests and a particular channel.
- This conjunction can be represented as, for example, “user_clustered_topic channel_id.”
- the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using unsupervised decision trees. For example, the content recommendation system can generate a decision tree that identifies user interest profiles having similar topics and determine the conjunction of the topics shared by those user interest profiles and the content items associated with a content hosting service. This can, for example, model the collective interests or topics of users whose user interest profiles are grouped in the same leaf node.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for modeling user interests using a decision tree that groups or clusters user interest profiles having similar topics in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- the content recommendation system can access a user interest profile of topics associated with the user. As described above, the topics are based on the content items accessed by the user.
- the content recommendation system can access other user interest profiles (e.g., all of the user interest profiles in the content hosting service), where each user interest profile includes topics associated with the content items accessed by that user.
- user interest profiles e.g., all of the user interest profiles in the content hosting service
- a vector clustering approach such as a k-means approach, can be used to form a community of user interest profiles. It should be noted that, in some implementations, the content recommendation system can replace the Euclidean distance calculation in the vector clustering approach with a dot product calculation.
- a decision tree can be constructed that determines the similarities between a user interest profile and other interest profile. The content recommendation system can use a decision tree algorithm in which user interest profiles are stored based on topic feature values so that nodes of the decision tree represent a feature that is being classified and branches of the tree represent a value that the node may assume. Results may be classified by traversing the decision tree from the root node through the tree and sorting the nodes using their respective values.
- a binary decision tree can be constructed such that, at any node, if the dot product between the node and the user interest profile is non-zero, the node is placed under a right sub-tree. Otherwise, the left child is chosen and the node is placed under a left sub-tree.
- a top level or root node can contain the topics “Backyard Wrestling,” “Wrestling,” and “Beer.” If any user interest profile contains one or more of the topics in the top level node, the user interest profile is placed under the right sub-tree. This can, for example, partition user interest profiles into clusters that tend to contain users with similar interests and similar topics. In some embodiments, the nodes placed under the left sub-tree can be removed or otherwise excluded from generating the model of user interests.
- the content recommendation system can select a splitting node such that the population between right nodes and left nodes is generally balanced.
- the content recommendation system can obtain the portion of the decision tree that includes similar user interest profiles and determine the conjunction of this portion of the decision tree and the content items provided by a content hosting service. For example, the content recommendation system can use the right sub-tree of the decision tree to create a feature that models the collective interests of users having user interest profiles that are clustered in the same leaf node. The content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of topics in the user interest profiles of a group of users in the same leaf node and the content items provided by a content hosting service. In a more particular example, this conjunction can be represented as “unsupervised_decision_tree_leaf video_id” or “unsupervised_decision_tree_leaf channel_id.”
- one or more aspects of the decision tree described above in connection with FIG. 4 can be constructed using any suitable iterative process.
- a structure of the decision tree can be selected in an initial iteration and tested against training data from user interest profiles. The results of such testing with training data can be used to generate another structure of the decision tree in another iteration.
- the content recommendation system can model user interests using a boosted decision tree that jointly clusters content features and user. For example, the content recommendation system can determine that users interested in classical music (e.g., from the user interest profile, from preferences inputted by the user, etc.) are likely to watch video content items associated with the topic “Mozart” (topic: Mozart) but only if the sound track provided in the video content items is high quality or high fidelity.
- classical music e.g., from the user interest profile, from preferences inputted by the user, etc.
- a boosting approach can be used to build a strong classifier by combining multiple weak classifiers and a boosted decision tree approach can be a combination of the decision tree approach and the boosting approach.
- the content recommendation system can use a boosted decision tree approach, where the above-mentioned k-means clustering approach is used to split user interest profiles into a right sub-tree of similar user interest profiles and a left sub-tree of other user interest profiles.
- the content recommendation system can use the leaf node of similar user interest profiles as weak learners.
- the content recommendation system can then apply user features for training.
- the quality of an audio track in a video content item can be used to train a joint model of user and content features.
- user features can be used to filter out candidate content items to recommendation to the user (e.g., a particular content item includes a low-quality audio track that would not be of interest to the user).
- the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests by mapping content items and topics into a multi-dimensional space. For example, in some implementations, the content recommendation system can generate a decision tree that identifies user interest profiles having similar topics and determine the conjunction of the topics shared by those user interest profiles and the content items associated with a content hosting service.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an illustrative process for modeling user interests using latent embedding, where multiple topics and multiple content items are mapped into a multi-dimensional space and a user interest model is trained such that a loss or error function is minimized, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- the content recommendation system can map each topic of a plurality of topics into a multi-dimensional space.
- each topic can be initially assigned a random location in a 64th-dimensional space.
- the number of dimensions e.g., 64
- the number of dimensions of the multi-dimensional embedding space can be determined based upon any suitable criterion, such as available computing resources, size of the training database, etc.
- the content recommendation can also map each content feature of a plurality of content features into the multi-dimensional space.
- mapping functions that map each type of data item to the joint embedding space can be learned at 530 .
- the content recommendation system can iteratively select sets of embedded training items and determine if the distances between the selected items based on the current location in the joint embedding space corresponds to the known relationships between those items.
- an error function such as a hinge ranking loss function
- a and B are topics associated with a user interest profile, the dot product of A and B is closer than another topic, C. This can be represented, for example, as: A′*w ⁇ B′*w>A′*w ⁇ C′*w +margin Otherwise, the mappings and locations of the topics in the multi-dimensional space are adjusted such that their locations relate to each other are improved.
- an error function can be calculated such that if A is a topic associated with a video content item V and C is another topic that is not associated with the video content item V, the dot product of topic A and video content item V is closer than topic C and video content item V.
- This can be represented, for example, as: A′*w ⁇ V′*w>C′*w ⁇ V′*w
- examples of functions that may be used as the error function in the training phase include the standard margin ranking loss (AUC) function and the weighted approximate-ranked pairwise (WARP) loss function.
- AUC standard margin ranking loss
- WARP weighted approximate-ranked pairwise
- the content recommendation system can use a WARP function to select negative examples, such as topic C. That is, samples are drawn at random, and a gradient step can be made for each sample to minimize loss. Due to the cost of computing the exact rank, the content recommendation system can approximate the exact rank by sampling. For a given positive label, the content recommendation system draws negative labels until a violating label is found, where the rank is then approximated.
- the content recommendation system can obtain a trained joint embedding space.
- the content recommendation system can access a user interest profile of topics associated with the user.
- the topics can be based on the content items accessed by the user.
- the content recommendation system can project the topics from the user interest profile into the trained joint embedding space.
- the new items including the topics from the user interest profile can be embedded in the trained joint embedding space at a location determined upon the learned mapping function for topics.
- One or more associations between the newly embedded item and the previously embedded items can be determined based on a distance measure.
- the content recommendation system can apply one or more techniques, such as Principal component analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM), to determine content items that are close in proximity.
- PCA Principal component analysis
- SVD Singular Value Decomposition
- GMM Gaussian mixture modeling
- the content recommendation system can use the learned joint embedding space to determine user preference for a topic, a video, or a channel. For example, the content recommendation system can project these items into the joint embedding space and calculate the dot product. In this example, the higher the dot product indicates a higher likelihood that the user associated with the user interest profile watches a particular content item or a channel that provides content items.
- the content recommendation system can provide a predictive model of user interests that can be used to determine a recommendation of one or more content items to a user. Based on features relating to topics and features relating to content items, the predictive model can determine a set of probabilities that represents the interaction between user interests and content items. For example, if a video content item relates to astronomy and users with the topic “science” in their user interest profile watch or are highly likely to watch the video content item, the instance for the conjunction of the topic and the video content item can have a high weight or probability value.
- the content recommendation system can rank multiple content items based on their determined probabilities at 150 .
- the content recommendation system can use the model of user interests to generate a ranked list of candidate video items.
- the content recommendation system can use the model of user interests to generate a list of candidate video items sorted by watch probability and then re-rank the list using additional criteria, such as view count, ratings, recency (e.g., upload date), sharing activity, etc.
- the content recommendation system can select a subset of the content items from the ranked list to recommend to the user. For example, upon determining content items accessed by the user (e.g., using a user interest profile), determining topics associated with the accessed content items, generating a model of user interests based on the determined topics, and generating a list of content items that are ranked by watch probabilities derived using the model, the content recommendation system can select a particular number of content items from the ranked list to recommend to the user.
- a content hosting service can indicate a number of recommendations that can be provided on an interface. As shown in FIG.
- the content hosting service can request that a particular number of recommended content items (e.g., eight) are provided in region 610 .
- a particular number of recommended content items e.g., eight
- any suitable information can be displayed to provide the user with the recommended content items—e.g., a thumbnail or image, a title or a portion of a title, and/or a playback time associated with the recommended content item.
- the content recommendation system can determine whether one or more of the content items in the ranked list have been previously accessed by the user. For example, the content recommendation system can inhibit the recommendation of a content item that has been previously watched by the user (e.g., based on information from a user access log). In another example, the content recommendation system can adjust the ranking associated with the previously watched content item (e.g., lower the ranking of the previously watched content).

Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/731,266, filed on Dec. 31, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
Methods, systems, and media for recommending content items based on topics are provided. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to recommending content items by modeling user interest profiles that are based on content consumption.
Due to an overwhelming volume of content that is available to the average consumer, content hosting services generally attempt to present content that is interesting to its users. Some content hosting services allow users to create user profiles that indicate demographic information, such as gender or age, as well as areas of interest. These content hosting services then attempt to use such user profiles to select content to provide to each of its users. However, users may not be able to articulate their interests while populating a user profile. In addition, interests may change over time and these users may not update their user profiles to reflect such changes.
In accordance with various implementations of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms for recommending content items based on topics are provided.
In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a method for recommending content items is provided, the method comprising: determining, using a hardware processor, a plurality of accessed content items associated with a user, wherein each of the plurality of content items is associated with a plurality of topics; determining, using the hardware processor, the plurality of topics associated with each of the plurality of accessed content items; generating a model of user interests based on the plurality of topics, wherein the model implements a machine learning technique to determine a plurality of weights for assigning to each of the plurality of topics; applying, using the hardware processor, the model to determine, for a plurality of content items, a probability that the user would watch a content item of the plurality of content items; ranking, using the hardware processor, the plurality of content items based on the determined probabilities; and selecting a subset of the plurality of content items to recommend to the user based on the ranked plurality of content items.
In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a system for recommending content items is provided. The system comprising: a hardware processor that is configured to: determine a plurality of accessed content items associated with a user, wherein each of the plurality of content items is associated with a plurality of topics; determine the plurality of topics associated with each of the plurality of accessed content items; generate a model of user interests based on the plurality of topics, wherein the model implements a machine learning technique to determine a plurality of weights for assigning to each of the plurality of topics; apply the model to determine, for a plurality of content items, a probability that the user would watch a content item of the plurality of content items; rank the plurality of content items based on the determined probabilities; and select a subset of the plurality of content items to recommend to the user based on the ranked plurality of content items.
In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a computer-readable medium containing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for recommending content items, is provided. The method comprises: determining a plurality of accessed content items associated with a user, wherein each of the plurality of content items is associated with a plurality of topics; determining the plurality of topics associated with each of the plurality of accessed content items; generating a model of user interests based on the plurality of topics, wherein the model implements a machine learning technique to determine a plurality of weights for assigning to each of the plurality of topics; applying the model to determine, for a plurality of content items, a probability that the user would watch a content item of the plurality of content items; ranking the plurality of content items based on the determined probabilities; and selecting a subset of the plurality of content items to recommend to the user based on the ranked plurality of content items.
Various objects, features, and advantages of the disclosed subject matter can be more fully appreciated with reference to the following detailed description of the disclosed subject matter when considered in connection with the following drawing, in which like reference numerals identify like elements.
Methods, systems, and media for recommending content items using topics are provided.
In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms for recommending content items, such as video content items and channels that provide video content items, using topics are provided. These content items and channels can be presented by a content hosting service (e.g., a video hosting service) or any other suitable content database. In response to determining the content items that have been accessed by a user on a content hosting service, one or more topics associated with each of the content items can be determined.
It should be noted that a channel, in some embodiments, is a group of videos or video content items from a particular source. In another embodiment, a channel is a group of videos or video content items with a common attribute, such as a source, a topic, a date, etc.
It should also be noted that, in some embodiments, a user interest profile can be accessed to determine which content items have been accessed by the user. For example, in response to logging into a user account, a content hosting service can associate and store information relating to content items that have been accessed by the user in a user interest profile. In some embodiments, the user interest profile can also include user interactions with the content items, such as pausing, fast forwarding, rewinding a particular content item, rating a particular content item, sharing a particular content item, the amount of time a particular content item is watched, etc. Additionally or alternatively, a user access log can be accessed to determine which content items have been accessed by the user.
In some embodiments, the topics associated with each of the content items can be determined from the user interest profile. For example, topics can be derived from metadata associated with a content item (e.g., genre, category, title, actor, director, description, etc.). In another example, a content database (e.g., a video database) or a knowledgebase can be queried to determine, for each accessed content item, the topics associated with each content item and/or other suitable topic information (e.g., an interest weight associated with each topic).
Based on one or more of the associated topics, a model of user interests can be generated using one or more machine learning techniques. The model of user interests derived using machine learning techniques can be used, for example, in conjunction with linear regression to provide predictions or probabilities of the likelihood that the user accesses or watches a particular content item or a particular channel that presents particular content items. By ranking content items based on the determined probabilities, a subset of content items or channels presenting content items can be selected for recommending to the user.
It should be noted that any suitable machine learning technique can be used to generate a model of user interests. For example, a model of user interests can be generated using a machine learning approach, where a subset of topics, such as the top K topics, from a user interest profile can be determined and a conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items associated with a content hosting service can be determined. In another example, a model of user interests can be generated by using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach to create topic clusters of related topics, where a user interest profile of topics can be mapped to one or more topic clusters and a conjunction of those topic clusters and the content items associated with a content hosting service can be determined. In yet another example, a model of user interests can be generated using vector clustering approaches.
These mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications. For example, these mechanisms can allow a content hosting service, using these models of user interests, to propagate interests in a content item or a channel that presents content items from a single user or a group of users to other users, thereby generalizing the content recommendation system beyond the preferences of a single user. In another example, these mechanisms can allow a content hosting service to recommend content items or a channel that presents content items to a user that is unaware of the availability of such a content item or channel.
Although the embodiments described herein generally relate to recommending video content items, such as television programs, movies, and video clips, this is merely illustrative. For example, these content recommendation mechanisms can be implemented in a product search domain or commerce domain, where one or more topics associated with a user are determined from product metadata relating to products viewed by a user and a model of user interests is generated based on those topics. In another example, these content recommendation mechanisms can be implemented in a music search domain, where one or more topics associated with a user are determined from structured music metadata relating to media accessed by the user and a model of user interests can be generated based on those topics. Accordingly, the content recommendation mechanisms can be used in any suitable recommendation system for providing recommended content items.
Turning to FIG. 1 , FIG. 1 is a flow chart of an illustrative process 100 for providing a content recommendation system that recommends content items based on topics in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
In situations in which the content recommendation system discussed herein collects personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users can be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about content items accessed by a user, a user's interactions with content items, a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
At 120, the content recommendation system can determine one or more topics associated with each of the content items accessed by the user. For example, a video content item relating to the supernova SN_1987A can have the topics “SN_1987A” and “astronomy.” In another example, the user interest profile can include the content items accessed by the user and a list of the one or more topics associated with each of the content items accessed by the user.
It should be noted that each content item on a content hosting service can be annotated with entities or topics created by a content source. For example, the topics associated with the content items can be created by a community of users in a collaborative knowledgebase, such as Freebase. In another example, the topics associated with the content items can be generated based on content metadata, such as unique terms derived from video titles, actor names, character names, director names, genres or category information, etc. In these examples, the content recommendation system can transmit a query to a content database (e.g., a video database, a knowledgebase having entity information or topic information, etc.) to determine, for each of the accessed content items, the topics associated with each content item.
It should also be noted that the topics associated with a content item can be stored along with other metadata associated with the content item. Alternatively, instead of being stored with the metadata of each content item, the topics and/or other information relating to the topics can be stored in a separate database.
In some embodiments, an interest weight can be associated with each topic. For example, a topic corresponding to an accessed content item can be associated with an interest weight that represents the strength or degree of association of the topic for a given content item. The interest profile can, in some embodiments, be represented as a weighted sum of all of the topics associated with the content items accessed by the user. For example, the interest weight for a particular topic in a user interest profile can be a product, sum, average, or other arithmetic function of the interest weight normalized by the frequency of the topic in the user interest profile. In a more particular example, the interest weight for the topic “astronomy” can be high in comparison to the interest weights associated with other topics when the topic “astronomy” is a frequent topic of content items accessed by the user.
Referring back to FIG. 1 , upon determining the topics associated with each of the content items accessed by the user, the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using one or more machine learning techniques at 130.
Generally speaking, user modeling can include one or more input features. As used herein, a feature can be represented by feature-value pairs—i.e., a feature template and a feature value. For example, the feature for a particular video content item (video_id) can have the value “1234” or video_id:1234. In this example, the feature video_id:1234 can model the global popularity of a video content item having the video identifier “1234.” When used by itself, such a model determines the probability that a user watches the video content item having the video identifier “1234.” In another example, a feature can be used to model a channel (channel_id). In this example, the feature channel_id:ABC123 can model the global popularity that a user watches video content items presented by the channel having the channel identifier “ABC123.” Again, when used by itself, such a model determines the probability that a user watches video content items presented by the channel having the channel identifier “ABC123.”
In some embodiments, user modeling can include one or more input features relating to the user. For example, a user feature, such as user_id, can model the probability that a given user accesses any content item provided by a content hosting service. In a more particular example, the feature user_id:XYZ can determine the probability that a user having a user identifier “XYZ” watches any video content item provided by a video hosting service. It should be noted that a model for a more discerning user can, for example, determine that the probability that the user accesses any content item provided by a content hosting service is low.
Another input feature relating to the user can include a geographical location. For example, a user feature, such as user_geo, can model the probability that users from a particular geographical location watch any content item provided by a content hosting service. In a more particular example, the feature user_geo:GBR can determine the probability that users located in Great Britain (GBR) watch any video content item provided by a video hosting service.
In some embodiments, features can be used in conjunction with other features, where the conjunction is sometimes referred to herein as the
In some embodiments, these input features and conjunctions can be used to model users. More particularly, upon determining the list of entities and topics that a user has shown interest based on viewing history (e.g., the content items accessed by the user, the content items watched for a substantial period of time by the user, the content items that the user has provided a favorable indication, the content items that the user has shared with other users, etc.), the content recommendation system can use various input features and conjunctions to generate an interest model for a user using one or more machine learning techniques.
Illustrative examples of the one or more machine learning techniques that can be used to generate a model of user interests are described herein in connection with FIGS. 2-5 .
Direct Interest Modeling
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using a direct interest modeling approach. For example, the content recommendation system can determine a subset of topics in a user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items associated with a content hosting service.
At 220, the content recommendation system can determine a subset of topics from the multiple topics in the user interest profile. In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can determine the subset of topics based on the associated interest weight. For example, the content recommendation system can determine the top fifty topics in the user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the top fifty topics and the content items provided by the content hosting service. In another example, the content recommendation system can select a particular subset of topics from the user interest profile based on whether the associated interest weight is greater than a particular threshold value. In such an example, the threshold value can be determined such that at least a given number of topics have been selected. Additionally or alternatively, the threshold value can be adjusted by an administrative user using the content recommendation system (e.g., after inspecting the data, after inspecting the associated interest weights, etc.).
At 230, the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of the subset of topics and the content items provided by the content hosting service to model the interaction of user interests and content items. For example, given a set of feature vectors representing a subset of topics, a model can be generated that indicates the probability that the user associated with the user interest profile watches a content item. In this example, if a video content item having a video identifier “567” (video_id:567) relates to astronomy and users with the topic “science” (user_topic:science) in their user interest profile watch or are highly likely to watch the video content item, the instance for the conjunction “user_topic:science
Although the embodiments described herein generally relate to determining the conjunction between content items and a topic, a topic cluster, or any other suitable representation derived from topic information, this is merely illustrative. For example, the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction between topics (e.g., user topics) and a particular channel (e.g., channel_id) to model the interaction of user interests and a particular channel. This conjunction can be represented as, for example, “user_topic
It should also be noted that, although the illustrative example shown in FIG. 2 accesses a user interest profile associated with a user and generates a model of user interests based on at least a portion of the topics from the user interest profile, any suitable number of user interest profiles can be used. For example, the content recommendation system can determine that a user has similar interests to a group of users. In this example, the content recommendation system can access the user interest profiles associated with the user and each user in the group of users and determine a subset of topics that are common to the multiple users and that have interest weights greater than a particular threshold value. This subset of topics can then be used in conjunction with content items that are provided by the content hosting service.
Topic Clustering
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using a topic clustering approach. For example, the content recommendation system can identify one or more topic clusters of related topics that are similar to the topics included in a user interest profile and determine the conjunction of the one or more topic clusters and the content items associated with a content hosting service. As opposed to directly modeling the topics associated with a user in a user interest profile, the content recommendation system can map the topics in the user interest profile to one or more topic clusters and generate an interest model based on the topic clusters.
At 320, the content recommendation system can determine, for each topic, one or more related topics. Any suitable approach can be used for determining related topics. For example, the content recommendation system can use the co-occurrence of topics in user interest profiles to determine which topics are related to each other. In this example, the content recommendation system can determine across multiple user interest profiles (e.g., all of the user interest profiles in the content hosting service), pairs of topics that co-occur in at least a portion of the user interest profiles, and determine a measure of co-occurrence or any other suitable distance measure. The distance measure can, for example, indicate how often video content items on two co-occurring topics have been accessed by a user.
Additionally or alternatively, the content recommendation system can determine related topics by querying an alternate source that specifies relationships between entities or topics, such as a knowledgebase (e.g., Freebase). For example, in response to transmitting a query that includes a topic (e.g., topic: SN_1987A) to a knowledgebase, the content recommendation system can receive a related topic graph that includes a set of related topic nodes and distance measures between the various nodes. The content recommendation can use the related topic graph for determining topic clusters, where neighboring nodes to a topic node are semantically more related than nodes with larger distance measure from the topic node.
At 330, the content recommendation system can cluster each topic with one or more related topics based on the distance measure. For example, the content recommendation system can create topic clusters using any suitable clustering approaches, such as a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach. The content recommendation system can identify the topic clusters having a distance measure less than a given threshold value (e.g., grouping topics together that are closer in distance) and combine the two or more topics into a topic cluster.
In some embodiments, in addition to combining topics into a topic cluster, the content recommendation system can generate an interest weight for the topic cluster. The interest weight for the topic cluster can combine the interest weights associated with each of the topics by, for example, adding, multiplying, averaging, or applying another arithmetic or statistical function on the interest weights. In some embodiments, the interest weight for the topic cluster can be normalized by, for example, the frequency of the co-occurring topics in the user interest profiles.
At 340, upon determining the multiple topic clusters of related topics, the content recommendation system can map the user interest profile (that includes topics associated with content items accessed by the user) with the topic clusters to determine user cluster features. For example, the content recommendation system can determine a topic cluster corresponding to each topic in the user interest profile. As a result, the content recommendation system can determine multiple topic clusters of related topics for association with a user interest profile.
It should be noted that, in some embodiments, topic clusters can be stored in the user interest profile as opposed to the topics associated with content items accessed by the user. Alternatively, topics associated with content items accessed by the user and topic clusters can be stored in the user interest profile.
At 350, the content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of the user cluster features (e.g., the topic clusters associated with the user interest profile) with content items provided by a content hosting service. That is, the content recommendation system can generate a matrix or any other suitable data representation that provides probabilities that a user of a user interest profile watches content items based on the user cluster features. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the content recommendation system can select a subset of user cluster features for modeling user interests (e.g., the topic clusters that have an interest weight greater than a particular threshold value, the topic cluster that has the highest interest weight, etc.).
As described above, the content recommendation system can also determine the conjunction between user cluster features and a particular channel (e.g., channel_id) to model the interaction of user interests and a particular channel. This conjunction can be represented as, for example, “user_clustered_topic
Decision Trees
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests using unsupervised decision trees. For example, the content recommendation system can generate a decision tree that identifies user interest profiles having similar topics and determine the conjunction of the topics shared by those user interest profiles and the content items associated with a content hosting service. This can, for example, model the collective interests or topics of users whose user interest profiles are grouped in the same leaf node.
At 420, the content recommendation system can access other user interest profiles (e.g., all of the user interest profiles in the content hosting service), where each user interest profile includes topics associated with the content items accessed by that user.
In some embodiments, a vector clustering approach, such as a k-means approach, can be used to form a community of user interest profiles. It should be noted that, in some implementations, the content recommendation system can replace the Euclidean distance calculation in the vector clustering approach with a dot product calculation. At 430, a decision tree can be constructed that determines the similarities between a user interest profile and other interest profile. The content recommendation system can use a decision tree algorithm in which user interest profiles are stored based on topic feature values so that nodes of the decision tree represent a feature that is being classified and branches of the tree represent a value that the node may assume. Results may be classified by traversing the decision tree from the root node through the tree and sorting the nodes using their respective values. For example, a binary decision tree can be constructed such that, at any node, if the dot product between the node and the user interest profile is non-zero, the node is placed under a right sub-tree. Otherwise, the left child is chosen and the node is placed under a left sub-tree.
In a more particular example, a top level or root node can contain the topics “Backyard Wrestling,” “Wrestling,” and “Beer.” If any user interest profile contains one or more of the topics in the top level node, the user interest profile is placed under the right sub-tree. This can, for example, partition user interest profiles into clusters that tend to contain users with similar interests and similar topics. In some embodiments, the nodes placed under the left sub-tree can be removed or otherwise excluded from generating the model of user interests.
In some embodiments, at 440, the content recommendation system can select a splitting node such that the population between right nodes and left nodes is generally balanced.
At 450, the content recommendation system can obtain the portion of the decision tree that includes similar user interest profiles and determine the conjunction of this portion of the decision tree and the content items provided by a content hosting service. For example, the content recommendation system can use the right sub-tree of the decision tree to create a feature that models the collective interests of users having user interest profiles that are clustered in the same leaf node. The content recommendation system can determine the conjunction of topics in the user interest profiles of a group of users in the same leaf node and the content items provided by a content hosting service. In a more particular example, this conjunction can be represented as “unsupervised_decision_tree_leaf
Boosted Decision Trees
It should be noted that one or more aspects of the decision tree described above in connection with FIG. 4 can be constructed using any suitable iterative process. For example, a structure of the decision tree can be selected in an initial iteration and tested against training data from user interest profiles. The results of such testing with training data can be used to generate another structure of the decision tree in another iteration.
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can model user interests using a boosted decision tree that jointly clusters content features and user. For example, the content recommendation system can determine that users interested in classical music (e.g., from the user interest profile, from preferences inputted by the user, etc.) are likely to watch video content items associated with the topic “Mozart” (topic: Mozart) but only if the sound track provided in the video content items is high quality or high fidelity.
Generally speaking, a boosting approach can be used to build a strong classifier by combining multiple weak classifiers and a boosted decision tree approach can be a combination of the decision tree approach and the boosting approach. For example, the content recommendation system can use a boosted decision tree approach, where the above-mentioned k-means clustering approach is used to split user interest profiles into a right sub-tree of similar user interest profiles and a left sub-tree of other user interest profiles. The content recommendation system can use the leaf node of similar user interest profiles as weak learners. The content recommendation system can then apply user features for training. For example, as described above, the quality of an audio track in a video content item, the quality of a video content item (e.g., resolution), and other user features can be used to train a joint model of user and content features. In another example, user features can be used to filter out candidate content items to recommendation to the user (e.g., a particular content item includes a low-quality audio track that would not be of interest to the user).
Latent Embedding
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can generate a model of user interests by mapping content items and topics into a multi-dimensional space. For example, in some implementations, the content recommendation system can generate a decision tree that identifies user interest profiles having similar topics and determine the conjunction of the topics shared by those user interest profiles and the content items associated with a content hosting service.
At 510, the content recommendation system can map each topic of a plurality of topics into a multi-dimensional space. For example, each topic can be initially assigned a random location in a 64th-dimensional space. It should be noted that the number of dimensions (e.g., 64) can be predetermined. In addition, the number of dimensions of the multi-dimensional embedding space can be determined based upon any suitable criterion, such as available computing resources, size of the training database, etc.
At 520, the content recommendation can also map each content feature of a plurality of content features into the multi-dimensional space.
Upon configuring a joint embedding space that embeds data items including topics and content items, mapping functions that map each type of data item to the joint embedding space can be learned at 530. For example, the content recommendation system can iteratively select sets of embedded training items and determine if the distances between the selected items based on the current location in the joint embedding space corresponds to the known relationships between those items. In a more particular example, an error function, such as a hinge ranking loss function, can be calculated such that if A and B are topics associated with a user interest profile, the dot product of A and B is closer than another topic, C. This can be represented, for example, as:
A′*w·B′*w>A′*w·C′*w+margin
Otherwise, the mappings and locations of the topics in the multi-dimensional space are adjusted such that their locations relate to each other are improved.
A′*w·B′*w>A′*w·C′*w+margin
Otherwise, the mappings and locations of the topics in the multi-dimensional space are adjusted such that their locations relate to each other are improved.
Similar to the topics embedded in the multi-dimensional space, an error function can be calculated such that if A is a topic associated with a video content item V and C is another topic that is not associated with the video content item V, the dot product of topic A and video content item V is closer than topic C and video content item V. This can be represented, for example, as:
A′*w·V′*w>C′*w·V′*w
A′*w·V′*w>C′*w·V′*w
It should be noted that examples of functions that may be used as the error function in the training phase include the standard margin ranking loss (AUC) function and the weighted approximate-ranked pairwise (WARP) loss function. For example, to focus more on the top of a ranked list where the top k positions are of interest, the content recommendation system can use a WARP function to select negative examples, such as topic C. That is, samples are drawn at random, and a gradient step can be made for each sample to minimize loss. Due to the cost of computing the exact rank, the content recommendation system can approximate the exact rank by sampling. For a given positive label, the content recommendation system draws negative labels until a violating label is found, where the rank is then approximated.
In response to learning such that the error function is minimized, the content recommendation system can obtain a trained joint embedding space.
At 540, the content recommendation system can access a user interest profile of topics associated with the user. As described above, the topics can be based on the content items accessed by the user.
At 550, the content recommendation system can project the topics from the user interest profile into the trained joint embedding space. For example, the new items including the topics from the user interest profile can be embedded in the trained joint embedding space at a location determined upon the learned mapping function for topics. One or more associations between the newly embedded item and the previously embedded items can be determined based on a distance measure. For example, the content recommendation system can apply one or more techniques, such as Principal component analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM), to determine content items that are close in proximity.
It should be noted that the content recommendation system can use the learned joint embedding space to determine user preference for a topic, a video, or a channel. For example, the content recommendation system can project these items into the joint embedding space and calculate the dot product. In this example, the higher the dot product indicates a higher likelihood that the user associated with the user interest profile watches a particular content item or a channel that provides content items.
These and other machine learning techniques that train models in an embedding space are further described in, for example, Weston et al., “Web Scale Image Annotation: Learning to Rank with Joint Word-Image Embeddings” and Weston et al., “Large-Scale Music Annotation and Retrieval: Learning to Rank in Joint Semantic Spaces,” which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
Recommending Content Items
The content recommendation system can provide a predictive model of user interests that can be used to determine a recommendation of one or more content items to a user. Based on features relating to topics and features relating to content items, the predictive model can determine a set of probabilities that represents the interaction between user interests and content items. For example, if a video content item relates to astronomy and users with the topic “science” in their user interest profile watch or are highly likely to watch the video content item, the instance for the conjunction of the topic and the video content item can have a high weight or probability value.
Referring back to FIG. 1 , using the model of user interests and the determined watch probabilities, the content recommendation system can rank multiple content items based on their determined probabilities at 150. For example, the content recommendation system can use the model of user interests to generate a ranked list of candidate video items. In another example, the content recommendation system can use the model of user interests to generate a list of candidate video items sorted by watch probability and then re-rank the list using additional criteria, such as view count, ratings, recency (e.g., upload date), sharing activity, etc.
At 160, the content recommendation system can select a subset of the content items from the ranked list to recommend to the user. For example, upon determining content items accessed by the user (e.g., using a user interest profile), determining topics associated with the accessed content items, generating a model of user interests based on the determined topics, and generating a list of content items that are ranked by watch probabilities derived using the model, the content recommendation system can select a particular number of content items from the ranked list to recommend to the user. In a more particular example, a content hosting service can indicate a number of recommendations that can be provided on an interface. As shown in FIG. 7 , upon the completion of watching a video content item in video window 600, the content hosting service can request that a particular number of recommended content items (e.g., eight) are provided in region 610. As also shown, any suitable information can be displayed to provide the user with the recommended content items—e.g., a thumbnail or image, a title or a portion of a title, and/or a playback time associated with the recommended content item.
In some embodiments, the content recommendation system can determine whether one or more of the content items in the ranked list have been previously accessed by the user. For example, the content recommendation system can inhibit the recommendation of a content item that has been previously watched by the user (e.g., based on information from a user access log). In another example, the content recommendation system can adjust the ranking associated with the previously watched content item (e.g., lower the ranking of the previously watched content).
