Abstract
An information retrieval system uses phrases to index, retrieve, organize and describe documents, analyzing documents and storing the results of the analysis as phrase data. Phrases are identified that predict the presence of other phrases in documents. Documents are the indexed according to their included phrases. Related phrases and phrase extensions are also identified. Changes to existing phrase data about a document collection submitted by a user is captured and analyzed, and the existing phrase data is updated to reflect the additional knowledge gained through the analysis.

Technical field
The present invention relates to a kind of for to such as the document produce index of Large Scale Corpus such as internet (Internet), search and the information retrieval system of classifying.
Background technology
The so-called search engine of information retrieval system, nowadays they are a kind of for seeking the basic tool of information such as extensive, diversified also ever-increasing corpus such as internets.In general, search engine creates index so that the individual words that exists in document (or " page ") and each document is relevant.Come searching document in response to an inquiry that contains the multiple queries item, this normally realizes based on the query term that has in the literature some.According to the document graduation of other statistical measures such as the frequency that occurs such as query term, main territory, link analysis to retrieving.Then, usually by the order after graduation, the document that retrieves is presented to the user, and do not carry out any other grouping or enforced classification.In some cases, only present the selected part of document text in order to make the user can understand roughly the content of described document.
Direct " boolean (Boolean) " of query term coupling has well-known restriction, and especially None-identified those do not have query term but have the document of related term.For instance, in typical Boolean system, to can not return to the document about other herding dogs (shepherd dog) (for example, Border Collies (winning shepherd dog)) with definite query term during search " AustralianShepherds (Australian shepherd dog) ".But described system may retrieve usually simultaneously about the document of Australia (Australia) (and with dogs (dog) irrelevant) and document about " shepherds (shepherd dog) ", and these documents are come higher level.
The problem here is that conventional system comes to be the document produce index according to individual term rather than concept.Concept represents with phrase usually, as " Australian Shepherd (Australian shepherd dog) ", " President of the United States (US President) " or " Sundance Film Festival (Sundance Film Festival) " etc.About predetermined and very limited " known " phrase book incompatible establishment literature index, generally by human operator may selected at most by these " known " phrases for some existing system.Because perceive identification by (such as) all possible phrase that forms of three, four or five or more word need to calculate and storer, so usually can avoid the phrase produce index.For instance, if suppose that any five words can consist of a phrase and a large corpus will have at least 200,000 uniquity, will there be approximately 3.2*10 so
26Individual may phrase, this obviously exceeds any existing system can be stored in amount or its amount that can programme in addition and handle in storer.Another problem is that phrase is constantly inputted and can exceed its usage in dictionary, and this individual words newer than invention is much frequent.New phrase always produces from sources such as technology, art, world's event and law.Other phrase will reduce use in time.
Some existing information searching system attempts to provide conceptual retrieval by the pattern that occurs simultaneously with individual words.In these systems, search for a word, for example " President (president) ", with retrieve simultaneously have continually with " President (president) " together with the document of other word (reaching " House (house) " as " White (white) ") of occurring.Although this method may produce the Search Results with the document of conceptually being correlated with on the individual words level, it can't be trapped in the thematic relation that exists between the phrase that occurs simultaneously usually.
Therefore, need a kind of information retrieval system and method, it can identify phrase in Large Scale Corpus all sidedly, according to phrase to the document produce index, according to its phrase search document and document is classified.In addition, need to allow the user other phrase information is provided and captures and the semantic knowledge of integrated gained to system in this system.
Summary of the invention
The present invention relates to a kind of information retrieval system and method, its with phrase to the document produce index in archives, search for, classify and describe.Described system is suitable for identifying those phrases that have enough frequent and/or unique usages in archives to indicate that it is " effectively " or " good " phrase.In this way, can identify many words phrase, for example by four, five or phrase that more form.This has just been avoided necessary identification by each possible phrase of the possible sequence generation of institute of the word of giving determined number and to the problem of its produce index.
This system is further adapted for based on existing the ability of other phrase to identify the phrase that is relative to each other in phrase prediction document.More particularly, utilize the actual while occurrence rate prediction measures relevant to the expection while occurrence rate of these two phrases that makes two phrases.A kind of this type of prediction measures is information gain, as the ratio of reality while occurrence rate with expection while occurrence rate.When prediction measures surpassed a predetermined threshold, two phrases were relevant.In the sort of situation, the second phrase has significant information gain with respect to the first phrase.Semantically, relevant phrases will be those phrases that jointly are used for discussing or describing a given theme or concept, for example " President of the United States (US President) " and " White House (White House) ".For given phrase, relevant phrases can be come sequencing based on its prediction measures separately according to its correlativity or validity.
Information retrieval system is come the document produce index in archives by effective or good phrase.For each phrase, put up list for one and identify the document that those contain described phrase.In addition, for a given phrase, store indication with the second list, vector or other structure and also have the data of which relevant phrases of given phrase in containing each document of described given phrase.In this way, which document is described system not only can easily identify and contain which phrase in response to search inquiry, and can identify which document also contain relevant to query phrase and therefore more may be specifically about the represented theme of query phrase or the phrase of concept.
Use phrase and relevant phrases that the establishment of trooping and the use of relevant phrases further are provided, relevant phrases be clustered in the significant grouping that semantically represents phrase.The relevant phrases that has very high prediction measures between the genitive phrase during trooping is identified and is trooped.Trooping can be used to organize Search Results, comprises selecting Search Results to comprise which document and order thereof, and remove document from Search Results.
The website has usually from several pages to the hundreds of or thousands of pages of possibility.Therefore, the phrase information that information retrieval system produces can be used for the list of the top phrase of definite each website, for example the most representative phrase of website.This can complete by the relevant phrases information that checks the phrase that occurs in the document on the website.In addition, phrase information can be subsequently by capturing the change that keeper or other do the top list of phrases through authorized user and the gained semantic knowledge being integrated in the phrase information that has contained in system and being replenished and become more meticulous.The keeper can be associated any one of the top phrase of other relevant phrases and website.For its relevant phrases information of top phrase that receives other relevant phrases then through upgrading to comprise the information relevant with other relevant phrases, and other relevant phrases is also through upgrading to comprise the information from the top phrase.This operation is to be considered as other phrase as it is present in the website.In addition, other relevant phrases can be through upgrading to use the relevant phrases information of top phrase.
The user interface that the present invention produces at system and software architecture, computer program and computer-implemented method and computing machine and present aspect have other embodiment.
Above only be based on the information retrieval system of phrase and some features of method.The technician of information retrieval field will understand, and the dirigibility of phrase information ubiquity can be widely used and use in produce index, document note, search, graduation and other field of document analysis and processing.

Embodiment
I.
System survey
Referring now to Fig. 1,, it has showed the software architecture of an embodiment of search system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, system comprises authorized index system 100, search system 120, presents system 130 and front-end server 140.
Directory system 110 is responsible for the phrase in the identification document and is come the document produce index with other archives by accessing various websites 190 according to its phrase.Front-end server 140 receives inquiry from the user of user side 170, and provides those inquiries to search system 120.Search system 120 is responsible for the search document (Search Results) relevant to search inquiry, comprises any phrase in the identification search inquiry, then uses the phrase that occurs to classify to affect rank order to the document in Search Results.Search system 120 provides Search Results to presenting system 130.Present system 130 and be responsible for revising Search Results (comprise and remove the document that almost repeats and the subject description that produces document), and modified Search Results is returned to front-end server 140, it offers user side 170 with result.System 100 further comprises for storage about the index 150 of the authorized index information of document with for the phrase data memory storage 160 of storing phrase and ASSOCIATE STATISTICS information.
In the context of the application's case, " document " is interpreted as and can by the media of search engine produce index and any type of retrieving, comprises file of web documents, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or other picture format etc.A document can have the component of one or more pages, subregion, section or other suitable its content and type.Comparably, document can be described as " page ", and it is commonly used to refer to the document on the internet.Use generic term " document " not mean scope of the present invention is carried out any restriction.Search system 100 can operate large document corpus, for example internet and WWW, but it can be used in more limited set equally, for example is used for the archives of library or the private enterprise.Should be appreciated that under arbitrary situation, document is distributed in many different computer systems and website usually.So, do not losing in general situation, no matter form or position (for example, which website or database) are referred to as corpus or archives with document.Each document all has the identifier that is associated of the described document of unique identification; Described identifier is preferably URL, but also can use the identifier (for example, document number) of other type.In the present invention, suppose with URL and identify document.
II.
The authorized index system
In one embodiment, directory system 110 provides the operation of three main functions: 1) identification phrase and relevant phrases, 2) about phrase to the document produce index, and 3) produce and keep the classification based on phrase.Be understood by those skilled in the art that, under the support of conventional authorized index function, authorized index system 110 also will carry out other function, and therefore this paper is not described further these other operations.Index 150 and the data storage bank 160 of 110 pairs of phrase datas of authorized index system operate.Hereinafter further describe these data storage banks.
1.
Phrase identification
" good " and " bad " phrase in the phrase identifying operation identification archives of authorized index system 110, it helps document produce index and search.On the one hand, good phrase is that those often appear in archives the phrase that surpasses in the document of a certain number percent, and/or is designated as has different outward appearances in described document, for example delimits by putting mark label or other form, form or grammatical markers.Good phrase be that it predicts other good phrase on the other hand, and be not only the word sequence that appears in dictionary.For instance, phrase " President of the United States (US President) " is to predict the phrase with other phrases such as " Bill Clinton (bielke Islingtons) " such as " George Bush (George Bush) ".Yet, for example a predictability do not had in other phrase of " fell down the stairs " or " top of the morning ", " out of the blue ", because often occur together with many other different and irrelevant phrases from idiom as these Chinese idiom.Therefore, the phrase cognitive phase determines which phrase has been that phrase and which are bad phrase (that is, lacking predictive ability).
Referring now to Fig. 2,, the phrase identifying has the following functions sexual stage:
200: collect possible and good phrase, and the frequency of described phrase and the statistical value that occurs simultaneously;
202: be phrase or bad phrase based on the frequency statistics value with possible phrase classification;
204: measure to have cut down list of phrases based on the predictability that obtains from the statistical value that occurs simultaneously.
Every one-phase in these stages will be described now in further detail.
Phase one 200 is such processes, and by this process, the authorized index system 110 one group of document in (crawl) archives of creeping forms a plurality of repetition subregions of described archives in time.Every bout is processed a subregion.The document number that every bout is creeped can change, and is preferably approximately 1,000,000 document of each subregion.Preferably only process the document of before not creeping in each subregion, until handle all documents, or satisfy a certain other stop criterion.In fact, because new document is constantly added to archives, continue so creep.110 pairs of each documents through creeping of authorized index system are taked the following step.
Travel through the word of described document with the phrase length of window of n, wherein n is desired maximum phrase length.The length of window is generally at least 2, is preferably 4 or 5 (words).Phrase preferably includes all words in the phrase window, comprises that those can be characterized as being the word that finishes word, for example " a ", " the " etc. originally.The phrase window can by end of line, paragraph carriage return, put the mark label or in other perhaps the sign of format change stop.
Fig. 3 illustrates the part of document 300 during traversal, and it is showed phrase window 302 from word " stock " beginning and expands 5 words to the right.First word in window 302 is candidate's phrase i, and each in sequence i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4 and i+5 is similarly candidate's phrase.Therefore, in this example, candidate's phrase is: " stock ", " stock dogs ", " stock dogs for ", " stock dogs for the ", " stock dogs for the Basque " and " stock dogsfor the Basque shepherds ".
In each phrase window 302, check successively each candidate's phrase with determine its whether Already in good list of phrases 208 or may list of phrases 206 in.If candidate's phrase has not been present in list of phrases 208 or possibility list of phrases 206, determines so described candidate's phrase for " bad " phrase and it is skipped.
If candidate's phrase has been in list of phrases 208, for example entry g
j, new phrase g so more
jIndex 150 entries to comprise described document (for example, its URL or other document identification symbol), to indicate this candidate's phrase g
jAppear in current document.Phrase g
jIndex 150 in entry (or) be called phrase g
jPut up list.Put up list and comprise the document d list (by its document identification symbol, for example document number or URL) that phrase wherein occurs.
In addition, as hereinafter further explaining, matrix 212 appears in renewal simultaneously.In initial first leg, all will be sky with bad list well, and therefore tend to most of phrases are added to may list of phrases 206.
If candidate's phrase has not been in list of phrases 208, so it is added to possibility list of phrases 206, unless described candidate's phrase Already in wherein.Each entry p on possible list of phrases 206 has three countings that are associated:
P (p): the document number that has the possibility phrase;
S (p): all example numbers of possible phrase; And
M (p): the concerned example number of possible phrase.May phrase and document in the difference of adjacent content be grammer or form mark, for example black matrix or underscore or when being anchor text in hyperlink or quotation marks, the example of possible phrase " concerned ".These (with other) difference outward appearance is indicated by various HTML markup language labels and grammatical markers.When a phrase had been placed on list of phrases 208, these statistical values of described phrase were maintained.
Except each list, matrix 212 (G) appears when also having kept phrase.Matrix G has m * m dimension, and wherein m has been the quantity of phrase.Each entry G (j, k) in matrix represents a pair of good phrase (g
j, g
k).Occur simultaneously matrix 212 logically (but physically not necessarily) keep every couple of good phrase (g
j, g
k) about three of secondary window 304 countings separately, described secondary window 304 be centered close to current word i, and expansion+/-a h word.In one embodiment, for example Fig. 3 is illustrated, and secondary window 304 has 30 words.Therefore, matrix 212 occurring simultaneously keeps:
R (j, k): occurrence count in the time of original, i.e. phrase g
jWith phrase g
kAppear at together the number of times in secondary window 304;
D (j, k): the concerned counting of separation, i.e. phrase g
jOr phrase g
kAppear at number of times in the secondary window as special text; And
C (j, k): the concerned counting of connection, i.e. phrase g
jWith phrase g
kBoth appear at number of times in the secondary window as special text.The concerned counting that use to connect is particularly advantageous in avoids phrase (for example, copyright notice) frequently to appear in sidebar, footer or header and the therefore situation of in fact unpredictable other text.
Referring to the example of Fig. 3, suppose that " stock dogs " and phrase " Australian Shepherd " and " Australian Shepard Club of America " have been positioned on list of phrases 208.Latter two phrase appears in secondary window 304 works as before phrase " stock dogs " on every side.Yet phrase " Australian Shepherd Club ofAmerica " occurs as the anchor text of the hyperlink that arrives the website (by the underscore indication).Therefore, increase progressively described to { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd " } original while occurrence count, and increase progressively { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd Club of America " } original while occurrence count and the concerned counting that separates because the latter occurs as special text.
Each document in subregion is repeated both travel through the process of each document with window sequence 302 and secondary window 304.
After document in having traveled through subregion, the next stage of produce index operation will be from may list of phrases 206 upgrading 202 good list of phrases 208.If possible the frequency of occurrences of the possible phrase p on list of phrases 206 indicates it enough to be used as semantically significant phrase with the document number that described phrase occurs, so described phrase has been moved to list of phrases 208.
In one embodiment, following to its test.From removing a possibility phrase p and be placed on list of phrases 208 list of phrases 206, precondition is:
A) P (p)＞10 and S (p)＞20 (contain the document number of phrase p greater than 10, and the occurrence number of phrase p being greater than 20); Perhaps
B) M (p)＞5 (the concerned example number of phrase p is greater than 5).
These threshold values are convergent-divergent by the document number in subregion; For example, if creep 2,000,000 document in a subregion, threshold value approximately doubles so.Certainly, be understood by those skilled in the art that, the occurrence of these threshold values or the logic of testing it can change as required.
If phrase p does not have qualification to enter list of phrases 208, check that it becomes the qualification of bad phrase.Phrase p is that the condition of a bad phrase is:
A) document that contains phrase is counted P (p)＜2; And
B) the concerned example of phrase is counted M (p)=0.
The described phrase of these conditions indication is not frequent, and can not be used to refer to effective content both, and again, these threshold values can be according to the document number in subregion and convergent-divergent.
It should be noted that as mentioned above, except many words phrase, good list of phrases 208 natures will comprise that individual words is as phrase.This is because each the first word candidate's phrase always in phrase window 302, and suitable example counting will add up.Therefore, authorized index system 110 can be automatically to individual words (that is the phrase that, has single word) and many words phrase produce index.Good list of phrases 208 also will be than short a lot of based on the theoretical maximum that might make up of m phrase.In exemplary embodiments, good list of phrases 208 will comprise approximately 6.5x10
5Individual phrase.Because the phrase of may phrase becoming reconciled only need to be followed the trail of by system, so do not need to store bad list of phrases.
Check archives by last bout, the expection of using due to phrase in Big-corpus distributes, so the list of possibility phrase will be relatively short.Therefore, if the 10th bout (for example, 10,000,000 document), a phrase occurs for the first time, and it is can not be extremely a good phrase in that time so.It may be the new phrase of just having brought into use, and therefore becomes more and more common during creeping subsequently.In the sort of situation, its corresponding counts will increase, and may finally satisfy the threshold value that becomes a good phrase.
The phase III of produce index operation is to use from the predictability that matrix 212 acquisitions occur simultaneously to measure to cut down 204 good list of phrases 208.In the situation that do not cut down, itself can't fully predict the existence of other phrase in dictionary or itself be the phrase of the subsequence of length language more although good list of phrases 208 probably comprises many reasonably appearing at.Removing these more bad phrases makes more and may obtain steadily phrase.In order to have identified phrase, use a predictability tolerance, the existence that it expresses a given phrase, the possibility that another phrase occurs in the literature increases.In one embodiment, this following completing:
As mentioned above, the m that matrix 212 is data of being associated with good phrase of storage * m matrix appears simultaneously.Every row j in matrix has represented phrase g
i, and every row k has represented phrase g
kFor each good phrase g
j, calculation expectation value E (g
j).Expectation value E is that in the storehouse, expection contains g
jThe number percent of document.For example, it is calculated as and contains g
jThe document number and the storehouse in the ratio of the document sum T that creeped: P (j)/T.
As mentioned above, at g
jWhen occurring in the literature at every turn, just upgrade and contain g
jThe number of document.Each g
jCounting when increasing or during this phase III, renewable E (g
j) value.
Next, other good phrase g for each
k(for example, each row of matrix) determines g
jWhether predicted g
kg
jThe following of predictability tolerance determine:
I) calculation expectation value E (g
k).If g
jWith g
kBe irrelevant phrase, when expecting, occurrence rate E (j, k) is E (g
j) * E (g
k);
Ii) calculate g
jWith g
kActual while occurrence rate A (j, k).This is divided by document sum T with original while occurrence count R (j, k);
Iii) when simultaneously occurrence rate A (j, k) surpasses expection during occurrence rate E (j, a k) threshold quantity, claim g when reality
jPrediction g
k
In one embodiment, predictability tolerance is information gain.Therefore, when at phrase g
jThere is lower another phrase g
kInformation gain I when surpassing a threshold value, phrase g
jPrediction phrase g
kIn one embodiment, this is calculated as follows:
I(j，k)＝A(j，k)/E(j，k)。
And when satisfying following condition, good phrase g
jPredicted phrase g
k:
I (j, k)＞information gain threshold.
In one embodiment, information gain threshold is 1.5, but preferably between 1.1 and 1.7.Threshold value is elevated to is used for reducing the possibility that stochastic prediction appears surpassing in two scripts irrelevant phrase simultaneously more than 1.0.
As mentioned above, with respect to given row j, to every calculating that is listed as the gain of k duplicate message of matrix G.After delegation completes, if good phrase g
kIn the information gain of none phrase surpass information gain threshold, this means so phrase g
jDo not predict any other good phrase.In the sort of situation, remove g from good list of phrases 208
j, it becomes bad phrase basically.Note, do not remove phrase g
jRow j because this phrase itself can be predicted by other good phrase.
After assessing all row that occur simultaneously in matrix 212, finish this step.
Last step in this stage is to have cut down list of phrases 208 to remove imperfect phrase.Imperfect phrase is only to predict its expansion phrase and the phrase of (that is, phrase begin place) beginning from the leftmost side of described phrase.Phrase p " expansion phrase " is the supersequence that begins with phrase p.For instance, phrase " President of " prediction " President of the United States ", " President of Mexico ", " President of AT﹠amp; T " etc.Because these phrases of all back are all to begin and be its supersequence with " President of ", so they are the expansion phrases of " President of ".
Therefore, maintained each phrase g on list of phrases 208
jAll will predict a certain amount of other phrase based on previously discussed information gain threshold.Now, for each phrase g
j, authorized index system 110 carries out itself and its each phrase g of predicting
kString matching.Each prediction phrase g is tested in string matching
kWhether be phrase g
jThe expansion phrase.If all prediction phrase g
kAll phrase g
jThe expansion phrase, g so
jJust imperfect, will be removed from good list of phrases 208 and add imperfect list of phrases 216 to.Therefore, not g if there is at least one
jThe phrase g of expansion phrase
k, that g
jBe complete, and maintained in list of phrases 208.So for instance, because unique other phrase that " President of the United " predicts is that " President of the United States " and this prediction phrase are the expansion phrases of described phrase, so " President of the United " is exactly an imperfect phrase.
216 of imperfect list of phrases are very useful during actual search.When receiving search inquiry, itself and imperfect list 216 can be compared.An if entries match in described inquiry (or its part) and described list, search system 120 just can be searched most probable expansion phrase (the given imperfect phrase of this imperfect phrase so, have the expansion phrase of high information gain), and advise this phrase or to expansion phrase automatic search to the user.For example, if search inquiry is " President of the United ", search system 120 can be from trend user suggestion " President of the United States " with as search inquiry so.
After the last stage of completing the produce index process, good list of phrases 208 will contain a large amount of good phrase of finding in corpus.Each in these good phrases will predict that all at least one is not other phrase of its expansion phrase.That is, each good phrase uses with enough frequencies, and independently represents significant concept or thought expressed in corpus.Different from the existing system of the phrase that uses predetermined or artificial selection, good list of phrases has reflected the phrase of reality use in the corpus.In addition, due to along with new document is added to archives and periodically repeats above-mentioned creeping and the produce index process, so authorized index system 110 detects described new phrase automatically when new phrase enters dictionary.
2.
Trooping of identification relevant phrases and relevant phrases
Referring to Fig. 4, the relevant phrases identifying comprises the following functions operation:
400: identification has the relevant phrases of high information gain value;
402: identify trooping of relevant phrases;
404: storage cluster bit vector and cluster number.
Describe now each in these operations in detail.
At first, wander back to and matrix 212 occurs simultaneously and contained phrase g
j, wherein each predicts that all at least one has other the good phrase g greater than the information gain of information gain threshold
kThen, in order to identify 400 relevant phrases, for every a pair of good phrase (g
j, g
k), information gain and relevant phrases threshold value (for example, 100) are compared.That is, under the following conditions, g
jWith g
kRelevant phrases:
I(g
j，g
k)＞100。
Occur when identifying with this high threshold the good phrase that surpasses well the upper expectation rate of statistics.On statistics, it means phrase g
jWith g
kOccurrence rate is over 100 times of expection while occurrence rate simultaneously.For instance, the phrase in given document " Monica Lewinsky ", phrase " Bill Clinton " may occurrence rate be more its 100 times in same document, and phrase " Bill Clinton " may appear in the document of random selection arbitrarily.Because occurrence rate is 100: 1, be 99.999% so another kind of form of presentation is prediction accuracy.
Therefore, will be less than any entry (g of relevant phrases threshold value
j, g
k) zeroing, thereby referring expression g
j, g
kUncorrelated.Now, any residue entry that occurs simultaneously in matrix 212 is all indicated all relevant phrases.
Next, by information gain value I (g
j, g
k) to each row g of matrix 212 occurring simultaneously
jIn row g
kClassification makes at first to list to have the relevant phrases g of high information gain
kTherefore, this is categorized as given phrase g
jWhich identify according to information gain other phrase most probable relevant.
Next step is to determine that 402 which relevant phrases form together relevant phrases and troop.Trooping is the set of relevant phrases, and wherein each phrase has high information gain with respect at least one other phrase.In one embodiment, following identification is trooped.
Every row g at matrix
jIn, will there be one or more and phrase g
jOther relevant phrase.This set is exactly relevant phrases set R
j, R={g wherein
k, g
lG
m.
For R
jIn each relevant phrases m, authorized index system 110 determine in R each other relevant phrases whether also with g
jRelevant.Therefore, if I is (g
k, g
l) be also non-zero, g so
j, g
kWith g
lIt is a part of trooping.To the often a pair of (g in R
l, g
m) repeat this test of trooping.
For instance, supposed that phrase " Bill Clinton " and phrase " President ", " Monica Lewinsky " are relevant, this is because each information gain with respect to " Bill Clinton " in these phrases all surpasses the relevant phrases threshold value.In addition, suppose that phrase " Monica Lewinsky " is relevant to phrase " purse designer ".These phrases form set R subsequently.For determining to troop, authorized index system 110 gains to assess described phrase with respect to the information gain of other phrase by determining each the corresponding informance in these phrases.Therefore, all information gain I to phrase (" President ", " Monica Lewinsky "), I (" President ", " purse designer ") in the authorized index 110 definite R of system etc.In this example, " Bill Clinton ", " President " form one with " Monica Lewinsky " and troop, " Bill Clinton " forms second with " President " and troops, and " Monica Lewinsky " forms the 3rd with " purse designer " and troops, and " Monica Lewinsky ", " Bill Clinton " and " purse designer " formation four group collection.Although this is that " Monica Lewinsky " predicts this two phrases because " Bill Clinton " do not have enough information gains to predict " purse designer ".
For recording 404 cluster information, troop to each and assign a unique cluster number (ID troops).Then, in conjunction with each good phrase g
jRecord together this information.
In one embodiment, determine cluster number by the bit vector of trooping, the bit vector of trooping is the orthogonality relation between referring expression also.The bit vector of trooping is that length is the sequence of the position of n, and n has been the quantity of the good phrase in list of phrases 208.For given good phrase g
j, the position, position is corresponding to g
jThrough the classification relevant phrases R.If the relevant phrases g in R
kWith phrase g
jIn same trooping, set a position.More generally, this means if at g
jWith g
kBetween either direction on have information gain, set the corresponding position in the bit vector of trooping.
So cluster number is the value of gained bit string.This embodiment has such characteristic, and the relevant phrases that namely has multidirectional or unidirectional information gain appears in same cluster.
Following is an example that uses the bit vector of trooping of above-mentioned phrase:
Bill Clinton | President | Monica Lewinsky | purse designer | ID troops | |
Bill Cliton | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 14 |
President | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 12 |
Monica Lewinsky | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 11 |
purse designer | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
So summarize, after this process, will be each good phrase g
jIdentify one group of relevant phrases R, it is according to information gain I (g
j, g
k) from high to low order classification.In addition, for each good phrase g
j, the bit vector of trooping all will be arranged, its value is for identification phrase g
jIts member's the cluster number of mainly trooping, and which phrase and g in the relevant phrases in quadrature value (being 1 or 0 for each position) indication R
jBe in and jointly troop.Therefore, in above-mentioned example, " Bill Clinton ", " President " and " Monica Lewinsky " are in trooping in 14 based on the value of the position in the row of phrase " BillClinton ".
For storing this information, can use two kinds of basic representations.The first, as above indicated, information can be stored in and occur simultaneously in matrix 212, wherein:
The capable j of entry G[, row k]=(I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping).
Perhaps, can avoid matrix representation, and all information have been stored in list of phrases 208, wherein every delegation represents a good phrase g
j
Phrase is capable
j=list [phrase g
k, (I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping)].
The method provides a kind of useful set of clusters weave.At first, the method is not the theme that defines of a strict and permanent meaning and the classification of concept, but recognize that the indicated theme of relevant phrases forms the relation table of a complexity, wherein some phrase is relevant to many other phrases, and the scope of some phrase is more limited, and wherein each relation can be mutual (other phrase predicted in each phrase) or unidirectional (other phrase predicted in a phrase, otherwise but can not).It is " part " that result can characterize paired each good phrase with trooping, and some is trooped overlapping owing to having one or more common relevant phrases subsequently.
Subsequently for a given good phrase g
j, relevant phrases provides a kind of classification that named phrase troops that is used for according to the sequencing of information gain: the name of trooping is to have the title of the relevant phrases of high information gain in trooping.
Said method provides a kind of very sane mode of the effective phrase for identifying present archives, and useful is, provides these relevant phrases to be used in together the mode of nature in " trooping " in reality is implemented.Therefore, troop " editor " of any manual work guiding of the relational language of having avoided common in many systems and concept of this data-driven of relevant phrases selected intrinsic deviation.
3.
With phrase and relevant phrases to the document produce index
Given comprising about the good list of phrases 208 of relevant phrases with the information of trooping, the next feature operation of authorized index system 110 be about good phrase with troop to the document produce index in archives, and the information through upgrading is stored in index 150.Fig. 5 illustrates this process, wherein has the following function phases to the document produce index:
500: document is posted to the list of putting up of the good phrase found in document.
502: example counting and the relevant phrases bit vector of upgrading relevant phrases and secondary relevant phrases.
504: come the note document with relevant phrases information.
506: come directory entry sequencing again according to putting up list size.
To describe in more detail these stages now.
As mentioned above, the literature collection that travels through or creep; This can be identical or different literature collection.For a given document d, from the i of position, the window sequence 302 take length as n is by word traversal 500 documents in the above described manner.
In a given phrase window 302, begin all good phrases identification window from position i.Each good phrase all is expressed as g
iTherefore, g1 is first good phrase, and g2 will be second good phrase, and the rest may be inferred.
For each good phrase g
i(example g1 " President " with g4 " President of ATT ") (for example, URL) is posted to good phrase g in index 150 with the document identification symbol
iPut up list.This renewal identifies, and phrase g occurred in this specific document
i
In one embodiment, phrase g
jThe list of putting up adopt following logical form:
Phrase g
j: list: (document d, [list: relevant phrases counting] [relevant phrases information]).
For each phrase g
j, have a list that the document d of described phrase occurs.For each document, there is a phrase g who appears at equally in document d
jThe list of counting of occurrence number of relevant phrases R.
In one embodiment, relevant phrases information is a relevant phrases bit vector.This bit vector can be characterized by " dibit " vector, and this is because for each relevant phrases g
k, have position, two positions: g
k-1 and g
k-2.First position storage indicates whether to exist relevant phrases g in document d
k(that is, the g in document d
kCounting greater than 0) flag.The storage of second position indicates whether also to exist phrase g in document d
kRelevant phrases g
lFlag.Phrase g
jRelevant phrases g
kRelevant phrases g
lBe called in this article " g
jThe secondary relevant phrases ".Described counting and the canonic ordering (according to the order classification of the information gain of successively decreasing) of position, position corresponding to phrase in R.This classification order produces such effect, namely makes g
jThe relevant phrases g of topnotch prediction
kBe associated with the highest significant position of relevant phrases bit vector, and g
jThe relevant phrases g of minimum prediction
lBe associated with least significant bit (LSB).
More usefully notice for given phrase g, contain the document of g with respect to all, related all identical between the individual bits of the length of relevant phrases bit vector and relevant phrases and described vector.This embodiment has following characteristic, namely allows system easily relatively to contain the relevant phrases bit vector of any (or owning) document of g, has given relevant phrases to observe which document.This is conducive to promote search procedure to identify document in response to search inquiry.Therefore, given document will appear at putting up in list of many different phrases, and this type of is puted up in list at each, and the relevant phrases vector of described document will be exclusively used in and have the described phrase of putting up list.This respect has kept the locality of relevant phrases bit vector with respect to indivedual phrases and document.
Therefore, next stage 502 comprise the current index position of traversal in document secondary window 304 (as previously mentioned ,+/-the secondary window of K item (for example 30)), for example from i-K to i+K.For the g that appears in secondary window 304
iEach relevant phrases g
k, authorized index system 110 increases progressively g with respect to the document d in the relevant phrases counting
kCounting.If g
iOccur after a while again finding relevant phrases in the literature and in secondary window after a while, again increase progressively counting.
As mentioned above, based on counting first g of correspondence that sets in relevant phrases position mapping
k-1, if g
kCounting＞0, the position is set as 1, if or described counting equal 0, being set is 0.
Next, by search relevant phrases g in index 150
k, at g
kThe entry of putting up in list identification document d, and then check g
kThe secondary relevant phrases counting (or position) of any relevant phrases, and set second g
k-2.If set any one in these secondary relevant phrases counting/positions, also there is g in this indication in document d
jThe secondary relevant phrases.
When handling document d fully in this way, authorized index system 110 will identify following content:
I) the good phrase g of each in document d
j
Ii) for each good phrase g
j, identify its which relevant phrases g
kBe present in document d;
Iii) for each the relevant phrases g that is present in document d
k, identify its which relevant phrases g
l(g
jThe secondary relevant phrases) also be present in document d.
a)
Determine document subject
By phrase to the document produce index and use cluster information that another advantage of authorized index system 110 is provided, its for determine based on relevant phrases information document about the ability of theme.
Suppose for given phrase g
jWith given document d, put up list of entries as follows:
g
j: document d: relevant phrases counting :={ 3,4,3,0,0,2,1,1,0}
Relevant phrases bit vector :={ 11 11 10 00 00 10 10 10 01}
Wherein, the relevant phrases bit vector is shown as dibit pair.
From the relevant phrases bit vector, we can determine one-level and the secondary theme of document d.Main subject heading is indicated (1,1) by the position, and the secondary theme is indicated (1,0) by the position.The relevant phrases position is to existing the right relevant phrases g of institute's rheme in (1,1) indication document d
kAnd secondary relevant phrases g
lBoth.This may be interpreted as the author who means document when writing described document d and has used together some relevant phrases g
j, g
kWith g
lThere is g in the position to (1,0) indication
jWith g
kBoth, but do not have g
kAny other secondary relevant phrases, so this is a more effective theme.
b)
Improve graduate document note
Authorized index system 110 be can be during produce index come note 5 04 each document d with the information that makes the graduation of searching period subsequently be improved on the other hand.Annotation procedure 506 is as follows.
Given document d in archives can have the outer link to other document of some.Each outer link (hyperlink) all comprises the document identification symbol of anchor text and target literature.For illustrative purposes, the current document d that is processing is called URL0, and the target literature of the outer link on document d is called URL1.In order to wait a moment for the document graduation to Search Results, for each link in the URL0 that points to some other URLi, authorized index system 110 creates described links with respect to the outer link score of the anchor phrase of URL0 and the described anchor phrase internal chaining score with respect to URLi.That is, the link of each in archives has a pair of score, i.e. an outer link score and an internal chaining score.These scores of following calculating.
On given document URL0, authorized index system 110 identifications each outer link to another document URL1, wherein anchor text A is a phrase in good list of phrases 208.Fig. 7 a schematically illustrates this relation, and the anchor text " A " in its Literature URL0 is used for hyperlink 700.
Phrase A put up list, URL0 is puted up as the outer link of phrase A, and URL1 is puted up as the internal chaining of phrase A.For URL0, complete as mentioned above the relevant phrases bit vector, to identify relevant phrases and the secondary relevant phrases of the A that exists in URL0.With the outer link score of this relevant phrases bit vector as the link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A.
Next, following definite internal chaining score.For each internal chaining to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A, the authorized index 110 scanning URL1 of system, and determine phrase A whether occurs in the main body of URL1.If phrase A not only points to URL1 (via the outer link on URL0), and appears in the content of URL1 itself, this shows that the concept that can claim URL1 and phrase A representative is inner relevant so.Fig. 7 b has illustrated this situation, and wherein phrase A appears in the main body of URL0 (as the anchor text) and URL1.In the case, with the relevant phrases bit vector of the phrase A of the URL1 internal chaining score as the link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains phrase A.
If appearing in the main body of URL1, anchor phrase A (as Fig. 8 a), do not take different steps to determine the internal chaining score.In the case, authorized index system 110 creates the relevant phrases bit vector (as there is phrase A at URL1) of the URL1 that is used for phrase A, and which relevant phrases of referring expression A appears in URL1.Next, with the internal chaining score of this relevant phrases bit vector as the link from URL0 to URL1.
For instance, suppose the following phrase of initial existence in URL0 and URL1:
(in above and following table, not showing the secondary relevant phrases).URL0 is capable is outer link score from the link of anchor text A, and URL1 capable be the internal chaining score of described link.Here, URL0 contains the anchor phrase that target is URL1 " Australian Shepard ".In five relevant phrases of " Australian Shepard ", only one " Aussie " appears in URL0.So intuitively, URL0 is only weak relevant to Australian Shepards.By comparing, URL1 not only has the phrase " Australian Shepherd " that is present in the document main body, but also has many relevant phrases " blue merle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".Therefore, because anchor phrase " AustralianShepard " appears in URL0 and URL1, so the internal chaining score of the outer link score of URL0 and URL1 is the corresponding line shown in above.
Above-mentioned the second situation is not occur the situation of anchor phrase A in URL1.In the sort of situation, there is which phrase in relevant phrases " Aussie ", " blue merle ", " redmerle ", " tricolor " and " agility training " in scanning URL1 of authorized index system 110 and determining in URL1, and therefore produce a relevant phrases bit vector, for example:
Here, this shows that URL1 does not contain anchor phrase " Australian Shepard ", but contains relevant phrases " bluemerle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".The method is conducive to prevent fully webpage (a class document) is carried out the manipulation of some type in order to distort Search Results.The page that has in a large number the given anchor text that points to the page of wanting by manual creation can " bombard " with the graduation algorithm that depends on the link number that points to given document to come the graduate search engine of described document.Therefore, when the search inquiry of anchor text is used in input, usually return to institute and want page, though in fact this page almost or fully it doesn't matter with the anchor text.The relevant bits vector from importing to the relevant phrases bit vector of phrase A of document URL0, eliminated target literature URL1 search system to pointing to URL1 with as in the URL0 of the designator of validity or the phrase A in URL1 and the dependence of the relation between the anchor text phrases.
Based on the frequency of occurrences of each phrase in corpus in index 150, also give each phrase one phrase number.Phrase is more common, and its phrase that receives in index number is just lower.Next, authorized index system 110 puts up number listed document number of phrase in list according to each all in index 150 is puted up list sort in descending order 506, makes and at first lists the phrase that the most frequently occurs.So, can number search particular phrase with phrase.
III.
Search system
Search system 120 operates to receive inquiry and the search document relevant to described inquiry, and the list (and link of these documents) of these documents is provided in search result set.Fig. 6 illustrates the major function operation of search system 120:
600: the phrase in the identification inquiry;
602: retrieve the document relevant to query phrase;
604: according to phrase, the document in Search Results is classified.
The details of the every one-phase in these stages is as follows.
1.
Phrase in identification inquiry and query expansion
The phase one 600 of search system 120 is any phrases of existing in identification inquiry so that search index effectively.Use following term in this section:
Q: inquiry input and that received by search system 120;
Qp: the phrase that exists in inquiry;
The relevant phrases of Qr:Qp;
The expansion phrase of Qe:Qp;
The union of Q:Qp and Qr.
Receive inquiry q from user side 190, described inquiry q has character or the word of a certain maximum quantity at the most.
Search system 120 uses size to travel through the every of described inquiry q as the phrase window of N (for example 5).Described phrase window first from first of described inquiry, is then expanded the N item to the right.Then, this window moves right M-N time, and wherein M is the item number in described inquiry.
At each the window's position place, all will there be N item (or still less) in window.These consist of a possible query phrase.Search the possibility phrase in good list of phrases 208, determine if it is a good phrase.If there is this may phrase in good list of phrases 208, return to a phrase number to phrase so; Now, this may phrase be exactly candidate's phrase.
In testing each window might phrase determining them whether after good candidate's phrase, search system 120 will be given one group of phrase number for the corresponding phrase in inquiry.Next, with number classification (descending) of these phrases.
From as the highest phrase of first candidate's phrase number, search system 120 determines whether another candidate's phrase arranged the distance of the fixed numbers in the list of classification is interior, and namely the difference between phrase number is in the threshold quantity of (for example) 20,000.If have, select so the effective query phrase Qp of leftmost phrase conduct in inquiry.Remove this query phrase and all subphrases thereof from candidate's list of phrases, and described list is reclassified and repeat said process.The result of this process is one group of effective query phrase Qp.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on the Senate Floor ".Search system 120 will be identified following candidate's phrase: " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on ", " Hillary RodhamClinton Bill " reach " Hillary Rodham Clinton ".Abandon the first two, and keep last as the effective query phrase.Next, search system 120 will be identified " Bill on the Senate Floor " and subphrase " Bill on theSenate ", " Bill on the ", " Bill on ", " Bill ", and can select " Bill " as effective query phrase Qp.At last, search system 120 can be resolved " on the Senate Floor ", and identification " Senate Floor " is as the effective query phrase.
Next, search system 120 is adjusted effective phrase Qp so that initial caps.When resolving inquiry, the potential initial caps in search system 120 each effective phrase of identification.This can be by utilizing known initial caps table (for example, the initial caps of " united states " is " United States ") or utilizing take grammer as the initial caps algorithm on basis and complete.This produces the set of the query phrase of suitable initial caps.
Next, when exist in this set phrase and subphrase thereof both the time, search system 120 second legs check the phrase of initial caps, and only select the Far Left letter of those phrases and it is become capitalization.For example, will be " President of the United States " to the capitalization of the search of " president ofthe united states ".
In next stage, search system 120 identification 602 documents relevant to query phrase Q.Search system 120 then retrieval and inquisition phrase Q put up list, and make these lists intersect to determine that all (or some) which document appears at query phrase put up in list.If the phrase Q in inquiry has one group of expansion phrase Qe (hereinafter will further explain), at first search system 120 forms the union of putting up list of described expansion phrase so, then make its and these to put up list crossing.As mentioned above, search system 120 is identified the expansion phrase by search each query phrase Q in imperfect list of phrases 216.
The result that intersects is one group of document associated with the query.By phrase and relevant phrases to the document produce index, phrase Q in the identification inquiry, and then with query expansion to comprising the expansion phrase, thereby produce one group than the selected works of conventional search system document more associated with the query based on boolean, in the search system based on boolean of routine, only select to contain the document of described query term.
In one embodiment, search system 120 can not necessarily make with Optimization Mechanism query phrase Q in response to inquiry identification document all put up list and intersect.Due to the structure of index 150, so for each phrase g
j, its relevant phrases g
kAll known, and at g
kThe relevant phrases bit vector in identify.Therefore, two or more query phrases are the phrase that is relative to each other or the crossing process with common relevant phrases to this Information Availability in simplifying wherein.In those situations, can directly access the relevant phrases bit vector, and then be used for next retrieving corresponding document.The method is hereinafter more fully described.
There are three kinds of possible relevant situation in given any two query phrase Q1 and Q2:
1) Q2 is the relevant phrases of Q1;
2) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, and its corresponding relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 non-intersect (that is, there is no common relevant phrases); And
3) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, but its corresponding relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 intersect.
For every a pair of query phrase, search system 120 is determined suitable situation by the relevant phrases bit vector of searching query phrase Qp.
Search system 120 continues the list of putting up that for query phrase Q1 retrieval comprises the document that contains Q1, and for each the literature search relevant phrases bit vector in these documents.Whether whether the relevant phrases bit vector of Q1 be the relevant phrases of Q1 and be present in the document referring expression Q2 (and if any, also comprising each in the residue query phrase).
If the first situation is applicable to Q2, search system 120 scans the relevant phrases bit vector of putting up each the document d in list of Q1 so, in order to determine wherein whether have the position of setting for Q2.If the document d that Q1 puts up in list does not set this position, it means that Q2 does not appear in that document so.Therefore, can immediately this document be got rid of outside considering.Then, can be to the score of residue document.This list of putting up that means that further search system 120 need not to process Q2 checks which document it also is present in, thereby has saved computing time.
If the second situation is applicable to Q2, these two phrases are irrelevant each other so.For example, inquiry " cheap bolt actionrifle " has two phrases " cheap " and " bolt action rifle ".These phrases are uncorrelated each other, and in addition, the relevant phrases of each in these phrases is not overlapping; Namely " cheap " has relevant phrases " low cost ", " inexpensive ", " discount ", " bargain basement " and " lousy ", and " bolt action rifle " has relevant phrases " gun ", " 22caliber ", " magazine fed " and " Armalite AR30M ", so these lists are non-intersect.In the case, search system 120 makes the list (ACL) regulations (regular) of putting up of Q1 and Q2 intersect to obtain document for score.
If the third situation is applicable, although two phrase Q1 are uncorrelated with Q2 so, they have at least one common relevant phrases.For example, phrase " bolt action rifle " and " 22 " both all have " gun " as relevant phrases.In the case, search system 120 these two phrase Q1 of retrieval and Q2's puts up list and makes these lists intersect the list of documents that contains two phrases with generation.
Then, search system 120 can be rapidly to each score in the gained document.At first, search system 120 is determined the score adjusted value of each document.The score adjusted value be by in the relevant phrases bit vector of document corresponding to the formed mask in position of the position of query phrase Q1 and Q2.For example, suppose Q1 and Q2 corresponding to the 3rd and the 6th dibit position in the relevant phrases bit vector of document d, and the place value of the 3rd position is (1,1), and the place value of the 6th centering is (1,0), and the score adjusted value is exactly bitmask " 00 00 11 00 00 10 " so.Then, shield the relevant phrases bit vector of document with the score adjusted value, and then modified phrase bit vector is delivered in graduation function (as described below) to be used for calculating the main body score of described document.
2.
Graduation
a)
Based on contained phrase, document is classified
Search system 120 provides the graduation stage 604, wherein comes the document in Search Results is classified with the bit vector of trooping of the phrase information in the relevant phrases bit vector of each document and query phrase.The method is to come document is classified according to phrase contained in document or informal " main body is hit ".
As mentioned above, for arbitrary given phrase g
j, g
jPut up each document d in list and have there is which relevant phrases g in the document of being identified in d
kWith which secondary relevant phrases g
iThe relevant phrases bit vector that is associated.The relevant phrases that exists in given document and secondary relevant phrases are more, and the position that will set in the document relevant phrases bit vector of given phrase is just more.The position of setting is more, and the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector is just larger.
Therefore, in one embodiment, search system 120 is come the document classification in Search Results according to the value of the relevant phrases bit vector of document.Contain the relevant phrases bit vector that will have mxm. with the document of the maximally related phrase of query phrase Q, and these documents will be the documents of the highest ranking in Search Results.
The method is why more satisfactory is that these documents are the most relevant to query phrase on theme because semantically.Note, the method can provide the document of height correlation, even these documents do not contain high-frequency input inquiry item q, this is because relevant phrases information once was used for the identification pertinent literature, and then these documents is classified both.Therefore document with low-frequency input inquiry item still can have a large amount of relevant phrases of query term and phrase, and than only having high-frequency query term and phrase but more relevant without the document of relevant phrases.
In a second embodiment, the relevant phrases of the search system 120 query phrase Q contained according to each document in results set is come each document score.This completes in the following way.
Will there be the phrase Qr relevant to described query phrase of a certain number N in given each query phrase Q, and it can be identified during the phrase identifying.As mentioned above, come the sequencing to relevant inquiring phrase Qr according to the information gain from query phrase Q of relevant inquiring phrase Qr.Then, these relevant phrases are assigned point, be first the first relevant phrases Qr1 (namely, have the relevant phrases Qr from the highest information gain of Q) assign N point, then be that next relevant phrases Qr2 assigns N-1 point, then for Q3 assigns N-2 point, the rest may be inferred, is therefore that last relevant phrases QrN assigns 1 point.
Then, by determining to exist which relevant phrases Qr of query phrase Q, and give the point that described document is assigned to each described relevant phrases Qr, and to each document score in Search Results.Then basis is from being up to minimum score with described document classification.
As further becoming more meticulous, search system 120 can be from results set selected some document.In some cases, document may be about many different themes; Especially true for offering than long article.In many cases, the document relevant to many different themes compared, the expressed closely-related document of single theme during the user prefers those and inquires about.
For the document of a type after selected, the cluster information in the bit vector of trooping of search system 120 use query phrases, and remove any document of trooping that wherein exists more than number of thresholds.For example, search system 120 can be removed any document of trooping more than two that contains.This threshold value of trooping can pre-determine, or to be set by the user be a search parameter.
b)
Based on the anchor phrase, document is classified
Except hitting based on the main body of query phrase Q to the graduation of the document in Search Results, in one embodiment, search system 120 is also come document is classified based on the query phrase Q that occurs in the anchor to other document and relevant inquiring phrase Qr.In one embodiment, search system 120 is calculated the score of each document, and described score is the function (for example, linear combination) of two scores (that is, main body hit score and anchor hits score).
For example, document score that can the given document of following calculating:
Score=.30* (main body is hit score)+.70* (anchor hits score).
.30 can adjust as required with the weights of .70.With the given query phrase Qp of described mode above, the main body of document is hit the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector that score is the mxm. of described document.Perhaps, search system 120 can directly obtain this value in the following way: search each the query phrase Q in index 150, access document from the list of putting up of query phrase Q, and then access the relevant phrases bit vector.
The anchor of document d hits the function that score is the relevant phrases bit vector of query phrase Q, and wherein Q is the anchor item in the document of list of references d.When authorized index system 110 is document produce index in archives, it keeps list of documents for each phrase, wherein said phrase is the anchor text in outer link, and also keeps internal chaining list (with the anchor text that is associated) from other document for each document.The internal chaining of a document is the reference (for example, hyperlink) from other document (list of references) to given document.
Then for the anchor of determining given document d hits score, search system 120 is gathered anchor phrase Q iteration in described list of references R set of (i=1-list of references number) by the list of references R that lists with index, and following product is sued for peace:
Ri.Q. relevant phrases bit vector * D.Q. relevant phrases bit vector.
The product value here is the score of the degree of anchor phrase Q and document D Topic relative.Here this score is called " inbound score component ".This product comes the vectorial weighting of the relevant bits of current document D by the relevant bits vector of the anchor phrase in list of references R effectively.If list of references R itself relevant to query phrase Q the relevant phrases bit vector of high value (and therefore have), this increases the validity of current document D score so.Then, combined body is hit score and anchor hits score to produce as mentioned above the document score.
Next, for each in list of references R, obtain the relevant phrases bit vector of each anchor phrase Q.This is the tolerance to anchor phrase Q and document R theme correlation degree.Here this value is called " departures score component ".
Then extract all (list of references, referenced document) right anchor phrase Q from index 150.Then come these classification by these right (departures score component, inbound score component) values that are associated.According to embodiment, any one in these components can be the Main classification keyword, and another component can be the secondary classification keyword.Then, will present to the user through the result of classification.Making the highest grade with document that many phrases associated with the query hit as anchor according to departures score component to document classification, is therefore " expert " document with these document representations.Often make due to the anchor item grade of referenced document the highest according to inbound document score classification.
IV. top phrase and phrase information become more meticulous
Become more meticulous each document phrase information that 130 use authorized index systems 110 of system produce of phrase information is determined other phrase information of individual Web sites (or other limited archives), and user's any modification that this out of Memory is done becomes more meticulous and is stored in the phrase information that produces that has now in index 150.Fig. 8 illustrates the become more meticulous major function operation of system 130 of phrase information:
800: definite top phrase that is associated with given website
810: other relevant phrases that receives the top phrase
820: the relevant phrases of upgrading the top phrase with other relevant phrases
830: with other relevant phrases of information updating from existing relevant phrases
1.
Determine the top phrase
Except the document of determining wherein to occur particular phrase and relevant phrases (having realized as authorized index system 110), the phrase information system 130 that becomes more meticulous also is configured to the set of representative or effective phrase of definite specific website or other limited archives; These representative phrases generally can be described as " top phrase "." the top phrase " of website is the probably useful designator of relevant inquiry of described website, and therefore the mechanism that realizes for the search efficiency that improves is provided.
For given website, phrase information become more meticulous system 130 processes each document in 800 websites with the top phrase of definite every page, and then assembles these every page top phrase and determine the top phrase of archives with integral body.
(a)
Every literature processing
For each document in the website, the phrase information system 130 that becomes more meticulous determines from index 150 phrase that occurs document.For the phrase of each identification, calculate the importance score based on relevant phrases.In one embodiment, the importance score of phrase is each the function of the total frequency of occurrences of relevant phrases in document.This realizes by the lists of putting up that check the authorized index system 110 previous documents that create, because in the list of relevant phrases and document, the frequency of each relevant phrases is stored in putting up in list for given phrase and document.This determines to mean that the phrase that will have maximum relevant phrases is considered as representing most given document.
(b)
Determine the top phrase of website
In the situation that determined the top phrase of each document in the website, phrase information becomes more meticulous, and system 130 now uses this every documentation ﹠ info so that the whole top phrase of determining the website.In one embodiment, cross over document in the website to the score summation of each top phrase, and select to have the individual phrase of number N (for example, 10) of the highest PTS as the top phrase of website.In another embodiment, the position in archives and to its score weighting according to the top phrase of document.For instance, in the archives that is formed by webpage, have to the root of website and be given the weighting higher than the page with longer path (suppose near the page of root than being nested in deeply page important in page level) than the page of short path.The document identification that the top phrase of website then is stored in by the homepage of website accords with in the data structure of produce index.
Can be periodically or recomputate the top phrase of website according to webmaster's needs.In one embodiment, when upgrading at every turn, the score of previous top phrase set can decay and with the combination of the score of current top phrase set, determine subsequently final score, and it classified to identify new top phrase.For instance, final score can be the weighted array of the previous score of 75% current score and 25%.This (or other is linear or non-linear) attenuation function makes the website can change gradually its most important phrase.
2.
Receive the alternative top phrase of current top phrase
The phrase information system 130 that becomes more meticulous also provides an interface, and it allows the keeper (for example, webmaster) of archives to watch the top phrase and manually it is changed into to think the phrase that more can represent web site contents.Allow the keeper to make this a little change and given to upgrade with more representative phrase the dual benefits that the top list of phrases makes document in the storehouse will think that inquiry to wider range is relevant and other Reliable Semantic information is provided, such as hereinafter discussion.
Fig. 9 is schematically illustrated as the user interface based on the website of the simplification of this purpose design.At first webmaster or other input suitable identifying information through authorized administrator, for example create during previous registration process and it is identified as the username and password that has authority for the website.After the checking of this identifying information, the phrase information system 130 that becomes more meticulous then shows one page, for example the user interface of Fig. 9.The top phrase of website is presented in the text field 902.The keeper can provide different alternative phrases for any one of top phrase, and with button 904, system 130 is submitted in these alternative phrases.For instance, the keeper can stipulate, substitutes top phrase " working dog " 906 with more representative top phrase (for example, " dog sports ").
3.
Upgrade existing phrase information
The change that the keeper does represents the knowledge especially reliably about the relation of phrase, because it is by archives being had authority and therefore representing about archives administrator hand input that what concept may be understood very much.Therefore, capture this other knowledge, replenish the existing phrase informations that authorized index system 110 determines automatically and the abundanter and more representative understanding that creates for the phrase relation is very valuable with it.
Originally, phrase information become more meticulous system 130 upgrades phrase informations, notes using current top phrase TP
oldAlternative top phrase TP to new keeper's appointment
newChange as the basis of upgrading.Change in response to the top phrase, carry out a series of actions, its order need to not carried out with the certain order of hereinafter statement.In fact, the order of described action can alter a great deal in different embodiment, but still realizes identical result.The effect of step of updating 820 be each alternative top phrase is considered as " as " it has been present in the website.In general, this completes by the website being added to the relevant phrases data of putting up list and then substituting the top phrase with the relevant phrases Data Update from old top phrase and other top phrase that substitute phrase.This process is now described in more detail.
At first, the root document (for example, the basic URL of website) with the website adds alternative top phrase TP to
newPut up list.This is in fact with TP
newBe associated with the website, it is considered as it appears on the homepage of website.This is reasonably, because the top phrase represents whole archives, rather than its any specific document, and therefore homepage is served as the agency of the position that substitutes top phrase appearance on the website.
Another action is with current top phrase TP
oldAdd to and substitute top phrase TP
newThe relevant phrases list, and similarly with TP
newAdd TP to
oldThe relevant phrases list.This action is suitable because the keeper by providing new phrase as substituting of old phrase clearly referring expression be correlated with.This feature so permission system capture two semantic relations between phrase.This is by access phrase TP
oldAnd TP
newEach put up list, further access the entry (for example, the basic URL of website) of the root document of archives and then upgrade this entry and exist other phrase to complete as relevant phrases with reflection.
Another action is to determine which relevant phrases TP
oldAnd TP
newHas common ground.Intersecting of relevant phrases do not correspond to the position of the relevant phrases bit vector of another phrase due to the position of the relevant phrases bit vector of a phrase, so can not intersect to determine by the relevant phrases bit vector that makes two phrases simply.In fact, for TP
oldAnd TP
newIn each determine set corresponding to the actual relevant phrases of bit vector position, and then make two intersection of sets, result is and TP
oldAnd TP
newThe phrase that both are correlated with.In one embodiment, intersect the relevant phrases of (that is, common) at TP
newThe counting of putting up in list be set to TP
oldCounting, this is in order to give TP
newTP for its common relevant phrases
oldThe copy of counting.
For instance, if TP
oldRelevant phrases be " blue merle ", " red merle " and " Aussie " and TP
newRelevant phrases be " agility training ", " red merle " and " working dog ", relevant phrases " red merle " is for intersecting so.Therefore, at TP
newPut up in list, the entry of the root document of access library, and increase progressively the counting of relevant phrases " red merle ".
Expection number of site keeper and keeper will attempt to provide its in fact semantically alternative phrase of incoherent top phrase; This can unexpectedly or deliberately carry out, for example in order to Search Results is pursued and attacked page.This problem can be by guaranteeing to substitute phrase TP
newHave with it the TP that substitutes
oldThe semantic relation of minimum degree and being avoided.Subsequently in one embodiment, TP
newCan not substitute TP
oldUnless there is the correlativity of a certain degree in two phrases, for example there are common ground in corresponding one-level relevant phrases or the secondary relevant phrases of at least one phrase.In addition, in this embodiment, phrase information becomes more meticulous system 130 can be in addition by successively decreasing about the TP of website
newRelevant phrases counting and be that the trial that substitutes uncorrelated phrase is placed obstacles." obstacle successively decreases " attracts the user to arrive described website in order to stop the keeper to input popular but false top phrase.
Another action is the TP that increases progressively relevant phrases (it is also the top phrase of website)
newThe relevant phrases list in counting.It is following true that this increases progressively reflection: the top phrase has been present in somewhere in archives (in the situation that top phrase of automatically determining) or has been considered as at least effectively that (if being not in fact) exists (in the situation that manually top phrase of appointment).For instance, the top phrase of supposing recipe formula in the website is " baked chicken ", " chicken salad ", " vegetable stew " and " roast beef ", and the top phrase " baked chicken " of new top phrase " chickendishes " replace old is just being used in further supposition.Also the relevant phrases of supposition " baked chicken " is " roast chicken ", " broiled chicken " and " chicken salad ".Because " chicken salad " is existing top phrase in the website, and or the relevant phrases of alternative phrase " chicken dishes ", so in the relevant phrases list of phrase " chicken salad ", the entry of " chicken salad " increases progressively.
The effect of these various more new elements is with the information updating data structure, as the alternative phrase TP of keeper's appointment
newItself be present in the website and relevant to its other phrase of putting up the indication of list relevant phrases entry.Although TP
newMay in fact not exist, but the keeper states that it is that the fact of the top phrase of archives means that this " simulation " relation data has powerful semantic basis and is the valuable interpolation of phrase data that system 100 is followed the trail of.
The top phrase is carried out more under news use substituting phrase, during above-described search procedure, will be in response to returning to the website corresponding to the inquiry that substitutes phrase (and relevant phrases).
