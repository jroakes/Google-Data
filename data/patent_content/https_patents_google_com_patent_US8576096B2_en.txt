- Combinatorial coding circuitry 106 receives vector x i and uses Factorial Pulse Coding to produce a codeword C.
- m is the total number of unit amplitude pulses
- n is the vector length.
- larger values of m and n can quickly cause problems, especially in mobile handheld devices which need to keep memory and computational complexity as low as possible.
- combinatorial function generator 108 utilizes a low complexity technique for producing F′(n, d).
- Combinatorial coding circuitry 106 then utilizes F′(n, d) to produce codeword C.
- Circuitry 108 utilizes relatively low resolution approximations (bits of precision) of factorial combinations F′(n, d), which provide only enough precision to allow a valid codeword to be generated. That is, as long as certain properties are maintained, a suitable approximation of the function F(n, d) is sufficient to guarantee that the resulting codeword is uniquely decodable.
- F(n, d) and F′(n, d) it is not necessary for F(n, d) and F′(n, d) to be equivalent in order for the resulting codeword to be uniquely decodable.
- the restriction simply says that if F′(n, d) ⁇ F(n, d), then there will be overlapping code-spaces, and subsequently, there will be more than one input capable of generating a particular codeword; thus, the codeword is not uniquely decodable.
- the second condition states that the “error” for a given n, d shall be greater than or equal to the sum of the error terms associated with the previous element of the recursive relationship described by Peng, et. al in U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960.
- F(n,d) may satisfy another inequality derived from Eq. 31 of Peng, et al. and is given by:
- P ′( i ) 2 ⁇ l(i) ⁇ 2 l(i) log 2 ( i )+1 ⁇ , i ⁇ [1, 2, . . . , n], (15)
- l(i) is a shift factor that may vary as a function of i.
- the 2 l factor is equivalent to a shift of l bits to the left, whereby the floor function ⁇ x+1 ⁇ removes the fractional bits while rounding up to the next highest integer, and finally the 2 ⁇ l factor shifts the results back to the right by l bits.
- Q′(d) can be pre-computed and stored in a table using only 28 ⁇ 4 bytes of memory for the F(144, 28) example.
- R′(k) we need to first define k as:
- k is preferably a 32 bit number with an 8 bit unsigned integer component k i and a 24 bit fractional component k f .
- R′(k) cannot be practically pre-computed for efficient real-time operation, great care must be taken in specifying the exact operations necessary in both the encoder and decoder to ensure that the reconstructed signal vector matches the input signal vector exactly.
- R′(k) may be obtained from left shifting ⁇ 2 l K f ⁇ , which can be accurately represented by l bits.
- any functions P′(i), Q′(d), and R′(k) may be used without loss of generality as long as the properties on Eqs. 10 and 11 are satisfied. Care must be taken however, that an increase in bit rate may occur if too little precision is used. It should also be noted that there is an inherent tradeoff in bit rate and complexity, and for large values of m, n, an increase of 1 or 2 bits may be a reasonable tradeoff for a significant reduction in complexity.
- n 280 and is the same for all the layers.
- the number of the pulses for encoding depends on the bit-rate of each layer. If each layer is 8 kbps, 16 kbps, or 32 kbps then they need 160 bits, 320 bits, and 640 bits for coding of 20 ms block, respectively.
- a block of length 280 can be coded using 28, 74, and 230 pulses for 160 bits, 320 bits, and 640 bits per layer, respectively.
- the multi-precision operations in equations (19) and (20) are performed on a digital signal processor which typically operates on 16-bit words.
- addition operations are needed to be performed over 10 words and for 640 bit codeword the addition operation are to be performed over 40 words.
- Each addition operation takes 4 units (generation of carry, move to array, add with carry).
- encoding/decoding of k-bit codeword in p-layers of a multi-layer system requires 400 ⁇ p ⁇ k/16 ⁇ (2m ⁇ 3) operations/sec.
- WMOPS stands for Weighted Millions of Operation Per Second.
- P′(i) are first obtained so that the unique decodability inequality F ′( n, d )> F ( n ⁇ 1 , d )+ F ′( n ⁇ 1 , d ⁇ 1) (24) is satisfied for all values of n and d.
- the binary representation F′(n, r) obtained in equation (23) has k i ⁇ l R terminating zeros if k>l R .
- F′(p k , k) is computed in a pseudo floating point format, i.e., the function R′(k) outputs an l R -bit mantissa (M) and a corresponding non-negative exponent (h).
- the maximum ratio of ⁇ k to F(p k , k) is less than k/(p k ⁇ k+1).
- these functions can be used in construction of a factorial packing codeword by modifying only a very small subset (only 3 words out of 10, 20, or 30 words) of the complete multi-precision codeword.
- the small subset is represented by a location indicator defined by integers w l and w u that identifies the words in the multi-precision codeword which are to be modified.
- the location indicator is computed as follows:
- p k ⁇ 1 max( p ) s.t. F ′( p, k ⁇ 1) ⁇ ′ k (40)
- the l R -bit mantissa and exponent representation format also have advantages in coding of the number of non-zero positions.
- the encoding of number of number of non-zero positions v is given by
- combinatorial coding circuitry 106 will receiving a signal vector (x) to be encoded.
- a first multi-precision operand ( ⁇ ′ k ) will be generated based on the signal vector to be encoded. More particularly,
- Circuitry 106 selects a portion of ⁇ ′ k to be modified based on the exponent operand.
- the portion is represented by a location indicator defined by integers w l and w u that identifies the words in the multi-precision codeword which are to be modified.
- the location indicator is computed as shown in equation (38).
- a part of ⁇ ′ k is then modified based on the mantissa operand and location indicator to produce a modified multi-precision operand ( ⁇ ′ k+1 ) as in equation (34), and a multi-precision codeword is generated for use in a corresponding decoder, based on the modified multi-precision operand as shown in equation (39).
- FIG. 2 illustrates one example of the generation of a code word via the above technique.
- the w l word of ⁇ ′ k is modified by adding a left-shifted h ⁇ 16 ⁇ w l lowest significant bits of mantissa M.
- the w l +1 to w u ⁇ 1 words are modified by adding subsequent 16-bits of mantissa M. Each of these addition involves add with a carry and a carry out is generated for the next stage.

- Decoding circuitry 306 then creates vector x i based on F′(n, d).
- Circuitry 306 operates in a similar manner as circuitry 106 , except subtraction replaces addition operations.
- Vector x i is passed to signal reconstruction circuitry 310 where the output signal (e.g., speech, audio, image, video, or other signals) is created based on x i and other parameters from other decoding circuitry 304 .
- the other parameters may include any number of signal reconstruction parameters associated with the signal coding paradigm being used in a particular embodiment. These may include, but are not limited to, signal scaling and energy parameters, and spectral shaping and/or synthesis filter parameters.

Abstract
Description
and all values of vector xi are integral valued such that −m≦xi≦m where m is the total number of unit amplitude pulses, and n is the vector length. The total M bits are used to code N combinations in a maximally efficient manner, such that the following expression, which describes the theoretical minimum number of combinations, holds true:
For this equation, F(n,d) are the number of combinations of d non-zero vector elements over n positions given by:
D(m,d) are the number of combinations of d non-zero vector elements given m total unit pulses given by:
D(m, d)=F(m−1, d−1), (4)
and 2d represents the combinations required to describe the polarity (sign) of the d non-zero vector elements. The term min(m, n) allows for the case where the number of unit magnitude pulses m exceeds the vector length n. A method and apparatus for coding and decoding vectors of this form have been fully described in the prior art. Furthermore, a practical implementation of this coding method has been described in 3GPP2 standard C.S0014-B, where the vector length n=54 and the number of unit magnitude pulses m=7 produce an M=35 bit codeword.
Direct implementation is problematic because F(144, 28) would require 197 bits of precision in the numerator and 98 bits of precision in the nominator to produce a 99 bit quotient. Since most digital signal processors (DSPs) used in today's handheld devices typically support only 16 bit×16 bit multiply operations, special multi-precision multiply/divide routines would need to be employed. Such routines require a series of nested multiply/accumulate operations that typically require on the order of k multiple/accumulate (MAC) operations, where k is the number of 16 bit segments in the operand. For a 197 bit operand, k=┌197/16┐=13. So, execution of a single 197×16 bit multiply would require a minimum of 13 MAC operations plus shifting and store operations. The denominator term is calculated in a similar manner to produce a 98 bit result. In addition, a 197/98 bit division is required, which is an extremely complex operation, thus computation of the entire factorial relation in Eq. 5 would require considerable resources.
In an effort to reduce complexity, Eq. 5 can be rewritten in to distribute the divide operations to produce the following:
In this expression, the dynamic range of the divide operations is reduced, but unfortunately, increased resolution of the quotient is needed to accurately represent division by 3, 7, 9, etc. In order to accommodate this structure, a rounding operation is also needed to guarantee an integer result. Given the large number of high precision divide operations, this implementation does not adequately address the complexity problem for large m and n, and further has the potential to produce an incorrect result due to accumulated errors in precision.
If this expression is evaluated from left to right, the result will always produce an integer value. While this method controls the precision and dynamic range issue to some degree, large values of m and n still require extensive use of multi-precision multiply and divide operations.
where the function expa(k)=ak. Next, define functions P(i), Q(d), and R(k), and substitute into Eq. 8 such that:
where P(i)=loga(i), Q(d)=Σj−1 d loga(j), and R(k)=expa(k)=ak.
However, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is not necessary for F(n, d) and F′(n, d) to be equivalent in order for the resulting codeword to be uniquely decodable. There are only two conditions that are sufficient for this to hold true:
F′(n, d)≧F(n, d), (10)
and
F′(n, d)≧F′(n−1, d)+F′(n−1, d−1). (11)
In this case, Eq. 11 has to be satisfied with strict inequality for certain (m,k), (m≦n), (k≦d), that is:
F(m, k)>F(m−1, k)+F(m−1, k−1), m≦n, k≦d. (13)
and where the conditions given in Eqs. 10 and 11 are satisfied. Considering P(i), we may wish to approximate the function such that P′(i)≧loga(i), i ε [1, 2, . . . , n]. If we choose a=2 and then restrict P′(i) to 32 bits of precision, the resulting operations are easy to implement on a handheld mobile device since most DSPs support
P′(i)=2−l(i)└2l(i)log2(i)+1┘, i ε[1, 2, . . . , n], (15)
where l(i) is a shift factor that may vary as a function of i. In the preferred embodiment, l(i)=l=21, but many other sets of values are possible. For this example, the 2l factor is equivalent to a shift of l bits to the left, whereby the floor function └x+1┘ removes the fractional bits while rounding up to the next highest integer, and finally the 2−l factor shifts the results back to the right by l bits. Using this methodology, the function P′(i)≧log2(i) for all i≧1, and also provides sufficient dynamic range and precision using only 32 bits because 9 bits of positive integer resolution in the log2 domain can represent a 512 bit number. To avoid the complexity of computing these values in real-time, they can be pre-computed and stored in a table using only 144×4 bytes of memory for the F(144, 28) example. Using a similar methodology for approximating Q(d), we get:
where the floor function └x−1┘ is used because of the subtraction of the quantity from the total. This guarantees that Q′(d)≦Σj=1 dlog2(j) so that the contribution of Q′(d) will guarantee F′(n, d)≧F(n, d). While l(j) can assume many values depending on the configuration of m and n, the preferred embodiment uses a value of l(j)=l=14 for the variable shift factor. Like P′(i), Q′(d) can be pre-computed and stored in a table using only 28×4 bytes of memory for the F(144, 28) example. For defining R′(k), we need to first define k as:
With P′(i) and Q′(d) defined above, k is preferably a 32 bit number with an 8 bit unsigned integer component ki and a 24 bit fractional component kf. Using this, we may derive R′(k)≧exp2(k)=2k by letting k=ki+kf and then taking the
R′(k)=2k
where 2k
and the code for pulse magnitudes is given by:
Thus, the formulation of these codeword requires addition of v and v−1 multi-precision numbers. Similar subtraction operations are needed in the decoder. These operations also add to the complexity of the FPC method when n and m are large. Consider encoding/decoding of an audio signal for a multi-layer embedded coding system. This technique is used for encoding the transform of the residual error signal in the three layers of the multi-layer system. Let the size of a 20 ms block is n=280 and is the same for all the layers. The number of the pulses for encoding depends on the bit-rate of each layer. If each layer is 8 kbps, 16 kbps, or 32 kbps then they need 160 bits, 320 bits, and 640 bits for coding of 20 ms block, respectively. Using the FPC technique a block of length 280 can be coded using 28, 74, and 230 pulses for 160 bits, 320 bits, and 640 bits per layer, respectively. The multi-precision operations in equations (19) and (20) are performed on a digital signal processor which typically operates on 16-bit words. Thus, for formation of 160 bit codeword, addition operations are needed to be performed over 10 words and for 640 bit codeword the addition operation are to be performed over 40 words. Each addition operation takes 4 units (generation of carry, move to array, add with carry). Hence encoding/decoding of k-bit codeword in p-layers of a multi-layer system requires 400·p·┌k/16┐·(2m−3) operations/sec. For various values of n, m, and p the complexity of the multi-precision addition/subtraction operations is shown in Table 1. In this table, WMOPS stands for Weighted Millions of Operation Per Second.

3 | 280 | 16 kbps/320 | 74 | 3.48 |
3 | 280 | 32 kbps/640 | 230 | 22.0 WMOPs |
From Table 1, we note that when the bit rate doubles, the complexity of the multi-precision addition increases six times.
where
and R′(k) is an approximation of the function R′(k)≈2k, given as:
R′(k)=└2k
where k=ki+kf is broken down into integer and fractional components of k, and Kf=2k
F′(n, d)>F(n−1, d)+F′(n−1, d−1) (24)
is satisfied for all values of n and d.
M≈└2 min(l
and the exponent h is defined as:
h=min(0, k i −l R) (28)
Now the summation in equations (25) and (26) can easily use the fact that └h/16┘ words are not affected when F′(pk, k) is added to the partial sum.
C π=(((F(p 1,1)+F(p 2,2))+F(p 3,3))+ . . . )+F(p v , v), (29)
i.e., the partial sum Ψk to which F(pk, k) is added is given by:
It can be shown that the multi-precision operand Ψk is less than F(pk, k−1). The maximum ratio of Ψk to F(pk, k) is less than k/(pk−k+1). The above ratio is infinity when k=pk+1, which is also the maximum possible value of k. Since F(pk, pk+1)=0, the carry need not be propagated in this particular case. For other values of k, this ratio is not greater than smaller of n and m. Thus
Ψk +F(p k , k)<(min(m, n)+1)F(p k , k), k≦p k (31)
Since min(m, n) is less 32768 hence the above summation will not propagate the carry more than one extra word. This suggests that if we use exact combinatorial functions in the ordered summation (29), then we get the benefit of propagating the carry to only one extra word, however exact combinatorial function do not have the advantage of trailing zeros and hence addition is performed over the length of F(pk, k).
which is less than F′(pk, k−1). Hence, the inequality
F′(p k , k−1)<32768·F′(p k , k), (33)
suffices that when F′(pk, k) is added to Ψ′k, to generate Ψ′k+1 (a modified multi-precision codeword),
Ψ′k+1=Ψ′k +F′(p k , k), (34)
a carry needs to be propagated to only one extra word. This has been empirically determined for F′(n, r), defined by equations (21), (22) and (23). Besides the unique decodabiltiy inequality, we also need to satisfy the partial sum inequality, i.e.,
Ψ′k<32768·F′(p k , k). (35)
It can be shown that if the unique decodability inequality holds for n<pk then
Ψ′k <F′(p k−1, k−1)+F′(p k−1, k−2). (36)
Thus, it is sufficient to generate P′(i) which satisfy:
32768·F′(p k , k)>F′(p k−1, k−1)+F′(p k−1, k−2) (37)
- 1. Unique decidability inequality
- 2. Trailing zeros property
- 3. Partial sum inequality

Encoding of Number of Non-Zero Positions:
It can be easily seen that the multiplication of two approximate functions can be much easier in the mantissa and exponent format than in the multi-precision format. The main advantage however is when we want to reduce the complexity then using the lR-bit mantissa and exponent representation, each of the F′(n, k) and F′(m−1, k−1) can be pre-stores using only two words (product of their lR-bit mantissa and sum of their exponent can also be pre-stored). This enables faster encoding of v without any significant ROM requirement.

As shown in
w l =└h/16┘=3,
w u=└(h+l R)/16┘+1=5
The wl word of Ψ′k is modified by adding a left-shifted h−16×wl lowest significant bits of mantissa M. The wl+1 to wu−1 words are modified by adding subsequent 16-bits of mantissa M. Each of these addition involves add with a carry and a carry out is generated for the next stage. The wu word is modified by adding only the carry out from the previous addition. Note that since lR=16, wu=wl+2. In case of the decoder subtractions are performed instead of additions.

If, on the rare occasion, the values of m and m′ are different, the line spectrum shall be modified by adding or subtracting unit values to the quantized line spectrum Xcc. This guarantees that the resulting line spectrum can be reliably coded using the factorial coding method. The output index representing the line spectrum Xcc is designated RLSIDX.
