Abstract
Caching or discarding geographic data received at a client computing device may be based on a caching policy for the geographic data. A caching policy may define conditions to process the geographic data at the client device based on several factors. For example, a current position of the client device or a position of a portion of a map displayed within a viewport of the device may cause the device to cache or discard the received geographic data. The device may determine a relationship between the viewport and the received geographic data, compare the determined relationship to the caching policy and cache or discard at least a portion of the received geographic data based on the comparison.
