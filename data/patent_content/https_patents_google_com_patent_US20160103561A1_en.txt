Definitions
- This disclosure generally relates to determining a performance metric for a thumbnail that is presented in connection with a reference to media content and/or automatically selecting a primary thumbnail to be presented for the media content based on the performance metric.
- Media content is often advertised to an end user using a thumbnail.
- a video or other media content
- each video is associated with a thumbnail that accompanies a link or other reference to the video. Clicking on the thumbnail or other portion of the reference results in a presentation of the video.
- An identification component can be configured to identify a set of thumbnails associated with an item of media content.
- a thumbnail from the set of thumbnail is to be presented in connection with a reference to the media content. Hence, when a content consumer sees a reference to the media content such can be accompanied by the thumbnail.
- An analysis component can be configured to respectively determine a performance metric associated with multiple thumbnails from the set that have been presented.
- a selection component can be configured to select from the set of thumbnails a primary thumbnail that is determined or predicted to have a best performance metric.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example system that can monitor the performance of thumbnails for an item of media content and select or update a primary thumbnail for the media content with a thumbnail that demonstrates exemplary performance in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure;
- FIG. 2A illustrates a block diagram of various examples of media content in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 2B illustrates a block diagram of various examples of thumbnails that might be associated with the various types of media content in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of various examples of the performance metric in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of an example system that can provide for additional aspects or features in connection with monitoring the performance of thumbnails for an item of media content in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram that depicts various non-limiting examples of additional input in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure

- FIG. 8 illustrates an example schematic block diagram for a computing environment in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example block diagram of a computer operable to execute certain embodiments of this disclosure.
- available media content is often listed using a thumbnail associated with the media content.
- a user can visit the hosting site (or an intermediary) and perform a search of the available media content.
- Results of the search can return a listing of available media content matching the search criteria and these results are typically accompanied by a thumbnail representing the respective media content result.
- an ad can be presented that includes a link or reference to an item of media content.
- the ad can be accompanied by a thumbnail that is representative of the media content.
- the thumbnail is selected from among the contents of the associated item of media content.
- the thumbnail is generally a particular frame of the video.
- the thumbnail can be a specific sampling portion (e.g., 20 seconds) of the audio content.
- the thumbnail can be a particular image included in the set of illustrations, and so on.
- the thumbnail can also relate to an icon presented on a user interface, such as an icon for an application, document, or the like.
- thumbnail selection can be beneficial to content owners, content consumers, content hosting sites or services, and others.
- thumbnail selection can be provided in an automated fashion that can reduce the burden on content owners and the risk of unnecessary error or missed opportunities. For example, techniques disclosed herein can be employed to prevent poor thumbnail performance. In cases where a primary thumbnail consistently performs worse than other tested thumbnails, the original thumbnail can be replaced. Thumbnail selection can also be provided in a manner that evolves over time such as responding to newly detected trends or characteristics associated with a potential content consumer, which can further improve convenience and success.
- thumbnails By way of illustration, consider a video content hosting site or service in which a user (e.g., content owner, curator, etc.) uploads a video for access by content consumers. Initially, the user might select a representative thumbnail or set of thumbnails or such might be determined in another manner, including based on techniques disclosed herein. Suppose two candidate thumbnails are selected, but as yet it is not adequately known which of the two thumbnails will be more successful in attracting content consumers to the video. In some embodiments, both thumbnails can be exposed in connection with various references to the video.
- half (or another percentage) of all references to the video can include the first candidate thumbnail and the other half (or another percentage) can include the second candidate thumbnail.
- thumbnails associated with references to the video can be continued as-is, or can converge on either one of the candidate thumbnails.
- the first candidate thumbnail performs statistically significantly more effectively than the second candidate thumbnail, then the first candidate thumbnail can be selected as the primary thumbnail.
- the primary thumbnail will be used with a substantial portion of links or references to the video.
- some references typically a small fraction, can continue to include the second candidate thumbnail or even other candidate thumbnails, which can be employed to monitor the continuing performance of the candidate thumbnails as well as the primary thumbnail.
- N candidate thumbnails can be further generalized to N candidate thumbnails, where N can be substantially any positive integer.
- N can be substantially any positive integer.
- the first candidate thumbnail can be assigned to, e.g., 95% of the references to the video that are presented (e.g., as results to a search, etc.).
- the remaining five candidate thumbnails can each be assigned to 1% (or another percentage) of the references to the video.
- the third candidate thumbnail tends to generate, e.g., 20% more clicks (or other metric related to thumbnail performance) than all other thumbnails.
- the third candidate thumbnail can replace the first candidate thumbnail as the primary thumbnail, and therefore be used in connection with 95% of the references to the video, with the remaining 5% continuing to test performance for other candidates.
- additional information can be employed in the selection of a thumbnail to display in connection with a reference to the video.
- information associated with the content consumer's device can be employed to tailor the thumbnail in a manner that is predicted or determined to result in improved performance.
- the IP address or another geo-location technique can be employed to identify an approximate location of a content consumer.
- the thumbnail served in connection with a reference to the video can differ between a first content consumer and a second content consumer due to the respective location determinations.
- Such can leverage regional differences between content consumers by selecting thumbnails determined to appeal to content consumers based on regional identity. Numerous other examples exist, such as contextual location (e.g., home vs. work), time-of-day, genre, trend data, preferences or settings, and so forth, which is further detailed herein.
- Such tailoring can even be specific to an individual device (or user), typically only limited by the relevant data that can be obtained and/or consented to.
- users can opt-out of providing personal information, demographic information, location information, proprietary information, sensitive information, machine information, or the like in connection with data gathering aspects.
- one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymizing collected, received, or transmitted data.
- System 100 can, inter alia, monitor the performance of thumbnails for an item of media content and select or update a primary thumbnail for the media content with a thumbnail that demonstrates exemplary performance.
- Embodiments disclosed herein can, for example, drive additional traffic to the media content; automate both initial and on-going thumbnail selection, which can provide added value to users and reduce the likelihood of choosing a thumbnail that results in poor performance.
- System 100 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference to FIG. 8 . It is to be appreciated that the computer 802 can be used in connection with implementing one or more of the systems or components shown and described in connection with FIG. 1 and other figures disclosed herein.
- system 100 can include an identification component 102 , an analysis component 112 , and a selection component 116 .
- Identification component 102 can be configured to identify set of thumbnails 104 associated with media content 106 .
- Set of thumbnails 104 can include substantially any number, N, of individual thumbnails 104 1 - 104 N , which are hereinafter referred to, either individually or collectively, as thumbnail(s) 104 , with appropriate subscripts generally employed only when instructive or convenient to highlight various distinctions or to better impart the disclosed concepts.
- a given thumbnail 104 can be presented in connection with a reference 108 to media content 106 .
- Reference 108 can include a link or embedded element that accesses media content 106 , or any other suitable mechanism that can be presented by user device 110 .
- reference(s) 108 can be provided as results to a search directed to media content 106 or similar items, an ad for media content 106 , a purchase transaction interface, and so forth.
- Illustration 200 depicts various examples of media content 106 and illustration 210 provides examples of thumbnails 104 that might be associated with the various types of media content 106 .
- media content 106 can be a video 202 in which case an associated thumbnail 104 might be a frame from or an image 212 that is representative of video 202 .
- image 212 will be a frame extracted from or included in video 202 , but such is not required.
- media content 106 can be an audio 204 such as, e.g., a song or other musical composition, a narration of a book or another literary work, or the like.
- the associated thumbnail 104 can be audio clip 214 .
- audio clip 214 can be a portion of audio 204 .
- selecting the right portion of audio 204 or another audio clip 214 for audio 204 can also result in improved performance. For instance, consider a first thumbnail 104 that provides a 25 second sample of the first chorus of a song versus a second thumbnail 104 that provides a 30 second sample of the second chorus of the song.
- media content 106 can be images 206 such as, for example, illustrations or plates for a book, photographs, or various other collections. References 108 to media content 206 of this type or related types can also include thumbnail 104 , which can be representative image 216 . Generally, representative image 216 can be selected from among images 206 , but such is not necessarily required. For instance, image 216 might relate to an artist, photographer, painter, or editor of the underlying media content 106 . As another example, media content 106 can be computer-based applications or apps 208 or documents or other files that are invoked by the app 208 . In that case, thumbnail 104 can be an icon 218 associated with app 208 .
- media content 106 can exist, and corresponding thumbnails 104 , unique to that type of media content 106 or otherwise, can also exist. Therefore, examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting. Rather, media content 106 can include substantially any type of content that can be accessed by way of reference 108 . Likewise, thumbnail 104 can be substantially any type of presentation that can be included in reference 108 , typically one that is representative of media content 104 .
- analysis component 112 can be configured to respectively determine performance metric 114 associated with multiple thumbnails from set of thumbnails 104 that have been presented. Hence, each of the multiple thumbnails 104 can be assigned an associated performance metric 114 , which can be determined by monitoring the performance tied to each of the multiple thumbnails 104 . Analysis component 112 can determine these performance metrics 114 in a statistical or empirical manner by monitoring various transactions associated with media content 106 and/or thumbnail(s) 104 or reference(s) 108 .
- Selection component 116 can be configured to select from the set of thumbnails 104 a primary thumbnail 118 that is determined to have a best performance metric 114 .
- Primary thumbnail 118 can be associated with media content 106 in such a way that primary thumbnail 118 can be the default thumbnail that is presented in connection to references 108 to media content 106 .
- Primary thumbnail 118 can be presented along with a significant portion of references 108 in order to leverage the superior performance analysis component 112 revealed in terms of performance metric 114 , examples of which are provided with reference to FIG. 3 .
- performance metric 114 can relate to a click rate 302 such as a number or ratio of clicks on reference 108 to access media content 106 that occur in connection with a particular thumbnail 104 included in reference 108 .
- Performance metric 114 can relate to a number or ratio of purchases 304 of media content 106 in connection with a particular thumbnail 104 .
- Performance metric 114 can also relate to a number or ratio of views of the media content 106 that result when a particular thumbnail 104 is presented in reference 108 to media content 106 .
- performance metric 114 can relate to app (e.g., app 208 ) downloads or installs 308 , which can be determined based on a ratio of the number of times app 208 is downloaded and/or installed versus a number of times an associated icon 218 or other thumbnail 104 is presented.
- Performance metric 114 can also be function of organic visits 310 , which can distinguish between a user selecting reference 108 a first time in which no action is taken (e.g., purchase 204 , download/install 308 ), but for which action is taken on a subsequent visit.
- System 400 can provide for additional aspects or features in connection with monitoring the performance of thumbnails for an item of media content 106 .
- System 400 can include identification component 102 , analysis component 112 , and selection component 116 as substantially described supra in connection with FIG. 1 and herein.
- system 400 can include sampling component 402 and update component 408 .
- Sampling component 402 can be configured to facilitate presentation 404 of multiple thumbnails 104 in connection with reference 108 to media content 106 .
- sampling component 402 can facilitate presentation 404 of a first candidate thumbnail 104 in connection with a first reference 108 to media content 106 and presentation 404 of a second candidate thumbnail 104 in connection with a second reference 108 to media content 106 .
- Sampling component 402 can manage the distribution of both candidate thumbnails, e.g., equal distribution for all references 108 to media content 106 (e.g., the first thumbnail 104 assigned to 50% of references 108 and the second thumbnail 104 assigned to the other half).
- the first thumbnail 104 might currently be deemed primary thumbnail 118 or otherwise believed to be more productive and therefore be assigned to the bulk of references 108 , e.g., 99% of references 108 , with the second thumbnail 104 assigned to the remaining 1% of references 108 .
- Such allocation of one or more thumbnails 104 to a particular percentage, proportion, or number of references 108 can be determined according to a policy associated with the content hosting site or service or another authorized entity, such as the content owner.
- the click rate, purchases, views, or other metric that is tied to a particular thumbnail 104 and/or the associated references 108 in which that particular thumbnail 104 was presented, can be received as statistical data 406 by analysis component 112 .
- Analysis component 112 can determine performance metric 114 from such statistical data 406 .
- selection component 116 can determine primary thumbnail 118 , generally as the thumbnail 104 that results in a superior performance metric 114 . Because primary thumbnail 118 is generally one that has superior performance, primary thumbnail 118 can be assigned to be associated with presentation 404 for a significant proportion of references 108 . Such can be accomplished by update component 408 .
- update component 408 can be configured to update 410 a default thumbnail 104 associated with media content 106 with primary thumbnail 118 in connection with a portion of references 108 to media content 106 .
- the primary thumbnail 118 will generally appear in a much larger percentage of references 108 relative to other thumbnails 104 .
- the benefits provided by the superior performance of the primary thumbnail 118 can be realized, while testing and analysis on a small set of references 108 can continue.
- a content owner uploads a video (e.g., media content 106 ) to a video hosting site or service.
- the content owner selects a default thumbnail (e.g., primary thumbnail 118 ) that is to accompany certain references (e.g., reference 108 ) to the content owner's video.
- the content owner can select several thumbnails (e.g., thumbnails 104 ) that can be vetted to determine which is most productive.
- one or more thumbnail can be selected without input from the content owner, for example, based on analysis relating to thumbnail 104 selection for media content 106 , trend data associated with thumbnails 104 or performance metrics 114 , analysis of media content 106 , or even randomly selected from among the contents of media content 106 or from a media repository.
- each of the four candidate thumbnails might be assigned to an equal percentage of references to the video (e.g., each candidate thumbnail appears in approximately 25% of the references to the video).
- the preferred thumbnail might be initially allocated for most of the references, e.g., 70% (since it is indicated or predicted to perform better), while each of the other three can be allocated to smaller proportions of the references, e.g., 10% each.
- sampling component 402 can facilitate thumbnail presentation 404 on a user interface of user device 110 ), for example, when such references 108 are presented based on search results, advertisements, promotions, or other web behavior.
- the content consumer might click on the reference 108 in order to access the content owner's video, or might not.
- Analysis component 112 can determine which of the thumbnails 104 was presented with the reference 108 and whether or not such resulted in a click-through (or other behavior relating to performance metric 114 ). Once at least some minimum amount of data is known (e.g., via statistical data 406 ), analysis component 112 can construct performance metric 114 for each of the candidate thumbnails.
- Selection component 116 can designate the best performing candidate thumbnail 104 as primary thumbnail 118 , which can be allocated for all references 108 to media content 106 , possibly excluding a small fraction of references 108 that can be used to present other thumbnails 104 for on-going comparison or analysis.
- identification component 102 can be configured to periodically reevaluate set of thumbnails 104 and identify a new set of thumbnails (not shown) that differs from set of thumbnails 104 . Thereafter, analysis component 112 can, respectively, determine performance metric 114 for thumbnails in the new set of thumbnails, e.g., based on statistical data 406 that result from thumbnail presentations 404 . Based on such analysis, selection component 116 can select primary thumbnail 118 from among the new set of thumbnails and update 410 can be applied such that a significant percentage of references 108 to media content 106 will present the primary thumbnail 118 . In some embodiments, selection component 116 can select primary thumbnail 118 further based on information associated with user devices 110 that present references 108 . Such information is denoted additional input 412 and further detailed in connection with FIG. 5 .

Abstract
References to videos or other media content are often accompanied by a thumbnail that is in some way representative of the video. Selection of this thumbnail can have a significant impact on the productivity of the reference, e.g., in driving traffic to the underlying video or other media content. Accordingly, the performance of various candidate thumbnails can be monitored and the thumbnail that performs best can be selected as the primary thumbnail, which can be presented most often in connection with references to the video or other media content.
Description
- This disclosure generally relates to determining a performance metric for a thumbnail that is presented in connection with a reference to media content and/or automatically selecting a primary thumbnail to be presented for the media content based on the performance metric.
- Media content is often advertised to an end user using a thumbnail. For example, consider a video (or other media content) hosting site or service that lists the videos that are available from the hosting site or service. Typically, each video is associated with a thumbnail that accompanies a link or other reference to the video. Clicking on the thumbnail or other portion of the reference results in a presentation of the video.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate the scope of any particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented in this disclosure.
- Systems disclosed herein relate to selecting a thumbnail determined or predicted to provide superior performance. An identification component can be configured to identify a set of thumbnails associated with an item of media content. A thumbnail from the set of thumbnail is to be presented in connection with a reference to the media content. Hence, when a content consumer sees a reference to the media content such can be accompanied by the thumbnail. An analysis component can be configured to respectively determine a performance metric associated with multiple thumbnails from the set that have been presented. A selection component can be configured to select from the set of thumbnails a primary thumbnail that is determined or predicted to have a best performance metric.
- The following description and the drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.
- Numerous aspects, embodiments, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:

FIG. 8 illustrates an example schematic block diagram for a computing environment in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure; and -
FIG. 9 illustrates an example block diagram of a computer operable to execute certain embodiments of this disclosure. - When considering a media content hosting site or service, available media content is often listed using a thumbnail associated with the media content. For example, a user can visit the hosting site (or an intermediary) and perform a search of the available media content. Results of the search can return a listing of available media content matching the search criteria and these results are typically accompanied by a thumbnail representing the respective media content result. As another example, an ad can be presented that includes a link or reference to an item of media content. Similarly, the ad can be accompanied by a thumbnail that is representative of the media content.
- In many cases, the thumbnail is selected from among the contents of the associated item of media content. For example, if the media content is a video, then the thumbnail is generally a particular frame of the video. If the media content is audio content (e.g., a song or audio transcript, etc.), the thumbnail can be a specific sampling portion (e.g., 20 seconds) of the audio content. If the media content relates to illustrations of a book or graphic novel, then the thumbnail can be a particular image included in the set of illustrations, and so on. In addition, the thumbnail can also relate to an icon presented on a user interface, such as an icon for an application, document, or the like.
- However, regardless of whether the thumbnail draws from the media content itself or is independent of the media content (e.g., other content), the thumbnail is generally in some way representative of the media content. Research indicates that selection of the thumbnail to be presented in connection with a reference to an associated item of media content can have a significant impact on directing traffic to the associated item of media content. Thus, improving or optimizing thumbnail selection can be beneficial to content owners, content consumers, content hosting sites or services, and others. In addition, thumbnail selection can be provided in an automated fashion that can reduce the burden on content owners and the risk of unnecessary error or missed opportunities. For example, techniques disclosed herein can be employed to prevent poor thumbnail performance. In cases where a primary thumbnail consistently performs worse than other tested thumbnails, the original thumbnail can be replaced. Thumbnail selection can also be provided in a manner that evolves over time such as responding to newly detected trends or characteristics associated with a potential content consumer, which can further improve convenience and success.
- By way of illustration, consider a video content hosting site or service in which a user (e.g., content owner, curator, etc.) uploads a video for access by content consumers. Initially, the user might select a representative thumbnail or set of thumbnails or such might be determined in another manner, including based on techniques disclosed herein. Suppose two candidate thumbnails are selected, but as yet it is not adequately known which of the two thumbnails will be more successful in attracting content consumers to the video. In some embodiments, both thumbnails can be exposed in connection with various references to the video.
- For example, half (or another percentage) of all references to the video can include the first candidate thumbnail and the other half (or another percentage) can include the second candidate thumbnail. Over time, if no statistically significant distinction is revealed between the performance of the first candidate thumbnail and the second, then thumbnails associated with references to the video can be continued as-is, or can converge on either one of the candidate thumbnails. On the other hand, if the first candidate thumbnail performs statistically significantly more effectively than the second candidate thumbnail, then the first candidate thumbnail can be selected as the primary thumbnail. Typically, the primary thumbnail will be used with a substantial portion of links or references to the video. However, some references, typically a small fraction, can continue to include the second candidate thumbnail or even other candidate thumbnails, which can be employed to monitor the continuing performance of the candidate thumbnails as well as the primary thumbnail.
- Such can be further generalized to N candidate thumbnails, where N can be substantially any positive integer. For example, suppose N=6, where the first candidate thumbnail is believed to be the most effective. In that case, the first candidate thumbnail can be assigned to, e.g., 95% of the references to the video that are presented (e.g., as results to a search, etc.). The remaining five candidate thumbnails can each be assigned to 1% (or another percentage) of the references to the video. Further suppose that it is detected that the third candidate thumbnail tends to generate, e.g., 20% more clicks (or other metric related to thumbnail performance) than all other thumbnails. In that case, the third candidate thumbnail can replace the first candidate thumbnail as the primary thumbnail, and therefore be used in connection with 95% of the references to the video, with the remaining 5% continuing to test performance for other candidates.
- In some embodiments, additional information can be employed in the selection of a thumbnail to display in connection with a reference to the video. For example, if available and consensual, information associated with the content consumer's device can be employed to tailor the thumbnail in a manner that is predicted or determined to result in improved performance. For instance, the IP address or another geo-location technique can be employed to identify an approximate location of a content consumer. Thus, the thumbnail served in connection with a reference to the video can differ between a first content consumer and a second content consumer due to the respective location determinations. Such can leverage regional differences between content consumers by selecting thumbnails determined to appeal to content consumers based on regional identity. Numerous other examples exist, such as contextual location (e.g., home vs. work), time-of-day, genre, trend data, preferences or settings, and so forth, which is further detailed herein. Such tailoring can even be specific to an individual device (or user), typically only limited by the relevant data that can be obtained and/or consented to.
- Various aspects or features of this disclosure are described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In this specification, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. It should be understood, however, that certain aspects of disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate describing the subject disclosure.
- It is to be appreciated that in accordance with one or more implementations described in this disclosure, users can opt-out of providing personal information, demographic information, location information, proprietary information, sensitive information, machine information, or the like in connection with data gathering aspects. Moreover, one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymizing collected, received, or transmitted data.
- Referring now to
FIG. 1 , asystem 100 is depicted.System 100 can, inter alia, monitor the performance of thumbnails for an item of media content and select or update a primary thumbnail for the media content with a thumbnail that demonstrates exemplary performance. Embodiments disclosed herein can, for example, drive additional traffic to the media content; automate both initial and on-going thumbnail selection, which can provide added value to users and reduce the likelihood of choosing a thumbnail that results in poor performance.System 100 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference toFIG. 8 . It is to be appreciated that thecomputer 802 can be used in connection with implementing one or more of the systems or components shown and described in connection withFIG. 1 and other figures disclosed herein. As depicted,system 100 can include anidentification component 102, ananalysis component 112, and aselection component 116. -
Identification component 102 can be configured to identify set ofthumbnails 104 associated withmedia content 106. Set ofthumbnails 104 can include substantially any number, N, of individual thumbnails 104 1-104 N, which are hereinafter referred to, either individually or collectively, as thumbnail(s) 104, with appropriate subscripts generally employed only when instructive or convenient to highlight various distinctions or to better impart the disclosed concepts. A giventhumbnail 104 can be presented in connection with areference 108 tomedia content 106.Reference 108 can include a link or embedded element that accessesmedia content 106, or any other suitable mechanism that can be presented byuser device 110. For example, reference(s) 108 can be provided as results to a search directed tomedia content 106 or similar items, an ad formedia content 106, a purchase transaction interface, and so forth. - While still referring to
FIG. 1 , but turning also toFIGS. 2A and 2B ,illustrations Illustration 200 depicts various examples ofmedia content 106 andillustration 210 provides examples ofthumbnails 104 that might be associated with the various types ofmedia content 106. For example,media content 106 can be avideo 202 in which case an associatedthumbnail 104 might be a frame from or animage 212 that is representative ofvideo 202. Typically,image 212 will be a frame extracted from or included invideo 202, but such is not required. - As another example,
media content 106 can be an audio 204 such as, e.g., a song or other musical composition, a narration of a book or another literary work, or the like. In such cases, the associatedthumbnail 104 can beaudio clip 214. In some embodiments,audio clip 214 can be a portion ofaudio 204. Hence, just as selecting theright image 212 to serve asthumbnail 104 forvideo 202 can lead to improved performance, selecting the right portion ofaudio 204 or anotheraudio clip 214 foraudio 204 can also result in improved performance. For instance, consider afirst thumbnail 104 that provides a 25 second sample of the first chorus of a song versus asecond thumbnail 104 that provides a 30 second sample of the second chorus of the song. - As a third example,
media content 106 can beimages 206 such as, for example, illustrations or plates for a book, photographs, or various other collections.References 108 tomedia content 206 of this type or related types can also includethumbnail 104, which can berepresentative image 216. Generally,representative image 216 can be selected from amongimages 206, but such is not necessarily required. For instance,image 216 might relate to an artist, photographer, painter, or editor of theunderlying media content 106. As another example,media content 106 can be computer-based applications orapps 208 or documents or other files that are invoked by theapp 208. In that case,thumbnail 104 can be anicon 218 associated withapp 208. Other examples ofmedia content 106 can exist, andcorresponding thumbnails 104, unique to that type ofmedia content 106 or otherwise, can also exist. Therefore, examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting. Rather,media content 106 can include substantially any type of content that can be accessed by way ofreference 108. Likewise,thumbnail 104 can be substantially any type of presentation that can be included inreference 108, typically one that is representative ofmedia content 104. - Still referring to
FIG. 1 ,analysis component 112 can be configured to respectively determine performance metric 114 associated with multiple thumbnails from set ofthumbnails 104 that have been presented. Hence, each of themultiple thumbnails 104 can be assigned an associatedperformance metric 114, which can be determined by monitoring the performance tied to each of themultiple thumbnails 104.Analysis component 112 can determine theseperformance metrics 114 in a statistical or empirical manner by monitoring various transactions associated withmedia content 106 and/or thumbnail(s) 104 or reference(s) 108. -
Selection component 116 can be configured to select from the set of thumbnails 104 aprimary thumbnail 118 that is determined to have abest performance metric 114.Primary thumbnail 118 can be associated withmedia content 106 in such a way thatprimary thumbnail 118 can be the default thumbnail that is presented in connection toreferences 108 tomedia content 106.Primary thumbnail 118 can be presented along with a significant portion ofreferences 108 in order to leverage the superiorperformance analysis component 112 revealed in terms ofperformance metric 114, examples of which are provided with reference toFIG. 3 . - While still referring to
FIG. 1 , but turning as well toFIG. 3 ,illustration 300 depicts various examples ofperformance metric 114. For example,performance metric 114 can relate to aclick rate 302 such as a number or ratio of clicks onreference 108 to accessmedia content 106 that occur in connection with aparticular thumbnail 104 included inreference 108. Performance metric 114 can relate to a number or ratio ofpurchases 304 ofmedia content 106 in connection with aparticular thumbnail 104. Performance metric 114 can also relate to a number or ratio of views of themedia content 106 that result when aparticular thumbnail 104 is presented inreference 108 tomedia content 106. - As another example,
performance metric 114 can relate to app (e.g., app 208) downloads or installs 308, which can be determined based on a ratio of the number oftimes app 208 is downloaded and/or installed versus a number of times an associatedicon 218 orother thumbnail 104 is presented. Performance metric 114 can also be function oforganic visits 310, which can distinguish between a user selecting reference 108 a first time in which no action is taken (e.g.,purchase 204, download/install 308), but for which action is taken on a subsequent visit. - Turning now to
FIG. 4 ,system 400 is provided.System 400 can provide for additional aspects or features in connection with monitoring the performance of thumbnails for an item ofmedia content 106.System 400 can includeidentification component 102,analysis component 112, andselection component 116 as substantially described supra in connection withFIG. 1 and herein. In addition,system 400 can includesampling component 402 andupdate component 408. -
Sampling component 402 can be configured to facilitatepresentation 404 ofmultiple thumbnails 104 in connection withreference 108 tomedia content 106. For example,sampling component 402 can facilitatepresentation 404 of afirst candidate thumbnail 104 in connection with afirst reference 108 tomedia content 106 andpresentation 404 of asecond candidate thumbnail 104 in connection with asecond reference 108 tomedia content 106.Sampling component 402 can manage the distribution of both candidate thumbnails, e.g., equal distribution for allreferences 108 to media content 106 (e.g., thefirst thumbnail 104 assigned to 50% ofreferences 108 and thesecond thumbnail 104 assigned to the other half). As another example, thefirst thumbnail 104 might currently be deemedprimary thumbnail 118 or otherwise believed to be more productive and therefore be assigned to the bulk ofreferences 108, e.g., 99% ofreferences 108, with thesecond thumbnail 104 assigned to the remaining 1% ofreferences 108. Such allocation of one ormore thumbnails 104 to a particular percentage, proportion, or number ofreferences 108 can be determined according to a policy associated with the content hosting site or service or another authorized entity, such as the content owner. - The click rate, purchases, views, or other metric that is tied to a
particular thumbnail 104 and/or the associatedreferences 108 in which thatparticular thumbnail 104 was presented, can be received asstatistical data 406 byanalysis component 112.Analysis component 112 can determine performance metric 114 from suchstatistical data 406. Onceperformance metrics 114 for all or a portion ofthumbnails 104 are determined,selection component 116 can determineprimary thumbnail 118, generally as thethumbnail 104 that results in asuperior performance metric 114. Becauseprimary thumbnail 118 is generally one that has superior performance,primary thumbnail 118 can be assigned to be associated withpresentation 404 for a significant proportion ofreferences 108. Such can be accomplished byupdate component 408. - For example,
update component 408 can be configured to update 410 adefault thumbnail 104 associated withmedia content 106 withprimary thumbnail 118 in connection with a portion ofreferences 108 tomedia content 106. As one result, theprimary thumbnail 118 will generally appear in a much larger percentage ofreferences 108 relative toother thumbnails 104. Hence, the benefits provided by the superior performance of theprimary thumbnail 118 can be realized, while testing and analysis on a small set ofreferences 108 can continue. - By way of illustration, consider the following scenario in which a non-limiting concrete example of the disclosed subject matter is provided. A content owner uploads a video (e.g., media content 106) to a video hosting site or service. During the upload process, the content owner selects a default thumbnail (e.g., primary thumbnail 118) that is to accompany certain references (e.g., reference 108) to the content owner's video. In some embodiments, the content owner can select several thumbnails (e.g., thumbnails 104) that can be vetted to determine which is most productive. In some embodiments, one or more thumbnail can be selected without input from the content owner, for example, based on analysis relating to
thumbnail 104 selection formedia content 106, trend data associated withthumbnails 104 orperformance metrics 114, analysis ofmedia content 106, or even randomly selected from among the contents ofmedia content 106 or from a media repository. - Suppose that after the upload process, four candidate thumbnails have been identified, but no preferential weight is given to any of the four. In that case, each of the four candidate thumbnails might be assigned to an equal percentage of references to the video (e.g., each candidate thumbnail appears in approximately 25% of the references to the video). Alternatively, it might be determined, either by the content owner or systems or components detailed herein that one of the four is preferred and/or predicted or determined to yield better performance. In that case, the preferred thumbnail might be initially allocated for most of the references, e.g., 70% (since it is indicated or predicted to perform better), while each of the other three can be allocated to smaller proportions of the references, e.g., 10% each.
- Over time, content consumers will be exposed to references to the video (e.g.,
sampling component 402 can facilitatethumbnail presentation 404 on a user interface of user device 110), for example, whensuch references 108 are presented based on search results, advertisements, promotions, or other web behavior. When exposed, the content consumer might click on thereference 108 in order to access the content owner's video, or might not.Analysis component 112 can determine which of thethumbnails 104 was presented with thereference 108 and whether or not such resulted in a click-through (or other behavior relating to performance metric 114). Once at least some minimum amount of data is known (e.g., via statistical data 406),analysis component 112 can constructperformance metric 114 for each of the candidate thumbnails.Selection component 116 can designate the bestperforming candidate thumbnail 104 asprimary thumbnail 118, which can be allocated for allreferences 108 tomedia content 106, possibly excluding a small fraction ofreferences 108 that can be used to presentother thumbnails 104 for on-going comparison or analysis. - In some embodiments,
identification component 102 can be configured to periodically reevaluate set ofthumbnails 104 and identify a new set of thumbnails (not shown) that differs from set ofthumbnails 104. Thereafter,analysis component 112 can, respectively, determineperformance metric 114 for thumbnails in the new set of thumbnails, e.g., based onstatistical data 406 that result fromthumbnail presentations 404. Based on such analysis,selection component 116 can selectprimary thumbnail 118 from among the new set of thumbnails and update 410 can be applied such that a significant percentage ofreferences 108 tomedia content 106 will present theprimary thumbnail 118. In some embodiments,selection component 116 can selectprimary thumbnail 118 further based on information associated withuser devices 110 that present references 108. Such information is denotedadditional input 412 and further detailed in connection withFIG. 5 . - With reference now to
FIG. 5 ,illustration 500 is provided that depicts various non-limiting examples ofadditional input 412. For instance,additional input 412 can relate tolocation 502 such as a particular geographic region. To provide a concrete example of howlocation 502 might be used, consider the following. LeBron James is a very popular athlete who left a sports team in Ohio to join a sports team in Florida. As a result, James' popularity is greater in Florida than many other places, and is less popular in Ohio than many other places. Consider a video of a basketball program in which a still image of LeBron James jumping to dunk the basketball is selected asprimary thumbnail 118. Consider further that a content consumer in which areference 108 to the video is presented lives in Ohio, as determined bylocation 502, where James is generally less popular. Based on suchadditional information 412,primary thumbnail 118 for that particular presentation ofreference 108 might be altered byselection component 116 orsampling component 402 to select and/or present athumbnail 104 deemed to be more productive in Ohio. - In some embodiments,
additional input 412 can relate tocontextual location 504. For example, selection and/or presentation of athumbnail 104 in aparticular reference 108 can be modified based upon whether the content consumer (or by proxy user device 110) is at home versus at work, as suchcontextual location 504 can have a significant impact on what a content consumer finds appealing. Other examples ofadditional input 412 can include, e.g.,calendar time 506 such as a time of day, day of the week, holiday, and so forth;genre 508 or other category relating to the underlying media content 106 (e.g., comedy, news, entertainment, etc.); ortrend data 510 such as rising or declining popularity, memes, or the like, promotions or other scheduled events. - Another example of
additional input 412 can be preferences/settings 512, which can relate todevice 110. Such can relate to language, likes, dislikes, or associated equipment or features. For instance, device type or screen resolution can determine whethercertain thumbnails 104 are available or might be used to determine whether a high-resolution thumbnail 104 should be selected or a low-resolution thumbnail 104.Demographics 514 relating touser device 110, the content owner, the content consumer, or another relevant entity can serve as another example ofadditional input 412. Further, another example ofadditional input 412 can behistory 516.History 516 can relate to a browser history or a particular (e.g., current) session history or the like. For example, in cases where a content consumer is presenting content that is determined to be adult content, then adult-themed thumbnail 104 might be preferred. In contrast, the same user or a different user that has ahistory 516 of presenting content rated for children might result in a determination that adult-themed thumbnail 104 is not appropriate and therefore should not be selected for presentation. It is understood that other suitable examples ofadditional input 412 can exist, and can include any suitable data or information that can have an impact on what a content consumer might find appealing or interesting. It is further understood that all suchadditional input 412 can be collected based on user authorization and/or consent. -
FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate various methodologies in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts within the context of various flowcharts, it is to be understood and appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. Additionally, it is to be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this disclosure are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device or storage media. -
FIG. 6 illustratesexemplary method 600.Method 600 can provide for selecting a primary thumbnail for the media content with a thumbnail that demonstrates superior performance. For example, atreference numeral 602, multiple candidate thumbnails to be used in connection with a presentation of a reference to a video (or other media content) can be identified (e.g., by an identification component).Method 600 can proceed to insert A, discussed in connection withFIG. 7 or to reference numeral 604. - At
reference numeral 604, a performance of the multiple candidate thumbnails can be respectively determined (e.g., by an analysis component). The respective performances can be determined based on a performance metric resulting from a presentation of an associated candidate thumbnail in connection with the presentation of the reference to the video. - At
reference numeral 606, a primary thumbnail can be selected from among the multiple candidate thumbnails (e.g., by a selection component). The primary thumbnail can be selected in response to a determination that the selected candidate thumbnail yields a best performance in connection with the performance metric. The performance metric can be related to, for instance, clicks, views, purchases, or another metric in connection with the reference in which the associated candidate thumbnail is presented.Method 600 proceeds to insert B detailed in connection withFIG. 7 or ends. - Turning now to
FIG. 7 ,exemplary method 700 is depicted.Method 700 can provide for additional features or aspects in connection with selecting a primary thumbnail for the media content.Method 700 can begin at the start of insert A or the start of insert B. Atreference numeral 702, the multiple candidate thumbnails identified atreference numeral 602 ofFIG. 6 can be identified further based on input received in connection with an upload of the video to a video hosting site or service, analysis relating to thumbnail selection for the video, trend data associated with thumbnail performance, or another suitable means.Method 700 can end or proceed to the start of insert B. - At
reference numeral 704 presentations of the candidate thumbnails can be respectively facilitated (e.g., by a sampling component). Such presentations can be provided in connection with respective presentations of various references to the video. For example, references to the video can be presented in connection with a search for related content, as an ad placement, a promotion and so forth. When these references are presented (e.g., by a device of a content consumer), the references can be accompanied by one of the candidate thumbnails. - At
reference numeral 706, a candidate thumbnail from the multiple candidate thumbnails to be used in connection with a presentation of a reference to the video can be updated with the primary thumbnail (e.g., by an update component). Hence, the primary thumbnail, which is typically determined to be the most productive at least in terms of a particular performance metric, can be represented more often with the various references to the video. - At
reference numeral 708, the primary thumbnail (or another thumbnail that is to be presented in connection with a particular reference to the video) can be selected further based on data associated with a user device that presents the reference to the video. For example, the primary thumbnail (or another thumbnail to be presented) can be tailored to the content consumer in order to increase the potential performance of the thumbnail that is presented. Such tailoring can be based on the data, which can relate to, e.g., location, contextual location, calendar time, genre, trend data, preferences or settings, demographics, or other suitable data.Method 700 ends. - The systems and processes described below can be embodied within hardware, such as a single integrated circuit (IC) chip, multiple ICs, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or the like. Further, the order in which some or all of the process blocks appear in each process should not be deemed limiting. Rather, it should be understood that some of the process blocks can be executed in a variety of orders, not all of which may be explicitly illustrated herein.
