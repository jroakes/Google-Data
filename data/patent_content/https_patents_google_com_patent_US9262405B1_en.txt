- the data processing system 110 can remove the user interface 200 from the web browser 210 without translating the text of the electronic document 205 and can refrain from displaying the user interface 200 on electronic documents delivered to computing device 120 in the future.
- the data processing system 110 can also include a user profile module 135 for creating, modifying, or storing information associated with computing device 120 .
- the data processing system can deliver electronic documents to the computing device 120 , along with an interface offering to translate the documents, as described above in connection with FIG. 2 .
- the user profile module 135 can receive a response from the computing device 120 when a user interacts with the interface, and can use the response to create or modify the user profile for the computing device 120 .
- the data structure 300 can be stored by the data processing system 110 , for example as an expandable array, a linked list, a vector, or a table in the database 140 .
- User profile module 135 can create a new profile in the data structure 300 for the computing device 120 , or can determine that a profile for the computing device 120 already exists.
- each user profile stored in the data structure 300 can include a unique identifier 302 , such as an IP address, a telephone number, or a cookie data file.
- User profile module 135 can determine the identifier 302 by examining a cookie data file received from computing device 120 .
- user profile module 135 can search through each of the profiles stored in the data structure 300 . If one of the existing profiles has an identifier 302 that matches the identifier from computing device 120 , user profile module 135 can determine that a profile for computing device 120 already exists. Alternatively, if there is no existing user profile with a matching identifier 302 , user profile module 135 can determine that a profile for computing device 120 does not yet exist and can create a new profile for computing device 120 , for example by inserting information into the data structure 300 corresponding to the new profile.
- a profile created by user profile module 135 can store information associated with the computing device 120 or with the user of the computing device 120 .
- the profile created by user profile module 135 can include information about the languages 304 understood by a user of computing device 120 , a proficiency 306 associated with each language, a number of requests 308 to translate content into the language, a geographic parameter 310 , and a turn-off parameter 312 .
- the user profile module 135 can update the user profile for the computing device 120 in response to the network activity of computing device 120 .
- the data processing system 110 can serve multiple electronic documents to computing device 120 over a period of time.
- the language translation module 130 can determine the language of text in the document.
- the user profile module 135 can use this information to modify the profile for the computing device 120 .
- the user profile module can assign a relatively high value to the proficiency for a given language in response to computing device 120 requesting a large number of electronic documents written in that language.
- the proficiency level 306 can be a numeric score indicating how well the user understands a given language.
- the proficiency level 306 is an integer from 1 to 3, with a value of 1 indicating the lowest level of proficiency and a value of 3 indicating the highest level of proficiency.
- the user profile module 135 can assess the proficiency level for a language based on the number of requests initiated by computing device 120 to translate an electronic document into that language. For example, if a computing device 120 makes a large number of requests to translate documents from other languages into Japanese, the user profile module 135 can record the number of translation requests in the user profile. The user profile module 135 can also determine that the user of computing device 120 likely has a high level of understanding of Japanese, and can assign a high value for the proficiency level 306 associated with Japanese. The user profile module 135 can also adjust the proficiency level associated with a language based on the language complexity in electronic documents displayed on computing device 120 . For example, the language translation module 130 can evaluate the complexity of language in a document delivered to computing device 120 .
- the content publisher 125 can select a level of complexity for the electronic document. If the user of computing device 120 chooses to translate documents having a high complexity in a given language, but does not choose to translate documents having an intermediate complexity in the same language, the user profile module can assign an intermediate value to the proficiency level for that language in the user profile corresponding to computing device 120 . Similarly, if the user chooses to translate documents having a low complexity, the user profile module 135 can determine that the user has a low level of proficiency in the language, and can update the corresponding user profile accordingly.
- the user profile module 135 can also determine a geographic parameter 310 that may be relevant to the computing device 120 , and can store the geographic parameter 310 in the data structure 300 .
- the user profile module 135 can include in a user profile the country or region where the computing device 120 is located. If there is a lack of other information about the computing device 120 , the user profile module 135 can determine the likely language skills of a user based on the location of the computing device 120 . For example, the user profile module 135 can assign a high value to the proficiency level for Spanish if the computing device 120 is located in Spain, even if the computing device 120 has not requested a large number of electronic documents in Spanish.
- the user profile module 135 can also store a turn-off parameter 312 in a user profile.
- the turn-off parameter 312 can be a binary value indicating whether the user is interested in language translation services.
- the data processing system 110 can display the user interface 200 at computing device 120 and the user can select option 220 c , which indicates that the user is not interested in translation services.
- the user profile module 135 can then assign a value of 1 to the turn-off parameter 312 for computing device 120 .
- the data processing system can examine the turn-off parameter 312 stored in the user profile for computing device 120 . If the turn-off parameter 312 has a value of 1, the data processing system can refrain from offering to translate the electronic document.
- the user profile module 135 can receive network activity from the computing device 120 over a predetermined period of time.
- the browser history data received by user profile module 135 may indicate those web pages displayed on computing device 120 within the past half hour, day, week, month, year, etc. If network activity from computing device 120 has been stored in database 140 , the user profile module 135 may retrieve only data that was collected during a predetermined period of time to make determinations about the language skills and preferences of a user of computing device 120 . This can help to ensure that the language information in the user profile associated with computing device 120 is current.
- the data processing system 110 can receive content from supplemental content provider 115 .
- the content from supplemental content provider 115 can be provided along with the requested content.
- content publisher 125 will request that a supplemental content item be delivered to computing device 120 along with the electronic document.
- the request for supplemental content can be received by the data processing system 110 .
- the data processing system 115 can receive supplemental content items from any number of supplemental content providers 115 .
- the supplemental content items can be stored in the data processing system 110 , for example in the database 140 .
- the data processing system 110 can use the user profile to select a supplemental content item to be served to the computing device 120 .
- the data processing system 110 can determine from the user profile that the computing device 120 is located in Germany, but that the user of the computing device 120 is not proficient in German. In this instance, the data processing system 110 can choose to serve a supplemental content item that is not written in the local language (i.e., German), but is instead written in a different language.
- the supplemental content item can be served in a different language than the electronic document with which it is displayed.
- the data processing system 110 may select a supplemental content item that was originally received in English from supplemental content provider 115 , and may serve this content item for display at the computing device 120 .
- the data processing system 110 may select a supplemental content item that was originally received in German (or any other language) from supplemental content provider 115 , and may use the language translation module 130 to translate the supplemental content item into English.
- the translated supplemental content item can then be delivered to the computing device 120 for display.
- the data processing system 110 can select a supplemental content item based on the local language, even if the user profile for computing device 120 indicates that the user is more proficient in a different language.
- the supplemental content provider 115 may prefer that the content be shown in its original language. It may also be difficult to accurately translate the language from the content item into the user's preferred language, (e.g., the content item may include complex language or proper nouns).
- a supplemental content item can include an associated geographic parameter selected by the supplemental content provider 115 .
- Delivering the supplemental content item in its original language can also avoid the possibility of inaccurate translations, which could be misleading to the user of computing device 120 .
- the data processing system 110 can use information from the user profile to improve the probability that the user will understand the language of the supplemental content item.
- the data processing system 110 can serve to the computing device 120 a supplemental content item whose language is below a threshold level of complexity based on the user's proficiency.
- the language translation module 130 can determine the level of complexity of the supplemental content item.
- the supplemental content provider can include an indication of the level of complexity in the supplemental content, which can be stored by the data processing system.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
- a flow diagram is shown depicting a method 400 of serving a content item to a user in a specific language.
- the method 400 includes the steps of providing an electronic document (Step 405 ), receiving a translation request (Step 410 ), storing a language parameter in a memory device (Step 415 ), receiving a request for a supplemental content item (Step 420 ), selecting the supplemental content item based on the language parameter and a geographical parameter (Step 425 ), and providing the content item (Step 430 ).
- the method 400 includes the step of providing an electronic document (Step 405 ).
- a computing device can submit a request for an electronic document, such as a website or an email.
- a user of the computing device can make a request by entering a uniform resource locator (URL) into a web browsing program, or by clicking on a hyperlink on a webpage.
- a data processing system can respond to the request by delivering the requested content for display at the computing device.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the method 400 also includes the step of receiving a translation request (Step 410 ).
- the electronic document served to the computing device can include text in any language.
- the user of the computing device may not understand the language in which the electronic document is written. For example, the user may comprehend only Dutch and Spanish, but may request an electronic document with Japanese text.
- the data processing system can then offer to translate the text into a language that the user understands, for example by displaying a user interface prompting the user to select whether or not he would like to have the document translated. If the user chooses to have the document translated, the data processing system can receive the request to translate the document, and can then serve a translated version of the document for display to the user.
- the data processing system can include a language translation module configured to translate text from a first language into a second language.
- the user can choose not to translate the document, in which case the data processing system will not translate the document.
- the user may also choose not to have translation services offered in connection with future requests for electronic documents.
- the method 400 includes the step of storing a language parameter in a memory device (Step 415 ).
- a language parameter can be stored based on the translation request received in Step 410 .
- more than one language parameter can be stored.
- Language parameters can include language proficiencies, requests to translate text into a language, geographic parameters, or turn-off parameters to indicate that the user does not wish to receive translation services in the future.
- the language parameter can be stored in a user profile.
- the user profile can include a client identifier associated with the computing device and a plurality of language parameters. For example, if the user of the computing device chooses to translate a document from Portuguese into Mandarin, language parameters relating to this request can be stored in the user profile associated with the computing device. In this example, it is likely that the user understands Mandarin but does not understand Portuguese, so a high proficiency associated with Mandarin can be stored in the user profile, and a low proficiency associated with Portuguese can be stored in the user profile. Similarly, if the user requests the Portuguese document and does not choose to translate it, a high proficiency can be stored and associated with Portuguese. Activity relating to subsequent requests for electronic documents can also be stored in the user profile. For example, subsequent network activity of the computing device can indicate that the user has varying levels of understanding of other languages, and corresponding proficiency levels can be stored for these additional languages in the user profile.
- a geographic parameter can be stored in the user profile based on the country or region in which the computing device is located. If the user chooses not to have translation services offered in the future, a turn-off parameter can be stored in the profile, indicating that the data processing system should not prompt the user with an offer to translate text during a subsequent browsing session.
- the method 400 includes the step of receiving a request for a supplemental content item (Step 420 ).
- the publisher of the requested electronic document may request that supplemental content be delivered to the computing device along with the electronic document.
- the content publisher may request that supplemental content be displayed at the computing device in a predetermined location in the electronic document.
- the content publisher can also request that supplemental content be displayed in a separate pop-up window that is created when the electronic document is displayed on the computing device.
- Such a request for supplemental content can be received by the data processing system.
- the method 400 includes the step of selecting a supplemental content item based on a language parameter and a geographical parameter (Step 425 ).
- Supplemental content items may be received by the data processing system from many different supplemental content providers.
- the supplemental content items can be stored by the data processing system, for example in a database associated with the data processing system, and can later be retrieved for delivery to the computing device.
- the data processing system can select a supplemental content item that a user is likely to understand by selecting the supplemental content item based at least in part on the language parameters in the user profile associated with the computing device of the user.
- the data processing system can select a supplemental content item in a language that is different from the predominant language where the computing device is located. For example, as described above in connection with Step 415 , the data processing system can store a geographic parameter in the user profile. If the geographic parameter indicates that the computing device is located in Italy, but the proficiency parameter associated with Italian indicates that the user has a low level of comprehension of Italian language, the data processing system can select a supplemental content item in a language in which the user has a higher proficiency level. The data processing system may also select a supplemental content item which originally included Italian language, but which has been translated into a language that the user is more likely to understand. The translation may be performed by the data processing system.
- the data processing system can select a supplemental content item based on the predominant language where the computing device is located. For example, as described above in connection with Step 415 , the data processing system can store a geographic parameter in the user profile. If the geographic parameter indicates that the computing device is located in Italy, the data processing system can select a supplemental content item that includes Italian text. A local language supplemental content item can be selected even if the user of the computing device has greater proficiency in another language. In some implementations, the user's proficiency in the local language can be used to select the supplemental content item. For example, the data processing system can determine that the user of the computing device has a low proficiency level in the local language by referring to the user profile. In response, the data processing system can select a local language supplemental content item whose language is very basic, in order to increase the likelihood that the user will understand the text.
- the method 400 also includes the step of providing the selected supplemental content item to the computing device (Step 430 ).
- the data processing system can provide the supplemental content item to the computing device along with the requested electronic document.
- the publisher of the electronic document can provide space within the electronic document for supplemental content supplied by a supplemental content provider, and the data processing system can configure the supplemental content item for display in the reserved space of the electronic document.
- the data processing system can then provide the electronic document and the supplemental content item to the computing device for display.
- the data processing system can deliver the supplemental content in a browser window that is created separately from the browser window displaying the requested electronic document.
- the supplemental content provider can be different from the content publisher.
