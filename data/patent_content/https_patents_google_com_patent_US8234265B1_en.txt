- This specification relates to data processing and content selection.
- the Internet enables access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, webpages directed to particular subject matter, news articles, images, and other resources are accessible over the Internet.
- the wide variety of resources that are accessible over the Internet has enabled opportunities for advertisers to provide targeted advertisements with the resources. For example, an advertisement can be targeted for presentation with resources directed to subject matter to which the advertisement is relevant.
- advertisements associated with a targeting keyword “basketball” can be provided with a search results webpage that is provided in response to a search query “basketball,” or a search query that is identified as relevant to the targeting keyword “basketball.”
- resources available over the Internet that are relevant to a search query can be provided to a user in response to the search query.
- resource keywords that identify topics to which content of a resource belongs can be used to identify web pages that are relevant to the search query “basketball.”
- search queries there are many different words or phrases, referred to collectively throughout this document as terms, that can be provided as search queries to request content that is relevant to the same topic. Additionally, some search queries may be provided by different users requesting content that is relevant to several different topics. Therefore, it can be difficult to select content for each search query provided by a user based only on the search query that is provided by a user.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, in a data processing device, user session data for a plurality of user sessions, the user session data for each user session including search queries and corresponding content performance data for the user session, the content performance data representing user actions in response to content being provided responsive to the search queries; segmenting, by a data processing device, the user session data into session subsets based on a session delineator, each session subset including search queries that were received within a threshold proximity of other search queries in the session subset, the threshold proximity being specified by the session delineator; classifying, by a data processing device, each search query as belonging to a particular query performance group based on a content performance measure corresponding to the search query, the content performance measure being computed based on the content performance data corresponding to the search query; selecting, by a data processing device, reference query pairs, each reference query pair including a first search query from a first query performance group and a second query from a second query performance group,
- the methods can include computing, for each search query, a content performance measure based on a number of selections of content provided responsive to the search query, the number of selections being computed based on the content performance data corresponding to the search query.
- Computing a content performance measure can include computing a selection rate for content provided responsive to the search query.
- Computing a selection rate can include computing, for each search query, a normalized selection rate based on a number of instances of the search query and presentation characteristics for the content.
- Computing a normalized selection rate can include normalizing the selection rate based on presentation positions for the content, each presentation position having a corresponding normalization factor with which the normalized selection rate is computed for content presented in the presentation position.
- Classifying each search query to a particular query performance group can include classifying each search query having an advertisement performance measure that meets an advertisement performance threshold as a high-performing query and as belonging to a high-performing query group; and classifying each search query having an advertisement performance measure that is less than the advertisement performance threshold as a low-performing query and as belonging to a low-performing query group.
- Selecting reference query pairs can include defining, for each session subset, initial query pairs, each initial query pair including a high-performing query and a low-performing query; determining, for each initial query pair, a number of session subsets for which the initial query pair is defined; and selecting, as reference query pairs, initial query pairs that are defined for at least a threshold number of session subsets.
- Segmenting the user session data into session subsets can include selecting, for each user session, a session specific delineator specifying a threshold proximity with which the session subsets for the user session are defined; and segmenting the user session data for the user session based on the session specific delineator.
- Computing the session delineator can include computing an average elapsed time between receipt of queries corresponding to the unique identifier, and wherein segmenting the user session data based on the session specific delineator comprises grouping search queries that correspond to the unique identifier and are received within a query period of each other into a same session subset.
- Additional queries relevant to content being requested by users are inferred based on query rules that identify high-performance queries that were previously received within a same user sub-session as low-performing queries that are later received as search queries.
- the relevance of content provided in response to a low-performing query can be enhanced from the user's perspective by including content that is relevant to a high-performing query that is received within a same user sub-session as the low-performing query.
- Content responsive to the high-performing query and that may not have been identified for presentation based on a low-performing query can be provided to a user device in response to receiving the low-performing query as a search query.

- FIG. 1B is a block diagram illustrating example user interactions with a search system.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example process flow for generating query rules for search queries based on content selection data.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for generating query rules based on content performance data corresponding to search queries.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to facilitate content selection data expansion and content selection.
- a query analysis subsystem (“analysis subsystem”) analyzes search queries that are received during user sessions to generate query rules that can be used to identify content that may not have been identified for a received search query.
- the query rules can specify one or more terms that can be used, in addition to a search query received from a user device, to identify content responsive to the search query.
- the analysis subsystem can generate query rules, for example, by identifying queries that are received in a same user sub-session (i.e., a specified portion of a user session) and defining these queries as requesting content to satisfy the same user informational need due to the proximity with which the queries were received. For example, queries that are received closer in time to each other are more likely requesting content to satisfy the same informational need than queries that are received further apart in time.
- the analysis subsystem defines initial query pairs using queries that are received during a same user sub-session, with each initial query pair being a high-performing query and a low-performing query from the same user sub-session.
- a high-performing query is a query having at least a threshold measure of performance, while a low-performing query is a query having less than the threshold measure of performance.
- Content selection rate is a measure of user selections of content provided in response to a query and is an example performance measure that can be used to identify high-performing queries and low performing queries.
- a high performing query can have a content selection rate (e.g., advertisement or search result selection rate) that exceeds a threshold selection rate
- the low-performing query can have a content selection rate that is less than the threshold selection rate.
- the analysis subsystem classifies initial query pairs that are identified in a threshold number of user sub-sessions as reference query pairs with which query rules are defined.
- the query rules specify a high-performing query that can be used to identify content in response to receipt of a low-performing query.
- the analysis subsystem can make them available to a search system, advertisement management system, or another query processing system for identifying content responsive to search queries.
- an analysis subsystem is implemented as an element of a query processing system that operates in an online environment.
- the analysis subsystem is implemented in a processing system separate from the query processing system.
- the analysis subsystem communicates over a network or directly with the query processing system.
- the analysis subsystem is described throughout this document as being a subsystem of an advertisement management system and with reference to using advertisement performance metrics for the search queries to generate query rules. However, the description is applicable to other implementations and using performance measures for other content.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which an advertisement management system 110 manages advertising services.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , advertisers 108 , and the advertisement management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and advertisers 108 .
- a website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and audio that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display in which advertisements can be presented are referred to as advertisement slots.
- a search system 112 identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 104 .
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- the advertisement management system 110 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with the resource or search results.
- the request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page. Therefore, the advertisement management system 110 can use the characteristics to select advertisements for presentation in the advertisement slots.
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the advertisement slot e.g., media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- the advertisement management system 110 can select, for presentation, advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to the search queries 116 .
- the data representing the request for advertisements as well as data representing the selected advertisements and user actions (e.g., selections and conversions) taken in response to the selected advertisements being presented can be stored in a historical data store 119 .
- data representing each search query for which advertisements have been requested can be indexed in the historical data store 119 with data identifying the advertisements that were selected for the search query and advertisement performance data for the advertisement.
- advertisements having or associated with targeting keywords that match the search query 116 are the advertisements selected by the advertisement management system 110 to be provided with the resource.
- a targeting keyword matches a search query by having the same textual content (“text”) as the search query. For example, an advertisement associated with the targeting keyword “football” can be selected for presentation with a search results page provided for the search query “football.”
- a targeting keyword also matches a search query by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword or search query despite having text different from the targeting keyword.
- an advertisement having the targeting keyword “football” may also be selected for presentation in response to a search query for “sports” because football is a type of sport, and, therefore, is relevant to the term “sports.”
- Search queries that are relevant to particular targeting keywords can be identified, for example, using clustering techniques to cluster terms according to a measure of similarity. For example, a search query term that is in the same cluster as a targeting keyword for an advertisement can be identified as relevant to the targeting keyword, thereby making the advertisement available for presentation in response to the search query.
- advertisements can be made available for presentation in response to receiving other search query terms that are identified as relevant to or semantically related to the targeting keyword for the advertisement.
- search queries that are provided by users requesting content to satisfy the user's need for information may not match targeting keywords that are specified for advertisements that are relevant to the content being requested. Therefore, it can be difficult to select for presentation content relevant to the informational need being expressed with the search query.
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram 150 illustrating example user interactions with a search system 112 .
- a user controlling user device 106 a may submit the search query “federer” 116 a to a search system 112 to request content to satisfy a need for information about Roger Federer and/or tennis.
- much of the content identified as relevant to the tennis player Roger Federer and/or tennis may not have targeting keywords or other content selection criteria that are matched by the search query “federer” 116 a . Therefore, the user device 106 a may be provided very little or no “federer content” 152 (i.e., content that is relevant to the search query “federer”).
- the user device 106 a may be provided “federer content” 152 that does not satisfy the user's need for information. In turn, the user may select very little content that is presented in response to the search query, or select nothing at all.
- Content selection data 154 representing user selections of content provided in response to the search query can be stored in the historical database 119 .
- the user may submit a different query in hopes of identifying content that better satisfies the user's need for information.
- the user operating user device 106 a may submit the search query “tennis” 116 b .
- the search query “tennis” 116 b may match targeting keywords for content that is relevant to tennis and/or Roger Federer, causing the “tennis content” 156 (i.e., content relevant to the search query “tennis”) to be presented to the user by the user device 106 a .
- Content that more adequately satisfies a user's need for information is more likely to be selected by a user than content hat less adequately satisfies the user's need for information. Therefore, when a user provides a search query that matches targeting keywords (or other selection criteria) for content that more adequately satisfies the user's need for information, the user is more likely to select more advertisements and other content provided in response to the search query. Accordingly, content performance measures (e.g., numbers of selections or selection rates) for content that more adequately satisfies a users need for information will be higher than performance measures for content that less adequately satisfies the user's need for information. Thus, the performance measures of advertisements or other content that are provided responsive to a search query is an indication of how well the content responsive to the search query satisfy the user's need for information.
- content performance measures e.g., numbers of selections or selection rates
- a user that is submitting multiple search queries requesting content for a same informational need is likely to submit these queries at a faster rate than the rate with which the user will submit queries that are requesting content related to different informational needs.
- the user that is searching for particular tennis content may submit several different search queries that the user associates with the tennis content, but that may not match targeting keywords (or other selection criteria) for the tennis content very well. Therefore, the user may submit a new query for the tennis content very soon after submitting the previous query.
- the user will likely spend more time viewing the content, and is also less likely to submit additional search queries requesting the tennis content.
- the more proximate e.g., in time or events
- query rules can be generated that specify additional terms that can be used for identifying content when search queries having low-performing queries are received. These query rules can specify, for example, that content be identified for high-performing queries that have previously been received within a threshold period of the low-performing query by at least a threshold number of users.
- the advertisement management system 110 includes an analysis subsystem 120 that includes one or more processors configured to generate query rules based on an analysis of received search queries and content selection data corresponding to the received search queries.
- the query rules generated by the analysis subsystem 120 specify terms, in addition to the search queries, that can be used for identifying content responsive to received search queries.
- the advertisement management system 110 can store and index the query rules in a rule data store 122 and provide query rules, for example, to the advertisement management system 110 (or other query processing devices) to facilitate identification of advertisements (or other content) that are relevant to content being requested by the search query.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example process flow 200 for generating query rules for search queries based on content selection data.
- the analysis subsystem 120 receives user session data 202 as input.
- the analysis subsystem 120 receives user session data, for example, from a data store storing user session data that was logged during user sessions, such as the historical data store 119 of FIG. 1 .
- a user session is a period of time over which data received from a particular user device (or group of user devices) are grouped together.
- the user session data 202 for each user session can include, for example, data representing received search queries and corresponding user actions over a specified period (e.g., a time period or a threshold number of actions or occurrences).
- user session data for an individual user session may include data representing all search queries received from a user (or group of users) over a twenty-four hour time period and data representing all advertisements (or other content) that were selected from search results pages for the search queries.
- the user session data 202 also includes timing information specifying a time at which each search query was received and a time at which each advertisement was selected during the user session.
- the timing information can be a time of day (e.g., Greenwich Median Time) or a relative time within the user session (e.g., an amount of time after a beginning time for the user session).
- the user session data for each user session can be associated with an anonymized identifier that corresponds to the user session to which the data belongs and indexed based on the anonymized identifier.
- the anonymized identifier can be, for example, a hash of an Internet Protocol address, user identifier, or other identifier so that the user session data corresponding to the anonymized identifier is not attributable to an identifiable user, but is still identified as being from the same user (or group of users) for processing the data.
- the analysis subsystem 120 segments the user session data (e.g., for each user session) into user session subsets 204 .
- Each user session subset (e.g., USS 1 -USSi) includes a unique subset of the user session data 202 that can be selected for inclusion in the subset using the timing information.
- each user session subset can include a disjointed subset of the user session data that is delineated by a session delineator.
- the session delineator defines a characteristic of the user session data by which the user session data is segmented.
- the session delineator can be, for example, a threshold time period within which search queries that are requesting content for a same informational need are received.
- the threshold time period can be determined on a user by user basis, as described with reference to FIG. 3 .
- other delineators can be used for segmenting the user session data (e.g., a number of events).
- the analysis subsystem 120 identifies, for each user session subset (USS 1 . . . USSi), a dataset 206 that includes search queries (e.g., Q 1 . . . Qx) received during the user session subset (e.g., USS 1 ) and corresponding advertisement performance measures (e.g., AP 1 . . . APx) for each of the queries.
- the advertisement performance measure is a measure of advertisement performance for the advertisements presented with search queries.
- the advertisement performance measure can be provided with the user session data 202 or computed based on other advertisement performance data included with the user session data 202 .
- a selection rate for the advertisement can be computed based on a total number of selections for the advertisement relative to a total number of presentations for the advertisement, where the total number of selections and the total number of presentations can be represented by data included with the user session data.
- the analysis subsystem 120 analyzes the advertisement performance measures for the queries (e.g., Q 1 . . . Qx) and classifies each of the queries to a particular query performance group based on the advertisement performance measure for the query. For example, the analysis subsystem 120 can identify queries having at least a threshold advertisement performance as high-performing queries (e.g., HPQ 1 . . . HPQx) that are classified in a high-performing query group 208 . Similarly, the analysis subsystem 120 can identify queries having less than the threshold advertisement performance as low-performing queries (e.g., LPQ 1 . . . LPQz) that are classified in a low-performing query group 210 .
- the analysis subsystem 120 can identify queries having at least a threshold advertisement performance as high-performing queries (e.g., HPQ 1 . . . HPQx) that are classified in a high-performing query group 208 .
- the analysis subsystem 120 can identify queries having less than the threshold advertisement performance as low-performing queries (e
- each initial query pair (e.g., QP 1 . . . QPd) includes a high-performing query (e.g., HPQ 1 ) and a low-performing query (e.g., LPQ 1 ) that corresponds to a same user session subset (e.g., USS 1 ).
- each initial query pair for a particular user session subset can include one high-performing query from the user session subset and one low-performing query for the user session subset.
- the initial query pairs for a user session subset include initial query pairs resulting from a permutation of the queries classified to the high-performing query group 208 and the queries classified to the low-performing query group for the user session subset.
- the high-performance query HPQ 1 can be paired with each of the low-performance query pairs LPQ 1 . . . LPQz to generate z initial query pairs (i.e., HPQ 1 :LPQ 1 . . . HPQ 1 :LPQz, where each HPQ:LPQ represents a unique initial query pair).
- each reference query pair (e.g., RQP 1 . . . RQPe) specifies a high-performing query (e.g., HPQ 1 ) and a low-performing query (e.g., LPQ 1 ) that are defined for at least the threshold number of user session subsets.
- the threshold number of user session subsets can be selected, for example, based on query quality goals and available processing resources, as described in more detail with reference to FIG. 3 .
- each query rule specifies a high-performing query that can be used to identify content when the corresponding low-performing query is received as a search query.
- a query rule defined based on reference query pair RPQ 1 can specify that the high-performing query (e.g., HPQ 1 ) that is included in RPQ 1 can be used to identify content in response to receipt, as a search query, of the low-performing query included in RPQ 1 (e.g., LPQ 1 ).
- the high-performing query e.g., HPQ 1
- LPQ 1 low-performing query included in RPQ 1
- the query rules can be stored in a data store for access by a query processing system and/or provided to a query processing system to facilitate identification of content for presentation in response to a search query. For example, in response to a query processing system receiving a search query, the query processing system can request from the data store a query rule corresponding to the search query.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for generating query rules based on content performance data corresponding to search queries.
- the process 300 receives user session data for user sessions, where the user session data for each user session includes search queries received during the user session and content performance data for content provided during the user session.
- the user session data are segmented into user session subsets based on a session delineator so that each user session subset includes search queries that were received within a threshold proximity of each other.
- each query in each user session subset is classified as a high-performing query or a low-performing query and initial query pairs are defined so that each initial query pair includes a high-performing query from a user session subset and a low-performing query from the same user session subset.
- a number of user session subsets for which each initial query pair is defined is computed, and initial query pairs that are defined for at least a threshold number of user session subsets are selected as reference query pairs.
- query rules are generated using the reference query pairs, and based on the query rules, content responsive to a high-performing query is provided in response to receipt of a search query specifying a low-performing query.
- the process 300 can be implemented, for example, by the analysis subsystem 120 of FIG. 1 .
- the analysis subsystem 120 includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the process 300 .
- a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of the process 300 .
- User session data for user sessions are received ( 302 ).
- the user session data for each user session includes search queries received during the user session and content performance data corresponding to the search queries.
- the content performance data can represent, for example, user actions detected in response to content being provided to a user device in response to a search query.
- the content performance data can include data representing user selections of advertisements (or other content) that are presented with a search results page providing search results responsive to a search query submitted by a user.
- the data representing user selections of the advertisements can be, for example, data identifying a number of clicks (or a click-through-rate) for each individual advertisement provided with the search results page or an aggregate number of clicks for the advertisements provided.
- the content performance data can include data representing conversions or other performance measures for the advertisements.
- the content performance data can also include timing information that specifies a time at which each search query was received. As described above, the timing information can be a time of day or a relative time within the user session at which the search query was received.
- the search queries and corresponding performance data can be received, for example, from a data store storing logged and/or indexed data from user sessions, such as the indexed cache 114 of FIG. 1 .
- user session data for each user session is identified as belonging to the user session based on a unique identifier for the user session.
- each user session can have an identifier that is associated with data that is received or computed during the user session.
- the user session data for a particular user session can be an anonymized identifier that is computed based on data associated with the user session.
- the anonymized identifier can be a hash of an Internet Protocol address associated with the user device corresponding to the user session data or a hash of a value of a cookie associated with the user device.
- the user session data is segmented into session subsets based on a session delineator ( 304 ).
- each session subset includes search queries that were received within a threshold proximity of other search queries in the session subset, where the threshold proximity is specified by the session delineator.
- the session delineator can specify the threshold proximity as a maximum time or a maximum number of events that can elapse or occur between receipt of each of the queries in each session subset.
- queries that are received within a shorter time (or number of events) of each other are more likely requesting content for a same user informational need than queries that are received after a longer time.
- a session delineator that specifies a shorter time (or number of events) can result in user session subsets that include search queries that are more relevant to each other than the search queries included in user session subsets that result from a session delineator that specifies a longer time.
- the session delineator is selected to be less than an average elapsed time (or average number of events) within which queries are received during a particular user session. For example, when user session data for a particular user session indicates that search queries are received every ten minutes on average, the session delineator may be selected as five minutes such that queries received within five minutes of each other are included in the same user session subset. Thus, in this example, any query that is received within five minutes of another query will be included in the same user session subset as the other query.
- a query may be included in more than one user session subset.
- query A and query B will be included in the same user session subset.
- another query C is then received more than five minutes after query A but less than five minutes after query B, then queries B and C will be included in another query session subset.
- each of the user session subsets includes a unique set of search queries because each user session subset will have at least one query different from every other user session subset.
- each user session subset can be a disjointed subset so that each search query is included in only one user session subset.
- the user session subset can be used to segment user session data at five minute intervals starting, for example, from a time at which a first search query of the user session is received (or another reference time).
- each search query having the same unique session identifier as the first received search query and received within five minutes of the first received search query can be grouped together the same user session subset.
- Each search query having the same unique session identifier as the first received query and received between five and ten minutes after receipt of the first received search query can be grouped together in another user session subset.
- the session delineator can be used in combination with a subset limiter that reduces the number of user session subsets by requiring a candidate query that is eligible for inclusion in more than one user session subset to be included only in the user session subset that includes a most proximate search query to the candidate query.
- the subset limiter can require that the candidate query only be included in both user session subsets when the candidate query is received within a narrower time (or number of events) than that specified by the session delineator.
- each user and/or each user session can have a session specific session delineator.
- the session delineator for each user session can be computed based on an average time (or number of events) that elapses between receipt of queries during the user session.
- the session delineator for each user session can be computed based on an analysis of the user session data corresponding to the unique identifier for the user session.
- Computing the session delineator for each user session based on the user session data corresponding to the user session increases the likelihood that queries included in the same user session subset are requesting content for a same user informational need. For example, one user may have an average query submission rate that is twice as fast as another user. Therefore, if the session delineator that is computed for the user that submits queries more slowly (“user 1 ”) is used to segment user session data for the user that submits queries more quickly (“user 2 ”), it is more likely that the user session subsets for user 2 will include search queries that are less relevant to each other than those in the user session subsets for user 1 .
- Each search query in each session subset is classified to a particular query performance group based on a content performance measure corresponding to the search query ( 306 ).
- the content performance measure is included with the content performance data corresponding to the search query and received from a data store, such as the historical data store 119 of FIG. 1 .
- the content performance measure is computed based on the content performance data corresponding to the search queries.
- Content performance measures for a search query can be computed as an aggregate performance (e.g., selections or selection rate) of content provided in response to the search query.
- the content performance measure for a particular query can be a total number of advertisements that were selected from search result pages for the search query.
- the content performance measure for the particular query can be a selection rate of advertisements from the search results pages that is computed based on a total number of times the search result was received (i.e. a total number of instances of the search query) or a total number of advertisements that were presented with the search results page.
- the content performance measure for each search query is compared to a threshold content performance. Search queries for which the content performance measure exceeds the threshold content performance are classified as high-performing queries and search queries for which the content performance measure does not exceed the content performance threshold are classified as low-performing queries.
- performance measures for content provided in response to a search query can be normalized based on characteristics of the content that was selected.
- the performance measures can be normalized to account for differences in presentation positions (i.e., presentation characteristics) for the content as well as inherent characteristics (e.g., size, color animation status) of the content.
- the normalization can be performed by applying a normalization factor to the performance measures.
- a normalization factor is a value that adjusts a performance measure so that each performance measure more accurately reflects the relevance of the content to the search query for which it was provided. For example, content is sometimes presented in different locations of a Web page based on its relevance to the search query for which the content was provided. Therefore, content that is selected from a location that is reserved for more relevant content provides a stronger signal that the search query provides content that satisfies the user's informational need than selection of content from another location in which less relevant content can be presented.
- search results and advertisements Two particular forms of content that are sometimes presented in different locations of a Web page based on their relevance to a search query are search results and advertisements.
- Search results are often presented in descending order of relevance in a search results page and advertisements can be selected for presentation in advertisement slots based, in part, on how well the targeting keywords match the search query.
- a selection of one advertisement may provide a stronger signal that content identified as relevant to the search query satisfies the user's informational need than selection of another advertisement.
- a selection of an advertisement in a top banner position of a Web page may be more indicative that content identified as relevant to the search query satisfies the user's informational need than a selection of an advertisement in the bottom right corner of the Web page.
- a search query having a same content selection rate as another search query, but having a higher top banner advertisement selection rate may be identified as a higher performing query than the other query having a lower top banner advertisement selection rate.
- Each presentation position can have a corresponding normalization factor, such that the performance data for content provided in each of the presentation positions of a web page can be normalized and used to compute normalized content performance for the search queries.
- normalization factors can be specified for other characteristics of advertisements such as quality measures for the advertisements, times at which the advertisements were presented, and inherent characteristics (e.g., color, animation status, audio characteristics, and size) of the advertisements.
- Initial query pairs are defined for each session subset ( 308 ).
- each initial query pair includes a high-performing query and a low-performing query, where the high-performing query and the low-performing query are selected from the same user session subset.
- Each high-performing query can be matched with every low-performing query in the user session subset to define a number of initial query pairs equal to a product of the number of high-performing queries and the low-performing queries in the user session subset. For example, assume that a user session subset includes two high-performing queries (e.g., queries 1 and 2 ) and three low-performing queries (e.g., queries 4 , 5 , and 6 ).
- the initial query pairs can be every permutation of the high-performing queries and the low-performing queries (e.g., query 1 :query 3 ; query 1 :query 5 ; query 1 :query 6 ; query 2 :query 3 ; query 2 :query 4 ; and query 2 :query 5 ).
- a number of session subsets for which the initial query pairs are defined is computed ( 310 ).
- the computed number of session subsets is a total number of instances of the initial query pair across all user session subsets for all user sessions over a specified time period.
- the number of session subsets can be a number of session subsets in which the initial query pair is defined over a previous 3 months, a previous 6 months, or another specified time period.
- the number of session subsets is computed to be a number of different user sessions, or user sessions corresponding to different user devices, in which the initial query pair is defined.
- the number of session subsets can be a total number of unique user sessions in which the initial query pair is defined.
- Initial query pairs that are defined in at least a threshold number of user session subsets are selected as reference query pairs ( 312 ).
- the threshold number of user session subsets is selected so that at least a threshold portion of the queries in the reference query pairs are received with at least a threshold frequency (i.e., a minimum rate of receipt as a search query).
- the threshold number of user sessions can be set to a value so that at least 90% of the queries in the reference query pairs have a receipt frequency within the top 50% of all received queries.
- the likelihood that the search queries in the reference query pairs will have receipt frequencies that are above the threshold frequency increases.
- the likelihood that the search queries in the reference query pairs will have receipt frequency that is below the threshold frequency increases because the initial query pairs that qualify as reference query pairs are required to be identified in fewer of the user session subsets.
- the threshold number of user session subsets can be iteratively adjusted until the threshold portion in the reference query pairs have a receipt frequency that meets that threshold frequency.
- the initial threshold number of user session subsets may be set at 500, such that each initial query pair that is defined for at least 500 different user session subsets (or unique user sessions) is selected as a reference query. At this initial threshold several thousand reference query pairs may be identified. Each of the queries in the reference query pairs can be analyzed to determine a receipt frequency (or total number of times the query has been received) over a specified time.
- the threshold can be lowered.
- the threshold number of user session subsets can be lowered 300 different user session subsets (or unique user sessions).
- the reference query pairs at the new threshold of 300 user session subsets are analyzed to determine whether the threshold portion of queries in the reference query pairs have receipt frequencies that satisfy the frequency threshold, as described above. If so, the threshold number of user session subsets can continue to be lowered until the threshold portion of the queries in the reference query pairs are do not have receipt frequencies that meet the threshold frequency. In turn, the threshold can then be raised to a level at which the threshold portion of queries in the reference query pairs have at least the threshold receipt frequency.
- Adjusting the threshold user session subsets as described above increases the number of low-performing queries for which query rules will be defined, while ensuring that processing resources are not used to generate query rules for search queries that are only rarely received.
- Query rules are generated based on the reference query pairs ( 314 ).
- each query rule specifies a high-quality query for which content can be identified in response to receiving a low-quality query.
- the high-quality query and corresponding low-quality query specified by a query rule can be, for example, a high-quality/low-quality query pair that define a reference query pair.
- the query rules can be stored, for example, in a data store that stores query rules, such as the rule data store 122 of FIG. 1 .
- Content responsive to a high-performing query is provided in response to a request for content responsive to a low-performing query based on the query rules ( 316 ).
- the low-performing query is received as a search query that was submitted by a user device.
- a query rule corresponding to the low-performing query can be identified or requested.
- content is identified for presentation to the user device.
- the identified content is provided to the user device.
- the content provided to the user device in response to receipt of a low-performing search query can include content that is identified based on the high-performing query, and that may not have been identified based on the low-performing query.
- the content provided in response to the low-performing query can include, for example, advertisements having targeting keywords that match the high-performing query of the query rule, search results, provided by a search engine, that are identified based on the high-performing query, or other content (e.g., video or audio) that are identified as relevant to the high-performing query.
- the criteria e.g., search queries
- the criteria with which content is selected for presentation in response to a received search query are expanded to include the high-performing query of the query rule corresponding to the low-performing query.
- the query rules can be used by a variety of query processing systems such as search engines, video or audio search tools that provide suggested video and or audio in response to queries, and advertisement management systems that select advertisements for presentation with content.
