132 can keep the tracking for notifying 602 for being sent to user equipment 200.Universal distributed memory cache system (example
Such as, memory cache) such as database (for example, data storage 160) can be grouped into putting) slower backing storage before
Notify 602 layerings (for example, the copy for notifying 602 is stored in temporary cache, will to notify 602 for being sent in RAM
Copy be stored in memory cache layer).When being intended to send user equipment 200 for new notice, will can newly notify first
It is sent to NSM component 132.Then, NSM component 132 can search the similar notice for being sent to user equipment 200 recently, right
It should be in one or more in identical live streaming stream video, identical contact person or identical session.Then, NSM component 132
Pre-existing can be notified into 602 and new combination of notifications, new notice state is stored in temporary cache (for example, interior
Deposit cache layer) in, and then user equipment 200 is sent by updated state.In the state for receiving update, if
The user of user equipment 200 not yet releases previous notification, then user equipment 200 can update shown notice state.NSM group
Part 132 can (session tracker may include that (user is currently for viewing history with 200 session tracker of counsel user equipment
The content of viewing, the content that user has watched), notification history (it is received notice, user to received notice response,
Institute is received to notify corresponding live streaming stream video etc.), to determine whether user has notified specified in 602 in viewing expection
Whether the user of live streaming stream video or user equipment 200 has contacted with similar notice (for example, user has received or refused
User's viewing and the expected previous notice for notifying 602 identical live streaming stream videos are invited absolutely).If user has released notice
602, user has contacted with similar notice in viewing live streaming stream video or user, then expected to notify that 602 be by
It is sent to user equipment 602.In one implementation, notice receiving module 232, which can receive, notifies 602 and by the pair of notice
Originally it is stored in notice cache 123.When to send new notice to user equipment 200, notice receiving module 232 can be looked into
Look for the similar notice for being sent to user equipment 200 recently and combine it is pre-existing notify 602 with new notice (for example, utilizing
New notice duplicate removal it is pre-existing notify that 602), new notice state is stored in notice cache 123, and by update
State is sent to user equipment 200.
In another implementation, stop watching live streaming stream video corresponding with notifying 602 in response to user, can make
Notify that 602 is invalid.In the case where the live stream of the duplicate removal characterized by multiple users notice, single user is (for example, stop seeing
See live the user of stream video) it can be by using the sending out notice of the client device to recipient user from notifying in 602
It is removed.Sending out notice can make the previous notification status of the client device of recipient user invalid, and can be to reception
The client device of person user sends new notice state.Sending out notice may include the creation time for sending out notice when
Between stab so that if multiple ineffective times stamp be sent to recipient user client device and if client device connects
Unordered ineffective time stamp is received, then can be avoided the race condition by addressee's stale data is shown (for example, even if having
Sending out notice (there is less new timestamp) is received after the sending out notice of newest timestamp, when display also being had newest
Between the sending out notice that stabs).
User (for example, sliding notifies to the left, can select the closing in notice or release option by providing some inputs
Deng) come from user interface release one or more notify 602.User can receive one or more by providing some inputs
Notice (for example, sliding notice to the right, chooses the link of live streaming stream video or receive option etc. in notice).In response to user
It releases or receives to notify 602, can not update, duplicate removal, combination or Notice Of Nonavailability 602.If user releases or receives not yet
It notifies 602, then notifies 602 may be deactivated and be replaced by update, duplicate removal or combined notice.
