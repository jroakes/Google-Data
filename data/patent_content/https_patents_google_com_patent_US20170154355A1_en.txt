- the interaction data store 120 can be updated to account for the interaction.
- the content provider 108 can be presented one or more reports 122 which can include metrics related to user interaction with content items that include information for pairs of social entities, including metrics specific to individual entities.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management system 110 that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content management system 110 or other server.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example system 200 for serving content.
- User devices can submit requests for content to a content management system 202 over a network 204 .
- the following requests can be received by the content management system 202 : 1) a request for content for a content slot 206 included in a search results page 208 presented on a laptop device 210 of a user 212 who is located west of Minneapolis, Minn.; 2) a request for content for a content slot 214 included in a weather forecast page 216 presented on a mobile device 218 of a user 220 who is located in Minneapolis; 3) a request for content for a content slot 222 included in a news page 224 presented on a tablet device 226 of a user 228 who is located north of Minneapolis; 4) a request for content for a content slot 230 included in a news page 232 presented on a mobile device 234 of a user 236 who is located in Wisconsin; 5) a request for content for a content slot 238 included in a map interface 240 presented on
- the content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes Hamline University (which is located in St. Paul, Minn.) and Augsburg College (located in Minneapolis, Minn.).
- the pair including Hamline and Augsburg is an example of a college rivalry.
- the Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified, for example, based at least in part on both Hamline and Augsburg being associated with the content displayed in the map interface 240 (e.g., an area displayed in the map includes both Hamline and Augsburg).
- the Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified based at least in part on the user 244 being located in the same city (St. Paul) that is associated with the Hamline social identity group.
- the Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified based on profile information 254 for the user 244 from a user information database 255 .
- the Hamline-Augsburg pair can also be identified based on both Hamline and Augsburg being associated with a content item 256 that the content management system 202 selects for presentation in the content slot 238 (e.g., both Hamline and Augsburg are physically located in the Twin Cities and the content item 256 is a Twin Cities-related content item).
- the content item 256 can be selected based on the content displayed in the map interface 240 , based on information about the user 244 , based on the identified social identity group pair, and or on other factors. While reference is made here that the two entities for comparison are selected based on their proximate location, other factors can be used to determine which entities to compare. In some implementations, the content sponsor can specify the entities (e.g., rivals).
- the content management system 202 can determine a response metric (e.g., from a response metrics database 257 ) associated with the content item 256 for both Hamline and Augsburg, where each response metric indicates responses that are attributable to users associated with a respective entity.
- the response metric information can be included in (e.g., presented with) the content item 256 , such as on a scoreboard 259 .
- the scoreboard 259 indicates that thirty two Hamline users and twenty eight Augsburg users have designated (e.g., “liked”) the content item 256 .
- the scoreboard 259 includes controls 260 and 261 (e.g., “plus-one” controls) which allow the user 244 to designate (e.g., “vote for”) either Hamline or Augsburg, respectively.
- the control 260 can be dynamically placed on top of the control 261 in response to the content management system 202 determining that the user 244 is associated with Hamline (e.g., based on the profile information 255 ). If the user selects the control 260 or the control 261 , the corresponding Hamline or Augsburg count can be updated on the scoreboard 259 and a response metric associated with the selected entity and with the scoreboard 259 can be updated (e.g., incremented) in the response metrics database 257 .
- the content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, respectively (e.g., a “MN-WI pair”).
- the MN-WI pair can be identified, for example, based at least in part on the user 236 being physically located in the state of Wisconsin.
- the MN-WI pair can be identified based on the content of the news page 232 being related to the state of Minnesota.
- the content management system 262 can identify a content item 262 for presentation in the slot 230 (e.g., based at least in part on football content of the content item 262 matching football content displayed in the news page 230 ).
- the content management system 202 can determine response metrics that are associated with the content item 262 and with Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, and can present the response metrics along with the content item 262 .
- the content item 262 includes content 263 that indicates that 211,322 football fans have indicated that they are fans from Wisconsin and content 264 that indicates that 133,952 football fans have indicated that they are fans from Minnesota.
- the content item 262 includes a link 265 which allows the user 236 to indicate that they are a football fan from Wisconsin.
- the link 265 can be included without including a corresponding link for Minnesota, for example, based on the user 236 being physically located in Wisconsin, or based on other information associated with the user 236 .
- the content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively.
- the content presented in the video player interface 248 is not related to either Minneapolis or St. Paul, the Minneapolis-St. Paul pair can be identified, for example, based on user profile information 270 that is associated with the user 252 .
- the user 252 may, for example, be logged in to an account associated with the content management system 202 (e.g., as indicated by a user label 271 ).
- the content management system 202 can identify a content item 272 for presentation in the content slot 246 and can determine a response metric for Minneapolis users and a response metric for St. Paul users where are each response metric is associated with the content item 272 .
- the content item 272 indicates that there are three hundred forty one “XX” programming language developers in Minneapolis and two hundred eleven “XX” programming language developers in St. Paul.
- the content item 272 includes a control 273 , which allows the user 252 to indicate that they are an “XX” programming language developer from Minneapolis.
- the control 273 can be included without including a corresponding control for St. Paul, for example, based on the content management system 202 identifying the Minneapolis-related user profile information 270 .
- the content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively. Although the user 228 is not physically located in either Minneapolis or St. Paul and does not have user profile information associated with either city, the content management system 202 can identify the Minneapolis-St. Paul pair, for example, based at least in part on the Minneapolis/St. Paul content of the news page 224 . The content management system 202 can determine response metrics for each of Minneapolis and St. Paul where each response metric is associated with an identified content item 276 .
- the content management system 202 can configure the content item 276 so that the response metrics are not initially displayed, but are presented in response to selection of a vote link 277 or a vote link 278 included in the content item 276 .
- the content item 276 can be updated to include metrics which indicate the number of football fans in Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively, as illustrated by an updated content item 280 .
- the response metric for Minneapolis can include the vote associated with the selection of the link 278 by the user 226 and the response metrics database 257 can be updated in response to selection of the vote link 278 .
- any pair of entities that represents a dichotomy of users can be identified.
- the content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes mobile device users and desktop users (e.g., based on determining that the mobile device 218 is a mobile device).
- the content management system 202 can determine response metrics associated with an identified content item 280 for each of mobile device users and desktop users.
- the content item 280 includes information that indicates that 40% of mobile users and 32% of desktop users have designated the content item 280 .
- the content item 280 includes a control 282 that allows the user 220 to designate the content item 280 as a mobile user.
- the control 282 can be included in the content item 280 without including a corresponding control for desktop users based on the content management system 202 determining that the mobile device 218 is a mobile device.
- the content management system might not identify a pair of entities. For example, for the request for content for the content slot 206 , the content management system might not determine a pair of social identity groups that are associated with content identified for the content slot 206 , with the content presented in the search results page 208 , or with the user 208 , to name a few examples. In such a situation, the content management system 202 may identify some other pair of entities, such as a default pair of entities, or a random pair of entities. As another example, the content management system 202 may determine to present a content item that does not include response metrics for a pair of social identity groups.
- the content management system 202 can identify a content item 290 which includes a single response metric 292 indicating a number of users who have designated the content item 290 and a control 294 which allows the user 208 to designate the content item 290 .
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example campaign management user interface 300 .
- the user interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign.
- the sponsor can select a tab 302 to display a campaign configuration area 304 .
- the sponsor can view a list 306 of campaigns by selecting a control 307 .
- the sponsor can edit an existing campaign in the campaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 308 ) in the campaign list 306 .
- the campaign configuration area 304 includes, among other controls, various controls which the sponsor can use to configure selection criteria that include entity (e.g., social identity group) pairings.
- entity e.g., social identity group
- the user can select one or more content items included in the campaign using a control 309 .
- Content items listed in the control 309 can be template content items which include, for example, variable text which can be populated when the template content item is selected for presentation and after a pair has been associated with the template content item.
- a template content item can include a scoreboard portion that has both static text and variable text, and the variable text can be populated with the names of entities and with interaction data that is associated with the entities.
- a template content item may include a scoreboard area that includes two static labels that include the text “fans like this”.
- variable text including the name of a first entity in the pair and interaction data associated with the first entity can be added to the first static label to produce a first dynamic label, for example, of “388 Michigan fans like this”.
- a second dynamic label can be generated corresponding to the second entity (e.g., such as “412 Ohio State fans like this”).
- the campaign sponsor can designate different approaches for how a pair is associated with a template content item. For example, a pair can be selected, for example, based on a resource in which the template content item is to be presented and/or based on information associated with the user.
- the user can select a control 311 to define or select a specific pair to be associated with the selected template content item(s). If the user selects the control 311 , then the selected template content items are enabled to be selected for presentation, such as if a resource or a user associated with a request for content at least partially matches a pair selected or defined by the sponsor.
- Entity pairs that have been selected or defined by the sponsor for the selected template content item(s) can be displayed in a control 312 .
- the sponsor has selected a pair 314 that represents a college rivalry between the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University.
- the sponsor can use a control 316 to select one or more predefined pairs.
- the control 316 enables selection of the following pairs: a geographic area rivalry pair including Boston and New York, a college football rivalry pair including Michigan and Ohio State, a college football rivalry pair including Oklahoma and Texas, and a college basketball rivalry pair including Duke and North Carolina.
- the sponsor can select an add control 318 to associate the selected pair(s) with the campaign and to add the selected pair(s) to the control 312 .
- a group 320 of user interface controls can be used to define a new social identity group pair.
- the sponsor can enter or select the name of a first social identity group using a control 322 and can enter or select the name of a second social identity group using a control 324 .
- a new pair including the first group and the second group can be associated with the campaign and added to the control 312 by selecting an add control 326 .
- the newly defined pair can be stored in a repository and used for subsequent population of the control 316 (e.g., in future presentations of the user interface 300 for the current sponsor or some other sponsor, the control 316 can include social identity group pairs previously defined using the user interface 300 ).
- Pairs can be defined using methods other than selecting or entering names.
- a sponsor can select a control 328 to cause display of a map interface (not shown) in which the sponsor can define pairs by defining or selecting two geographic areas (e.g., two cities, states, countries, neighborhoods, etc.). After dismissing the map interface, any pairs defined using the map interface can be displayed in the control 312 and associated with the selected template content item(s).
- a sponsor can select a category of entities (e.g., “college basketball rivalries”). In some implementations, a sponsor can define and select a new category of entities. If a sponsor selects a category, a template content item may be selected, for example, for presentation on a resource that is associated with an entity that is of the type represented by the category. For example, if the sponsor associates the category “college basketball rivalries” with a content item, the content item may be selected to be presented on a news page that discusses a recent game for the University of Wisconsin Badgers basketball team.
- a category of entities e.g., “college basketball rivalries”.
- a sponsor can define and select a new category of entities. If a sponsor selects a category, a template content item may be selected, for example, for presentation on a resource that is associated with an entity that is of the type represented by the category. For example, if the sponsor associates the category “college basketball rivalries” with a content item, the content item may be selected to be

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium for providing content. A method includes: identifying a plurality of segments of viewers wherein each segment is associated with an entity; identifying pairs of segments for comparison; responsive to a request for content, identifying a content item for presentation on a user device; identifying a first pair of segments that are associated with the content item; determining, for each segment of the first segment pair, a response metric associated with responses to the content item, the responses attributable to entities in a given segment; and providing the content item responsive to the request including providing results associated with the response metric for both segments of the first pair of segments for presentation along with the content item.
Description
- This application claims the benefit of the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/792,207, filed on Mar. 15, 2013, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing content. The method comprises: identifying a plurality of segments of viewers wherein each segment is associated with an entity; identifying pairs of segments for comparison; responsive to a request for content, identifying a content item for presentation on a user device; identifying a first pair of segments that are associated with the content item; determining, for each segment of the first segment pair, a response metric associated with responses to the content item, the responses attributable to entities in a given segment; and providing the content item responsive to the request including providing results associated with the response metric for both segments of the first pair of segments for presentation along with the content item.

- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes: one or more processors; and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a plurality of segments of viewers wherein each segment is associated with an entity; identify pairs of segments for comparison; responsive to a request for content, identify a content item for presentation on a user device; identify a first pair of segments that are associated with the content item; determine, for each segment of the first segment pair, a response metric associated with responses to the content item, the responses attributable to entities in a given segment; and provide the content item responsive to the request including providing results associated with the response metric for both segments of the first pair of segments for presentation along with the content item.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a plurality of segments of viewers wherein each segment is associated with an entity; identify pairs of segments for comparison; responsive to a request for content, identify a content item for presentation on a user device; identify a first pair of segments that are associated with the content item; determine, for each segment of the first segment pair, a response metric associated with responses to the content item, the responses attributable to entities in a given segment; and provide the content item responsive to the request including providing results associated with the response metric for both segments of the first pair of segments for presentation along with the content item.

A portion of the plurality of segments can include one or more segments associated with a respective geographic region. The pairs can include rivals. The content item can be associated with a campaign and the selection criteria for presenting the content item can include criteria that specifies the first pair of segments. A report can be provided to a content sponsor of the content item that includes interaction data related to the content item for entities associated with the first pair of segments. Providing results can include providing interaction data for members of each segment of the first pair of segments associated with interactions with the content item. Providing results can include providing a scoreboard presentation that includes the interaction data along with a designator for each respective segment of the first pair of segments. Selection criteria that specify the first pair of segments can be received from a content sponsor of the content item. The received selection criteria can be stored in a campaign associated with the first content item. Prior to receipt of the selection criteria, suggestions can be provided to the content sponsor of potential pairs of segments for comparison. Receiving a selection criteria can include receipt of one of the suggestions.

Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, andpublishers 109. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Thecontent providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally (or in association with a service requested by or) at a content provider's client device. - The
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 111 which define the content campaign. Thecampaign parameters 111 can be stored in aparameters data store 112.Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creatives), and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or target websites, and one or more keywords. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 111 specified by thecontent provider 108. As described in more detail below with respect toFIG. 3A , thecontent provider 108 can use an account management user interface to configure selection criteria that include social identity group pairs. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.

Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can, for example, requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. As another example,user devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 113 over thenetwork 102. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 113 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 113 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in one or more search results pages. In some implementations, asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 113 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title or video title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page or video, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - A request for content can be received by the
content management system 110 from auser device 106. The request for content can be associated with, for example, a request for aresource 105 or asearch query 116. Thecontent management system 110 can select one or more content items to provide in response to the request. For example, the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. As another example, resource keywords associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 116 can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Content items selected by thecontent management system 110 can include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. For example, content items having selection keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 can be selected by thecontent management system 110. Thecontent management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction. - In some implementations, some
content providers 108 prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction. Acontent provider 108 can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with apublisher 109, where the agreement requires thepublisher 109 to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by thecontent provider 108 over a specified period (e.g., one week). In turn, thecontent provider 108,publisher 109, or both parties can provide data to thecontent management system 110 that enables thecontent management system 110 to facilitate satisfaction of the agreement. - For example, the
content provider 108 can upload a content item and authorize thecontent management system 110 to provide the content item in response to requests for content corresponding to thewebsite 104 of thepublisher 109. Similarly, thepublisher 109 can provide thecontent management system 110 with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that thepublisher 109 has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period. Over time, thecontent management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time. - As described in more detail below, after identifying a content item for presentation in response to a request from a
user device 106, thecontent management system 110 can determine a pair of segments of users that have been associated with (e.g., previously interacted with) the content item. The pair can, for example, be a rival pair of social entities or some other pair of social identity groups. Thecontent management system 110 can determine interaction data for the content item from aninteraction data store 120, where the interaction data is attributable to entities in respective segments of the identified pair. Thecontent management system 110 can provide the content item along with comparison information that is based at least in part on the interaction data. For example, the content item can include a scoreboard which indicates a number of users in each segment who have interacted with the content item. If the user interacts with the presented content item, such as by voting or otherwise designating the content item in association with a particular social entity, theinteraction data store 120 can be updated to account for the interaction. Thecontent provider 108 can be presented one ormore reports 122 which can include metrics related to user interaction with content items that include information for pairs of social entities, including metrics specific to individual entities. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the
content management system 110 that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by thecontent management system 110 or other server. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample system 200 for serving content. User devices can submit requests for content to acontent management system 202 over anetwork 204. For example, the following requests can be received by the content management system 202: 1) a request for content for acontent slot 206 included in a search resultspage 208 presented on alaptop device 210 of auser 212 who is located west of Minneapolis, Minn.; 2) a request for content for acontent slot 214 included in aweather forecast page 216 presented on amobile device 218 of auser 220 who is located in Minneapolis; 3) a request for content for a content slot 222 included in anews page 224 presented on atablet device 226 of auser 228 who is located north of Minneapolis; 4) a request for content for acontent slot 230 included in anews page 232 presented on amobile device 234 of auser 236 who is located in Wisconsin; 5) a request for content for acontent slot 238 included in amap interface 240 presented on amobile device 242 of auser 244 who is located in Saint Paul. Minn.; and 6) a request for content for acontent slot 246 included in avideo player interface 248 presented on adesktop device 250 of auser 252 who is located south of Minneapolis. - In response to the request for content for the
content slot 238, thecontent management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes Hamline University (which is located in St. Paul, Minn.) and Augsburg College (located in Minneapolis, Minn.). The pair including Hamline and Augsburg is an example of a college rivalry. The Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified, for example, based at least in part on both Hamline and Augsburg being associated with the content displayed in the map interface 240 (e.g., an area displayed in the map includes both Hamline and Augsburg). - As another example, the Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified based at least in part on the
user 244 being located in the same city (St. Paul) that is associated with the Hamline social identity group. As yet another example, the Hamline-Augsburg pair can be identified based on profile information 254 for theuser 244 from auser information database 255. The Hamline-Augsburg pair can also be identified based on both Hamline and Augsburg being associated with a content item 256 that thecontent management system 202 selects for presentation in the content slot 238 (e.g., both Hamline and Augsburg are physically located in the Twin Cities and the content item 256 is a Twin Cities-related content item). The content item 256 can be selected based on the content displayed in themap interface 240, based on information about theuser 244, based on the identified social identity group pair, and or on other factors. While reference is made here that the two entities for comparison are selected based on their proximate location, other factors can be used to determine which entities to compare. In some implementations, the content sponsor can specify the entities (e.g., rivals). - The
content management system 202 can determine a response metric (e.g., from a response metrics database 257) associated with the content item 256 for both Hamline and Augsburg, where each response metric indicates responses that are attributable to users associated with a respective entity. The response metric information can be included in (e.g., presented with) the content item 256, such as on ascoreboard 259. For example, thescoreboard 259 indicates that thirty two Hamline users and twenty eight Augsburg users have designated (e.g., “liked”) the content item 256. Thescoreboard 259 includes controls 260 and 261 (e.g., “plus-one” controls) which allow theuser 244 to designate (e.g., “vote for”) either Hamline or Augsburg, respectively. The control 260 can be dynamically placed on top of thecontrol 261 in response to thecontent management system 202 determining that theuser 244 is associated with Hamline (e.g., based on the profile information 255). If the user selects the control 260 or thecontrol 261, the corresponding Hamline or Augsburg count can be updated on thescoreboard 259 and a response metric associated with the selected entity and with thescoreboard 259 can be updated (e.g., incremented) in theresponse metrics database 257. - In response to the request for content for the
content slot 230, thecontent management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, respectively (e.g., a “MN-WI pair”). The MN-WI pair can be identified, for example, based at least in part on theuser 236 being physically located in the state of Wisconsin. As another example, the MN-WI pair can be identified based on the content of thenews page 232 being related to the state of Minnesota. Thecontent management system 262 can identify acontent item 262 for presentation in the slot 230 (e.g., based at least in part on football content of thecontent item 262 matching football content displayed in the news page 230). - The
content management system 202 can determine response metrics that are associated with thecontent item 262 and with Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, and can present the response metrics along with thecontent item 262. For example, thecontent item 262 includescontent 263 that indicates that 211,322 football fans have indicated that they are fans from Wisconsin andcontent 264 that indicates that 133,952 football fans have indicated that they are fans from Minnesota. Thecontent item 262 includes a link 265 which allows theuser 236 to indicate that they are a football fan from Wisconsin. The link 265 can be included without including a corresponding link for Minnesota, for example, based on theuser 236 being physically located in Wisconsin, or based on other information associated with theuser 236. - In another example, in response to the request for content for the
content slot 246, thecontent management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively. Although the content presented in thevideo player interface 248 is not related to either Minneapolis or St. Paul, the Minneapolis-St. Paul pair can be identified, for example, based on user profile information 270 that is associated with theuser 252. Theuser 252 may, for example, be logged in to an account associated with the content management system 202 (e.g., as indicated by a user label 271). - The
content management system 202 can identify a content item 272 for presentation in thecontent slot 246 and can determine a response metric for Minneapolis users and a response metric for St. Paul users where are each response metric is associated with the content item 272. For example, the content item 272 indicates that there are three hundred forty one “XX” programming language developers in Minneapolis and two hundred eleven “XX” programming language developers in St. Paul. The content item 272 includes a control 273, which allows theuser 252 to indicate that they are an “XX” programming language developer from Minneapolis. The control 273 can be included without including a corresponding control for St. Paul, for example, based on thecontent management system 202 identifying the Minneapolis-related user profile information 270. - In another example, in response to the request for content for the content slot 222, the
content management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes users from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively. Although theuser 228 is not physically located in either Minneapolis or St. Paul and does not have user profile information associated with either city, thecontent management system 202 can identify the Minneapolis-St. Paul pair, for example, based at least in part on the Minneapolis/St. Paul content of thenews page 224. Thecontent management system 202 can determine response metrics for each of Minneapolis and St. Paul where each response metric is associated with an identified content item 276. Thecontent management system 202 can configure the content item 276 so that the response metrics are not initially displayed, but are presented in response to selection of avote link 277 or avote link 278 included in the content item 276. For example, in response to selection of thevote link 278, the content item 276 can be updated to include metrics which indicate the number of football fans in Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively, as illustrated by an updatedcontent item 280. The response metric for Minneapolis can include the vote associated with the selection of thelink 278 by theuser 226 and theresponse metrics database 257 can be updated in response to selection of thevote link 278. - Other types of entity pairs can be identified. In some implementations, any pair of entities that represents a dichotomy of users can be identified. For example, in response to the request for content for the
content slot 214, thecontent management system 202 can identify a pair of social identity groups that includes mobile device users and desktop users (e.g., based on determining that themobile device 218 is a mobile device). Thecontent management system 202 can determine response metrics associated with an identifiedcontent item 280 for each of mobile device users and desktop users. For example, thecontent item 280 includes information that indicates that 40% of mobile users and 32% of desktop users have designated thecontent item 280. Thecontent item 280 includes acontrol 282 that allows theuser 220 to designate thecontent item 280 as a mobile user. Thecontrol 282 can be included in thecontent item 280 without including a corresponding control for desktop users based on thecontent management system 202 determining that themobile device 218 is a mobile device. - In some implementations and for some requests for content, the content management system might not identify a pair of entities. For example, for the request for content for the
content slot 206, the content management system might not determine a pair of social identity groups that are associated with content identified for thecontent slot 206, with the content presented in the search resultspage 208, or with theuser 208, to name a few examples. In such a situation, thecontent management system 202 may identify some other pair of entities, such as a default pair of entities, or a random pair of entities. As another example, thecontent management system 202 may determine to present a content item that does not include response metrics for a pair of social identity groups. For example, thecontent management system 202 can identify acontent item 290 which includes asingle response metric 292 indicating a number of users who have designated thecontent item 290 and acontrol 294 which allows theuser 208 to designate thecontent item 290. -
FIG. 3A illustrates an example campaignmanagement user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign. The sponsor can select atab 302 to display acampaign configuration area 304. The sponsor can view alist 306 of campaigns by selecting acontrol 307. The sponsor can edit an existing campaign in thecampaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 308) in thecampaign list 306. - The
campaign configuration area 304 includes, among other controls, various controls which the sponsor can use to configure selection criteria that include entity (e.g., social identity group) pairings. The user can select one or more content items included in the campaign using acontrol 309. Content items listed in thecontrol 309 can be template content items which include, for example, variable text which can be populated when the template content item is selected for presentation and after a pair has been associated with the template content item. For example, a template content item can include a scoreboard portion that has both static text and variable text, and the variable text can be populated with the names of entities and with interaction data that is associated with the entities. For example, a template content item may include a scoreboard area that includes two static labels that include the text “fans like this”. Upon selection of a pair, variable text including the name of a first entity in the pair and interaction data associated with the first entity can be added to the first static label to produce a first dynamic label, for example, of “388 Michigan fans like this”. Similarly, a second dynamic label can be generated corresponding to the second entity (e.g., such as “412 Ohio State fans like this”). - In some implementations, the campaign sponsor can designate different approaches for how a pair is associated with a template content item. For example, a pair can be selected, for example, based on a resource in which the template content item is to be presented and/or based on information associated with the user.
- As another example, the user can select a
control 311 to define or select a specific pair to be associated with the selected template content item(s). If the user selects thecontrol 311, then the selected template content items are enabled to be selected for presentation, such as if a resource or a user associated with a request for content at least partially matches a pair selected or defined by the sponsor. - Entity pairs that have been selected or defined by the sponsor for the selected template content item(s) can be displayed in a
control 312. For example, the sponsor has selected apair 314 that represents a college rivalry between the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University. The sponsor can use a control 316 to select one or more predefined pairs. For example, the control 316 enables selection of the following pairs: a geographic area rivalry pair including Boston and New York, a college football rivalry pair including Michigan and Ohio State, a college football rivalry pair including Oklahoma and Texas, and a college basketball rivalry pair including Duke and North Carolina. After selecting one or more pairs, the sponsor can select anadd control 318 to associate the selected pair(s) with the campaign and to add the selected pair(s) to thecontrol 312. - In some implementations, a group 320 of user interface controls can be used to define a new social identity group pair. For example, the sponsor can enter or select the name of a first social identity group using a
control 322 and can enter or select the name of a second social identity group using acontrol 324. A new pair including the first group and the second group can be associated with the campaign and added to thecontrol 312 by selecting anadd control 326. In some implementations, the newly defined pair can be stored in a repository and used for subsequent population of the control 316 (e.g., in future presentations of theuser interface 300 for the current sponsor or some other sponsor, the control 316 can include social identity group pairs previously defined using the user interface 300). - Pairs can be defined using methods other than selecting or entering names. For example, a sponsor can select a control 328 to cause display of a map interface (not shown) in which the sponsor can define pairs by defining or selecting two geographic areas (e.g., two cities, states, countries, neighborhoods, etc.). After dismissing the map interface, any pairs defined using the map interface can be displayed in the
control 312 and associated with the selected template content item(s). - In some implementations, a sponsor can select a category of entities (e.g., “college basketball rivalries”). In some implementations, a sponsor can define and select a new category of entities. If a sponsor selects a category, a template content item may be selected, for example, for presentation on a resource that is associated with an entity that is of the type represented by the category. For example, if the sponsor associates the category “college basketball rivalries” with a content item, the content item may be selected to be presented on a news page that discusses a recent game for the University of Wisconsin Badgers basketball team. A pair that includes the University of Wisconsin Badgers basketball team may be selected (e.g., a rivalry between the University of Wisconsin Badgers and the University of Minnesota Gophers), and a scoreboard which includes interaction data for the two groups included in the pair may be presented along with the template content item.
- Although the
user interface 300 is illustrated as enabling one or more pairs to be associated with selected template content item(s) (e.g., either automatically by the content management system or by the user using the user interface 300), in some implementations, the sponsor can (e.g., using a different user interface, not shown) design a content item to be associated with one specific pair. For example, a content item can include a scoreboard portion that includes static text that includes the names of two entities that are included in a pair. The content management system, upon presentation of such a content item, can populate dynamic text with interaction information for the respective entities. Such a content item can be selected for presentation, for example, based at least in part on a resource or the user being associated with one or more of the entities that are associated with the content item. -
FIG. 3B illustrates another example campaignmanagement user interface 350. A campaign sponsor can select areporting control 352 to view aperformance report 353 for a selectedcampaign 354. Theperformance report 353 includes information for content items (e.g., content items one, two, three, and four) that are included in thecampaign 354. For each respective content item included in thereport 353, thereport 353 indicates a pair of entities for which interaction data was presented (e.g., on a scoreboard) along with the content item. For example, thereport 353 indicates that interaction data for “State University” and “State College” was presented with content item one. Theperformance report 353 can include one or more performance metrics for each content item, such as interaction rate (e.g., corresponding to interaction with voting buttons on a scoreboard), click through rate (CTR), and revenue per thousand impressions (RPM). - The performance metrics included in the
performance report 353 can be grouped. For example, for content item one, afirst interaction rate 358 of ten percent indicates that ten percent of users designated State University (e.g., voted for State University) when presented with content item one when content item one is included in a scoreboard including State University and State College. Similarly, for content item one, asecond interaction rate 360 of eleven percent indicates that eleven percent of users designated State College when presented with content item one when content item one is included a scoreboard including State University and State College. As another example, theperformance report 353 indicates, for content item one, a first click throughrate 362 of 4.1 percent that is associated with State University. For example, the first click throughrate 362 can indicate that 4.1 percent of users who voted for State University also selected (e.g., clicked through on) content item one to go to a landing page associated with content item one. As another example, the first click throughrate 362 can indicate that 4.1 percent of users who are in general associated with State University selected content item one. A user can be associated with State University, for example, by voting for State University, being physically located at State University, by viewing a resource that is associated with State University but not with State College, having profile information that is associated with State University, or being associated with historical interaction history associated with State University. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing content. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 or thecontent management system 202 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - A plurality of segments of viewers are identified (402), where each segment is associated with an entity. One example type of entity is a social identity group. In some implementations, a social identity group is a social group that an individual can belong to or have an affinity towards. For example, a social identity group can be associated with a geographic region, such as people living, working, or currently physically located in a particular city, state, neighborhood, country, or other geographic area. Numerous other social identity groups exist, such as students or alumni of a particular school, employees of a particular company, retired persons, men, women, and many others.
- One or more pairs of segments are identified for comparison (404). A pair can, for example, include rivals. For example, a pair of segments can include two schools who are rivals in sporting and other competitions. As another example, a pair can include two rival geographic areas (e.g., two rival cities, neighborhoods, countries, or states). For example, Boston and New York can be a pair of rival geographic areas.
- In general, a pair can include two segments which are related in some way, and where generally a user may be associated with one but not both of the social identity groups associated with the segments included in the pair. For example, for some pairs, each segment is generally (e.g., significantly) a converse of the other segment. For example, a pair can include stay-at-home parents and work-outside-the-home parents.
- Responsive to a request for content, a content item is identified for presentation on a user device (406). For example, a content item can be identified that has characteristics matching a content slot associated with the request. The content item can be identified at least in part based on content of a resource which includes the content slot.
- A first pair of segments that are associated with the content item is identified (408). For example, in some implementations, the content item is associated with a campaign and selection criteria for the campaign for presenting the content item include criteria that specify one or more pairs. If one or more pairs are specified in the selection criteria, a particular pair may be identified. The selection criteria can specify, for example, that the user or that a resource associated with the request be associated with one or both of the segments in a pair.
- A response metric associated with responses to the content item is determined for each segment of the first segment pair (410), where the responses are attributable to entities in a given segment. Each response metric can include, for example, interaction data for members of a respective segment.
- The content item is provided responsive to the request (412), including providing results associated with the response metric for one or both segments of the first pair of segments for presentation along with the content item. For example, a scoreboard presentation that includes interaction data along with a designator for each respective segment of the first pair of segments can be provided.
-
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for providing content. The process 500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 or thecontent management system 202 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - A content item is identified for presentation responsive to a request from a device (502). For example, a content item can be identified that has characteristics matching a content slot associated with the request. The content item can be identified at least in part based on content of a resource which includes the content slot.
- A first pair of segments of viewers that have been associated with the content item is determined (504), where the first pair includes a rival pair of social entities. The rival pair of social entities can include, for example, two competing schools, two rival geographic areas, or some other type of pair that represents a rivalry.
- Interaction data attributable to entities in respective segments of the first pair to the content item is determined (506). For example, the interaction data can include data which indicates a number of users in each segment who have previously designated the content item.
- The content item is provided along with comparison information based at least in part on the interaction data (508). For example, a scoreboard presentation that includes the comparison information can be provided. The scoreboard can include a control for each segment which allows a user to designate the content item in association with the segment that corresponds to a selected control.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram of computing devices 600, 650 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. Computing device 650 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. - Computing device 600 includes a
processor 602,memory 604, astorage device 606, a high-speed interface 608 connecting tomemory 604 and high-speed expansion ports 610, and alow speed interface 612 connecting tolow speed bus 614 andstorage device 606. Each of thecomponents processor 602 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 600, including instructions stored in thememory 604 or on thestorage device 606 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 616 coupled tohigh speed interface 608. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 600 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 604 stores information within the computing device 600. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 604 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 606 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 600. In one implementation, thestorage device 606 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 606 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 604, thestorage device 606, or memory onprocessor 602. - The
high speed controller 608 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 600, while thelow speed controller 612 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only.
