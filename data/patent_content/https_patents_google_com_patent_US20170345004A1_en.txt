- a risk analysis system receives and stores user activity data about the product.
- the user allows the risk analysis system to store the user's search history for the product.
- the merchant sends a purchase transaction request to the risk analysis system for evaluation of the purchase transaction. Based on the request, the risk analysis system locates the record for the user and determines whether the product is identified in the user activity data.
- the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent.
- the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- An absence of the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a neutral or negative factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- a user registers with the risk analysis system.
- the user provides the user's name and other information so that the risk analysis system can create an account (or record) for the user.
- the user may also provide a user name and password so that the user can access a user account of the risk analysis system.
- the user may also provide one or more user financial accounts, such as a credit card account or a debit card account, that the user intends the risk analysis system to monitor.
- the risk analysis system also receives an authorization from the user to monitor the activities of the user.
- the user may activate or otherwise authorize an application executing on the user device to monitor the user's activities, such as the user's online activities or the location of the user device.
- the user may have to select a setting or install an application.
- a user conducts activity related to a product or service.
- the activity can encompass any activity related to a product or service.
- the user may conduct online activities, such as researching a product online to learn more about the product.
- a user interested in purchasing a television may research product specifications online or conduct online price comparisons for particular televisions.
- a user may also email a friend about a television the user intends to purchase.
- the user may later post information about the purchased television in a social network of the user, or prior to purchase post information about a television the user is considering purchasing.
- a user may research particular vacation destinations, airfare, or other products or services related to a destination online.
- the user may also email friends about a planned vacation or share vacation destination ideas on line.
- a user may also post information online about a trip the user has recently taken.
- the user may visit a merchant storefront to examine a product. For example, the user may visit several electronics stores while shopping for a television.
- the risk analysis system Based on the user's authorization for the risk analysis system to determine the user's activities, the risk analysis system receives relevant user activity data. That is, at the option of the user, the risk analysis system receives information about the user's activities related to products and services. For example, the risk analysis system receives the user's search history regarding the television the user intends to purchase. The risk analysis system may also receive any other online user activity related to a product or service, such as the user's search history regarding a vacation destination or user emails. For example, the risk analysis system may receive emails pertaining to products and services, such as emails about a planned vacation or a vacation the user has recently taken. The risk analysis system may also receive information for products or services that the user shares online, such as in a social network.
- the risk analysis system may receive authorized location data for the user device. That is, if the user includes their location information as part of the user activity to be monitored, the risk analysis system receives location data from the user device regarding locations pertinent to products and services. For example, if a user visits an electronics store, such as in the user's search for a television, the risk analysis system may receive location data for the electronics store. Likewise, if a user visits a travel agent, such as while planning a vacation, the risk analysis system may receive location data for the travel agent.
- the user device can obtain the location data by any suitable method, such as through a location service that relies on a global positioning system (“GPS”) or Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular communication towers available to the user device.
- the location data can comprise any information that establishes the location of the user's computing device, such as a street address, Ordnance Survey Grid Reference information, and/or latitude and longitude coordinates for points of interest.
- the risk analysis system After receiving the activity data of the user and at the option of the user, the risk analysis system associates the activity data with a record for the user. That is, the risk analysis system stores the user activity data in an accessible account record associated with the user, so that the risk analysis system can later access the activity. For example, when the risk analysis system receives the name of the user or user account information, such as from a merchant as described herein, the risk analysis system can locate the record of the user, along with the stored user activity data associated with the user account.
- the risk analysis system After the risk analysis system has received and stored user activity data for a particular user, the risk analysis system receives a purchase transaction request for a purchase transaction involving a financial account of the user. For example, a purchaser attempts to purchase a product with a financial account of the user at a point-of-sale terminal of a merchant, such as by swiping a credit card. Before completing the purchase transaction, the merchant sends a request to the risk analysis system to receive a risk score for the purchase transaction.
- the request includes, for example, information sufficient to identify the record for the user, as well as information about the product or service that was (or will be) purchased.
- the purchase transaction request may identify a financial account of the user that a purchaser has presented to complete the purchase transaction.
- the purchaser may be the user, in which case the purchase transaction would likely not be fraudulent. If the purchaser is not the user, however, the transaction is likely fraudulent.
- the merchant or a custodian of the financial account such as the account issuer, for example, may send a purchase transaction request regarding the purchase transaction.
- the risk analysis system then receives the request and provides a risk score to the financial account issuer.
- the risk analysis system determines a risk score or risk indicator for the purchase transaction based on the information received in the purchase transaction request and the information in the user activity data.
- the risk analysis system reads the content of the purchase transaction request to identify the product or service that is the subject of the purchase transaction. For example, the risk analysis system may determine that the purchase transaction concerns a television or an airline ticket, such as an airline ticket to a particular vacation destination.
- the risk analysis system also determines user-identity information from the request, such as by reading the account information used in the purchase transaction. The risk analysis system then uses the user identification information to locate the record of the user corresponding to the identification information.
- the risk analysis system After identifying the user record based on the user information, the risk analysis system compares the identified product or service to the user activity record to determine purchase transaction indicators for the product. That is, the risk analysis system reads the stored user activity history for any sign or other indication that the user would purchase the product or service of the purchase transaction.
- the indicators can comprise any connection or correlation between the product or service identified in the purchase transaction request and the activity data associated with the record for the user. For example, a user search history for a television would constitute an indicator that the user may purchase the television. Likewise, location data showing that the user device (and hence the user) was recently at an electronics store may also serve as an indicator that the user would purchase a television.
- the risk analysis system Based on the purchase transaction indicators that the risk analysis system determines from the user activity data, the risk analysis system generates a risk score or risk indicator for the purchase transaction. The risk analysis system then communicates the risk score or risk indicator to the entity, such as a merchant, that sought the risk score. For example, if the risk analysis system is unable to determine any purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction, the risk analysis system generates a neutral or negative score or indicator for the purchase transaction.
- a neutral or negative score reflects the fact that nothing in the user activity data suggests that the user would purchase the product or service associated with the purchase transaction.
- a merchant providing a purchase transaction request for the purchase of a television may receive a neutral or negative score when nothing in the user activity indicates that the user would purchase the television. Based on the neutral or negative score, the merchant may thus conclude that the purchaser is fraudulently attempting to buy the television or may look for other indicators of fraudulent activity.
- the negative risk-score may also prompt the merchant to require additional identification from the purchaser to confirm the purchaser's identity and the validity of the purchase transaction.
- an absence of the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a neutral or negative factor (or indicator) among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- the risk analysis system determines purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data, the risk analysis system generates a positive score in response to the purchase transaction request.
- user activity data indicating that a user would purchase a television would operate as a purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction involving a television. Based on the identification of such an indicator, the risk analysis system would generate a positive score in response to the purchase transaction request for the purchase transaction involving the television.
- the risk analysis system identified a purchase transaction indicator for airfare to a vacation destination—such as a user search history concerning the vacation destination—the risk analysis system would generate a positive risk score for the airfare purchase.
- the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent.
- the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor (or indicator) among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- the risk score that the risk analysis system generates is qualitative. For example, the identification of one or more purchase transaction indicators may result in a “Yes” response from the risk analysis system indicating that the purchase transaction is likely valid. In the absence of any purchase transaction indicators, a “No” response from the risk analysis system indicates that the risk analysis system cannot conform whether the transaction is fraudulent, or that the transaction may be fraudulent, and that hence the entity receiving the “No” response should take precautions or request additional information prior to approving the transaction.
- the determined risk score is quantitative. That is, the risk analysis system may configure the risk score to correspond to the number and/or weight of the identified indicators. For example, a single purchase transaction indicator for a particular purchase transaction may result in a low score, whereas the identification of multiple purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction results in a high score.
- a single purchase transaction indicator that a user would purchase a television may result in a risk score of “1.”
- additional purchase transaction indicators such as user emails regarding a television purchase, then a higher score of “9” or “10” may be generated, thus indicating a very low likelihood that the purchase transaction is fraudulent.
- the risk analysis system may weight different purchase transaction indicators differently when generating a risk score. For example, when the purchase transaction involves a television, user emails about a television may receive more or less weight than location data placing the user device near an electronics score.
- a financial account of the user is associated with the risk analysis system.
- the risk analysis system may be associated with a digital wallet account of the user.
- the risk analysis system receives a purchase transaction authorization request from a merchant.
- the purchase transaction authorization request can operate as a purchase transaction request.
- the risk analysis system determines a risk score as described herein before authorizing the transaction.
- the risk analysis system may determine negative risk score for a purchase transaction after the transaction is completed, in which case the risk analysis system may communicate a warning to the user, merchant, financial account issuer, or other entity that the transaction may be fraudulent.
- a user can increase the likelihood that fraudulent activity involving the user's purchase transactions is detected.
- the risk analysis system described herein determine and store user activity data—and provide purchase transaction risk-scores/indicators based on the user activity data—a user can increase the likelihood that fraudulent transactions involving the user's financial accounts will be detected.
- the methods and systems described herein not only benefit the user, but also merchants, financial account issuers, or any other entities seeking to reduce fraudulent purchase transactions.

- the risk analysis system 140 may receive the purchase transaction request information from the digital wallet application 111 on the user device 110 when the user 101 makes a purchase with the digital wallet application 111 .
- the risk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for the purchase transaction. That is, the risk analysis system reads the purchase transaction request to identity both the product associated with the request and the user 101 . For example, the risk analysis system 140 may determine that the product is a television. The risk analysis system 140 then locates the record for the identified user 101 . The risk analysis system 140 then compares the identified product to the user activity data associated with the record for the user 101 to identify purchase transaction indicators for the product. For example, the risk analysis system 140 looks for a signal in the user activity data for the user 101 indicating that the user would purchase the identified product. If the product is a television, for example, the risk analysis system 140 may look for an indication regarding the particular television. Based on the identified purchase transaction indicators, the risk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for the purchase transaction. Example details of block 230 are described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the risk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to the entity providing the purchase transaction request. That is, after determining a risk score for the purchase transaction request, the risk analysis system 140 transmits the determined risk score to the entity providing the purchase transaction request, such as via the network 105 . For example, the risk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to a merchant that has provided a purchase transaction request for a television. If a custodian of the user financial account 172 , such as the financial account issuer system 170 , provides the purchase transaction request, then the risk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to the custodian. The risk score, for example, operates to inform the entity providing the purchase transaction request of the fraud risk associated with the purchase transaction. In certain example embodiments, the risk analysis system 140 may also communicate the risk score to the user 101 . After receiving the risk score, the entity receiving the score can take whatever action is appropriate in view of the received risk score, such as asking for additional identity verification from the purchaser.
- the risk analysis system 140 provides a risk score to the merchant system 130 , for example, indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent.
- the product being identified in the user activity data can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- the risk analysis system 140 provides a risk score to the merchant system 130 , for example, indicating that the purchase transaction is may be fraudulent or that the risk analysis system 140 does not have information to support a positive assessment of the transaction.
- the product not being identified in the user activity data can be used as a negative or neutral factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 230 for determining a risk score for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments, as referenced in block 230 of FIG. 3 .
- the risk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction request to identify the product associated with purchase transaction and the user information. For example, if the product associated with the purchase transaction is a television, the risk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product is a television. Likewise, if the product of the purchase transaction is airfare, the risk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product is airfare. If the product of the purchase transaction is a travel agent service fee, for example, the risk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product a travel agent service fee.
- the risk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction request to identify information associated with the user 101 . That is, the risk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction for information that allows the risk analysis system 140 to identify the record of the user, such as the user account 143 , as described herein. For example, a purchaser may present an account number for a user financial account 172 to complete a transaction. If the account number is provided as part of the purchase transaction request, the risk analysis system 140 identifies the account number, for example.
- the risk analysis system 140 may determine other user-identifying information from the purchase transaction request. For example, the purchaser may provider the user's name when attempting to complete a purchase transaction. If the name of the user 101 is included as part of the purchase transaction request, then the risk analysis system 140 determines the name of the user 101 from the purchase transaction request. In certain example embodiments, if the purchase transaction request does not include sufficient information for the risk analysis system 140 to identify either the product or the record of the user 101 , then the risk analysis system 140 may seek additional information regarding the purchase transaction request. For example, the risk analysis system 140 may contact the merchant providing the request.
- the risk analysis system 140 locates the record for the user 101 based on information in the purchase transaction request. That is, based on the user-identifying information from the purchase transaction request, the risk analysis system 140 identifies the record of the user 101 associated with the user activity data. For example, the risk analysis system 140 identifies the user account 143 of the risk analysis system 140 . To locate the record of the user 101 , the risk analysis system 140 , for example, compares the user-identifying information of the purchase transaction request with the information for the user account 143 . For example, the risk analysis system 140 compares the financial account number received in the purchase transaction request with the financial account numbers that the user 101 provides to the risk analysis system 140 when establishing the user account 143 .
- the risk analysis system 140 locates the user account 143 based on a match of the financial account numbers.
- the risk analysis system 140 may identify the record of the user, such as the user account 143 , based on other information provided in the purchase transaction request. For example, as described herein the risk analysis system 140 may identify the name of the user from the purchase transaction request.
- the risk analysis system 140 compares the identified product to the user activity data to determine purchase transaction indicators for the product. That is, based on the product identified from the purchase transaction request, the risk analysis system 140 scans the user activity data associated with the record of the user 101 for purchase transaction indicators.
- the purchase transaction indicators comprise any indication, such as an sign, signal, note, confirmation, corroboration, confirmation, or any other evidence, that user 101 might purchase the product that is the subject of the purchase transaction.
- the purchase transaction indicators comprise any connection or correlation between the product identified in the purchase transaction request and the activity data associated with the record for the user 101 .
- a user search history for a television would constitute a purchase transaction indicator that the user may purchase the television.
- location data showing that the user device (and hence the user) was recently at an electronics store may also serve as an indicator that the user would purchase a television.
- location data placing the user 101 at a travel agent may serve as a purchase transaction indication that the user 101 may purchase airfare.
- numerous activities of a user 101 that are included in a user's activity data may service as a purchase transaction indicator of the user 101 for a product that is the subject of a user purchase transaction.
- the online activity information generated by the online activity of the user 101 may provide one or more purchase transaction indicators for a purchase transaction.
- the method follows the “yes” branch of block 320 to block 325 . If the risk analysis system 140 does not identify any purchase transaction indicators for a purchase transaction in the user activity data for a user 101 , the method follows the “no” branch of block 320 to block 330 . From blocks 325 and 330 , the method 230 proceeds to block 235 of FIG. 2 .
- the risk management system 140 generates a positive risk score. That is, if the risk analysis system 140 identifies at least one purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction in the user activity data, the risk management system 140 generates a risk score—in response to the purchase transaction request—that informs the recipient of the risk score that the transaction is less likely to be fraudulent. For example, if the risk management system 140 identifies—based on a purchase transaction request for a television—a purchase transaction indicator for the television, such as a user search for the television, the risk management system 140 generates a positive risk score for the purchase transaction request for the television. If the product is identified in the user activity data, the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent. Alternatively, the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. In this case, the risk score is the positive factor provided for consideration by the entity receiving the risk score.
- the risk management system 140 provides a positive risk score for the user's airfare purchase.
- the risk management system 140 provides a positive risk score for a user television purchase.
- the location data placing the user 101 at the electronics store serves as a purchase transaction indicator for the television.
- the risk management system 140 relies on the location data to generate a positive risk score for the television purchase.
- the positive risk score may be a qualitative risk score. That is, after identifying a purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction, the risk analysis system 140 generates a risk score that indicates a lower risk of fraud, but that does not attempt to quantitate the level of risk. For example, the risk analysis system 140 may generate a “yes” score, a “positive” score, a “low risk” score, or any other qualitative-type score that arises from the risk analysis system 140 identifying one or more purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data. The risk analysis system 140 can then communicate such qualitative risk scores to the entity requesting the score, thus informing the entity that the purchase transaction is (or was) less likely to be fraudulent.
- the risk analysis system 140 generates a quantitative risk score. That is, the risk analysis system 140 associates with the risk score a measure of likelihood that the purchase transaction is (or was) fraudulent.
- the risk analysis system 140 provide a risk score that is a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators for a particular purchase transaction that the risk analysis system 140 identifies in the user activity data. For example, a single purchase transaction indicator for a particular purchase transaction may result in a low score, whereas the identification of multiple purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction results in a high score.
- a single purchase transaction indicator that a user would purchase a television may result in a risk score of “1.”
- the identification of two indicators may results in a risk score of “5” or “6.”
- the risk score may also be range, for example, such as 1-10, with “1” corresponding to the identification of a single or a few purchase transaction indicators and “10” corresponding to the identification of multiple transaction indicators.
- the risk score may correspond to the number of purchase transaction indicators that the risk analysis system 140 identifies is in the user activity data. For example, if the risk analysis system 140 identifies 20 purchase transaction indicators, the risk analysis system 140 may generate a risk score of “20.”
- the risk analysis system 140 may assign weights to various purchase transaction indicators identified in a user's activity data. That is, in addition or alternatively to being a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators, the risk score may be a function of weighted purchase transaction indicators. The risk analysis system 140 , for example, may assign more weight to those purchase transaction indicators that the risk analysis system 140 deems to be more predicative of purchasing the product that is the subject o the purchase transaction. For example, if the purchase transaction involves a television, user emails about a specific television may receive more weight than location data placing the user device near an electronics score. In another example, a user search history for airfare may receive more weight than a user 101 posting non-specific vacation photographs on a social network page.
- a user search history for televisions generally may receive less weight than a user search history for a specific television.
- the risk analysis system 140 described herein may determine a number of quantitative risk scores that are a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators and/or the weight assigned to one or more of the purchase transactions.
- the risk management system 140 generates negative or neutral risk score. That is, if the risk management system 140 does not identify any purchase transaction indicators for a particular purchase transaction in the user activity data, the risk management system 140 generates a risk score—in response to the purchase transaction request—that informs the recipient of the risk score that the transaction might be fraudulent or that the risk management system 140 does not have information to assess whether the transaction is fraudulent.
- the risk management system 140 generates a negative score, for example, such as a “No” score or “likely fraudulent” score.
- the risk management system 140 may generate a neutral score, such as a “no score available” or “no indicators identified” score.
- the risk management system 140 may generate a neutral score in the absence of an identified purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction.
- an absence of the product being identified in the user activity data can be used as a neutral or negative factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- the risk score is the positive factor provided for consideration by the entity receiving the risk score.
- the risk analysis system 140 may independently obtain general information that may be useful to the risk analysis functions of the risk management system 140 .
- the risk analysis system 140 may obtain information for specific merchants, online merchants, retailers, online retailers, service providers, online service providers, restaurants, landmarks, buildings, parks, rail stations, airports, ports, sports arenas, or any other location or entities that might be useful to the risk analysis functions of the risk management system 140 .
- the risk analysis system 140 may obtain the information from any source.
- the risk analysis system 140 may obtain the information from online sources, such as merchant or retailer websites.
- the risk analysis system 140 may also categorize the information for use in determining a risk score.
- a restaurant called “John Doe's Steak House,” for example, may be hierarchically categorized from a specific category to a more general category. That is, beyond the specific name “John Doe's Steak House,” the risk analysis system 140 may categorize the restaurant as a “steak house,” a “fine-dining restaurant,” a “restaurant,” or “food,” with the latter category of “food” being the most generic (in this example).
- the risk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for a particular user 101 that is a function of both the categorized information and purchase transaction indicators identified in the user activity data. That is, the risk analysis system 140 may weight a purchase transaction indicator based on the category of information to which the identified purchase transaction indicator corresponds.
- an identified purchase transaction indicator such as a user search for “John Doe's Steak House”—would receive significantly more weight than a user search for “food.”
- a search by the user 101 for “steak house” would receive more weight than a user search for a “restaurant.”
- the risk analysis system 140 may categorize a television based first on the particular television, and thereafter the “brand name” of the television, “televisions” generally, and then “consumer electronics.”
- a purchase transaction for the particular television may receive the highest weight, with the categories of “brand name,” “televisions” generally, and “consumer electronics” respectively receiving less and less weight.
- the risk analysis system 140 determines categorized information for use in a risk score determination in response to receiving a purchase transaction request. For example, the risk analysis system 140 may receive a purchase transaction request for “John Doe's Steak House.” In response to the purchase transaction request, the risk analysis system 140 may determine that the “John Doe's Steak House” is a steak house, and hence further determine categories of “steak house,” “fine-dining restaurant,” “restaurant,” and “food” for “John Doe's Steak House.” The risk analysis system 140 may then, when processing the purchase transaction request for “John Doe's Steak House,” correlate an identified purchase transaction indicator to the determined category as described herein.
- a purchase transaction indicator such as a user online search for “steak house,” may receive more weight than a user online search for the more general category of “food.”
- the risk analysis system 140 may receive a purchase transaction request for a particular television. In response to the request, the risk analysis system 140 may determine “brand name,” “televisions,” and “consumer electronics” categories for the television. The risk analysis system 140 can then identify purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data as described herein, and also weight the identified purchase transaction indicators based on the more specific (or less specific) determined categories. For example, a purchase transaction indicator for the “brand name,” such as a search by the user 101 for the “brand name,” may receive more weight than a search by the user 101 for “consumer electronics.”

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to fraud prevention, and more particularly to methods and systems that rely on user-provided activity data, such as user search history, to detect possible fraudulent activity for purchase transactions involving a financial account of the user.
- Electronic commerce, such as online shopping, has been increasingly common since the advent of the Internet. Online shopping websites generally provide a user interface for customers to select products to purchase. After the customer has selected products for purchase, the customer typically may choose from multiple payment options to purchase the products.
- One conventional payment option generally supported by both merchant storefronts and online merchants is the use of a user financial account, such as a credit card account. To make an online purchase with a credit card, for example, a user will commonly enter necessary credit card information online. For example, a user wishing to purchase a product online will enter an account identifier (such as a credit card number, debit card number, etc.), shipping information, and the name, address, and contact information of the user. To make a purchase at a merchant storefront, the user will typically swipe the card or provide the card to a merchant storefront operator that manually enters the credit card information.
- Although the use of user financial accounts to conduct purchase transactions is convenient for both the user and the merchant, relying on user financial accounts to conduct purchase transactions is subject to fraudulent activity. For example, it is becoming increasingly difficult for online shoppers to keep their credit card information confidential and out of the possession of those who would use that information for fraudulent purposes. Likewise, users that keep a physical credit card must worry about theft of the physical card or the information contained thereon. Merchants themselves even present a potential risk to a user, whether through negligence or intentional fraud. For example, an employee of a merchant may submit erroneous transaction information to the financial institution issuing the financial account.
- Once a user's financial information is stolen, the user—and the financial institution issuing the financial account—has limited means of determining whether subsequent purchases are legitimate or fraudulent. And while fraud detection systems have been developed that rely on historical transaction data of the user in an attempt to predict subsequent user transactions, the narrow focus of these systems on user transaction history continues to leave users vulnerable to fraud. Such systems are thus inadequate at detecting fraud.
- In certain example aspects described herein, a computer-implemented method for transaction risk analysis is provided. A risk analysis system receives a registration from a user that desires to have their purchase transactions monitored for possible fraudulent activity. The risk analysis system, for example, receives user activity data associated with a user, such as online activity information that is generated by the user's online activity. The risk analysis system associates the user activity data with a record for the user. The risk analysis system then receives a purchase transaction request, such as from a merchant computing system. The purchase transaction request identifies a product for a purchase transaction involving a financial account of the user and provides information sufficient to identify the record of the user.
- Based on the information in the purchase transaction request, for example, the risk analysis system identifies the record of the user. The risk analysis system then compares the identity of the product with the online activity information for the user to determine a purchase transaction indicator for the product in the online activity information. The purchase transaction indicator, for example, provides an indication that the user may purchase the product. Based on the comparison of the identity of the product with the online activity information for the user, the risk analysis system determines a risk score or indicator for the purchase transaction and communicates the risk score or indicator to the merchant computing system.
- In certain other example aspects, a system for transaction risk analysis provided herein. Also provided in certain aspects is a computer program product to analyze transaction risk.
- These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for determining transaction risk for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for transaction risk analysis for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for determining a risk score for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - As disclosed herein, a risk analysis system allows a participating user to have their purchase transactions monitored for possible fraudulent transactions. A user conducts activities related to a particular product or service, such as conducting searches to purchase a product online. At the option of the user, a risk analysis system receives and stores user activity data about the product. For example, the user allows the risk analysis system to store the user's search history for the product. When a purchase attempt is made with the user's financial account at a merchant, for example, the merchant sends a purchase transaction request to the risk analysis system for evaluation of the purchase transaction. Based on the request, the risk analysis system locates the record for the user and determines whether the product is identified in the user activity data. If the product is identified, the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent. Alternatively, the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. An absence of the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a neutral or negative factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- More particularly, a user registers with the risk analysis system. As part of the registration, the user provides the user's name and other information so that the risk analysis system can create an account (or record) for the user. In certain examples, the user may also provide a user name and password so that the user can access a user account of the risk analysis system. The user may also provide one or more user financial accounts, such as a credit card account or a debit card account, that the user intends the risk analysis system to monitor. The risk analysis system also receives an authorization from the user to monitor the activities of the user. For example, in certain example embodiments the user may activate or otherwise authorize an application executing on the user device to monitor the user's activities, such as the user's online activities or the location of the user device. In order to obtain the benefits of the techniques herein and such monitoring, the user may have to select a setting or install an application.
- Following user registration, a user conducts activity related to a product or service. The activity can encompass any activity related to a product or service. For example, the user may conduct online activities, such as researching a product online to learn more about the product. A user interested in purchasing a television, for instance, may research product specifications online or conduct online price comparisons for particular televisions. A user may also email a friend about a television the user intends to purchase. The user may later post information about the purchased television in a social network of the user, or prior to purchase post information about a television the user is considering purchasing. In other examples, a user may research particular vacation destinations, airfare, or other products or services related to a destination online. The user may also email friends about a planned vacation or share vacation destination ideas on line. A user may also post information online about a trip the user has recently taken. In certain examples, the user may visit a merchant storefront to examine a product. For example, the user may visit several electronics stores while shopping for a television.
- Based on the user's authorization for the risk analysis system to determine the user's activities, the risk analysis system receives relevant user activity data. That is, at the option of the user, the risk analysis system receives information about the user's activities related to products and services. For example, the risk analysis system receives the user's search history regarding the television the user intends to purchase. The risk analysis system may also receive any other online user activity related to a product or service, such as the user's search history regarding a vacation destination or user emails. For example, the risk analysis system may receive emails pertaining to products and services, such as emails about a planned vacation or a vacation the user has recently taken. The risk analysis system may also receive information for products or services that the user shares online, such as in a social network.
- In addition to the user's online activities, the risk analysis system may receive authorized location data for the user device. That is, if the user includes their location information as part of the user activity to be monitored, the risk analysis system receives location data from the user device regarding locations pertinent to products and services. For example, if a user visits an electronics store, such as in the user's search for a television, the risk analysis system may receive location data for the electronics store. Likewise, if a user visits a travel agent, such as while planning a vacation, the risk analysis system may receive location data for the travel agent. The user device can obtain the location data by any suitable method, such as through a location service that relies on a global positioning system (“GPS”) or Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular communication towers available to the user device. The location data can comprise any information that establishes the location of the user's computing device, such as a street address, Ordnance Survey Grid Reference information, and/or latitude and longitude coordinates for points of interest.
- After receiving the activity data of the user and at the option of the user, the risk analysis system associates the activity data with a record for the user. That is, the risk analysis system stores the user activity data in an accessible account record associated with the user, so that the risk analysis system can later access the activity. For example, when the risk analysis system receives the name of the user or user account information, such as from a merchant as described herein, the risk analysis system can locate the record of the user, along with the stored user activity data associated with the user account.
- After the risk analysis system has received and stored user activity data for a particular user, the risk analysis system receives a purchase transaction request for a purchase transaction involving a financial account of the user. For example, a purchaser attempts to purchase a product with a financial account of the user at a point-of-sale terminal of a merchant, such as by swiping a credit card. Before completing the purchase transaction, the merchant sends a request to the risk analysis system to receive a risk score for the purchase transaction. The request includes, for example, information sufficient to identify the record for the user, as well as information about the product or service that was (or will be) purchased. For example, the purchase transaction request may identify a financial account of the user that a purchaser has presented to complete the purchase transaction. The purchaser may be the user, in which case the purchase transaction would likely not be fraudulent. If the purchaser is not the user, however, the transaction is likely fraudulent. In certain example embodiments, after a purchase transaction is complete, the merchant or a custodian of the financial account such as the account issuer, for example, may send a purchase transaction request regarding the purchase transaction. The risk analysis system then receives the request and provides a risk score to the financial account issuer.
- The risk analysis system determines a risk score or risk indicator for the purchase transaction based on the information received in the purchase transaction request and the information in the user activity data. The risk analysis system reads the content of the purchase transaction request to identify the product or service that is the subject of the purchase transaction. For example, the risk analysis system may determine that the purchase transaction concerns a television or an airline ticket, such as an airline ticket to a particular vacation destination. The risk analysis system also determines user-identity information from the request, such as by reading the account information used in the purchase transaction. The risk analysis system then uses the user identification information to locate the record of the user corresponding to the identification information.
- After identifying the user record based on the user information, the risk analysis system compares the identified product or service to the user activity record to determine purchase transaction indicators for the product. That is, the risk analysis system reads the stored user activity history for any sign or other indication that the user would purchase the product or service of the purchase transaction. The indicators can comprise any connection or correlation between the product or service identified in the purchase transaction request and the activity data associated with the record for the user. For example, a user search history for a television would constitute an indicator that the user may purchase the television. Likewise, location data showing that the user device (and hence the user) was recently at an electronics store may also serve as an indicator that the user would purchase a television. A user search history for a particular vacation destination—or an email or social network entry about the destination—may serve as an indicator that the user, for example, would purchase airfare (or other fare) to the vacation destination.
- Based on the purchase transaction indicators that the risk analysis system determines from the user activity data, the risk analysis system generates a risk score or risk indicator for the purchase transaction. The risk analysis system then communicates the risk score or risk indicator to the entity, such as a merchant, that sought the risk score. For example, if the risk analysis system is unable to determine any purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction, the risk analysis system generates a neutral or negative score or indicator for the purchase transaction.
- In certain examples, a neutral or negative score reflects the fact that nothing in the user activity data suggests that the user would purchase the product or service associated with the purchase transaction. A merchant providing a purchase transaction request for the purchase of a television, for example, may receive a neutral or negative score when nothing in the user activity indicates that the user would purchase the television. Based on the neutral or negative score, the merchant may thus conclude that the purchaser is fraudulently attempting to buy the television or may look for other indicators of fraudulent activity. Hence, the negative risk-score may also prompt the merchant to require additional identification from the purchaser to confirm the purchaser's identity and the validity of the purchase transaction. Additionally, an absence of the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a neutral or negative factor (or indicator) among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- In contrast, if the risk analysis system determines purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data, the risk analysis system generates a positive score in response to the purchase transaction request. As noted above, user activity data indicating that a user would purchase a television would operate as a purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction involving a television. Based on the identification of such an indicator, the risk analysis system would generate a positive score in response to the purchase transaction request for the purchase transaction involving the television. Likewise, if the risk analysis system identified a purchase transaction indicator for airfare to a vacation destination—such as a user search history concerning the vacation destination—the risk analysis system would generate a positive risk score for the airfare purchase. If the product is identified, the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent. Alternatively, the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor (or indicator) among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction.
- In certain examples, the risk score that the risk analysis system generates is qualitative. For example, the identification of one or more purchase transaction indicators may result in a “Yes” response from the risk analysis system indicating that the purchase transaction is likely valid. In the absence of any purchase transaction indicators, a “No” response from the risk analysis system indicates that the risk analysis system cannot conform whether the transaction is fraudulent, or that the transaction may be fraudulent, and that hence the entity receiving the “No” response should take precautions or request additional information prior to approving the transaction.
- In other examples, the determined risk score is quantitative. That is, the risk analysis system may configure the risk score to correspond to the number and/or weight of the identified indicators. For example, a single purchase transaction indicator for a particular purchase transaction may result in a low score, whereas the identification of multiple purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction results in a high score. A single purchase transaction indicator that a user would purchase a television, for example, may result in a risk score of “1.” The identification of two indicators, however—such as a search history for the television and location data placing the user device near an electronics store—may results in a risk score of “5” or “6.” If additional purchase transaction indicators are determined, such as user emails regarding a television purchase, then a higher score of “9” or “10” may be generated, thus indicating a very low likelihood that the purchase transaction is fraudulent. Additionally or alternatively, the risk analysis system may weight different purchase transaction indicators differently when generating a risk score. For example, when the purchase transaction involves a television, user emails about a television may receive more or less weight than location data placing the user device near an electronics score.
- In certain examples, a financial account of the user is associated with the risk analysis system. For example, the risk analysis system may be associated with a digital wallet account of the user. Thus, when the user utilizes the digital wallet account to process a purchase transaction, the risk analysis system receives a purchase transaction authorization request from a merchant. In such examples, the purchase transaction authorization request can operate as a purchase transaction request. In other words, the risk analysis system determines a risk score as described herein before authorizing the transaction. In other examples, the risk analysis system may determine negative risk score for a purchase transaction after the transaction is completed, in which case the risk analysis system may communicate a warning to the user, merchant, financial account issuer, or other entity that the transaction may be fraudulent.
- By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, a user can increase the likelihood that fraudulent activity involving the user's purchase transactions is detected. In other words, by allowing the risk analysis system described herein determine and store user activity data—and provide purchase transaction risk-scores/indicators based on the user activity data—a user can increase the likelihood that fraudulent transactions involving the user's financial accounts will be detected. The methods and systems described herein not only benefit the user, but also merchants, financial account issuers, or any other entities seeking to reduce fraudulent purchase transactions.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for determining transaction risk for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - As depicted in

In some embodiments, auser 101 associated with a device must install an application and/or make a feature selection to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein. - Each
network computing device network 105. For example, eachnetwork device FIG. 1 , thenetwork devices - The
user 101 can use thecommunication application 113, such as a web browser application or a stand-alone application, to view, download, upload, or otherwise access documents or web pages via a distributednetwork 105. Thenetwork 105 includes a wired or wireless telecommunication system or device by which network devices (includingdevices network 105 can include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), an intranet, an Internet, storage area network (SAN), personal area network (PAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a cellular or other mobile communication network, Bluetooth, near field communication (NFC), or any combination thereof or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals, data, and/or messages. - The
communication application 113 can interact with web servers or other computing devices connected to thenetwork 105. For example, thecommunication application 113 can interact with the usernetwork computing device 110, themerchant system 130, therisk analysis system 140, and thefinancial account system 170. Thecommunication application 113 may also comprise a web browser (not shown), which provides a user interface, for example, for accessing other devices associated with thenetwork 105. - The
user computing device 110 may include adigital wallet application 111. Thedigital wallet application 111 may encompass any application, hardware, software, or process theuser computing device 110 may employ to assist theuser 101 in completing a purchase transaction. Thedigital wallet application 111 can interact with thecommunication application 113 or can be embodied as a companion application of thecommunication application 113. As a companion application, thedigital wallet application 111 can execute within thecommunication application 113. That is, thedigital wallet application 111 may be an application program embedded in thecommunication application 113. - The
user computing device 110 may also include arisk analysis application 112. Therisk analysis application 112, for example, communicates and interacts with therisk analysis system 140, such as via that thecommunication application 113. In order to obtain the benefits of therisk analysis system 140 as described herein, for example, auser 101 may have to download and install therisk analysis application 112. Therisk analysis application 112, for example, may be configured, based on user preferences, to obtain, receive, and communicate activity data of theuser 101, such as online activity information pertaining to the user's online activities. For example, therisk analysis application 112 may be configured to receive content of the websites that a user visits. - The
risk analysis application 112 may also be configured to obtain, receive, and/or communicate location data for theuser device 110. For example, therisk analysis application 112 may be configured to communicate and interact with a location service provider that, in conjunction with theuser device 110, facilitates determination of the location of theuser device 110. For example, therisk analysis application 112 may, along with a location service and/or hardware of theuser device 110, rely on WiFi signals and cellular communication towers to determine the location of theuser device 110. Additionally or alternatively, therisk analysis application 112 may rely on satellites, Global Positioning System (“GPS”) location technology, a Network Location Provider (“NLP”), a map application, or other location identifying technology of theuser device 110 to determine location data for theuser device 110. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis application 112 can interact with thedigital wallet application 111 or can be embodied as a companion application of thedigital wallet application 111. As a companion application, therisk analysis application 112 can execute within thedigital wallet application 111. That is, therisk analysis application 112 may be an application program embedded in thedigital wallet application 111. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis application 112 executes and operates independently of thedigital wallet application 111. - The
user computing device 110 may also include adata storage unit 117. The exampledata storage unit 117 can include one or more tangible computer-readable storage devices. Thedata storage unit 117 can be a component of theuser device 110 or be logically coupled to theuser device 110. For example, thedata storage unit 117 can include on-board flash memory and/or one or more removable memory cards or removable flash memory. In certain example embodiments, thedata storage unit 117 may, at the option of the user, store activity data pertaining to theuser 101. - The
merchant computing system 130 represents a system that offers products and/or services for theuser 101 to purchase or use. In certain example embodiments, themerchant system 130 includes a point-of-sale (“POS”)terminal 134. The point-of-sale terminal 134 may be operated by a salesperson that enters purchase data into the point-of-sale terminal to complete a purchase transaction. Themerchant system 130 may be a physical location or an online merchant or comprise both a physical location and an online merchant. Affiliated or associated with themerchant system 130 is a merchant system operator (not shown). Themerchant computing system 130 comprises amerchant server 135, which in certain example embodiments may represent the computer-implemented system that the object provider system 120 employs to create and assemble awebsite 136 and content for thewebsite 136. - The
risk analysis system 140 represents a system for analyzing and determining fraud risk associated with a purchase transaction. Therisk analysis system 140 is configured to interact with and receive data and information from theuser computing device 110 via thenetwork 105. For example, at the option of theuser 101 therisk analysis system 140 is configured to receive user activity data from theuser computing device 110, such as from therisk analysis application 112. Therisk analysis system 140 is also configured to communicate with themerchant system 130 and thefinancial account system 170, such as via thenetwork 105. - The
risk analysis system 140 can include a web sever 141, which may represent the computer-implemented system that therisk analysis system 140 employs to determine fraud risk for a purchase transaction. For example, therisk analysis system 140 and associatedweb server 141 may be configured to obtain user activity data, associate the user activity data with a record for theuser 101, read purchase transaction requests, identify purchase transaction indicators, and determine a risk score for a purchase transaction as described herein.

FIGS. 1 and 2 , inblock 205, a risk analysis system receives registration request of auser 101 and creates a record for theuser 101. That is, auser 101 desiring to have one or more financial accounts 172 monitored for fraud risk establishes a record, such as a user account 143, with therisk analysis system 140. For example, theuser 101 accesses awebsite 142 of therisk analysis system 140 to provide information about theuser 101 to establish the account. The user information may comprise, for example, the name of theuser 101 as well as contact information for theuser 101 such as an email address, mailing address, or telephone number for theuser 101. Theuser 101 may also provide or identify specific user financial accounts 172 that theuser 101 intends therisk analysis system 140 to monitor. Theuser 101 may also provide or select configurable rules or preferences governing the user account 143, such as rules governing communications from therisk analysis system 140. For example, theuser 101 may request to be notified every time therisk analysis system 140 provides a fraud risk score associated with a purchase transaction as described herein. When providing account information, theuser 101 may also provide information regarding theuser device 110, such as the Internet protocol address (IP address) for theuser device 110. - In some embodiments, as part of the registration process, the
user 101 also authorizes therisk analysis system 140 to obtain user activity data for theuser 101. That is, theuser 101 provides consent for therisk analysis system 140 to obtain information about the user's digital activities so that therisk analysis system 140 can monitor the user-specified accounts for potentially fraudulent purchase transactions. For example, theuser 101 may authorize therisk analysis system 140 to receive and obtain user activity data, such as user search history data and user location data (based on the location of the user device 110). Theuser 101 may also authorize therisk analysis system 140 to access email accounts of theuser 101. Theuser 101 may also authorize therisk analysis system 140 to access user data associated with social network websites theuser 101 visits, such as posts or emails theuser 101 communicates through the social network website. Therisk analysis system 140 may also place cookies on theuser device 110, at the option and consent of theuser 101, so that therisk analysis system 140 can identify theuser device 110. In order to obtain the benefits of such monitoring, the user may have to select a setting or install an application, such as therisk analysis application 112. - Based on the information that the
user 101 provides when establishing an account, therisk analysis system 140 receives the information and establishes a record for theuser 101, such as in the user account 143 of therisk analysis system 140. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 provides theuser 101 with online access to the user account 143. For example, therisk analysis system 140 establishes, with theuser 101, a unique username and password that allow theuser 101 to access the user account 143. By accessing the user account 143, theuser 101 can change the user account rules and preferences, such as the rules regarding the communication of risk scores. Theuser 101 can also review and revoke any authorizations or consents that theuser 101 granted to therisk analysis system 140 during the registration process, including those that permit therisk analysis system 140 to obtain and use user activity data for theuser 101. - In
block 210, theuser 101 conducts activity regarding a product. The activity can encompass any activity related to a product. As used herein, a “product” comprises any tangible or intangible product, including services. For example, the product may include merchandise offered for sale at a merchant point-of-sale terminal or at an online retailer. In certain example embodiments, theuser 101 may conduct activity for classes of products, such as electronics. In other examples, theuser 101 may conduct activities for more specific products, such televisions or even a particular model of television. - In certain example embodiments, the user activity comprises online activity, such as searching or researching a product online. For example, a
user 101 may conduct a product search via a web browser (not shown) on theuser device 110. Theuser 101 may also visit product manufacturer websites to learn more about a particular product. For example, auser 101 interested in purchasing a television may research product specifications online or conduct online price comparisons for particular televisions. Auser 101 may likewise visit awebsite 136 of amerchant system 130 that offers a particular product, such as a television, for sale. Auser 101 looking for a particular service, for example, may visit websites that advertise the service or that provide references, reviews, or rankings for various providers of the service. For example, auser 101 looking for a television repair service may research available television repairmen. Theuser 101 may likewise research online reviews for a particular television repairman. In other examples, auser 101 may research particular vacation destinations, airfare, or other products or services related to vacation destinations online. A user may also search online for locations offering a product for sale. - Additionally or alternatively, in certain example embodiments the user activity comprises communications about a product online, such as on a social network website. For example,
user 101 may post information about a product that theuser 101 intends to purchase or that theuser 101 has recently purchased. Theuser 101 may also, for example, share photos of the product or solicit information about the product on the social network website. For example, theuser 101 may share photos of a vacation destination that theuser 101 has visited or intends to visit. Auser 101 may likewise comment on products that other users have purchased. For example, auser 101 provide an indication that theuser 101 likes a particular product or service that is discussed on the social network website. - Additionally or alternatively, in certain example embodiments the user activity comprises electronic communications about a product, such as text messages or emails. For example, a
user 101 may email a manufacturer seeking information about product specifications for a particular product. Theuser 101 may then receive a response email from the manufacturer regarding the product specifications for the product. Theuser 101 may likewise send or receive emails or texts regarding a product toother users 101. For example, auser 101 may email a contact about a particular television that theuser 101 intends to purchase. Auser 101 may also send email communicates to contacts or others, such as travel agents, regarding a vacation destination theuser 101 intends to visit, for example. - Additionally or alternatively, in certain example embodiments the user activity comprises the
user 101 obtaining online digital offers for a product of class of products. For example, theuser 101 may visit one or more websites to clip digital offers for a product such as a discount offer on a television or vacation package. In certain example embodiments, theuser 101 may save the coupons in a digital wallet account of theuser 101, such as via thedigital wallet application 111. The offer can be any type of offer, such as a ticket, coupon, discount, rebate, voucher, special offer, prepaid offer, or any other type of promotion that can be exchanged for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product or service, for example. For online retailers or merchants, for example, the offer may be any type of coupon code, promotional or promo code, discount code, key code, reward code, or any other type code of exchanged for a financial discount on a product. - In certain example embodiments, a
user 101 may visit a merchant storefront, such as a merchant point-of-sale terminal, to research a product or to purchase a product. Thus, in addition to online activities such as searching for a product, the user activity may include theuser 101 visiting a location pertaining to a product. For example, theuser 101 may visit various electronics stores when researching a television. Auser 101 planning a vacation may likewise visit a travel agent to make arrangements for the vacation. - As one skilled in the art will appreciate, a
user 101 may visit a variety of different locations in connection with researching and/or purchasing a product. Auser 101 will henna generate a variety of activity data regarding a user's location. It will also be appreciated that auser 101 may additionally or alternatively conduct a variety of online activities in connection with researching and/or purchasing a product. The user thus will generate a variety of activity data that includes online activity information. - In
block 215, therisk analysis system 140 receives user activity data. That is, based on of the user's authorization for therisk analysis system 140 to receive data regarding the user's activities, therisk analysis system 140 receives content generated by the user's activities. For example, therisk analysis system 140 receives online activity information of theuser 101 that is generated from the user's online activity, such as a search history of a registereduser 101 when the user searches for or researches a product online. Therisk analysis system 140 receives, for example, the user search history for televisions (or a particular television) of interest to theuser 101. In another example, therisk analysis system 140 may receive a user search history, browser history, email, or text for airfare or other fare to a particular destination. - The
risk analysis system 140 may likewise receive a web browsing history (or any other online history) related to any online activity of theuser 101, such as a history of all the websites theuser 101 visits. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may receive a web browsing history for social network sites that theuser 101 visits to discuss a product. Therisk analysis system 140 will also receive—at the option of theuser 101 and as part of the online user activity data—electronic correspondence, such as emails and text messages regarding a product. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may receive email content from theuser 101 to a product manufacturer about a particular product. Therisk analysis system 140 may also receive user activity data regarding the location of the user device 110 (and hence the user 101). For example, the user activity data may comprise locations, such as electronics stores, that theuser 101 has visited when researching or purchasing a television. - The
risk analysis system 140 obtains the user activity data from any source associated with theuser device 110 of theuser 101. For example, the user activity data may come from search engine websites, web browsers, social network website accounts, contact list entries, email contacts, or other programs and applications running or operating on theuser device 110. To obtain location data for theuser device 110, therisk analysis application 112 may rely on a location provider service. For example, the location provider may rely on WiFi signals, cellular communication data, satellites, a Global Positioning System (“GPS”) location technology, a Network Location Provider (“NLP”), a map application, or other location identifying technology of theuser device 110 to determine the user device location. Therisk analysis application 112 may also rely on WiFi hotspots that are available to theuser device 110 to determine the location of theuser device 110. The location data can comprise any information that establishes the location of theuser device 110, such as a street address, Ordnance Survey Grid Reference information, and/or latitude and longitude coordinates of the device. In certain example embodiments, arisk analysis application 112 on theuser device 110 receives the activity data from theuser device 110 and communicates the activity data to therisk analysis system 140. The risk analysis system then receives the user activity data. - In
block 220, therisk analysis system 140 associates user activity data with theuser 101 in a record for the user. That is, after therisk analysis system 140 receives the user activity data for aparticular user 101, therisk analysis system 140 identifies the record, such as the user account 143, corresponding to theuser 101 the generated the activity data. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may identify the record of theuser 101 based on cookies placed on theuser device 110. Therisk analysis system 140 may also determine the Internet protocol address (IP address) for theuser device 110 from the user activity data. Therisk analysis system 140 may also rely on other information provided by theuser 101 to identify the record of theuser 101, such as login credentials that theuser 101 may provide when logging in to a search engine or social network website, for example. - After identifying the record of the
user 101, therisk analysis system 140 links the user activity data with the user account 143 so that the activity data is accessible to therisk analysis system 140. For example, therisk analysis system 140 stores the user activity data, along with information for the user account 143, in thedata storage unit 147 of the risk analysis system. In certain example embodiments, such as when therisk analysis system 140 operates completely or partially on theuser device 110, therisk analysis application 112 may store all or part of the user activity data in thedata storage unit 117 of theuser device 110. Therisk analysis system 140 and/or therisk analysis application 112 then access the use activity data as described herein to determine a risk score for a particular purchase transaction associated a user financial account 172. - In
block 225, therisk analysis system 140 receives a purchase transaction request involving a user financial account 172. That is, once therisk analysis system 140 has associated user activity data with the record for aparticular user 101, the risk analysis system receives receive a request to process a pending or completed purchase transaction involving the user's financial account 172. The purchase transaction comprises information identifying theuser 101, such as an account number for the user's financial account 172, as well as information about the product being purchased (such as a television). For example, a purchaser attempts to purchase a product, such as a television, online or at a merchant point-of-sale terminal 134 using an account number associated with the user financial account 172. The purchaser, for example, may be theparticular user 101 associated with the user financial account 172. But in other instances, such as when the information for the user's financial account 172 has been stolen, the purchaser may not be theuser 101 and hence the purchase transaction is a fraudulent transaction. Based on the attempted purchase, a merchant operator (not shown) associated with themerchant system 130 sends a purchase transaction request to therisk analysis system 140, such as via thenetwork 105. For example, therisk analysis system 140 and themerchant system 130 communicate via a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP). In other example embodiments, themerchant system 130 may rely on conventional credit card processing to indirectly communicate with therisk analysis system 140 over the conventional credit card channels. Therisk analysis system 140 then receives the transaction request. - Additionally or alternatively, in certain example embodiments a custodian of the financial account, such as the financial
account issuer system 170, may send the purchase transaction request. For example, when the financialaccount issuer system 170 may receive an authorization request for an identified product from amerchant system 130, such as through an acquirer associated with themerchant system 130. The financialaccount issuer system 170 may then send a purchase transaction request to therisk analysis system 140. In other example embodiments, the financialaccount issuer system 170 may send the risk analysis system 140 a purchase transaction request for a completed purchase transaction in order to assess the likelihood of fraud associated with the completed transaction. In other embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 may administer or otherwise operate as the custodian of one or more financial accounts for theuser 101, such as a digital wallet account for theuser 101. In such embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 may evaluate the risk of fraud as described herein for purchase transactions involving the digital wallet account for theuser 101. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may receive the purchase transaction request information from thedigital wallet application 111 on theuser device 110 when theuser 101 makes a purchase with thedigital wallet application 111. - In
block 230, therisk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for the purchase transaction. That is, the risk analysis system reads the purchase transaction request to identity both the product associated with the request and theuser 101. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may determine that the product is a television. Therisk analysis system 140 then locates the record for the identifieduser 101. Therisk analysis system 140 then compares the identified product to the user activity data associated with the record for theuser 101 to identify purchase transaction indicators for the product. For example, therisk analysis system 140 looks for a signal in the user activity data for theuser 101 indicating that the user would purchase the identified product. If the product is a television, for example, therisk analysis system 140 may look for an indication regarding the particular television. Based on the identified purchase transaction indicators, therisk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for the purchase transaction. Example details ofblock 230 are described hereinafter with reference toFIG. 3 . - In
block 235, therisk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to the entity providing the purchase transaction request. That is, after determining a risk score for the purchase transaction request, therisk analysis system 140 transmits the determined risk score to the entity providing the purchase transaction request, such as via thenetwork 105. For example, therisk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to a merchant that has provided a purchase transaction request for a television. If a custodian of the user financial account 172, such as the financialaccount issuer system 170, provides the purchase transaction request, then therisk analysis system 140 communicates the risk score to the custodian. The risk score, for example, operates to inform the entity providing the purchase transaction request of the fraud risk associated with the purchase transaction. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 may also communicate the risk score to theuser 101. After receiving the risk score, the entity receiving the score can take whatever action is appropriate in view of the received risk score, such as asking for additional identity verification from the purchaser. - If the product is identified in the user activity data, for example, the
risk analysis system 140 provides a risk score to themerchant system 130, for example, indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent. Alternatively, the product being identified in the user activity data can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. - If the product is not identified in the user activity data, for example, the
risk analysis system 140 provides a risk score to themerchant system 130, for example, indicating that the purchase transaction is may be fraudulent or that therisk analysis system 140 does not have information to support a positive assessment of the transaction. Alternatively, the product not being identified in the user activity data can be used as a negative or neutral factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 230 for determining a risk score for a purchase transaction, in accordance with certain example embodiments, as referenced inblock 230 ofFIG. 3 . - With reference to
FIGS. 1 and 2 , in block 305 ofmethod 230, therisk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction request to identify the product associated with purchase transaction and the user information. For example, if the product associated with the purchase transaction is a television, therisk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product is a television. Likewise, if the product of the purchase transaction is airfare, therisk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product is airfare. If the product of the purchase transaction is a travel agent service fee, for example, therisk analysis system 140 determines from the content of the purchase transaction request that the product a travel agent service fee. - In addition to identifying the product that is the subject of the purchase transaction, the
risk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction request to identify information associated with theuser 101. That is, therisk analysis system 140 reads the purchase transaction for information that allows therisk analysis system 140 to identify the record of the user, such as the user account 143, as described herein. For example, a purchaser may present an account number for a user financial account 172 to complete a transaction. If the account number is provided as part of the purchase transaction request, therisk analysis system 140 identifies the account number, for example. - Additionally or alternatively, the
risk analysis system 140 may determine other user-identifying information from the purchase transaction request. For example, the purchaser may provider the user's name when attempting to complete a purchase transaction. If the name of theuser 101 is included as part of the purchase transaction request, then therisk analysis system 140 determines the name of theuser 101 from the purchase transaction request. In certain example embodiments, if the purchase transaction request does not include sufficient information for therisk analysis system 140 to identify either the product or the record of theuser 101, then therisk analysis system 140 may seek additional information regarding the purchase transaction request. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may contact the merchant providing the request. - In
block 310, therisk analysis system 140 locates the record for theuser 101 based on information in the purchase transaction request. That is, based on the user-identifying information from the purchase transaction request, therisk analysis system 140 identifies the record of theuser 101 associated with the user activity data. For example, therisk analysis system 140 identifies the user account 143 of therisk analysis system 140. To locate the record of theuser 101, therisk analysis system 140, for example, compares the user-identifying information of the purchase transaction request with the information for the user account 143. For example, therisk analysis system 140 compares the financial account number received in the purchase transaction request with the financial account numbers that theuser 101 provides to therisk analysis system 140 when establishing the user account 143. Therisk analysis system 140 then locates the user account 143 based on a match of the financial account numbers. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 may identify the record of the user, such as the user account 143, based on other information provided in the purchase transaction request. For example, as described herein therisk analysis system 140 may identify the name of the user from the purchase transaction request. - In
block 315, therisk analysis system 140 compares the identified product to the user activity data to determine purchase transaction indicators for the product. That is, based on the product identified from the purchase transaction request, therisk analysis system 140 scans the user activity data associated with the record of theuser 101 for purchase transaction indicators. The purchase transaction indicators comprise any indication, such as an sign, signal, note, confirmation, corroboration, confirmation, or any other evidence, thatuser 101 might purchase the product that is the subject of the purchase transaction. As such, the purchase transaction indicators comprise any connection or correlation between the product identified in the purchase transaction request and the activity data associated with the record for theuser 101. - For example, a user search history for a television would constitute a purchase transaction indicator that the user may purchase the television. Likewise, a user search history for a particular vacation destination—or an email or social network entry about the vacation destination—may serve as an indicator that the user, for example, might purchase airfare (or other fare) to the vacation destination. Similarly, location data showing that the user device (and hence the user) was recently at an electronics store may also serve as an indicator that the user would purchase a television. In another example, location data placing the
user 101 at a travel agent may serve as a purchase transaction indication that theuser 101 may purchase airfare. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, numerous activities of auser 101 that are included in a user's activity data may service as a purchase transaction indicator of theuser 101 for a product that is the subject of a user purchase transaction. For example, the online activity information generated by the online activity of theuser 101 may provide one or more purchase transaction indicators for a purchase transaction. - If the
risk analysis system 140 identifies one or more purchase transaction indicators for a purchase transaction in the user activity data for auser 101, the method follows the “yes” branch ofblock 320 to block 325. If therisk analysis system 140 does not identify any purchase transaction indicators for a purchase transaction in the user activity data for auser 101, the method follows the “no” branch ofblock 320 to block 330. Fromblocks method 230 proceeds to block 235 ofFIG. 2 . - In
block 325, therisk management system 140 generates a positive risk score. That is, if therisk analysis system 140 identifies at least one purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction in the user activity data, therisk management system 140 generates a risk score—in response to the purchase transaction request—that informs the recipient of the risk score that the transaction is less likely to be fraudulent. For example, if therisk management system 140 identifies—based on a purchase transaction request for a television—a purchase transaction indicator for the television, such as a user search for the television, therisk management system 140 generates a positive risk score for the purchase transaction request for the television. If the product is identified in the user activity data, the risk analysis system provides a risk score to the merchant indicating that the purchase transaction is not likely to be fraudulent. Alternatively, the product being identified in the user activity can be used as a positive factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. In this case, the risk score is the positive factor provided for consideration by the entity receiving the risk score. - In another example, if the purchase transaction concerns an airfare purchase and the user activity data includes a user search for airline tickets, then the
risk management system 140 provides a positive risk score for the user's airfare purchase. Likewise, if recent location data places the user device 110 (and hence the user 101) at an electronics store, for example, then therisk management system 140 provides a positive risk score for a user television purchase. In other words, the location data placing theuser 101 at the electronics store serves as a purchase transaction indicator for the television. Hence, therisk management system 140 relies on the location data to generate a positive risk score for the television purchase. - In certain example embodiments, the positive risk score may be a qualitative risk score. That is, after identifying a purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction, the
risk analysis system 140 generates a risk score that indicates a lower risk of fraud, but that does not attempt to quantitate the level of risk. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may generate a “yes” score, a “positive” score, a “low risk” score, or any other qualitative-type score that arises from therisk analysis system 140 identifying one or more purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data. Therisk analysis system 140 can then communicate such qualitative risk scores to the entity requesting the score, thus informing the entity that the purchase transaction is (or was) less likely to be fraudulent. - Additionally or alternatively, the
risk analysis system 140 generates a quantitative risk score. That is, therisk analysis system 140 associates with the risk score a measure of likelihood that the purchase transaction is (or was) fraudulent. In certain example embodiments, therisk analysis system 140 provide a risk score that is a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators for a particular purchase transaction that therisk analysis system 140 identifies in the user activity data. For example, a single purchase transaction indicator for a particular purchase transaction may result in a low score, whereas the identification of multiple purchase transaction indicators for the purchase transaction results in a high score. A single purchase transaction indicator that a user would purchase a television, for example, may result in a risk score of “1.” The identification of two indicators, however—such as a search history for the television and location data placing the user device near an electronics store—may results in a risk score of “5” or “6.” The risk score may also be range, for example, such as 1-10, with “1” corresponding to the identification of a single or a few purchase transaction indicators and “10” corresponding to the identification of multiple transaction indicators. In certain example embodiments, the risk score may correspond to the number of purchase transaction indicators that therisk analysis system 140 identifies is in the user activity data. For example, if therisk analysis system 140 identifies 20 purchase transaction indicators, therisk analysis system 140 may generate a risk score of “20.” - Additionally or alternatively, in certain example embodiments, the
risk analysis system 140 may assign weights to various purchase transaction indicators identified in a user's activity data. That is, in addition or alternatively to being a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators, the risk score may be a function of weighted purchase transaction indicators. Therisk analysis system 140, for example, may assign more weight to those purchase transaction indicators that therisk analysis system 140 deems to be more predicative of purchasing the product that is the subject o the purchase transaction. For example, if the purchase transaction involves a television, user emails about a specific television may receive more weight than location data placing the user device near an electronics score. In another example, a user search history for airfare may receive more weight than auser 101 posting non-specific vacation photographs on a social network page. In another example, a user search history for televisions generally may receive less weight than a user search history for a specific television. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, therisk analysis system 140 described herein may determine a number of quantitative risk scores that are a function of the number of purchase transaction indicators and/or the weight assigned to one or more of the purchase transactions. - In
block 330, therisk management system 140 generates negative or neutral risk score. That is, if therisk management system 140 does not identify any purchase transaction indicators for a particular purchase transaction in the user activity data, therisk management system 140 generates a risk score—in response to the purchase transaction request—that informs the recipient of the risk score that the transaction might be fraudulent or that therisk management system 140 does not have information to assess whether the transaction is fraudulent. In certain example embodiments, therisk management system 140 generates a negative score, for example, such as a “No” score or “likely fraudulent” score. In certain example embodiments, therisk management system 140 may generate a neutral score, such as a “no score available” or “no indicators identified” score. For example, because the absence of a purchase transaction indicator may not necessarily indicate that a transaction is fraudulent—while the existence of purchase transaction indicators may indicate lower likelihood of fraud—therisk management system 140 may generate a neutral score in the absence of an identified purchase transaction indicator for a purchase transaction. Additionally, an absence of the product being identified in the user activity data can be used as a neutral or negative factor among multiple factors considered in a risk analysis of the transaction. In this case, the risk score is the positive factor provided for consideration by the entity receiving the risk score. - In certain example embodiments, in addition to receiving user activity data from a
user 101, therisk analysis system 140 may independently obtain general information that may be useful to the risk analysis functions of therisk management system 140. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may obtain information for specific merchants, online merchants, retailers, online retailers, service providers, online service providers, restaurants, landmarks, buildings, parks, rail stations, airports, ports, sports arenas, or any other location or entities that might be useful to the risk analysis functions of therisk management system 140. Therisk analysis system 140 may obtain the information from any source. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may obtain the information from online sources, such as merchant or retailer websites. Therisk analysis system 140 may also categorize the information for use in determining a risk score. A restaurant called “John Doe's Steak House,” for example, may be hierarchically categorized from a specific category to a more general category. That is, beyond the specific name “John Doe's Steak House,” therisk analysis system 140 may categorize the restaurant as a “steak house,” a “fine-dining restaurant,” a “restaurant,” or “food,” with the latter category of “food” being the most generic (in this example). - In certain example embodiments, the
risk analysis system 140 determines a risk score for aparticular user 101 that is a function of both the categorized information and purchase transaction indicators identified in the user activity data. That is, therisk analysis system 140 may weight a purchase transaction indicator based on the category of information to which the identified purchase transaction indicator corresponds. For example, if therisk analysis system 140 receives a purchase transaction request regarding “John Doe's Steak House,” an identified purchase transaction indicator—such as a user search for “John Doe's Steak House”—would receive significantly more weight than a user search for “food.” Continuing with this same example, a search by theuser 101 for “steak house” would receive more weight than a user search for a “restaurant.” In another example, therisk analysis system 140 may categorize a television based first on the particular television, and thereafter the “brand name” of the television, “televisions” generally, and then “consumer electronics.” A purchase transaction for the particular television may receive the highest weight, with the categories of “brand name,” “televisions” generally, and “consumer electronics” respectively receiving less and less weight. - In certain example embodiments, the
risk analysis system 140 determines categorized information for use in a risk score determination in response to receiving a purchase transaction request. For example, therisk analysis system 140 may receive a purchase transaction request for “John Doe's Steak House.” In response to the purchase transaction request, therisk analysis system 140 may determine that the “John Doe's Steak House” is a steak house, and hence further determine categories of “steak house,” “fine-dining restaurant,” “restaurant,” and “food” for “John Doe's Steak House.” Therisk analysis system 140 may then, when processing the purchase transaction request for “John Doe's Steak House,” correlate an identified purchase transaction indicator to the determined category as described herein. For example, a purchase transaction indicator, such as a user online search for “steak house,” may receive more weight than a user online search for the more general category of “food.” Likewise, therisk analysis system 140 may receive a purchase transaction request for a particular television. In response to the request, therisk analysis system 140 may determine “brand name,” “televisions,” and “consumer electronics” categories for the television. Therisk analysis system 140 can then identify purchase transaction indicators in the user activity data as described herein, and also weight the identified purchase transaction indicators based on the more specific (or less specific) determined categories. For example, a purchase transaction indicator for the “brand name,” such as a search by theuser 101 for the “brand name,” may receive more weight than a search by theuser 101 for “consumer electronics.” -
