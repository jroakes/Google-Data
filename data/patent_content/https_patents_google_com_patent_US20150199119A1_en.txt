- a maximum image upscaling threshold may be set to a percentage value (e.g., 133%, 150%, etc.). This may help prevent skewing of an image that has a dimension much smaller than the comparable dimension in the image template.
- an image enhancement algorithm may be used on low resolution images that are scaled up. If such an algorithm is used, then the maximum image upscaling threshold may be relaxed (e.g., not used and/or set to a higher percentage value).
- images may be scaled proportionally. For example, if an image is scaled to fit its height, then the image width may be scaled the same amount.
- a “do not crop” option may be provided. For example, such an option may be implemented by replacing the CX entries (crop image width (X IMAGE )) and the CY entries (crop image height (Y IMAGE )) in the image truth table with a SXY entry (scale image width (X IMAGE ) and image height (Y IMAGE )).
- a truth table may be just one way in which a decision about whether to crop and/or scale an image might be made. There may be a variety of ways in which a determination of which dimension may be scaled, which dimensions may be cropped, and/or what limits may be placed on such scaling and cropping. For example, an algorithm may be used to determine scaling, cropping, and/or limits to place on scaling and cropping.
- the focal point has been used to adjust the dimensions of an image, as described above, the focal point may also be used with other image transformations.
- Exemplary image transformations may include blurring, shaping, grayscale, color adjusting, noise removal, beveling, background drop (e.g., make background transparent), etc.
- an image transformation algorithm may be used to alter (e.g., blur) a portion of an image at some distance from the focal point.
- a background color and neighboring objects may be examined to determine which transformation to apply. For example, if the image is being placed in an area having a blue background color, then a colorization may be applied to the edge of the image so that the image may blend in with the background for a smoother transition.
- This information may also be used to determine what the best sizing of the image may be for a specific placement of the image. For example, if the image has a blue vertical region at the vertical location to be cropped, then it may be determined that the image may be better sized if the blue vertical region remained in the cropped image.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may enable images to be automatically adjusted for placement within a web page based on the selected focal point of the image. Such an arrangement may eliminate the time consuming and frustrating task of manually adjusting (e.g., cropping, scaling) the image to fit within a web page.
- exemplary user interfaces have been described with respect to FIGS. 1 , 4 A- 4 E, 6 A and 6 B. In other implementations consistent with the principles of the invention, the user interfaces may include more, fewer, or different pieces of information.
- a focal point may be applied to other forms of electronic media items, such as, e.g., audio streams and electronic text.
- a focal point may be applied to an audio stream and may be used to filter the audio stream to the most important information (e.g., a particular voice, a portion of a speech, etc.).
- a focal point or focal “instance” e.g., a particular paragraph, a chapter, a section of a document, etc.
- may be applied to a variety of electronic text e.g., email, a web page, an online book, a paragraph, etc.

Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Implementations described herein relate generally to web site images and, more particularly, to optimizing web site images using a focal point.
- 2. Description of Related Art
- Many web site builder (or creation) products offer web page templates that a user may manipulate to create web pages for a web site. Such templates offer, for example, layout options, text input, image input, etc. Properly placing images within a web page template is typically difficult unless a professional web page designer adjusts (e.g., through scaling, cropping, skewing, positioning, etc.) the image to fit within the visual elements of the web page. For example, often times an image template of a web page template is dimensionally smaller than the image a user desires to display within the image template. For someone wishing to create a web site with no experience, this may become a significant barrier to producing a high quality web site. In addition, a change in the web page template typically requires that all of the images be readjusted by the user.
- Many image manipulation products (e.g., Adobe® Photoshop®) and web site builder products (e.g., Adobe® DreamWeaver, Microsoft® Frontpage, etc.) provide tools for adjusting images so that the images will fit properly within a web page. Unfortunately, these products make the process of adjusting the images a manual process. Depending upon the number of images to be placed within a web site, this manual process may take an inordinate amount of time, cause much frustration, and still result in an inferior web site being produced.
- According to one aspect, a method may include providing a digital image to be adjusted, enabling selection of a focal point of the image, and adjusting the image based on the focal point of the image.
- According to another aspect, a method may include providing an image to be displayed within an image template of a web page, and enabling selection of a focal point of the image. The method may also include comparing dimensions of the image with dimensions of the image template, and adjusting the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image. The method may further include providing the adjusted image within the image template of the web page.
- According to yet another aspect, a computer-readable medium may store computer-executable code for adjusting an image. The code may include instructions for providing an image to be provided within predetermined dimensions, and instructions for enabling selection of a focal point of the image. The code may also include instructions for comparing dimensions of the image with the predetermined dimensions, and instructions for adjusting the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image.
- According to a further aspect, a computer-readable medium may store computer-executable code for adjusting an image. The code may include instructions for providing a thumbnail of an image to be provided within predetermined dimensions, and instructions for using the thumbnail to enable selection of a focal point of the image. The code may also include instructions for comparing dimensions of the image with the predetermined dimensions, and instructions for adjusting the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image.
- According to another aspect, a computer-readable medium may store computer-executable code for adjusting an image. The code may include instructions for providing a preview image of an image to be provided within predetermined dimensions, and instructions for using the preview image to enable selection of a focal point of the image. The code may also include instructions for comparing dimensions of the image with the predetermined dimensions, and instructions for adjusting the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image.
- According to still another aspect, a method may include enabling selection of a focal point of an image to be displayed within a portion of a web page having predetermined dimensions. The method may also include comparing dimensions of the image with the predetermined dimensions of the portion of the web page, and using the comparison of the image dimensions with the predetermined dimensions to determine rules for adjusting the image. The method may further include adjusting the image based on the rules and the focal point of the image, and providing the adjusted image within the portion of the web page, the adjusted image including at least the focal point of the image.
- According to another aspect, a system may include means for providing an image to be displayed within an image template, and means for enabling selection of a focal point of the image. The system may also include means for comparing dimensions of the image with dimensions of the image template, and means for adjusting the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image. The system may further include means for providing the adjusted image within the image template.
- According to yet another aspect, a device may include a memory to store instructions, and a processor to execute the instructions. The processor may execute the instructions to provide an image to be provided within predetermined dimensions, and enable selection of a focal point of the image. The processor may also execute the instructions to compare dimensions of the image with the predetermined dimensions, and adjust the image based on the comparison and the focal point of the image.
- According to still yet another aspect, a method may include providing a plurality of images of a video or animation sequence, enabling selection of focal points of at least the first and last images of the video or animation sequence, and adjusting at least the first and last images of the video or animation sequence based on the selected focal points.
- According to a further aspect, a method may include providing an electronic media item, enabling selection of a focal point of the electronic media item, and adjusting the electronic media item based on the focal point of the electronic media item.

The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention may relate to techniques for optimizing an image for a web site using a focal point of the image. By using a single piece of information (e.g., the focal point of the image to be inserted within a web page), high quality web pages, containing a user-supplied image(s), may be generated without having to manually adjust the image(s). For example, a user may decide to insert an image within an image template of a web page builder product. To accomplish this, the user may import the image and may choose a focal point of the image. A “focal point” of an image may be any portion of the image that the user desires to be displayed within the web page, and/or any portion of the image that the user desires to be a primary focus. For example, a focal point may include a face, a logo, certain words, a prominent image feature, and/or any image feature the user desires to be included for display within the web page. The focal point of the image may be automatically set to be the center of the image, and/or the user may select the focal point of the image. Once the focal point is set, the image may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page and/or may include at least that portion of the image deemed to be the focal point.
- The description to follow will describe an image optimization technique as it is used with a web site builder product. It should be understood that the description may equally apply to other image manipulation products. For example, the image optimization technique may used with any web site builder product (e.g., Adobe® DreamWeaver, Microsoft® Frontpage, Yahoo!® SiteBuilder, etc.) and/or any image manipulation product (Adobe® Photoshop®, Microsoft® Digital Image Suite, Corel® CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, MicroGraphix Picture Publisher, etc.).

FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram illustrating concepts consistent with the principles of the invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , a web site builder product may include a navigation section, a web page template, a section to preview a web page, and image adjustment tools. The navigation section may include tools that may aid in the navigation of web pages of the web site being created. For example, the navigation section may include a tree providing a list of web page templates that a user may select from in order to view the contents of a web page template. - The web page template may provide a template that may aid in the web page creation process. For example, as shown in
FIG. 1 , the web page template may provide a template for a home page. The home page template may include a page title section for entering the title of the web page, and/or a main content section for entering information about the home page (e.g., company description, services provided, etc.). The home page template may include a picture section for inserting an image within the web page, and/or a section for inputting a company name, logo, slogan, copyright information, trademark information, etc. - The picture section may display the selected image and/or may display a focal point selector. The focal point selector may initially be provided in the center of the image and/or may be manipulated to select a focal point of the image. Once the focal point is selected, the image may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page and/or may include at least that portion of the image deemed to be the focal point.
- The web page preview section may include a window that may provide a preview of the web page. The preview of the web page may contain the information inputted into the web page template, including the selected image. The preview of the web page may display the selected image as an adjusted image, i.e., after the image has been automatically adjusted based on the selected focal point. For example, as shown in
FIG. 1 , the selected image may have a height (a “y” dimension and/or a vertical dimension) and/or a width (an “x” dimension and/or a horizontal dimension) that is larger than the height and/or width of the section of the web page where the image may be displayed. The image may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page based on the selected focal point and/or may include at least that portion of the image deemed to be the focal point. - The image adjustment tools may include a variety of tools that may aid in the manipulation of an image. For example, the image adjustment tools may include tools to cut, copy, paste, clear, import, link, unlink, image map, rotate left, rotate right, crop, adjust, and/or revert the image. These manual image adjustment tools may optionally be used in addition to the automatic image adjustment.

Image adjustment software 330 may operate in conjunction with web
site builder software 320. In another implementation, image adjustment software 330 may be part of website builder software 320. In this latter implementation, website builder software 320 may perform the functions of image adjustment software 330. In yet another implementation, image adjustment software 330 may be a process separate fromoperating system 310 and/or website builder software 320. - Image adjustment software 330 may be automatically activated upon initiation of
operating system 310 and/or website builder software 320. Alternatively, image adjustment software 330 may be activated when instructed by a user. In either case, image adjustment software 330 may permit automatic adjustment of a web site image using a focal point of the image, as will be described below. - There are a number of ways that a user could import an image and/or select a focal point of the image so that the image may be automatically adjusted to fit within a web page.
FIGS. 4A-4E are exemplary diagrams of exemplary implementations for inputting and/or optimizing a web page image using a focal point. As shown inFIG. 4A , a web site builder 400 (e.g., web site builder software 320) may include anavigation section 405, aweb page template 410, a webpage preview section 420, andimage adjustment tools 425.Navigation section 405 may include tools that may aid in the navigation of web pages of the web site being created. For example,navigation section 405 may include a tree providing a list of web page templates that a user may select from in order to view the contents of a web page template. -
Web page template 410 may provide a template of a web page to aid in the web page creation process. For example, as shown inFIG. 4A ,web page template 410 may provide a template for a home page. The home page template may include a page title section for entering the title of the web page, and/or a main content section for entering information about the home page (e.g., company description, services provided, etc.). The home page template may include apicture section 415 for inserting an image within the web page, and/or a section for inputting a company name, logo, slogan, copyright information, trademark information, etc.Picture section 415 may display the selected image. - Web
page preview section 420 may include a window that may provide a preview of the web page. The preview of the web page may contain the information inputted intoweb page template 410, including the selected image.Image adjustment tools 425 may include a variety of tools that may aid in the manipulation of a selected image. For example, the image adjustment tools may include tools to cut, copy, paste, clear, import, link, unlink, image map, rotate left, rotate right, crop, adjust, and/or revert the selected image. These manual image adjustment tools may selectively be used in addition to the automatic image adjustment. - As shown in
FIG. 4B ,web site builder 400 may include animage properties window 430 that may enable a user to select an image to place withinpicture section 415 ofweb page template 410.Picture section 415 may include aportion 435 for displaying the selected image.Image properties window 430 may be accessed a number of ways, such as by selectingportion 435 with a pointing device (e.g., a mouse).Image properties window 430 may include a section that enables a user to select an image (i.e., “Image” section). The image may be selected from image files stored in device 200 (e.g., inmain memory 230,ROM 240, and/or storage device 250), image files stored in a local network (e.g., a local area network) connected todevice 200, and/or image files found, for example, on a wide area network, such as the Internet. -
Image properties window 430 may include an “Alt text” section that may permit a user to enter text to be displayed when a pointing device, such as a mouse, is provided over the image in the web page.Image properties window 430 may include a “Mouseover image” section that may permit a user to select a mouseover image to be displayed when a pointing device is provided over the image in the web page. - A “Select the type of link” section may be provided in
image properties window 430. The “Select the type of link” section may permit a web page image to link to another page in the web site, another web site, an email address, a file ondevice 200, etc. when the image is selected with a pointing device.Image properties window 430 may include a “Target window” section that may permit a user to determine where the selected image may be displayed. For example, a user may choose to display the selected image within an image template and/or within a new window on the web page. - If a user selects the “Browse” button of “Image” section of
image properties window 430, then animage selection window 440 may be displayed, as shown inFIG. 4C .Image selection window 440 may permit a user to select an image file from image files stored indevice 200, stored in a local network connected todevice 200, and/or found on a wide area network.Image selection window 440 may include a “Views”button 445 that may display image files in a number of alternative views. For example, the image files may appear in any of the alternative views provided by an operating system, e.g., image files may be displayed within Windows® “thumbnails,” “tiles,” “icons,” “list,” or “details” views. A “list”view 450 of image files is shown inFIG. 4C for exemplary purposes. A shown, two image files (“Image1” and “Image2”) may be displayed and selected by a user. - In one exemplary implementation consistent with the principles of the invention,
image selection window 440 may include apreview section 455 that may enable animage 460 to be previewed prior to selection.Preview section 455 may include afocal point selector 465 that may initially be provided in the center ofimage 460 and/or may be manipulated to select a focal point ofimage 460. Once the focal point is set,image 460 may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page and/or may include at least that portion ofimage 460 deemed to be the focal point. - In another exemplary implementation consistent with the principles of the invention,
image selection window 440, via “Views”button 445, may display a “thumbnails”view 470 that may display an image file as athumbnail 475, as shown inFIG. 4D . A “thumbnail” may be a small picture that may be used to represent a link to a larger picture, e.g., a thumbnail may be a miniature version of the image in the image file.Focal point selector 465 may initially be provided in the center ofthumbnail 475 and/or may be manipulated to select a focal point ofthumbnail 475, and thus a focal point of the image. Once the focal point is set, the image may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page and/or may include at least that portion of the image deemed to be the focal point. - In yet another exemplary implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, the image may be selected as set forth above, but a focal point may not be set for the image. As shown in
FIG. 4E ,image 460 may be displayed withinportion 435 ofpicture section 415 of web page template 410 (as shown inFIG. 4B ).Focal point selector 465 may initially be provided in the center ofimage 460 and/or may be manipulated to select a focal point ofimage 460. Once the focal point is set,image 460 may be automatically adjusted to fit within the web page and/or may include at least that portion ofimage 460 deemed to be the focal point. The automatically adjustedimage 480 may be displayed within webpage preview section 420 as part of a web page preview. The full web page, with automatically adjustedimage 480, may be displayed by selecting a “See Full Page”button 485. - There are a number of ways that an image may be automatically adjusted for a web page using a focal point of an image.
FIGS. 5A-5E are exemplary diagrams of exemplary implementations for optimizing web page images using a focal point. - An image may be adjusted in a variety of ways. In one implementation, for example, the original imported image may be adjusted utilizing the techniques discussed below in connection with
FIGS. 5A-5E . - In another implementation, a copy of the imported image may be made, and the copy of the image may be adjusted utilizing the techniques discussed below in connection with
FIGS. 5A-5E . This may permit a user in the future to change a web page template and have a new image (e.g., based on the original imported image) generated that may fit within the constraints of the newly selected web page template. Another copy of the original image may be made, and the new copy may be adjusted utilizing the techniques discussed below in connection withFIGS. 5A-5E . A user may do a complete web page makeover by selecting a new web page template, and all of the images associated with the web page (but based on the original imported images) may be automatically adjusted to fit within the new web page template. - As shown in
FIG. 5A , animage map 500 may be envisioned when a user attempts to place an image within a web page.Image map 500 may include animage 505 to be inserted within the web page, and a template 510 (e.g., a web page image template) that may be sized to fit within the web page and may be used to automatically adjustimage 505 to fit within the web page.Focal point selector 465 may initially be provided in the center ofimage 505 and/or may be manipulated (e.g., using a pointing device, such as a mouse) to select a focal point ofimage 505. Once the focal point is set,image 505 may be automatically adjusted to fit withintemplate 510 so that at least that portion ofimage 505 deemed to be the focal point may be provided withintemplate 510. -
Image 505 may include a width (XIMAGE) and a height (YIMAGE).Template 510 may include a width (XTEMPLATE) and a height (YTEMPLATE). As shown inFIG. 5A , for exemplary purposes, width (XIMAGE) ofimage 505 may be larger than width (XTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, and height (YIMAGE) ofimage 505 may be smaller than height (YTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510. In this exemplary case,image 505 may be automatically adjusted to fit withintemplate 510 by cropping width (XIMAGE) ofimage 505 to fit within width (XTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, and scaling height (YIMAGE) ofimage 505 to fit within height (YTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510. The cropping and scaling ofimage 505 may be based on the selected focal point, as shown below with reference toFIGS. 5B-5E . -
FIGS. 5B and 5C show a first exemplary implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, where the image width (XIMAGE) may be larger than the template width (XTEMPLATE) and the image height (YIMAGE) may be smaller than the template height (YTEMPLATE). In one implementation, the processing ofFIGS. 5B and 5C may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components withindevice 200. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or includingdevice 200. - As shown in
FIG. 5B ,image 505 may include letters (“A” to “Z”) extending horizontally (i.e., in the “x” direction), and letters (“A” to “N”) extending vertically (i.e., in the “y” direction). Letters have been added toFIGS. 5B and 5C to aid in the understanding of howimage 505 may be automatically adjusted based on a focal point.Focal point selector 465 may be manipulated to a portion ofimage 505, other than the center ofimage 505, to enable selection of a focal point ofimage 505. Once the focal point is selected,image 505 may be automatically adjusted to fit withintemplate 510 so that at least that portion ofimage 505 deemed to be the focal point may be provided withintemplate 510. - Since the width of
image 505 ofFIG. 5B may be larger than the width oftemplate 510, the width ofimage 505 may need to be cropped to fit withintemplate 510. A cropped width (XCROP) ofimage 505 may be provided as shown inFIG. 5B . For example, cropped width (XCROP) may be equal to template width (XTEMPLATE) and may be determined by beginning at the focal point selected byselector 465 and extending radially outward in the positive and negative “x” directions (i.e., in the horizontal direction) until cropped width (XCROP) eventually equals template width (XTEMPLATE), as shown inFIG. 5C . If the focal point is not located at the center of image 505 (e.g., the focal point ofFIG. 5C ), then one of the rays forming cropped width (XCROP) may eventually stop when it reaches the edge ofimage 505, and the other ray forming cropped width (XCROP) may continue until cropped width (XCROP) eventually equals template width (XTEMPLATE). Since the height ofimage 505 may be smaller than the height oftemplate 510, the height ofimage 505 may need to be scaled to fit within the height oftemplate 510. This may be accomplished by extending the bottom of image 505 a distance (e.g., YSCALE), and by extending the top of image 505 a distance (e.g., YSCALE) so thatimage 505 may have a height equal to height (YTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, as shown inFIG. 5C . - The resulting portion of
image 505 that may be provided within the web page may be shown as ashaded area 515 ofimage 505 inFIG. 5B . As shown inFIG. 5C , the resulting portion of image 505 (i.e., shaded area 515) may include a portion of the horizontally arranged letters 520 (i.e., letters “A” to “5”), and all of the vertically arranged letters 525 (i.e., letters “A” to “N”). The resulting portion of image 505 (shaded area 515) may have a width (XCROP) that may equal width (XTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, and a height that may equal height (YTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510. -
FIGS. 5D and 5E show a second exemplary implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, where the image width (XIMAGE) may be smaller than the template width (XTEMPLATE) and the image height (YIMAGE) may be larger than the template height (YTEMPLATE). In one implementation, the processing ofFIGS. 5D and 5E may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components withindevice 200. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or includingdevice 200. - As shown in
FIG. 5D ,image 505 may include letters (“A” to “S”) extending horizontally (i.e., in the “x” direction), and letters (“A” to “S”) extending vertically (i.e., in the “y” direction). Letters have been added toFIGS. 5D and 5E to aid in the understanding of howimage 505 may be automatically adjusted based on a focal point.Focal point selector 465 may be manipulated to a portion ofimage 505, other than the center ofimage 505, to enable selection of a focal point ofimage 505. Once the focal point is selected,image 505 may be automatically adjusted to fit withintemplate 510 so that at least that portion ofimage 505 deemed to be the focal point may be provided withintemplate 510. - Since the height of
image 505 ofFIG. 5B may be larger than the height oftemplate 510, the height ofimage 505 may need to be cropped to fit withintemplate 510. A cropped height (YCROP) ofimage 505 may be provided as shown inFIG. 5D . For example, cropped height (YCROP) may be equal to template height (YTEMPLATE) and may be determined by beginning at the focal point selected byselector 465 and extending radially outward in the positive and negative “y” direction (i.e., in the vertical direction) until cropped height (YCROP) eventually equals template height (YTEMPLATE), as shown inFIG. 5E . Since the width ofimage 505 may be smaller than the width oftemplate 510, the width ofimage 505 may need to be scaled to fit within the width oftemplate 510. This may be accomplished by extending the right side of image 505 a distance (e.g., XSCALE), and by extending the left side of image 505 a distance (e.g., XSCALE) so thatimage 505 may have a width equal to width (XTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, as shown inFIG. 5E . - The resulting portion of
image 505 that may be provided within the web page may be shown as ashaded area 530 ofimage 505 inFIG. 5D . As shown inFIG. 5E , the resulting portion of image 505 (i.e., shaded area 530) may include all of the horizontally arranged letters 535 (i.e., letters “A” to “S”), and a portion of the vertically arranged letters 540 (i.e., letters “A” to “F”). The resulting portion of image 505 (shaded area 530) may have a width that equals width (XTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510, and a height (YCROP) that equals height (YTEMPLATE) oftemplate 510. - Although
FIGS. 5B-5E show adjusting the dimensions ofimage 505 to equal the dimensions oftemplate 510, the dimensions (e.g., the width or height) ofimage 505 may be adjusted to be less than the dimensions oftemplate 510. For example, ifimage 505 has a height equal to the height oftemplate 510, but the width ofimage 505 is much smaller than the width oftemplate 510, then scaling the width ofimage 505 may create an undesirably skewed image. In such a case, the height ofimage 505 may also be adjusted so that the image displayed within the web page may be less skewed and more proportional. - Although
FIGS. 5B-5E show cropping one dimension and scaling the other dimension ofimage 505, any combination of cropping and scaling may be utilized. For example,image 505 may be scaled in the “x” and “y” directions, followed by a cropping in the “x” direction and/or the “y” direction ofimage 505.Scaling image 505 in both directions and then cropping may maintain the fidelity ofimage 505. - In an alternative implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, instead of using
focal point selector 465 to select the focal point, a user may identify features in an image that may be significant and are desired to be displayed within the generated web page. For example, a user may select, with a pointing device (e.g., a mouse), various significant points within the image and/or identify a significant region within the image using an area selection tool (e.g., a mouse). In another example, a prominent feature in an image may be automatically identified and/or the focal point may default to the location of the prominent feature. A user may validate the automatically selected focal point and/or select another focal point of the image. - Although the exemplary implementations show a single still image being manipulated, the image manipulation techniques described herein may be applied to more than one still image, and/or a video/animation sequence that may include a series of frames (e.g., still images). In a video/animation sequence, focal points may be identified on the start and end frames of the sequence. Additional focal points may be identified at random intervals throughout the video/animation sequence, and/or an algorithm may be used to interpolate focal points in the intermediate frames of the sequence.
- Although
FIGS. 5A-5E show the focal point as a single point (e.g., an x, y coordinate) in an image, the focal may assume a variety of shapes other than a single point. For example, the focal point may be linear, circular, square, rectangular, and/or any other shape, such that the focal point defines an area or a portion of an image. In one implementation, if a shape is used as a focal point in a video/animation sequence, the shape of the focal point may or may not be constant throughout the video/animation sequence. In another implementation, if a shape is used as a focal point, additional information may be stored about the relative importance of the image areas(s) within and/or bisected by the shaped focal point. For example, the focal point may be a line, where the beginning point of the line may indicate the most important portion of the image, and the terminal (end) point of the line may be an image portion of lesser importance (although of greater importance than image portions not bisected by the line). - In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, more than one focal point may be identified in a single image. For example, a series of focal points on a single image may be used to create a video/animation sequence.
- Focal point information may be stored in a variety of locations. For example, in one implementation, focal point information may be stored as vector and/or meta data within layers and/or comment areas of its corresponding image file. In another implementation, focal point information may be stored separately from its corresponding image file.
- In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, a three-dimensional focal point may be used to create a new camera angle for an image, video, and/or animation. For example, a z-axis of the focal point may indicate a relative level of zoon and/or a viewing angle. Multiple shapes may be used for a three-dimensional focal point to apply visual effects. For example, a fisheye lens shape may be used and may allow the focal point to be distorted.
- In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, a focal point may be applied to a series of ordered data (e.g., a site map), and may indicate which portion(s) of the data is/are most important to the users on a site. If the focal point is multi-dimensional (e.g., a shape), then the relative importance of the areas contained within the shaped focal point may be identified. Such an arrangement may provide a mechanism for ensuring that indexing and advertisement placements may be optimal. The areas contained within a shaped focal point may receive special treatment in site navigation, and/or search results may rank documents (e.g., web pages) according to their user-defined (e.g., based on the focal point) importance.
-
FIGS. 6A and 6B are exemplary diagrams of exemplary implementations of web pages that may include images optimized using a focal point. For exemplary purposes,image 460 and the focal point selected byfocal point selector 465 ofFIG. 4E may be used to generate the image on the exemplary web pages ofFIGS. 6A and 6B . As shown inFIG. 4E , the focal point ofimage 460 may be the nose of the person located to the right inimage 460. The image generated on the web page may depend upon the layout of the web page. - As shown in
FIG. 6A , a firstexemplary web site 600 may include aweb page 610.Web page 610 may include aweb page image 620 that may have been automatically adjusted using a focal point.Web site 600 may be displayed withinweb site builder 400 by selecting a “See Full Page”button 485, as shown inFIG. 4E . The display ofweb page 610 may be modified by selecting from anoptions menu 630.Options menu 630 may include a template option (e.g., “Master—Professional”), a colors option, a fonts option, an artwork option, and a layouts option. The template option may include a variety of web site templates from which a user may choose. For example, a type or style of template, such as a “Professional Hard”template 640, as shown inFIG. 6A , may be selected andweb page 610 may be displayed in accordance with “Professional Hard”template 640. The colors, fonts, artwork, and layouts ofweb page 610 may be modified by selecting the colors option, fonts option, artwork option, and/or layouts option, respectively. - As further shown in
FIG. 6A ,web page image 620 may have a height that may be smaller than the height of selected (i.e., imported)image 460.Web page image 620 may have a width that may be larger than the width of importedimage 460.Imported image 460 may be automatically adjusted to fit withinweb page 610. For example, the width ofimage 460 may be scaled and/or the height ofimage 460 may be cropped to fit withinweb page 610.Web page image 620 may include at least the focal point selected inimage 460. For example, the nose of the person located to the right inimage 460 may be displayed inweb page image 620. - As shown in
FIG. 6B , a secondexemplary web site 650 may include aweb page 660.Web page 660 may include aweb page image 670 that may have been automatically adjusted using a focal point.Web site 650 may be displayed withinweb site builder 400 by selecting a “See Full Page”button 485, as shown inFIG. 4E . The display ofweb page 660 may be modified by selecting from anoptions menu 630, as discussed above forFIG. 6A . For example, a “Classic Wild”template 680, as shown inFIG. 6B , may be selected andweb page 660 may be displayed in accordance with “Classic Wild”template 680. - As further shown in
FIG. 6B ,web page image 670 may have a height that may be larger than the height of importedimage 460.Web page image 670 may have a width that may be smaller than the width of importedimage 460.Imported image 460 may be automatically adjusted to fit withinweb page 660. For example, the width ofimage 460 may be cropped and/or the height ofimage 460 may be scaled to fit withinweb page 660.Web page image 670 may include at least the focal point selected inimage 460. For example, the nose of the person located to the right inimage 460 may be displayed inweb page image 670. -
FIG. 7 is an exemplary flowchart of an exemplary implementation for inputting and/or optimizing web site images using a focal point.FIG. 8 is an exemplary flowchart of an exemplary implementation for optimizing web site images using a focal point. In one implementation, the processing ofFIGS. 7 and 8 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components withindevice 200. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or includingdevice 200. - The processing of
FIG. 7 may begin when a user is prompted to import an image that may be used as an image in a web site (block 710). For example, a user may select an image template inweb site builder 400 and may be prompted to import an image for placement in a web page. In one implementation, a user may invokeimage properties window 430, which may enable a user to select an image to place inpicture section 415 of web page template 410 (as shown inFIG. 4B ). In another implementation, a user may invokeimage selection window 440, which may enable a user to select an image file (as shown inFIG. 4C ). - The processing of
FIG. 7 may default the focal point of the image to the center of the image and/or to a prominent feature of the image (block 720). For example,focal point selector 465 may default to the center ofimage 505, as shown inFIG. 5A . In one implementation,focal point selector 465 may provide its default location in apreview image 460 ofpreview section 455, as shown inFIG. 4C . In another implementation,focal point selector 465 may provide its default location inthumbnail 475 of the image, as shown inFIG. 4D . In still another implementation,focal point selector 465 may provide its default location inimage 460 displayed within picture section 415 (FIG. 4B ) ofweb page template 410, as shown inFIG. 4E . - In one implementation, the focal point of the image may be automatically selected using an image algorithm. For example, an image algorithm may be used to locate a face and/or primary objects within an image, and the focal point may be identified at these algorithm generated locations. In another implementation, object recognition may be applied to an image and may automatically specify a particular object as a default focal point or region. In other words, object recognition may determine what the focal point should be based on the content (e.g., the image). For example, object recognition may be used to determine the focal point on the center of a face (e.g., the nose), other objects (e.g., cars, trees, etc.), etc.
- An image algorithm may be used with any type of image. For example, an image algorithm may be used with any type of digital image (e.g., binary (bilevel), grayscale, color, false-color, multi-spectral, thematic, etc.) provided in any type of format (e.g., a bitmap (BMP), a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), one defined by vector objects, etc.).
- A user may decide to adjust the focal point of the image (block 730—YES), and the focal point may be accordingly adjusted by the user (block 740). For example, in one implementation, a user may manipulate
focal point selector 465, with a pointing device (e.g., a mouse), to select the focal point of the image in any of the images displayed inFIGS. 4C-4E . In another implementation, a user may select, with a pointing device, various points in the image and/or identify a region in the image using an area selection tool (e.g., a mouse). - A user may decide to accept the default focal point (block 730—NO). For example, a user may validate the automatically selected focal point. The processing of
FIG. 7 may compare the dimensions of the imported image with the dimensions of the desired location of the image within the web page (block 750). For example, image width (XIMAGE), image height (YIMAGE), template width (XTEMPLATE), and template height (YTEMPLATE), as shown inFIG. 5A , may be used for such a comparison. - In one implementation, image width (XIMAGE), image height (YIMAGE), template width (XTEMPLATE), and template height (YTEMPLATE) (
blocks 810 ofFIG. 8 ) may be used to calculate an input image size (X, Y). For example, as shown inFIG. 8 (block 820), input image width (X) may be calculated from the following equation and may be represented as a percentage (%): -
X=X IMAGE /X TEMPLATE(%). - Input image height (Y) may be calculated from the following equation and may be represented as a percentage:
-
Y=Y IMAGE /X IMAGE(%). - As further shown in
FIG. 8 (block 830), an aspect ratio (XTEMPLATE/YTEMPLATE) may be calculated by dividing template width (XTEMPLATE) by template height (YTEMPLATE). For example, aspect ratio may have a variety of values, such as 1:1, 1:½,1:2, 1: n, and/or n:1, where an “n” value may be undefined (e.g., 1:n may mean XTEMPLATE is specified, but YTEMPLATE is not specified). - The processing of
FIG. 7 may use the comparison of the dimensions of the imported image with the dimensions of the desired location of the image within the web page to look up rules for adjusting the image (block 760). For example, in one implementation an image sizing truth table, as shown in Table 1 and described below, may be used for adjusting the image. In another implementation, a variety of algorithms may be used for fitting the image within the web page, such as an algorithm to determine the best fit of the image within the web page. - The processing of
FIG. 7 may adjust the image to fit within the web page using the rules and the focal point of the image. For example, in one implementation, the width and/or the height of the image may be cropped. The cropped dimension(s) may be determined by radially extending the cropped dimension(s) from the focal point, as discussed above forFIGS. 5B-5E . - The processing of
FIG. 7 may place the adjusted image within the web page. For example, the image may be optimized for placement within the web page, e.g., the image may be automatically adjusted based on the rules and the selected focal point. - Turning again to
FIG. 8 , the processing involved in blocks 810-830 has been previously described. The processing ofFIG. 8 may determine how the image may be automatically adjusted (i.e., may determine the outcome), based on input image width (X), input image height (Y), and aspect ratio (XTEMPLATE/YTEMPLATE) (block 840). The outcome may be determined in a variety of ways. In one implementation, for example, the outcome may be determined by using an image sizing truth table. The image sizing truth table (Table 1) may take the following form. -
TABLE 1 Image Sizing Truth Table Input Image Size Aspect Ratios X Y 1:1 1:½ 1:2 1:n n:1 100% 100% DN CY SYCX DN DN 100% 75% SYCX CY SYCX DN SY 100% 50% SYCX DN SYCX DN SY 100% 25% SYCX SYCX SYCX DN SY 100% 125% CY CY SYCX DN SY 100% 150% CY CY SYCX DN SY 100% 175% CY CY SYCX DN SY 75% 100% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX DN 75% 75% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY 75% 50% SYCX SXCY SYCX SX SY 75% 25% SYCX SYCX SYCX SX SY 75% 125% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX SY 75% 150% SXCY SXCY SXY SX SY 75% 175% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 50% 100% SXCY SXCY SXY SX DN 50% 75% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX SY 50% 50% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY 50% 25% SYCX SXY SYCX SX SY 50% 125% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 50% 150% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 50% 175% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 25% 100% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX DN 25% 75% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 25% 50% SXCY SXCY SXY SX SY 25% 25% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY 25% 125% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 25% 150% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 25% 175% SXCY SXCY SXCY SX SY 125% 100% CX SXCY SYCX SX DN 125% 75% SYCX SXCY SYCX SX SY 125% 50% SYCX CX SYCX SX SY 125% 25% SYCX SYCX SYCX SX SY 125% 125% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY 125% 150% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX SY 125% 175% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX SY 150% 100% CX SXCY SYCX SX DN 150% 75% SYCX SXY SYCX SX SY 150% 50% SYCX CX SYCX SX SY 150% 25% SYCX SYCX SYCX SX SY 150% 125% SYCX SXCY SYCX SX SY 150% 150% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY 150% 175% SXCY SXCY SYCX SX SY 175% 100% CX SXCY SYCX SX DN 175% 75% SYCX SYCX SYCX SX SY 175% 50% SYCX CX SYCX SX SY 175% 25% SYCX SYCX SYCX SX SY 175% 125% SYCX SXCY SYCX SX SY 175% 150% SYCX SXCY SYCX SX SY 175% 175% SXY SXCY SYCX SX SY - A variety of outcomes (blocks 850) may be provided by the image sizing truth table. For example, in a first implementation (i.e., “do nothing” (DN)), the dimensions of the image may not be adjusted. In a second implementation (CX), image width (XIMAGE) may be cropped based on the selected focal point. In a third implementation (CY), image height (YIMAGE) may be cropped based on the selected focal point. In a fourth implementation (SXCY), image width (XIMAGE) may be scaled to fit within the width of the web page (e.g., the image template) and image height (YIMAGE) may be cropped based on the selected focal point.
- In a fifth implementation (SYCX), image height (YIMAGE) may be scaled to fit within the height of the web page and image width (XIMAGE) may be cropped based on the selected focal point. In a sixth implementation (SXY), both image width (XIMAGE) and image height (YIMAGE) may be scaled to fit within the width and the height of the web page. In a seventh implementation (SX), image width (XIMAGE) may be scaled to fit within the width of the web page. In an eighth implementation (SY), image height (YIMAGE) may be scaled to fit within the height of the web page.
- In one implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, a maximum image upscaling threshold may be set. For example, a maximum image upscaling threshold may be set to a percentage value (e.g., 133%, 150%, etc.). This may help prevent skewing of an image that has a dimension much smaller than the comparable dimension in the image template.
- In another implementation, an image enhancement algorithm may be used on low resolution images that are scaled up. If such an algorithm is used, then the maximum image upscaling threshold may be relaxed (e.g., not used and/or set to a higher percentage value).
- In still another implementation, images may be scaled proportionally. For example, if an image is scaled to fit its height, then the image width may be scaled the same amount. In still another implementation, a “do not crop” option may be provided. For example, such an option may be implemented by replacing the CX entries (crop image width (XIMAGE)) and the CY entries (crop image height (YIMAGE)) in the image truth table with a SXY entry (scale image width (XIMAGE) and image height (YIMAGE)).
- Although an exemplary truth table has been described, a truth table may be just one way in which a decision about whether to crop and/or scale an image might be made. There may be a variety of ways in which a determination of which dimension may be scaled, which dimensions may be cropped, and/or what limits may be placed on such scaling and cropping. For example, an algorithm may be used to determine scaling, cropping, and/or limits to place on scaling and cropping.
- Although the focal point has been used to adjust the dimensions of an image, as described above, the focal point may also be used with other image transformations. Exemplary image transformations may include blurring, shaping, grayscale, color adjusting, noise removal, beveling, background drop (e.g., make background transparent), etc. For example, an image transformation algorithm may be used to alter (e.g., blur) a portion of an image at some distance from the focal point. In one implementation, a background color and neighboring objects may be examined to determine which transformation to apply. For example, if the image is being placed in an area having a blue background color, then a colorization may be applied to the edge of the image so that the image may blend in with the background for a smoother transition. This information may also be used to determine what the best sizing of the image may be for a specific placement of the image. For example, if the image has a blue vertical region at the vertical location to be cropped, then it may be determined that the image may be better sized if the blue vertical region remained in the cropped image.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may enable images to be automatically adjusted for placement within a web page based on the selected focal point of the image. Such an arrangement may eliminate the time consuming and frustrating task of manually adjusting (e.g., cropping, scaling) the image to fit within a web page.
- The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention.
- For example, while series of acts have been described with regard to
FIGS. 7 and 8 , the order of the acts may be modified in other implementations consistent with the principles of the invention. Further, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel. - Also, exemplary user interfaces have been described with respect to
FIGS. 1 , 4A-4E, 6A and 6B. In other implementations consistent with the principles of the invention, the user interfaces may include more, fewer, or different pieces of information. - Furthermore, the concept of a focal point may be applied to other forms of electronic media items, such as, e.g., audio streams and electronic text. For example, a focal point may be applied to an audio stream and may be used to filter the audio stream to the most important information (e.g., a particular voice, a portion of a speech, etc.). A focal point or focal “instance” (e.g., a particular paragraph, a chapter, a section of a document, etc.) may be applied to a variety of electronic text (e.g., email, a web page, an online book, a paragraph, etc.) to highlight the focal instance in the electronic text.
- It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that aspects of the invention, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement aspects consistent with the principles of the invention is not limiting of the invention. Thus, the operation and behavior of the aspects were described without reference to the specific software code—it being understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the aspects based on the description herein.
- No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article “a” is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term “one” or similar language is used. Further, the phrase “based on” is intended to mean “based, at least in part, on” unless explicitly stated otherwise.
