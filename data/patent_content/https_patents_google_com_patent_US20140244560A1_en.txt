- the engagement score for user 46 generated 304 by ranking process 10 may be modified (e.g., increased) as other users share/reshare, e.g., online post 402 a and/or online posts 402 b - d .
- the engagement score for user 46 generated 304 by ranking process 10 may be increased as the number of comments associated with, e.g., online post 402 a and/or online posts 402 b - d , by users (unique or otherwise) increases.
- the engagement score for user 46 generated 304 by ranking process 10 may increase as the number of recommendations associated with, e.g., online post 402 a and/or online posts 402 b - d , by users (unique or otherwise) increases.
- any of the above-noted inputs may be weighted by ranking process 10 when generating 304 the first score. For example, the number of times an online post (e.g., online post 402 a ) is shared/reshared may not be weighted as high as the number of comments associated the online post (or vice versa).
- the first score may include an engagement score based upon (e.g., at least in part) interaction of the user (e.g., user 46 ) with one or more other users.
- the user e.g., user 46
- the user 46 may have interacted with user 48 by, e.g., replying to online post 402 b via online post 402 c . This may modify, e.g., increase, the above-noted engagement score.
- user 46 may not have interacted with user 50 by, e.g., replying to online post 402 d . This may modify, e.g., decrease, the above-noted engagement score.
- the interaction of user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts that mention (e.g., include in the text) one or more other users.

- the interaction of user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts by user 46 that are commented on by user 46 .
- user 46 may be ostensibly commenting on the original online post of user 46 (e.g., online post 402 a ).
- the commenting by user 46 on his/her own online post may increase the first score of user 46 .
- the interaction of user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts by user 46 that comment on online posts of others.
- online post 402 a may be considered a main online post as, e.g., it is the first online posting by user 46 in a string of online posts (e.g., online posts 402 a - d ).
- online post 402 b may be considered a sub-comment of online post 402 a as it is not the first online posting by user 46 in the string of online posts.
- online post 402 b may be considered a sub-comment of online post 402 a
- online post 402 b may still be considered an online post by user 48 .
- the commenting by user 46 on the online post of user 48 may increase the first score of user 46 .
- sub-comments of online post 402 a may be excluded from consideration as an online post by user 48 for purposes of generating 304 the first score based upon the number of online posts by user 46 that comment on online posts of others.
- the interaction of user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts by user 46 that comment on online posts of others which also receive the above-described recommendations.

- the second score may include an expertise score based upon (e.g., at least in part) an amount of content associated with the one or more topics published by the user in the online posts. For example, each online post by user 46 associated with a particular topic (e.g., news story “X”) may modify, e.g., increase, the expertise score generated 306 by ranking process 10 .
- a combination of the expertise score with any combination of the above-noted engagement score may be used to generate 306 the second score. For example, an online post by user 46 associated with news story “X” that receive 2 comments from other users may be weighted less than an online post by user 46 associated with news story “X” that receive 5 comments from other users.
- the number of online posts by user 46 associated with news story “X” compared to the number of online posts by user 46 not associated with news story “X” may modify the expertise score generated 306 by ranking process 10 .
- ranking process 10 may modify (e.g., decrease) the second score of user 46 .
- the more online posts by user 46 that are associated with news story “X” may modify (e.g., increase) the second score of user 46 .
- the expertise score may be further based upon (e.g., at least in part) a length of time since at least a portion of the amount of content associated with the one or more topics was published by the user (e.g., user 46 ) in the online posts. For instance, assume for example purposes only that ranking process 10 based upon online post 402 a generates 306 the expertise score when online post 402 a is posted. In the example, as online post 402 a becomes “older”, ranking process 10 may generate 306 a new or updated expertise score for online post 402 a (e.g., after each month). Additionally/alternatively, ranking process 10 may modify, e.g., decrease, the weight given to online post 402 a after each month.
- Ranking process 10 may generate 306 an updated expertise score after other lengths of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc). In some implementations, only the online posts less than, e.g., 60 days old, may be considered by ranking process 10 .
- a rank of the user may be determined 308 by ranking process 10 according to the one or more topics based upon (e.g., at least in part) the first and second score. For example, based upon, e.g., the above-noted engagement score and/or the above-noted expertise score, ranking process 10 may determine 308 that user 46 has a rank of, e.g., 10.
- the rank of 10 for user 46 may be associated exclusively with the news story “X” topic and/or may be associated generally with user 46 for numerous topics.
- the rank of 10 may be determined 308 exclusively from online post 402 a (and/or associated sub-posts), and/or may be determined 308 from other online posts authored by user 46 .
- ranking process 10 may generate, e.g., a tennis topic cluster, that includes online posts about, e.g., famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball.
- a tennis topic cluster that includes online posts about, e.g., famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball.
- a tennis topic cluster that includes online posts about, e.g., famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball.
- ranking process 10 may determine that a user is an expert in topics of famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball, where ranking process 10 may demote the rank of the user in the topics of burgers and baseball, while maintaining (and/or increasing) the rank of the user in the tennis related topics.
- each consecutively created cluster may have a higher and higher demotion.
- ranking process 10 may render 310 the rank at one or more of the online posts.
- online post 402 a may include a portion (e.g., portion 408 ) where the rank may be rendered 310 .
- the rank may be rendered 310 in locations other than online post 402 a .
- the rank may be rendered 310 on a profile of user 46 .
- the rank may be rendered as an ordered list of users (e.g., associated with a particular group of users, network of users, topic, etc.) according to the respective rank of others, e.g., by topic.
- the rank may be rendered 310 as, e.g., novice, average, expert, credible, not credible, etc., in place of or in addition to a numerical and/or variable rank.
- ranking process 10 fetch the engagement score from, e.g., one or more of the above-noted data stores, and/or via a remote procedure call (RPC) that uses an ID of user 46 as input.
- RPC remote procedure call
- Optional parameters may also be used to determine, e.g., any preset twiddling on the engagement score, and/or return raw popularity and interactions numbers (if needed).
- Other techniques may be implemented by ranking process 10 to fetch the engagement score without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
- ranking process 10 may, by exposing the appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), take in a topic ID (e.g., webref space) for news story “X” and a count for a number of experts on news story “X” to be returned.
- Optional parameters may return additional metadata such as base and relative expert scores, number of topical posts, or debug information, such as topic name.
- a relative expert score may include, for example, ranking process 10 not only considering those topics that exist in an online post for determining one or more of the above-noted scores, but also those topics similar to them.
- ranking process 10 may identify 300 an online post about a famous tennis player, which may contribute towards a user's expertise score in the topic of tennis.
- ranking process 10 may provide 312 a suggestion of content to a second user (e.g., user 52 via client electronic device 44 ) based upon (e.g., at least in part) the rank of the user (e.g., user 46 ).
- ranking process 10 may provide 312 user 52 with a suggestion to “follow” user 46 and/or add user 46 to a group associated with the topic of news story “X”.
- ranking process 10 may provide 312 user 52 with a notification that user 46 is a top contributor (e.g., to the topic of news story “X”) and/or may suggest that user 52 follow a conversation involving user 46 .

Abstract
A method, computer program product, and computer system for identifying, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts are clustered according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user are determined. A first score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user according to the one or more topics is determined based upon the first and second score.
Description
- The internet has provided a venue that makes it possible for almost anyone to share their ideas with the world. For example, people may use blogs and social networks to espouse their views on a particular topic by, e.g., “posting” on the respective blog and/or social network. These posts may, for example, attract comments from interested users that may agree, disagree, or simply ask a question. As a result, an online conversation may develop that may help to disseminate information. However, with so much information available to the world, it may be difficult for a user to determine, e.g., which conversations may be worth their time to follow and whose postings may be credible.
- In one implementation, a method, performed by one or more computing devices, comprises identifying, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts are clustered according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user are determined. A first score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user according to the one or more topics is determined based upon the first and second score.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first score may include an engagement score based upon popularity. The first score may include an engagement score based upon interaction of the user with one or more other users. The second score may include an expertise score based upon an amount of content associated with the one or more topics published by the user in the online posts. The expertise score may be further based upon a length of time since at least a portion of the amount of content associated with the one or more topics was published by the user in the online posts. A suggestion of content may be provided to a second user based upon the rank of the user. The rank of the user may be rendered at one or more of the online posts.
- In another implementation, a computing system includes a processor and a memory configured to perform operations comprising identifying, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts are clustered according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user are determined. A first score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user according to the one or more topics is determined based upon the first and second score.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first score may include an engagement score based upon popularity. The first score may include an engagement score based upon interaction of the user with one or more other users. The second score may include an expertise score based upon an amount of content associated with the one or more topics published by the user in the online posts. The expertise score may be further based upon a length of time since at least a portion of the amount of content associated with the one or more topics was published by the user in the online posts. A suggestion of content may be provided to a second user based upon the rank of the user. The rank of the user may be rendered at one or more of the online posts.
- In another implementation, a computer program product resides on a computer readable storage medium that has a plurality of instructions stored on it. When executed by a processor, the instructions cause the processor to perform operations comprising identifying, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts are clustered according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user are determined. A first score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user is generated according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user according to the one or more topics is determined based upon the first and second score.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first score may include an engagement score based upon popularity. The first score may include an engagement score based upon interaction of the user with one or more other users. The second score may include an expertise score based upon an amount of content associated with the one or more topics published by the user in the online posts. The expertise score may be further based upon a length of time since at least a portion of the amount of content associated with the one or more topics was published by the user in the online posts. A suggestion of content may be provided to a second user based upon the rank of the user. The rank of the user may be rendered at one or more of the online posts.
- Advantageously, by taking into account the above-noted scores of a user, it may be possible to recommend better users related to a topic it may be possible to recommend users who may provide greater longer-term value within the user's own social graph.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Referring to
FIG. 1 , there is shownranking process 10 that may reside on and may be executed by a computer (e.g., computer 12), which may be connected to a network (e.g., network 14) (e.g., the internet or a local area network). Examples ofcomputer 12 may include, but are not limited to, a personal computer(s), a laptop computer(s), mobile computing device(s), a server computer, a series of server computers, a mainframe computer(s), or a computing cloud(s).Computer 12 may execute an operating system, for example, but not limited to, a custom operating system. - As will be discussed below in greater detail,
ranking process 10 may identify, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts may be clustered according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user may be determined. A first score of the user may be generated according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user may be generated according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user may be determined according to the one or more topics based upon the first and second score. - The instruction sets and subroutines of ranking
process 10, which may be stored onstorage device 16 coupled tocomputer 12, may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) included withincomputer 12.Storage device 16 may include but is not limited to: a hard disk drive; a flash drive, a tape drive; an optical drive; a RAID array; a random access memory (RAM); and a read-only memory (ROM). -
Network 14 may be connected to one or more secondary networks (e.g., network 18), examples of which may include but are not limited to: a local area network; a wide area network; or an intranet, for example. -
Computer 12 may include a data store, such as a database (e.g., relational database, object-oriented database, etc.) and may be located within any suitable memory location, such asstorage device 16 coupled tocomputer 12. In some implementations,computer 12 may utilize a database management system such as, but not limited to, “My Structured Query Language” (MySQL®) in order to provide multi-user access to one or more databases, such as the above noted relational database. The data store may also be a custom database, such as, for example, a flat file database or an XML database. Any other form(s) of a data storage structure and/or organization may also be used. Rankingprocess 10 may be a component of the data store, a stand alone application that interfaces with the above noted data store and/or an applet/application that is accessed viaclient applications computer 12 andstorage device 16 may refer to multiple devices, which may also be distributed throughout the network. -
Computer 12 may execute a web application (e.g., web application 20), examples of which may include, but are not limited to, e.g., a web server application, a social networking application, a blogging application, a web page hosting application, a web page management application, or other application that provides remote access to content via the internet. Rankingprocess 10 and/orweb application 20 may be accessed viaclient applications process 10 may be a stand alone application, or may be an applet/application/script that may interact with and/or be executed withinweb application 20. Examples ofclient applications client applications storage devices electronic devices electronic devices -
Storage devices electronic devices electronic devices - One or more of
client applications process 10 may be a purely server-side application, a purely client-side application, or a hybrid server-side/client-side application that is cooperatively executed by one or more ofclient applications process 10. - One or more of
client applications web application 20 may be a purely server-side application, a purely client-side application, or a hybrid server-side/client-side application that is cooperatively executed by one or more ofclient applications web application 20. -
Users computer 12 and rankingprocess 10 directly throughnetwork 14 or throughsecondary network 18. Further,computer 12 may be connected to network 14 throughsecondary network 18, as illustrated withphantom link line 54. Rankingprocess 10 may include one or more user interfaces, such as browsers and textual or graphical user interfaces, through whichusers process 10. - The various client electronic devices may be directly or indirectly coupled to network 14 (or network 18). For example, client
electronic device 38 is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14 via a hardwired network connection. Further, clientelectronic device 44 is shown directly coupled tonetwork 18 via a hardwired network connection. Clientelectronic device 40 is shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channel 56 established between clientelectronic device 40 and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) 58, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14.WAP 58 may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth™ device that is capable of establishingwireless communication channel 56 between clientelectronic device 40 andWAP 58. Clientelectronic device 42 is shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channel 60 established between clientelectronic device 42 and cellular network/bridge 62, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14. Some or all of the IEEE 802.11x specifications may use Ethernet protocol and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (i.e., CSMA/CA) for path sharing. The various 802.11x specifications may use phase-shift keying (i.e., PSK) modulation or complementary code keying (i.e., CCK) modulation, for example. Bluetooth™ is a telecommunications industry specification that allows, e.g., mobile phones, computers, smart phones, and other electronic devices to be interconnected using a short-range wireless connection. - Referring also to
FIG. 2 , there is shown a diagrammatic view of clientelectronic device 38. While clientelectronic device 38 is shown in this figure, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configuration are possible. For example, any computing device capable of executing, in whole or in part, rankingprocess 10 may be substituted for clientelectronic device 38 withinFIG. 2 , examples of which may include but are not limited tocomputer 12 and/or clientelectronic devices - Client
electronic device 38 may include a processor and/or microprocessor (e.g., microprocessor 200) configured to, e.g., process data and execute the above-noted code/instruction sets and subroutines.Microprocessor 200 may be coupled via a storage adaptor (not shown) to the above-notedstorage device 16. An I/O controller (e.g., I/O controller 202) may be configured to couplemicroprocessor 200 with various devices, such askeyboard 206, pointing/selecting device (e.g., mouse 208), USB ports (not shown), and printer ports (not shown). A display adaptor (e.g., display adaptor 210) may be configured to couple display 212 (e.g., CRT or LCD monitor(s)) withmicroprocessor 200, while network controller/adaptor 214 (e.g., an Ethernet adaptor) may be configured to couplemicroprocessor 200 to the above-noted network 14 (e.g., the Internet or a local area network). - As discussed above and referring also to
FIGS. 3-4 , rankingprocess 10 may identify 300, by one or more computing devices, online posts authored by a user. The online posts may be clustered 301 by rankingprocess 10 according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. Inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user may be determined 302 by rankingprocess 10. A first score of the user may be generated 304 by rankingprocess 10 according to the one or more topics based upon a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A second score of the user may be generated 306 by rankingprocess 10 according to the one or more topics based upon a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. A rank of the user may be determined 308 by rankingprocess 10 according to the one or more topics based upon the first and second score. - In some implementations, ranking
process 10 may identify 300, by one or more computing devices (e.g., computer 12), online posts authored by a user (e.g., user 46). For instance, assume for example purposes only that a user interface (e.g., UI 400) associated with, e.g., a social network, a blog, etc., includes one or more online posts (e.g., online posts 402 a-d) authored byuser 46. In the example, ranking process 10 (e.g., via computer 12) may identify 300 one or more of online posts 402 a-d, which may be stored, e.g., in one or more data stores at, e.g.,storage device 16.UI 400 need not be required for rankingprocess 10 to identify 300 one or more of online posts 402 a-d. - In some implementations, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the online posts may be clustered 301 by ranking
process 10 according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user. For example, the online posts may be clustered 301 by rankingprocess 10 according to one or more topics of the online posts (and similar topics authored by the user as will be discussed in greater detail below) in the above-noted online posts authored by the user. For instance, rankingprocess 10 may generate a cluster for a plurality of the above-noted online posts that are associated with the topic of, e.g., tennis. As another example, rankingprocess 10 may generate another cluster for a plurality of the above-noted online posts that are associated with the topic of, e.g., food. - In some implementations, inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user may be determined 302 by ranking
process 10. Inputs associated with a portion of the online posts may include, for example, the content (e.g., text) of one or more online posts. For example,online post 402 a may include, e.g., a comment regarding, e.g., tennis, food, and/or a recent news story “X”. The comment may have been posted by a user (e.g., user 46) viacomputer 38,client application 22,web application 20, rankingprocess 10, or combinations thereof. - As another example,
online post 402 b may include, e.g., a comment responding toonline post 402 a. For example, the comment may have been posted by a user (e.g., user 48) viacomputer 40,client application 24,web application 20, rankingprocess 10, or combinations thereof. - As another example,
online post 402 c may include, e.g., a comment fromuser 46 responding to the comment ofuser 48 inonline post 402 b. As another example,online post 402 a may include, e.g., an ability for any user to share the content of, e.g.,online post 402 a, with other users. For instance,online post 402 a may include a selectable portion (e.g., portion 404) that when selected by, e.g.,user 48, may repost comment 402 a (and/or each online post associate withonline post 402 a) to, e.g., a profile ofuser 48. - As another example,
online post 402 a may include, e.g., an ability for any user to recommend the content ofonline post 402 a to themselves and/or other users. For instance,online post 402 a may include a selectable portion (e.g., portion 406) that when selected by, e.g.,user 48, may associate comment 402 a (and/or each online post associated withonline post 402 a) with, e.g., a profile ofuser 48. The online posts may include other types of input (e.g., content and/or selectable portions) without departing from the scope of the disclosure. As such, the described inputs should be taken as an example only and not to otherwise limit the scope of the disclosure. - In some implementations, a first score of the user (e.g., user 46) may be generated 304 by ranking
process 10 according to the one or more topics based upon (e.g., at least in part) a first portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. In some implementations, the first score may include an engagement score based upon popularity. For instance, rankingprocess 10 may use any of the above-noted inputs of online posts 402 a-d (e.g., the number of online posts shared/reshared, the number of comments, the number of recommendations, etc.) to generate 304 the first score (e.g., value). As an example, the engagement score foruser 46 generated 304 by rankingprocess 10 may be modified (e.g., increased) as other users share/reshare, e.g.,online post 402 a and/oronline posts 402 b-d. As another example, the engagement score foruser 46 generated 304 by rankingprocess 10 may be increased as the number of comments associated with, e.g.,online post 402 a and/oronline posts 402 b-d, by users (unique or otherwise) increases. As an example, the engagement score foruser 46 generated 304 by rankingprocess 10 may increase as the number of recommendations associated with, e.g.,online post 402 a and/oronline posts 402 b-d, by users (unique or otherwise) increases. - In some implementations, any of the above-noted inputs may be weighted by ranking
process 10 when generating 304 the first score. For example, the number of times an online post (e.g.,online post 402 a) is shared/reshared may not be weighted as high as the number of comments associated the online post (or vice versa). - In some implementations, the first score may include an engagement score based upon (e.g., at least in part) interaction of the user (e.g., user 46) with one or more other users. For example, assume for illustrative purposes only that
user 48 has mentioneduser 46 inonline post 402 b. Further assume that thatuser 50 has also mentioneduser 46 inonline post 402 d. In the example,user 46 may have interacted withuser 48 by, e.g., replying toonline post 402 b viaonline post 402 c. This may modify, e.g., increase, the above-noted engagement score. Further in the example,user 46 may not have interacted withuser 50 by, e.g., replying toonline post 402 d. This may modify, e.g., decrease, the above-noted engagement score. - In some implementations, the interaction of
user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts that mention (e.g., include in the text) one or more other users. For example, inonline post 402 c,user 46 has mentioneduser 48. In the example, the mentioning ofuser 48 byuser 46 inonline post 402 c may increase the first score ofuser 46. - As another example, the interaction of
user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts byuser 46 that are commented on byuser 46. For instance, inonline post 402 c,user 46 may be ostensibly commenting on the original online post of user 46 (e.g.,online post 402 a). In the example, the commenting byuser 46 on his/her own online post may increase the first score ofuser 46. - As another example, the interaction of
user 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts byuser 46 that comment on online posts of others. For example, assume for illustrative purposes only thatonline post 402 a may be considered a main online post as, e.g., it is the first online posting byuser 46 in a string of online posts (e.g., online posts 402 a-d). Further assume thatonline post 402 b may be considered a sub-comment ofonline post 402 a as it is not the first online posting byuser 46 in the string of online posts. Whileonline post 402 b may be considered a sub-comment ofonline post 402 a,online post 402 b may still be considered an online post byuser 48. As such, in the example, the commenting byuser 46 on the online post of user 48 (e.g., viaonline post 402 c) may increase the first score ofuser 46. In some implementations, sub-comments ofonline post 402 a may be excluded from consideration as an online post byuser 48 for purposes of generating 304 the first score based upon the number of online posts byuser 46 that comment on online posts of others. As another example, the interaction ofuser 46 with one or more other users may include the number of online posts byuser 46 that comment on online posts of others which also receive the above-described recommendations. - In some implementations, a second score of the user (e.g., user 46) may be generated 306 by ranking
process 10 according to the one or more topics based upon (e.g., at least in part) a second portion of the inputs associated with the online posts authored by the user. In some implementations, the second score may include an expertise score based upon (e.g., at least in part) an amount of content associated with the one or more topics published by the user in the online posts. For example, each online post byuser 46 associated with a particular topic (e.g., news story “X”) may modify, e.g., increase, the expertise score generated 306 by rankingprocess 10. - In some implementations, a combination of the expertise score with any combination of the above-noted engagement score may be used to generate 306 the second score. For example, an online post by
user 46 associated with news story “X” that receive 2 comments from other users may be weighted less than an online post byuser 46 associated with news story “X” that receive 5 comments from other users. - As another example, the number of online posts by
user 46 associated with news story “X” compared to the number of online posts byuser 46 not associated with news story “X” may modify the expertise score generated 306 by rankingprocess 10. For example, assume for illustrative purposes only thatuser 46 has numerous online posts associated with news story “X” and does not have any online posts that are not associated with news story “X”. For each online post byuser 46 that is not associated with news story “X”, rankingprocess 10 may modify (e.g., decrease) the second score ofuser 46. Conversely, the more online posts byuser 46 that are associated with news story “X” may modify (e.g., increase) the second score ofuser 46. - In some implementations, the expertise score may be further based upon (e.g., at least in part) a length of time since at least a portion of the amount of content associated with the one or more topics was published by the user (e.g., user 46) in the online posts. For instance, assume for example purposes only that
ranking process 10 based upononline post 402 a generates 306 the expertise score whenonline post 402 a is posted. In the example, asonline post 402 a becomes “older”, rankingprocess 10 may generate 306 a new or updated expertise score foronline post 402 a (e.g., after each month). Additionally/alternatively, rankingprocess 10 may modify, e.g., decrease, the weight given toonline post 402 a after each month. Rankingprocess 10 may generate 306 an updated expertise score after other lengths of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc). In some implementations, only the online posts less than, e.g., 60 days old, may be considered by rankingprocess 10. - In some implementations, a rank of the user (e.g., user 46) may be determined 308 by ranking
process 10 according to the one or more topics based upon (e.g., at least in part) the first and second score. For example, based upon, e.g., the above-noted engagement score and/or the above-noted expertise score, rankingprocess 10 may determine 308 thatuser 46 has a rank of, e.g., 10. In some implementations, as discussed by example above, the rank of 10 foruser 46 may be associated exclusively with the news story “X” topic and/or may be associated generally withuser 46 for numerous topics. In some implementations, the rank of 10 may be determined 308 exclusively fromonline post 402 a (and/or associated sub-posts), and/or may be determined 308 from other online posts authored byuser 46. - As another example, referring at least to the above-noted discussion of ranking
process 10clustering 301 the online posts according to one or more topics of the online posts authored by the user, rankingprocess 10 may generate, e.g., a tennis topic cluster, that includes online posts about, e.g., famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball. In the example, assume for example purposes only that there are other topic clusters based upon other topics in the above-noted online posts. In the example: -
- 1. Ranking
process 10 may begin with the highest ranked topic, where i is the rank of a topic and where j is the rank of a user for the topic. Rankingprocess 10 may assign the rank i to a cluster. - 2. Ranking
process 10 may then move to next topic Ti in a ranked list of the topic (clusters). - 3. For each topic Tj where j<i, ranking
process 10 may lookup the similarity (Ti, Tj) in topic.- a) If ranking
process 10 determines that the similarity is greater than some predetermined confidence threshold, rankingprocess 10 may assign Ti to the same cluster as Tj, and break the loop, else - b)
Ranking process 10 may continue until j==i. If j==i, rankingprocess 10 may assign Tj to a new cluster.
- a) If ranking
- 4. Ranking
process 10 may multiply the above-noted rank of Tj by a demotion factor computed as, e.g., (0.8 ̂ cluster_number), where the cluster_number is the number of clusters that exist when the cluster was created. Thus, the first cluster may have a cluster_number of 0, the second cluster may have a cluster_number of 1, etc.
- 1. Ranking
- In the above example, ranking
process 10 may determine that a user is an expert in topics of famous tennis player X, Wimbledon, tennis, burgers, famous tennis player Y, tennis racquet, and baseball, where rankingprocess 10 may demote the rank of the user in the topics of burgers and baseball, while maintaining (and/or increasing) the rank of the user in the tennis related topics. In the example, each consecutively created cluster may have a higher and higher demotion. - In some implementations, ranking process 10 (e.g., via
web application 20 and/or client application 22) may render 310 the rank at one or more of the online posts. For example,online post 402 a may include a portion (e.g., portion 408) where the rank may be rendered 310. The rank may be rendered 310 in locations other thanonline post 402 a. For example, the rank may be rendered 310 on a profile ofuser 46. In some implementations, the rank may be rendered as an ordered list of users (e.g., associated with a particular group of users, network of users, topic, etc.) according to the respective rank of others, e.g., by topic. In some implementations, the rank may be rendered 310 as, e.g., novice, average, expert, credible, not credible, etc., in place of or in addition to a numerical and/or variable rank. - In some implementations, ranking process 10 (e.g., via
client application 22 and/or web application 20) fetch the engagement score from, e.g., one or more of the above-noted data stores, and/or via a remote procedure call (RPC) that uses an ID ofuser 46 as input. Optional parameters may also be used to determine, e.g., any preset twiddling on the engagement score, and/or return raw popularity and interactions numbers (if needed). Other techniques may be implemented by rankingprocess 10 to fetch the engagement score without departing from the scope of the disclosure. - In some implementations, ranking
process 10 may, by exposing the appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), take in a topic ID (e.g., webref space) for news story “X” and a count for a number of experts on news story “X” to be returned. Optional parameters may return additional metadata such as base and relative expert scores, number of topical posts, or debug information, such as topic name. A relative expert score may include, for example, rankingprocess 10 not only considering those topics that exist in an online post for determining one or more of the above-noted scores, but also those topics similar to them. For example, rankingprocess 10 may identify 300 an online post about a famous tennis player, which may contribute towards a user's expertise score in the topic of tennis. - In some implementations, ranking process 10 (e.g., via
web application 20 and/or client application 22) may provide 312 a suggestion of content to a second user (e.g.,user 52 via client electronic device 44) based upon (e.g., at least in part) the rank of the user (e.g., user 46). For example, rankingprocess 10 may provide 312user 52 with a suggestion to “follow”user 46 and/or adduser 46 to a group associated with the topic of news story “X”. As another example, rankingprocess 10 may provide 312user 52 with a notification thatuser 46 is a top contributor (e.g., to the topic of news story “X”) and/or may suggest thatuser 52 follow aconversation involving user 46. The suggestion may be provided 312 using multiple techniques, including, for example, email, text, and rendering the suggestion on a profile page of user 52 (e.g., as a feed). Rankingprocess 10 may provide 312user 52 with other suggestions without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In some implementations, the suggestion of content may be provided 312 touser 52 with or without consideration of any current (or previously held) social connection betweenuser 46 anduser 52. For example, whether or notuser 46 anduser 52 are friends may be need not be relevant when providing 312 the above-noted suggestion of user content. - In some implementations,
user 46 may “opt out” from having his/her online posts considered by rankingprocess 10. Opting out may include, for example, having rankingprocess 10 ignore some or all posts authored byuser 46 and/or preventing any rankings from being rendered 310 to other users. - The present disclosure may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product.
