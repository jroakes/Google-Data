Case.Such as, inquiry issue processor 120 can utilize language model, machine-learning process,
Knowledge mapping, grammer, Search Results and Search Results resource referred to by or a combination thereof
Determine problem inquiry and answer.
When determining that inquiry is inquired about for problem and there is the answer of response, inquire about issue processor
120 call abundant content handler 122, described abundant content handler 122 and then identify treat with
The abundant content that answer provides together.In the most described example embodiment, provided
Abundant content is the set of image or image.But, using the teaching of the invention it is possible to provide its of such as non-textual content
The abundant content of his type, described non-textual content such as video data, voice data etc..
Fig. 2 be enrich wherein answer that content inquires about with problem by together with the example user that provides
The diagram at interface 200.User interface 200 is search result interfaces, and inquires about 202 and " add profit
The provincial capital of Fu Niya is where " have been enter in input field 204.Inquiry issue processor
Inquiry is identified as problem by 120 to be inquired about, and also identifies answer " Sacramento (Sa Kela
Fomento) ".In response to determining that inquiry is problem inquiry and determines and identify answer, with inquiry
The search system 110 that issue processor 120 connects furnishes an answer frame 206.Answer frame 206 includes
The text data 208 of answer " Sacramento " is described.Additionally, answer frame 206 includes conduct
Enrich one or more images of content in the case, the government building in California
An image 210.Such as the additional information of Search Results 212 and Search Results 214 also is able to
It is provided on result of page searching.
Describe the selection to abundant content images 210 with reference to Fig. 3, Fig. 3 be for problem
The answer of inquiry provides the system flow chart 300 of abundant content together.System flow chart 300 describes
Realize the process in the abundant content handler 122.Fig. 4 shows such mistake
Journey, Fig. 4 is the instantiation procedure 400 providing abundant content with problem together with the answer for inquiring about
Flow chart.Therefore the description combining Fig. 4 carrys out descriptive system flow chart 300.
Abundant content handler 122 receives and is confirmed as the inquiry of problem inquiry and in response to this
The corresponding answer (402) that problem inquiry is generated.Such as, when inquiry issue processor 120
Determining when inquiry is problem and the answer that there is response, the inquiry of this problem and answer are provided to
Abundant content handler 122.Such as, " provincial capital in California " is inquired about for problem, answers
Case is " Sacramento ", and the inquiry of this problem and answer both of which are provided to enrich
Content handler.Each in problem inquiry and answer has one or more lexical item, institute
Predicate item is inquired about lexical item by the problem in Fig. 3 respectively, and { { AT} represents for QQT} and answer lexical item.
Abundant content handler generates and includes the element relevant to problem inquiry and be correlated with answer
Context inquiry (404) of element.Such as, context inquiry can include inquiring about extremely from problem
Few one or more lexical items and at least one or more lexical item from answer.As an alternative, context
Inquiry can be specified by problem inquiry and the entity of answer identification or the lexical item from problem inquiry
The relevant lexical item (synonym, lexical item extension etc.) drawn with the lexical item of answer.Implement at some
In mode, context inquiry is problem inquiry and the concatenation of answer.
For this example, the context employing the lexical item including lexical item that problem is inquired about and answer is looked into
Ask.Such as, " provincial capital in California " is inquired about for problem and answer is " Sa Kela
Fomento ", context inquiry is for " Capital of California Sacramento be (California
Sacramento, the provincial capital) ".It also is able to use other modes generating context inquiry, such as goes
Except stop-word, replace lexical item etc..In figure 3 context inquiry by lexical item CQT} represents, and
Generated by context query generation process steps 302.
Context inquiry is committed to abundant content handler 122 image search procedure and reception refers to
First data (406) gathered of the image that provisioning response is inquired about in this context.Such as, such as Fig. 3
Shown in, the first set of N number of image 310 is received from image search procedure.Each according to instruction
Image is arranged by the order of correlation of image and the inquiry generating described set for it
Name.In this example, the order according to the correlation indicating each image to inquire about with context is next right
Image sorts.
Abundant content handler determines the first figure meeting context condition in the first set of image
As and be unsatisfactory for second image (408) of context condition.Context condition is to be somebody's turn to do when image meets
During condition, the context information of the element of both is inquired about in instruction image offer problem inquiry and answer
Condition.Such as, when image meets this condition, this condition instruction image provides the lexical item of problem
Context information with both lexical items.Some images in set 310 may meet this condition,
Then may being unsatisfactory for of other.Those images meeting condition are classified as the first image, and
Those are ungratified is classified as the second image.Context evaluation procedure 304 performs to analyze to determine
First image and the second image.
Two examples of context condition are based on such as in response in problem inquiry or answer
Or the condition of the abundant properties collection of other set of multiple images, and based on the most permissible
The condition of the abundant content tab of the label of image, descriptor and other texts is described.With
Lower chapters and sections describe these conditions with reference to Fig. 5 A and 5B and Fig. 6 A and 6B.
Enrich afterwards content handler 122 relative to the second image preferentially from first image select with
It is provided as one or more answer image.Such as, abundant content handler 122 relative to
The first image in first set makes the second image degradation in the first aggregate in order so that
According to the order revised, the image in the first set is carried out ranking (410).Such as, such as figure
Shown in 3, the set 312 of image includes the image from set 310, but have adjusted figure
The ranking of picture, the different images such as corresponding first, second and n-th sequence position marks institute
Instruction.In some embodiments, the first collection can be raised relative to the ranking of the second image
The ranking of the first image in conjunction 310, or first can be made relative to the ranking of the first image
The ranking degradation of the second image in set 310, or upgrading and the combination of degradation can occur.
Upgrading and degradation can be fixing, such as fixing number or sequential location, or upgrading and
Degradation can based on be used for according to ranking come ordering chart picture basic relevance score adjustment and
Change.Ranking set-up procedure 306 performs to analyze to determine the first image and the second image.Below
Describe example with reference to Fig. 5 A and 5B and Fig. 6 A and 6B and adjust process.
Abundant content handler based on the order revised come the first Resource selection one from image or
Multiple images are to be provided (412) as one or more answer image together with answer.Such as,
Abundant content handler can select image top ranked in adjusted order such as IMG
C03 is to provide in answer frame 206 together with answer, or can select some images such as
IMG C03 and IMG C04 provides together with answer.
Degradation based on abundant properties collection
In this example embodiment, additional image set is generated for problem inquiry and answer,
And by corresponding second set and the 3rd collection this additional image set of incompatible expression.It is at Fig. 5 A
Shown in, the ranking of the set that Fig. 5 A is used to adjust in multiple image collection multiple
The schematic diagram of image collection.Image collection 310 is in response to context inquiry { first collection of CQT}
Close；Image collection 502 is in response to problem inquiry { second set of QQT}；And image set
Closing 504 is when answer { when AQT} runs as inquiry, being responded on image search engine
The 3rd set in this answer.Indicated by virtually connecting line identical image is mated.
In this embodiment, the image only occurred in the first set 310 is classified as first
Image, and occur in the image in the one or more set in the second set or the 3rd set
It is classified as the second image.Make to also appear in the second set 502 or the 3rd set 504
The image degradation in the first set 310 in individual or multiple set is based on following basic reason: this
The image of sample or to problem inquiry in context the most relevant or with answer in context more
Relevant, but less relevant to the whole context taking into account both context inquiry and answer.Such as,
For problem inquiry " provincial capital in California " answer " Sacramento " and context inquiry
For " Sacramento, the provincial capital in California ", in set is identical with hypograph:
IMG C01 and IMG Q04.Equally, image IMG C02 and IMG A03 is identical.
Such as, image IMG Q02 can be the image of the map of California, and IMG A03
It can be the logo of the occuptional movement team being located at sacramento.
In some embodiments, compared with the image occurred in all three set, occur
First set and only occur in the second set or the 3rd set in but be not present in the second set
Demoted more with the 3rd set image both.In these embodiments, relatively
The first figure in the first set is preferably only occurred in the second image occurred in all set
Picture, and relative in the set only occurred in the first set and the second set or the
The 3rd image preferably these second images in a set in one set and the 3rd set.
Although IMG C04 and IMG A04 the two image is passed on relevant to sacramento
Visual information, but context inquiry " Sacramento, the provincial capital in California " context
Instruction is to sacramento and the special interests of the function as the provincial capital, state thereof.Therefore, with not
The image occurred in the first set in the second set or the 3rd set is compared, and can occur in
The image in the first set in second set or the 3rd set can be less relevant in context.
This correlation consider part of the foundation on the fact that: when search for system to abundant content ranking time,
Search system can take into account the many features in addition to text query lexical item, such as clicking rate, under
The popularity etc. of the layer page.Therefore, make to also appear in a collection in the second set or the 3rd set
The image degradation in the first set in conjunction or both it tends to manifest and problem and answer
The image that the context of both is more correlated with.
Fig. 5 B is incompatible by the image in the set of image for abundant content set based on Fig. 5 A
It is categorized as the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 520 of the first image or the second image.In operation,
For first set in each image (or first set in front Q image in each
Individual, wherein Q is 100,200 etc.) complete process 520.
Abundant content handler 122 selects the image (522) in the first set of image.Such as,
Abundant content handler 122 selects image IMG C01.
Abundant content handler 122 determines that image is whether at the of the second set of image or image
Three set in one set in or both it in (524).Such as, abundant content handler
According to image identifier, 122 determine whether image IMG C01 gathers 502 or the 3rd second
In set 504.Herein, IMG C01 and IMG C04 mates.
If image image second set or image the 3rd set in one set in or
In both it, then enrich content handler and this image is categorized as the second image (526).This
Place, owing to image IMG C01 and IMG C04 mates, it is classified as the second image.Under
In an iteration, owing to image IMG C02 mates with image IMG A03, image IMG C02
Also the second image will be classified as.
On the other hand, if image neither in the second image collection of image the most not at image
The 3rd set in, then enrich content handler and this image be categorized as the first image (526).
Such as, in third time iteration, due in image IMG C03 and set 502 and set 504
One set or both it in image do not mate, image IMG C03 will be classified as first
Image.
After image is classified as the first image and the second image, make relative to the first image
Two image degradations.Degradation can be fixing, or can be based on one or more factors
Transformable.Such as, it is only included in a set in the second set or the 3rd set
Each second image can be downgraded with the first degradation factor, the fixed number of such as sequential location,
Or degradation reaches the scalar of the corresponding relevance score being used for reducing described image.But,
Each second image being included in both the second set and the 3rd set can be with less than first
Second degradation factor of degradation factor is downgraded.Second degradation factor can also be sequential location
Fixed number or scalar, but less than the first degradation factor.Less value reflect if
This image first set and second set both among, then with only first set and second
Image in set one set is compared, this image can in context with problem and answer
Whole context the most relevant.
Another demotion processes can take into account alternatively the second set and/or the 3rd set in
The sequential location of the image joined.Then, with the image of the second image included in the first set
Another second set or the 3rd is integrated into the sequential location of this second image in order and proportionally makes
This second image degradation in first set.If this image gathers this in the second set and the 3rd
In Liang Zhe, then can use the mean value of the sequential location of this image, or order can be used
Maximum in position.In some embodiments, in another is gathered, image is correlated with,
Its degradation just can be the most in the first aggregate.
It also is able to use other demotion processes.
Degradation based on abundant content tab
In this example embodiment, the image tag of each image is processed to determine image and is
First image still treats the second image demoted relative to the first image.Fig. 6 A shows
Label, Fig. 6 A is the first image collection 310 and the set being used to adjust in image collection
The schematic diagram of label of ranking.Image collection 310 is in response to context inquiry { the first of CQT}
Set.{ L Cx} is the label being associated with each image to label.Label can be predefined,
And can include content, such as metadata, describe being associated with this image of image subject
Content of text, the text from the webpage including image, the literary composition from the link being linked to image
This etc..
Additionally or alternatively, label can include describing by computer vision technique/image procossing
The text of the entity that technology detects in the picture.For example, it is possible to detect famous in the picture
Terrestrial reference or the face of famous person, and the name of such as terrestrial reference or personage describe this entity text with
This image is associated.
Generally, if image has the label that the lexical item with both problem inquiry and answer is mated,
Then this image is classified as the first image.On the other hand, only look into problem if image has
The label of the lexical item coupling of in inquiry or answer, then this image is classified as the second image.
The second image degradation is made to tend to manifest the most relevant to the context of both problem and answer
One image.
In the modification of this embodiment, if image has and both problem inquiry and answer
The label of lexical item coupling, and also there is the additional label with other Entities Matching, then this figure
As being classified as the second image.Do so and make context correlation focus in problem and answer.Example
As, it is assumed that problem inquiry " whom vice president of Bill Clinton is ".Owing to problem is inquired about and answers
The context focus of case is once to serve as the ARGO that of the subordinate vice president of Bill Clinton, including only
The second figure will be classified as ARGO you or the image only for the label of Bill Clinton
Picture.Equally, including the label for ARGO that with this two people of Bill Clinton, and also wrap
The image including the label for other government officials also will be classified as the second image.Including only pin
The image of ARGO that and the label of this two people of Bill Clinton is classified as the first image.
Fig. 6 B is, for label based on Fig. 6 A, the image in the set of image is categorized as
The flow chart of the instantiation procedure 620 of one image or the second image.In operation, for the first collection
Each image in conjunction (or each in front Q the image in the first set, wherein Q
It is 100,200 etc.) complete process 620.
Abundant content handler selects the image (622) in the first set of image.Such as, rich
Rich content handler 122 selects image IMG C01.Abundant content handler 122 determines image
The lexical item of label whether matching problem inquiry and both lexical items (624) of answer.Such as,
Problem inquiry is " husband of Ima Starr " and answer is " Hesa Starr ".Assume first
Image is the facial feature of Hesa Starr, and abundant content handler 122 can thereby determine that this image
Not there is the label mated with the lexical item of problem inquiry and the lexical item both of which of answer.
It is assumed, however, that image IMG C02 is Ima Starr and the image of Hesa Starr two people.
For this image, abundant content handler 122 can determine whether that this image has really and inquires about with problem
Lexical item and answer lexical item both of which coupling label.
If the lexical item that the label of image is not inquired about with problem and the lexical item both of which of answer
Join, then enrich content handler and this image is categorized as the second image (626).In this example,
Image IMG C01 is classified as the second image.
On the other hand, if the lexical item of the lexical item of the label of image and problem inquiry and answer this
Both mate, then enrich content handler and this image is categorized as the first image (628).?
In this example, image IMG C02 is classified as the first image.
After image is classified as the first image and the second image, make relative to the first image
Two image degradations.As it has been described above, degradation can be fixing, it is also possible to be based on one or many
The individual factor and transformable.Such as, with include the label mated with problem lexical item but do not include with
Second image of label of answer lexical item coupling is compared, including the label mated with answer lexical item but
Do not include each second image of the label mated with problem lexical item can demote reach less because of
Son.This reflects: includes the label mated with answer lexical item but does not include mating with problem lexical item
Label image still in response to answer and therefore the information requirement to user can be provided certain
Meeting of the degree of kind.
