Detailed description of the invention
General introduction
Various example and embodiment be will now be described.Following description provides specific detail, for thoroughly understanding and realizing
The description of these examples.However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that be that one or more embodiment as herein described can be
Put into practice in the case of there is no the many in these details.Similarly, those skilled in the art it will also be understood that the disclosure
One or more embodiments can be included herein other the obvious feature of many not described in detail.Separately
Outward, may not be illustrated in detail in or describe some well-known structure or function below, in order to avoid unnecessarily making associated description
Ambiguous hard to understand.
Embodiment of the disclosure and relate to hide the disappearance section in (such as, recovering) audio signal and/or discontinuity
And thus recover the successional method and system of signal.The method and system are based on interpolation and outer push operation, and also can
It is used for elongating or shortening audio section.
Recover the method for the disappearance section in audio signal and/or discontinuity sometimes referred to as packet loss concealment method.Often
Rule packet loss concealment method is generally only for voice, because voice signal is universal in can not carrying out the application in real time retransmitted
's.But, along with the development of application based on the Internet, the packet loss concealment for general audio signal has become more to increase the weight of
Want.Existing packet loss concealment method only for voice depends heavily on the pitch configuration of voice signal, and result, these
Method shows and bad for music, and in music, signal structure is the most complicated, and may be used for the letter of voice
Single model typically represents this signal structure the most well.Therefore, disclosed method and system are designed to for audio frequency (more
In the sense that Yi Ban compared with only voice) apply and do well.
In view of above-mentioned existing methodical deficiency, embodiment of the disclosure provide can real-time operation for concealing audio
Packet loss in signal and the method and system of discontinuity.
As will be described in further detail in this article, after extrapolating, carrying out interpolation, and be institute after carrying out interpolation
The data observed.Signal is expressed as the sum of sine wave by interpolation and outer push operation.According to one or more embodiments, right
In extrapolation, sinusoidal wave set can be detected in the data that finally it is observed that, and for interpolation, can observe before disappearance section or
The data generated detect the sine wave of the first set, and the observation after missing data section detects the second set
Sinusoidal wave.
According at least one embodiment as herein described, the interpolation of the disclosure will observed before and after disappearance section
To sinusoidal wave pairing before sine wave is classified by its amplitude.Sine wave is described as complex exponential real part.To sine wave
Complex gain and frequency carry out linear interpolation.
As will be described in more detail, interpolation can operate under two patterns: synchronous mode and asynchronous mode.
In synchronous mode, the length of the section of missing data is fixing (and the most consistent with primary signal).If interpolation model
Fitting data the most well, the most complex exponential amplitude will have deviation, and this is audible as.At asynchronous mould
Under formula, adjust the length of missing data section to reduce the importance of these deviations.
Fig. 1 illustrates the extrapolation for audio signal and the example of interpolation of the one or more embodiments according to the disclosure
Property application.Such as, two user (such as, musician) 120a and 120b can be at different physical locations (such as, remote environment)
Place performs music, and wherein, user 120a is at " position 1 " place, and user 120b is at " position 2 " place.It addition, user 120a and
120b can be in communication with each other by such as wired connection or network, and each in user 120a and 120b can have point
It is not used for reproducing and catching speaker 105 and the microphone 110 of audio frequency (such as, music) signal.Multiple signal sources 105 are (such as,
Speaker) can be located at (such as, microphone, individuality, other audio capture equipment etc.) between multiple sensor 120.
When launching data (such as, audio frequency) packet across communication network, sometimes receiving at the receiving terminal of network point
Before group, packet may lack within the time period extended, or loses completely.When packet lacks during the transmission, it is necessary to
Do some thing to compensate this type of loss of data.Such as, an existing method is to insert zero to replace missing data.But, this
Method provides unsuitable solution, because user stands performance and the audio quality degenerated.
For recovering other conventional packet loss concealment method of voice signal generally by means of autoregression (AR) model (example
Such as, wave filter) or its certain approximation the receiver section of signal is extrapolated.Autoregression model for voice may generally be considered as
Short-run model and the cascade of long-term model.Short-run model describes spectrum envelope, and long-term model describes pitch configuration.For packet
Losing and the more important thing is long-term model for hiding, its usual catching range is from the dependency of 2.5 to 15 milliseconds (ms).At some
In the case of, for long-term model allocation unit filtering gain.The existing method of some of packet loss concealment is by disappearance sample
Run on gap and there is the AR model (such as, wave filter) of zero excitation carry out lacking the least mean-square error extrapolation estimate of section,
This initial filter state is based on the signal before gap.
If past section and the following section of signal is known when starting to hide operation, then can use interpolation.
Interpolation (such as, for damaging record) is used by convention in the signal generally involving relatively short air gap recovers.
An existing interpolating method based on AR signal model describes a kind of encoding scheme completely, and encoder is considered as by it
For the set of measurements of kalman estimate device, this result in optimal interpolation naturally when packet loss, and can take into account
And it is spaced the given data of relevant future and past.But, this existing method the behaviour of the existing encoder of incompatible combination
Make.
Some existing Research on Methods method in addition to carrying out the AR model of extrapolation and interpolation in the section of shortage of data.
Such as, a method uses the many institute's weeks for interpolation between the sine wave identified according to the frequency spectrum of the signal before and after gap
The sinusoidal model known.Other method by signal modeling be suitable base vector with AR model and, and optimize basic vector the most simultaneously
The gain of amount and the contribution of AR model signals.This base vector can be sinusoidal wave, but is not provided for basic vector in this approach
Effective selection course of amount.
Usually, existing interpolation is computationally expensive.Such as, a method attempts using linear predictor pre-
Survey is across the sinusoidal wave T/F track of the very long section of missing data.In practice, it is impossible to make the pre-of this type of track
Survey reliable.In other method, in conjunction with hidden Markov model (HMM) use harmonic sine model known voice segments it
Between carry out interpolation, to follow the tracks of the evolution of phonetic feature.Harmonic wave is assumed to mean that this method is not effective to audio signal.
In order to overcome the existing methodical various shortcomings of audio concealment, embodiment of the disclosure and provide in disappearance section
On carry out extrapolation and the improved method of interpolation and system.As will be described in further detail in this article, this method and system are pins
To audio signal design and with audio signal as target, based on sinusoidal wave interpolation and extrapolation, and do not rely on sine wave
It it is the hypothesis of harmonic wave.
Together with compared to the most methodical further advantage and improvement, disclosed method and system (i) promote asynchronous
Interpolation, (ii) if signal is harmonic wave, then uses the interpolator corresponding to time domain waveform interpolation, and (iii) has sound
Frequently signal effective peak value option program.
Proposed below is interpolation of this disclosure and extrapolation uses motivation based on sinusoidal method, it is provided that about we
The details of the general frame of method, and further describe the various parts of composition native system.
Fourier transform illustrates based on complex exponential signal (such as, audio signal).Owing to this signal is real number, so
Complex exponential extension can be rearranged into the extension of sine wave.Likewise it is possible to spectrum peak is construed to crest frequency
Under sinusoidal wave gain.And Fourier transform extends the signal (feelings in discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with the form of steady-state sine ripple
Under condition, sinusoidal wave extend in finite time section), this viewpoint naturally extend be considered as signal having consecutive variations gain and
The sinusoidal wave summation of frequency.Then Fourier transform on Windowing signal segment can be construed to the shape of these sine waves
The approximation snapshot of state, each peak value represents sinusoidal wave.In this snapshot, amplitude (also can be regarded as fast from gradually roll-offing of peak value
According to finite resolving power) be the side effect using limited length of window.Then can the single sine wave of interpolation between the snapshots.This
Principle constitute according to one or more embodiments as herein described for carrying out interpolation in the disappearance section of audio signal
The part basis of method and system.
As will be described in more detail, the algorithm of the disclosure is intended to recover the section of consecutive miss data sample (wherein,
This type of section can be disappearance section or the discontinuity of audio signal).Although data are in the past end of missing data section almost
All the time can use, but situation is the most such for the following side of section.According at least one embodiment, can start algorithm it
The length of the data segment that front appointment will recover.This recovery section can be shorter than missing data section, and therefore allows not yet to receive
Situation to the data of the following side lacking section.It that case, algorithm can perform extrapolation.Can be used for lacking section in data
In the situation of following side, interpolation can be performed in disappearance section.Similarly, according at least one embodiment of this method, follow-up

Near being beneficial to, the distance related weighing of peak value is proportional.It is to say, make j identify candidate target, a (j) represents its peak value, and
F (j) represents the frequency of candidate target.Then this criterion is:
η=a (k)-w{f (k), f (j)), (1)
Wherein, f (k) is the frequency of existing object, andIt is that non-negative real frequency is mapped to non-
Negative actual distance is from the function of penalty value.Rationally selection to w is depending on benchmark f0Linear regression with distance:
W (/ (k) ,/0))=max (/0, A-f (k)-/(/) |). (2)

Can by establishment have same frequency and have under this frequency zero amplitude or complementary frequency spectrums amplitude " virtual " peak value come
Join this class object (such as, can be by signal interpretation sinusoidal wave simple and in the case of, then zero amplitude method more adduction
Reason).
Interpolation
The interpolation of sine wave can be performed in a multitude of different ways.Therefore, following summary some of different interpolating methods
Ultimate principle, and describe according to the details that embodiment of the disclosure utilized interpolating method.
Sinusoidal wave parameter is its amplitude, its frequency and its phase place.Hereinafter, term " phase offset " refers to specific
Phase value with reference to the moment.Each in these parameters is that the peak value for frequency spectrum is specified.But, complication factor is frequency
Rate is the derivative of phase place.Therefore, by performing amplitude, frequency and the linear interpolation of phase offset, frequency is due to phase offset
And it is non-constant and suffer deviation.This frequency departure is constant across interpolation interval, and equal to the half reciprocal of interpolation interval
Or it is less.
The linear interpolation of phase offset mean the frequency at the end points of interpolation interval be not equal to interval end points at estimate
The value of meter.First existing interpolating method avoids this problem by performing three rank polynomial interpolations of phase place, its value and derivative
(frequency) is determined by the measured value of two end points.It is obvious that this necessarily causes than linear phase shift interpolation more greatly but more
Short frequency departure, because gross phase precession must be identical with the phase place precession of linear phase shift interpolation situation.This
The additional drawback of one interpolating method is to which results in the irregular sampling of SIN function, which prevent and calculates efficient implementations
Structure.
In practice, first interpolating method above-mentioned for voice is proved to suffer reverberation character, and this may be owing to the not phase
The frequency departure hoped.For voice, can alternatively use harmonic wave minimum phase mould not using observed phase offset
Second existing interpolating method of type removes this reverberation character.But, this second method is not suitable for wherein sine wave may be also
Non-harmonic music.It addition, this second method does not retains the speech waveform of harmonic signal yet.
By sine wave is considered as complex exponential real part, the 3rd interpolating method occurs naturally.For example, it is contemplated thatWherein, f is frequency, and t is the time, and φ is phase offset, and α is complex coefficient,And operatorExtract real component.Then can perform the linear interpolation of frequency f and complex coefficient α in time.
Contrary with above-mentioned first and second existing interpolating methods, the interpolation of complex coefficient result in amplitude change on interpolation interval.This
Third method further promotes complex exponential rule sampling, which results in low computational complexity.
Being harmonic wave and the situation that there is the waveform that alignment result obtains for wherein sinusoidal wave set, complex coefficient interpolation is similar to
In the waveform interpolation method (such as, the waveform interpolation of stick signal waveform is attempted) for voice.Waveform interpolation system is for language
For tone signal, typically reverberation is less compared with three rank polynomial interpolation methods.It is contrary with the second interpolating method (mentioned above),
Complex coefficient interpolation retains the waveform of voice signal.
According to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, use complex coefficient interpolating method.If primary signal is smoothly drilled
Entering, and the length reconstructing the section of data is equal to the length of missing data, the most this method is done well.
By utilizing the fact that this type of signal is substantially harmonic wave, the voice sent can be improved the interpolation of system
Energy.If sinusoidal frequency is close to harmonic wave, then it is not the result that the reason of perfect harmonic wave is probably measured value.Therefore,
In such a case, it is possible to frequency being modified to is harmonic wave.Such as, in actual embodiment, if below 3000Hz's
Sine wave belongs to usage criteriaSend voice segments, then just can first test this
String ripple, wherein, foIt is candidate's pitch, fnIt is the frequency of sinusoidal wave n, anBeing the amplitude of sinusoidal wave n, N is the sine under 3000Hz
The number of ripple, and functionWillIt is rounded up to nearest integer.First, can be for the f making ξ minimizeoValue performs
Search, and the threshold value for this optimal ξ then can be used to judge whether signal is harmonic wave.If signal is harmonic wave, then
Can will be close to be harmonic wave frequency modification become be harmonic wave (such as, foMultiple).
Asynchronous interpolation
Above-mentioned various interpolating method has concentrated on the interpolation on the given interval of the length with missing data section.?
According in asynchronous interpolation available in one or more embodiments as herein described, so that the amplitude deviation in interpolation minimizes
For the purpose of adjust the length at interval, because this type of skew can be able to be heard as reverberation.
The linear interpolation of the sinusoidal wave complex coefficient identified by index n can be written as:
αn(t)=α 'n,-+αN, 1T, (3)
Wherein, t is the time, is inserted at t=0 and starts in wherein assuming, wherein, and αN ,-It is the initial value of complex coefficient, and
αN, 1It it is the coefficient affecting rate of change.It addition, make αN ,+Represent the estimated value of the α being used for observed Future Data, and τ table
Indicating claims interpolation end points.Then, for linear interpolation, equation (3) can be rewritten as
Make fN ,-And fN ,+Represent the sinusoidal frequency before and after recovery gap.Reasonably target is to find to make following formula minimum
The interpolation interval τ changed
Can description below equation (7).At each time point, factor alphanWith frequency fnCharacterize " instantaneous " waveform.Then, may be used
The above results (equation (7)) to be interpreted as the alignment metrology of instantaneous signal waveform.Factor | αN ,+|2Represent that sinusoidal wave n's is important
The weighting of property.?The precession of the sinusoidal wave phase place on expression interval, and show this precession on average
Advance with the meansigma methods of original frequency and final frequency.RatioWithRepresent starting and ending phase place.Similarly, always
Body target and find the end time τ for recovering interval consistent, end time τ make the phase place of interpolated signal with following last
The phase place of the signal observed at end is directed at well.
In view of the above description of asynchronous interpolation, according to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, from the scope of interpolation interval
The level of the executable interpolation of middle selection is so that the temporal pattern produced by interpolater is instantaneous with estimate according to known signal section
The alignment metrology of waveform maximizes.Additionally, according to one or more other embodiments as herein described, optional interpolation interval
Scope is to fill the wobble buffer of the equipment of reception to the level consistent with expection packet loss.

Low computational complexity omits the factor in equation (5)
