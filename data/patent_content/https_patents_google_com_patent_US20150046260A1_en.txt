- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for associating an entity with a keyword.
- the method comprises: identifying a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receiving at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; storing the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and using the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- Identifying the entity can further include prompting the content sponsor to provide an entity and receiving from the content sponsor a designation of a specific entity. Identifying the entity can further include receiving from a computing system a designation of a specific entity.
- a request for content can be received. The request can include one or more keywords and an entity designation. The one or more keywords and the entity designation for the request can be compared to the keyword and the identified entity. A determination can be made that a match exists based on the comparing.
- the campaign can be identified, based at least in part on the determining, as a candidate to use in response to the received request. The identified entity can be a negative entity.
- a request for content can be received wherein the request includes one or more keywords and an entity designation.
- the one or more keywords and the entity designation for the request can be compared to the keyword and the identified entity.
- a determination can be made that a match exists based on the comparing.
- the campaign can be identified, based at least in part on the determining, as not being a candidate to use in response to the received request.
- An auction can be conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide can be selected based on results of the auction.
- the entity designation can be inferred and not explicitly provided by a user.
- the entity designation can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group comprising profile data associated with a user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. Determining a match can include determining a match only when the identified entity matches the entity designation.
- the creative can be an advertisement.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for comparing a request entity to a campaign entity.
- the method includes: receiving a query from a user including at least one query term; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities associated with the query; associating the identified entity with the query; identifying one or more content items for delivery along with search results responsive to the query, wherein identifying one or more content items includes using the entity along with the query to locate a matching content item in an inventory of available content items; and providing the identified one or more content items responsive to the received query.
- An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. Identifying an entity can include: identifying candidate entities based at least in part on historical query data; presenting a plurality of candidate entities to a user that submitted the query in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities; and receiving a selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities. Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the user. Identifying the entity can include prompting the user to provide an entity and receiving from the user a designation of a specific entity.
- Identifying one or more content items can include: comparing the query and the identified entity with selection criteria associated with content items in inventory; determining that a match exists based on the comparing; and identifying a campaign based on the determining as a candidate to use when providing the identified one or more content items.
- An auction can be conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide can be selected based on results of the auction.
- the entity can be inferred and not explicitly provided by the user.
- the entity can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group comprising profile data associated with the user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. Determining a match can include determining a match only when the identified entity matches an entity designation associated with a given content item in inventory.
- a system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions.
- the instructions when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receive at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; store the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea.
- Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the content sponsor. Identifying the entity can include prompting the content sponsor to provide an entity and receiving from the content sponsor a designation of a specific entity.
- a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions.
- the instructions when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receive at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; store the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea.
- Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the content sponsor.
- Content providers can configure selection criteria so that content is provided in response to requests for content when the request matches an entity associated with the selection criteria.
- a content provider can specify both entities and selection criteria (e.g., keywords) for a content item.
- Content providers can leverage investment in existing selection criteria configurations by annotating existing selection criteria with one or more entity designations.

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a campaign associated with a content sponsor can be identified, where the campaign includes a creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content.
- the content sponsor can provide, for example, one or more keywords which can be used as selection criteria for the creative. Other selection criteria are possible.
- a content management system can identify a named entity (e.g., a person, place, product, service, vertical, concept or abstract idea) to associate with a keyword, store the identified entity in association with the keyword and the campaign, and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 (e.g., a content provider 108 a and a content provider 108 b ), publishers 109 , and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , and publishers 109 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by, for example, a publisher 109 , e.g., an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few examples.
- the resources 105 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 , for example, by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the publishers 109 on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, tablet devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 and the presentation of content to a user.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the data representing the resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page
- other content e.g., advertisements
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results 118 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results 118 are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- a request for a resource 105 or a search query 116 can also include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the requesting user device 106 (e.g., in instances in which the user consents in advance to the use of such an identifier).
- the content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request, such as content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot.
- content items having selection criteria e.g., keywords
- One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction.
- content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items.
- an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item.
- the slot can be allocated to the content provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure).
- the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores.
- some content providers 108 prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction.
- a content provider 108 can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with a publisher 109 , where the agreement requires the publisher 109 to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by the content provider 108 over a specified period (e.g., one week).
- the content provider 108 , publisher 109 , or both parties can provide data to the content management system 110 that enables the content management system 110 to facilitate satisfaction of the agreement.
- the content provider 108 can upload a content item and authorize the content management system 110 to provide the content item in response to requests for content corresponding to the website 104 of the publisher 109 .
- the publisher 109 can provide the content management system 110 with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that the publisher 109 has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period.
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time.
- a content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- a content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 120 which define the content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 120 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the campaign parameters 120 can be stored in a parameters data store 122 .
- Campaign parameters 120 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and one or more selection terms (e.g., keywords).
- a content provider 108 can annotate some or all selection criteria with one or more entities.
- an entity can be named and can represent, for example, a person (e.g., celebrity, president), place (e.g., national park, city), thing (e.g., ice cream, sweater), or concept (e.g., biology, motherhood)).
- entities include a product, service, organization, vertical, or abstract idea.
- a group or category of entities can be considered to be an entity (e.g., baseball players).
- Annotating selection criteria with one or more entities can result in a better user experience than if a more basic matching of selection criteria to a request keyword is performed.
- a simple match of a selection criteria keyword to a request keyword may not result in an appropriate content item being selected for the request.
- a request keyword may be the word “firing”, which, if a simple match is performed, may be matched to content items having selection criteria related to “firing a weapon”, “firing an employee”, “firing (e.g. igniting) a fireplace”, etc.
- the content provider 108 who can be, for example, a human resources consulting firm, can, as part of configuring a campaign, associate, for example, an entity that represents a concept of “firing an employee” to a particular content item, group of content items, or a campaign. That way, the content provider's 108 content (e.g., related to firing employees) won't be presented when a request comes in, for example, for a website that relates to pottery (e.g., where “firing” for this type of entity refers more likely to the process of turning the clay into a finished product).
- entities can be suggested to the content provider 108 , based on selection criteria for a campaign, content of landing pages associated with creatives used in the campaign, content of the creatives, a vertical that is known to be associated with the content provider, etc.
- the content provider 108 can select one or more suggested entities to use to annotate one or more selection criteria.
- a content provider 108 can also associate an entity that is not suggested with selection criteria, such as by entering information for an unsuggested entity.
- one or more inferred entities are automatically associated with selection criteria for the content provider 108 .
- Entity information can be stored in an entities data store 124 .
- the content management system 110 can use selection criteria and annotated entities when evaluating received requests for content.
- a search query 116 can be received that includes an entity designation.
- a user can be provided with and can select one or more entity suggestions for an entered search query 116 .
- an entity can be inferred from a user-provided search query 116 .
- a search query 116 can be received by a computer system, such as a search submitter system 126 , where the received search query 116 is annotated with one or more entity designations.
- the search submitter 126 can, for example, submit a search query 116 that is annotated with an entity designation determined by a knowledge panel.
- the content management system 110 can compare request keywords and a received entity designation to selection criteria and an entity designation associated with a content item.
- the content management system 110 can determine that a match exists between a content request and a content item, such as by determining that an entity designation associated with the content request matches an entity designation associated with the content item.
- the content management system 110 can select the content item for the content request and can provide the selected content item to the requesting user device 106 .
- Other examples are possible, such as described in more detail below.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to a user.
- a user 202 located near St. Louis, Mo. submits a search query 203 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 204 ) to a content management system 205 using a user device 206 .
- a content request for a content slot 207 can be received by the content management system 205 .
- the content management system 110 can infer an entity of the “St. Louis Gateway Arch” based on an “arch” query term included in the search query 203 and on the user's location near St. Louis.
- the search query 203 can be matched to a content item associated with a content provider 208 based on the entity “St. Louis Gateway Arch” determined for the search query 203 matching an entity designated by the content provider 208 for the content item.
- the content provider 208 may have previously, using a campaign management user interface 210 presented on a content provider user device 212 , designated an entity 214 of the “St. Louis Gateway Arch” to be associated with a tours promotion content item 215 .
- the content provider 208 may have entered information for the entity 214 , or may have selected the entity 214 from a list of suggested entities.
- Entity information used for determining suggestions can be retrieved by the content management system 205 from an entities data store 216 . Selection criteria and entity designations for selection criteria can be stored for the content provider 208 in a campaign information data store 218 . Based on the entity of “St.
- the tours promotion content item 215 can be selected and provided to the user device 206 , for presentation on the user device 206 (e.g., as illustrated by a content item 220 ).
- An entity can be inferred based on other factors, such as profile data associated with a user (e.g., user characteristics, user social environment activity, for users who have consented to use of such information), context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request, to name a few examples.
- profile data associated with a user e.g., user characteristics, user social environment activity, for users who have consented to use of such information
- context of the request e.g., content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request, to name a few examples.
- a user 230 located near Peoria, Ill. submits a search query 232 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 234 ) to the content management system 205 using a user device 236 .
- a request for content associated with the search query 232 can be received by the content management system 205 for a content slot 237 .
- the user 230 has consented to have at least some user activity stored by the content management system 205 .
- the content management system 205 can determine that the user 230 has recent activity related to feet, foot pain, shoe inserts, foot arches, etc.
- the content management system 205 can infer that the search query 232 relates to an entity “arch of the foot”, and can select a content item for the content slot 237 based at least in part on such a determination.
- the content slot 237 is presenting a content item 242 for a shoe store that sells shoe inserts.
- one or more entity suggestions are presented to a user and a user selection of one or more suggested entities is received.
- a user 250 located near Des Plaines, Ill. submits a search query 252 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 254 ) to the content management system 205 using a user device 256 .
- a request for content associated with the search query 252 can be received by the content management system 205 for a content slot 257 .
- Entity suggestions 258 can be presented to the user 250 for a query term 260 of “arch”.
- the entity suggestions 258 include a restaurant symbol (e.g., based on a nearby museum for a restaurant whose symbol relates to arches), the St. Louis Gateway Arch 261 , arch as an architectural construct, the city of Arch, Switzerland, and an arch of a foot.
- the user 250 can select an entity suggestion. For example, as illustrated by a cursor 262 , the user 250 can select the entity suggestion 261 of the St. Louis Gateway Arch.
- the search query 252 and an indication of the selected entity suggestion 261 can be sent to the content management system 205 .
- the content management system 205 can select the content item 215 for the content slot 257 based at least in part on the selected suggested entity 261 matching the entity 214 associated with the content item 215 .
- the content item 215 can be provided to the user device 256 , for presentation on the user device 256 (e.g., as illustrated by a content item 264 ).
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example campaign management user interface 300 .
- the user interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign.
- the sponsor can select a tab 302 to display a campaign configuration area 304 .
- the sponsor can view a list 306 of campaigns by selecting a control 308 .
- the sponsor can edit an existing campaign in the campaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 310 ) in the campaign list 306 .
- the sponsor can select a content item for the campaign using a control 312 .
- Selection criteria and a bid for the content item can be specified using controls 314 and 316 , respectively.
- Entity suggestions 318 for the selection criteria of “firing advice” can be presented to the sponsor in a list control 320 .
- the entity suggestions 318 include entity suggestions 318 a - c of “firearm instruction”, “HR (human resources) consulting”, and “fireplace maintenance”.
- the entity suggestions 318 can be determined, for example, from the selection criteria, based on a landing page associated with the content item, based on a vertical associated with the sponsor, or based on other information known about the sponsor, such as other content items selected or other campaigns.
- the sponsor can select an entity suggestion 318 to indicate that the selection criteria are to be annotated with an entity designation associated with the selection. For example, as illustrated by a cursor 322 , the user can select the entity suggestion 318 b of “HR consulting”. In some implementations, the sponsor can select multiple entity suggestions 318 .
- the sponsor can select an add control 324 to confirm the annotation of the selection criteria with an entity corresponding to the selection. For example, the sponsor can select the add control 324 with the entity suggestion 318 b selected to indicate that an entity corresponding to “HR consulting” relates to the content item.
- An “add-negative” control 326 can be selected to annotate the selection criteria with a negative entity that corresponds to the selection.
- the sponsor can select the add-negative control 326 with the entity suggestion 318 a selected to indicate that an entity corresponding to “firearm instruction” is not related to the content item.
- an indication of a corresponding annotation can be displayed in a control 328 .
- the sponsor can select an add-new-entity control 330 to annotate the selection criteria with an entity that does not have a corresponding suggestion in the entity suggestions 318 .
- a form can be displayed which can be used to enter and/or select information associated with the entity. After completing entry of information for the new entity, an entry for the new entity can be displayed in the control 328 .
- a control 332 can be selected to associate selected entities with all content items in the campaign.
- the sponsor can select the control 332 if other content items in the campaign are also related to entities associated with the selected content item.
- the sponsor can select a control 334 to require that for the content item to be matched to a received request for content, the request needs to match the selected entity designation(s).
- an entity designation associated with the request can match an entity designation associated with the content item.
- an entity-match confidence score which indicates a measure of match between the request for content and the selected entity designation(s) can be determined and a match can be declared when the confidence score exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- the content item can be selected in response to a received request for content even if the entity-match confidence score is below the predetermined threshold. For example, other factors (e.g., requests keywords matching the selection criteria, bid) can boost an overall quality score for the content item to a value which results in the content item being selected for the received request.
- factors e.g., requests keywords matching the selection criteria, bid
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for associating an entity with a keyword.

Abstract
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for associating an entity with a keyword. The method comprises: identifying a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receiving at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; storing the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and using the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. The keyword can be a broad keyword. Identifying an entity can include: identifying candidate entities based at least in part on historical query data; presenting a plurality of candidate entities to the content sponsor in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities; and receiving a selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities and using the selected entity as the identified entity. Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the content sponsor. Identifying the entity can further include prompting the content sponsor to provide an entity and receiving from the content sponsor a designation of a specific entity. Identifying the entity can further include receiving from a computing system a designation of a specific entity. A request for content can be received. The request can include one or more keywords and an entity designation. The one or more keywords and the entity designation for the request can be compared to the keyword and the identified entity. A determination can be made that a match exists based on the comparing. The campaign can be identified, based at least in part on the determining, as a candidate to use in response to the received request. The identified entity can be a negative entity. A request for content can be received wherein the request includes one or more keywords and an entity designation. The one or more keywords and the entity designation for the request can be compared to the keyword and the identified entity. A determination can be made that a match exists based on the comparing. The campaign can be identified, based at least in part on the determining, as not being a candidate to use in response to the received request. An auction can be conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide can be selected based on results of the auction. The entity designation can be inferred and not explicitly provided by a user. The entity designation can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group comprising profile data associated with a user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. Determining a match can include determining a match only when the identified entity matches the entity designation. The creative can be an advertisement.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for comparing a request entity to a campaign entity. The method includes: receiving a query from a user including at least one query term; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities associated with the query; associating the identified entity with the query; identifying one or more content items for delivery along with search results responsive to the query, wherein identifying one or more content items includes using the entity along with the query to locate a matching content item in an inventory of available content items; and providing the identified one or more content items responsive to the received query.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. Identifying an entity can include: identifying candidate entities based at least in part on historical query data; presenting a plurality of candidate entities to a user that submitted the query in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities; and receiving a selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities. Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the user. Identifying the entity can include prompting the user to provide an entity and receiving from the user a designation of a specific entity. Identifying one or more content items can include: comparing the query and the identified entity with selection criteria associated with content items in inventory; determining that a match exists based on the comparing; and identifying a campaign based on the determining as a candidate to use when providing the identified one or more content items. An auction can be conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide can be selected based on results of the auction. The entity can be inferred and not explicitly provided by the user. The entity can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group comprising profile data associated with the user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. Determining a match can include determining a match only when the identified entity matches an entity designation associated with a given content item in inventory.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receive at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; store the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. The keyword can be a broad keyword. Identifying an entity can include: identifying candidate entities based at least in part on historical query data; presenting a plurality of candidate entities to the content sponsor in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities; and receiving a selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities and using the selected entity as the identified entity. Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the content sponsor. Identifying the entity can include prompting the content sponsor to provide an entity and receiving from the content sponsor a designation of a specific entity.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a campaign associated with a content sponsor, the campaign having an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content; receive at least one keyword from the content sponsor to be used as selection criteria; identifying an entity from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword; store the identified entity along with the keyword in association with the campaign; and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. An entity can be named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. The keyword can be a broad keyword. Identifying an entity can include: identifying candidate entities based at least in part on historical query data; presenting a plurality of candidate entities to the content sponsor in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities; and receiving a selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities and using the selected entity as the identified entity. Presenting a plurality of candidate entities can include ranking the candidate entities and presenting a pre-determined number of top ranking candidate entities to the content sponsor.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Content providers can configure selection criteria so that content is provided in response to requests for content when the request matches an entity associated with the selection criteria. A content provider can specify both entities and selection criteria (e.g., keywords) for a content item. Content providers can leverage investment in existing selection criteria configurations by annotating existing selection criteria with one or more entity designations.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A campaign associated with a content sponsor can be identified, where the campaign includes a creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content. The content sponsor can provide, for example, one or more keywords which can be used as selection criteria for the creative. Other selection criteria are possible. A content management system can identify a named entity (e.g., a person, place, product, service, vertical, concept or abstract idea) to associate with a keyword, store the identified entity in association with the keyword and the campaign, and use the keyword and the identified entity when evaluating the received requests for content.

Theresources 105 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - To facilitate searching of
resources 105, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies theresources 105, for example, by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided by thepublishers 109 on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 can be stored in anindexed cache 114. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, tablet devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102 and the presentation of content to a user. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 116, thesearch system 112 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 orsearch results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results 118. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 orsearch results 118 for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which searchresults 118 are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. A request for aresource 105 or asearch query 116 can also include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the requesting user device 106 (e.g., in instances in which the user consents in advance to the use of such an identifier). - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request, such as content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords) that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 may be selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. One or more selected content items can be provided to theuser device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results 118. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example,content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that thecontent providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated tocontent providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to thecontent provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). When multiple slots are allocated in a single auction, the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores. - In some implementations, some
content providers 108 prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction. For example, acontent provider 108 can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with apublisher 109, where the agreement requires thepublisher 109 to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by thecontent provider 108 over a specified period (e.g., one week). In turn, thecontent provider 108,publisher 109, or both parties can provide data to thecontent management system 110 that enables thecontent management system 110 to facilitate satisfaction of the agreement. - For example, the
content provider 108 can upload a content item and authorize thecontent management system 110 to provide the content item in response to requests for content corresponding to thewebsite 104 of thepublisher 109. Similarly, thepublisher 109 can provide thecontent management system 110 with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that thepublisher 109 has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period. Over time, thecontent management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 120 which define the content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 120 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 120 can be stored in aparameters data store 122.Campaign parameters 120 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and one or more selection terms (e.g., keywords). As another example, acontent provider 108 can annotate some or all selection criteria with one or more entities. In general, an entity can be named and can represent, for example, a person (e.g., celebrity, president), place (e.g., national park, city), thing (e.g., ice cream, sweater), or concept (e.g., biology, motherhood)). Other examples of entities include a product, service, organization, vertical, or abstract idea. A group or category of entities can be considered to be an entity (e.g., baseball players). - Annotating selection criteria with one or more entities can result in a better user experience than if a more basic matching of selection criteria to a request keyword is performed. For example, for some selection criteria, a simple match of a selection criteria keyword to a request keyword may not result in an appropriate content item being selected for the request. For example, a request keyword may be the word “firing”, which, if a simple match is performed, may be matched to content items having selection criteria related to “firing a weapon”, “firing an employee”, “firing (e.g. igniting) a fireplace”, etc. The
content provider 108, who can be, for example, a human resources consulting firm, can, as part of configuring a campaign, associate, for example, an entity that represents a concept of “firing an employee” to a particular content item, group of content items, or a campaign. That way, the content provider's 108 content (e.g., related to firing employees) won't be presented when a request comes in, for example, for a website that relates to pottery (e.g., where “firing” for this type of entity refers more likely to the process of turning the clay into a finished product). - In some implementations, entities can be suggested to the
content provider 108, based on selection criteria for a campaign, content of landing pages associated with creatives used in the campaign, content of the creatives, a vertical that is known to be associated with the content provider, etc. Thecontent provider 108 can select one or more suggested entities to use to annotate one or more selection criteria. Acontent provider 108 can also associate an entity that is not suggested with selection criteria, such as by entering information for an unsuggested entity. In some implementations, one or more inferred entities are automatically associated with selection criteria for thecontent provider 108. Entity information can be stored in anentities data store 124. - The
content management system 110 can use selection criteria and annotated entities when evaluating received requests for content. For example, asearch query 116 can be received that includes an entity designation. For example, a user can be provided with and can select one or more entity suggestions for an enteredsearch query 116. As another example, an entity can be inferred from a user-providedsearch query 116. As yet another example, asearch query 116 can be received by a computer system, such as asearch submitter system 126, where the receivedsearch query 116 is annotated with one or more entity designations. Thesearch submitter 126 can, for example, submit asearch query 116 that is annotated with an entity designation determined by a knowledge panel. - The
content management system 110 can compare request keywords and a received entity designation to selection criteria and an entity designation associated with a content item. Thecontent management system 110 can determine that a match exists between a content request and a content item, such as by determining that an entity designation associated with the content request matches an entity designation associated with the content item. Thecontent management system 110 can select the content item for the content request and can provide the selected content item to the requestinguser device 106. Other examples are possible, such as described in more detail below. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample system 200 for providing content to a user. Auser 202 located near St. Louis, Mo. submits a search query 203 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 204) to acontent management system 205 using auser device 206. In association with thesearch query 203, a content request for acontent slot 207 can be received by thecontent management system 205. Thecontent management system 110 can infer an entity of the “St. Louis Gateway Arch” based on an “arch” query term included in thesearch query 203 and on the user's location near St. Louis. Thesearch query 203 can be matched to a content item associated with acontent provider 208 based on the entity “St. Louis Gateway Arch” determined for thesearch query 203 matching an entity designated by thecontent provider 208 for the content item. - For example, the
content provider 208 may have previously, using a campaignmanagement user interface 210 presented on a content provider user device 212, designated anentity 214 of the “St. Louis Gateway Arch” to be associated with a tours promotion content item 215. Thecontent provider 208 may have entered information for theentity 214, or may have selected theentity 214 from a list of suggested entities. Entity information used for determining suggestions can be retrieved by thecontent management system 205 from anentities data store 216. Selection criteria and entity designations for selection criteria can be stored for thecontent provider 208 in a campaigninformation data store 218. Based on the entity of “St. Louis Gateway Arch” inferred for thesearch query 203 matching theentity 214, the tours promotion content item 215 can be selected and provided to theuser device 206, for presentation on the user device 206 (e.g., as illustrated by a content item 220). - An entity can be inferred based on other factors, such as profile data associated with a user (e.g., user characteristics, user social environment activity, for users who have consented to use of such information), context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request, to name a few examples. For example, a
user 230 located near Peoria, Ill. submits a search query 232 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 234) to thecontent management system 205 using auser device 236. A request for content associated with thesearch query 232 can be received by thecontent management system 205 for acontent slot 237. Theuser 230, in this example, has consented to have at least some user activity stored by thecontent management system 205. Based onrecent user activity 238 for theuser 230 accessed from anactivity data store 240, thecontent management system 205 can determine that theuser 230 has recent activity related to feet, foot pain, shoe inserts, foot arches, etc. Thecontent management system 205 can infer that thesearch query 232 relates to an entity “arch of the foot”, and can select a content item for thecontent slot 237 based at least in part on such a determination. For example, thecontent slot 237 is presenting acontent item 242 for a shoe store that sells shoe inserts. - In some implementations, rather than inferring an entity, one or more entity suggestions are presented to a user and a user selection of one or more suggested entities is received. For example, a
user 250 located near Des Plaines, Ill. submits a search query 252 (e.g., as shown on a user interface 254) to thecontent management system 205 using auser device 256. A request for content associated with thesearch query 252 can be received by thecontent management system 205 for acontent slot 257. -
Entity suggestions 258 can be presented to theuser 250 for aquery term 260 of “arch”. Theentity suggestions 258 include a restaurant symbol (e.g., based on a nearby museum for a restaurant whose symbol relates to arches), the St.Louis Gateway Arch 261, arch as an architectural construct, the city of Arch, Switzerland, and an arch of a foot. Theuser 250 can select an entity suggestion. For example, as illustrated by acursor 262, theuser 250 can select theentity suggestion 261 of the St. Louis Gateway Arch. Thesearch query 252 and an indication of the selectedentity suggestion 261 can be sent to thecontent management system 205. Thecontent management system 205 can select the content item 215 for thecontent slot 257 based at least in part on the selected suggestedentity 261 matching theentity 214 associated with the content item 215. The content item 215 can be provided to theuser device 256, for presentation on the user device 256 (e.g., as illustrated by a content item 264). -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example campaignmanagement user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a campaign sponsor, can use to configure a campaign. The sponsor can select atab 302 to display acampaign configuration area 304. The sponsor can view alist 306 of campaigns by selecting acontrol 308. The sponsor can edit an existing campaign in thecampaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 310) in thecampaign list 306. - The sponsor can select a content item for the campaign using a
control 312. Selection criteria and a bid for the content item can be specified usingcontrols Entity suggestions 318 for the selection criteria of “firing advice” can be presented to the sponsor in alist control 320. For example, theentity suggestions 318 includeentity suggestions 318 a-c of “firearm instruction”, “HR (human resources) consulting”, and “fireplace maintenance”. Theentity suggestions 318 can be determined, for example, from the selection criteria, based on a landing page associated with the content item, based on a vertical associated with the sponsor, or based on other information known about the sponsor, such as other content items selected or other campaigns. - The sponsor can select an
entity suggestion 318 to indicate that the selection criteria are to be annotated with an entity designation associated with the selection. For example, as illustrated by acursor 322, the user can select theentity suggestion 318 b of “HR consulting”. In some implementations, the sponsor can selectmultiple entity suggestions 318. The sponsor can select an add control 324 to confirm the annotation of the selection criteria with an entity corresponding to the selection. For example, the sponsor can select the add control 324 with theentity suggestion 318 b selected to indicate that an entity corresponding to “HR consulting” relates to the content item. An “add-negative”control 326 can be selected to annotate the selection criteria with a negative entity that corresponds to the selection. For example, the sponsor can select the add-negative control 326 with theentity suggestion 318 a selected to indicate that an entity corresponding to “firearm instruction” is not related to the content item. In response to selecting either the add control 324 or the add-negative control 326, an indication of a corresponding annotation can be displayed in acontrol 328. - In some implementations, the sponsor can select an add-new-entity control 330 to annotate the selection criteria with an entity that does not have a corresponding suggestion in the
entity suggestions 318. In response to selecting the add-new-entity control 330, a form can be displayed which can be used to enter and/or select information associated with the entity. After completing entry of information for the new entity, an entry for the new entity can be displayed in thecontrol 328. - A
control 332 can be selected to associate selected entities with all content items in the campaign. For example, the sponsor can select thecontrol 332 if other content items in the campaign are also related to entities associated with the selected content item. The sponsor can select a control 334 to require that for the content item to be matched to a received request for content, the request needs to match the selected entity designation(s). For example, an entity designation associated with the request can match an entity designation associated with the content item. As another example, an entity-match confidence score which indicates a measure of match between the request for content and the selected entity designation(s) can be determined and a match can be declared when the confidence score exceeds a predetermined threshold. If the control 334 is not selected, the content item can be selected in response to a received request for content even if the entity-match confidence score is below the predetermined threshold. For example, other factors (e.g., requests keywords matching the selection criteria, bid) can boost an overall quality score for the content item to a value which results in the content item being selected for the received request. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for associating an entity with a keyword. Theprocess 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . - A campaign associated with a content sponsor is identified (402). The campaign has an associated creative for presentation to users and selection criteria for use in evaluating when to present the creative in response to received requests for content. The selection criteria can include, for example, one or more keywords. The creative can be, for example, an advertisement or some other type of content.
- At least one keyword is identified (e.g., received from the content sponsor) to be used as selection criteria (404). The keyword(s) can be received, for example, from a campaign management user interface. One or more of the keywords can be, for example, broad keywords.
- An entity is identified from a plurality of entities to associate with the keyword (406). In some implementations, an entity is named and associated with one or more of a person, a place, a product, a service, a vertical, a concept, or an abstract idea. For example, the content sponsor can be prompted to provide an entity and a designation of a sponsor-provided entity can be received from the content sponsor. As another example, a designation of a specific entity can be received from a computing system.
- In some implementations, a selection of an entity designation from a set of presented candidate entities can be received from the content sponsor. For example, one or more candidate entities can be identified, such as based on one or more of historical query data, the keyword and other keywords used by the content sponsor in a current or other campaign, content of the creative, information on a landing page associated with the creative, or information derived from image content included in the creative or the landing page. A confidence score for a candidate entity can indicate a likelihood that the candidate entity corresponds to the keyword.
- In some implementations, the candidate entities are ranked and a pre-determined number (e.g., five) of top ranking candidate entities are identified. The identified candidate entities can be presented to the content sponsor in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities. For example, the candidate entities can be presented in a list control or other selection-based user interface control. A selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities can be received and the selected candidate entity can be used as the identified entity. In some implementations, more than one entity designation can be made.
- The identified entity is stored along with the keyword in association with the campaign (408). For example, the identified entity can be stored in association with the keyword, the campaign, and a confidence score in a campaign information data store.
- The keyword and the identified entity are used when evaluating the received requests for content (410). For example, the entity can be compared to request keywords associated with received requests for content, where the request keywords can be based on search query terms, content of a page from whence a request originated, or search results associated with the request. As another example, the keyword and the identified entity can be used as described below in the description for the
process 500. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for comparing a request entity to a campaign entity. Theprocess 500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . - A request for content is received (502), the request including one or more request keywords and an entity designation. The entity designation can, for example, be provided by a user. As another example, the entity designation can be inferred and not explicitly provided by the user. For example, the entity designation can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group including profile data associated with the user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. The request keywords can be, for example, search query terms. For example, the request keywords can be “support large pan” and the entity designation can be an entity that represents “panning movement” (e.g., rather than an entity designation that represents “a metal container used for cooking”).
- The one or more request keywords and the entity designation for the request (e.g., the “request entity”) are compared to a campaign selection criteria (e.g., keywords) associated with a campaign and with an entity identified as being associated with the campaign keyword (e.g., a “campaign entity”) (504). For example, the one or more request keywords can be compared to the campaign keyword and the request entity can be compared to the campaign entity. In some implementations, a confidence score is determined which indicates a strength of match between the request entity and the campaign entity. In some implementations, a determination is made that the request entity is a negative entity.
- A determination is made that a match exists based on the comparing (506). For example, in some implementations, the determination is made that a match exists only when the request entity exactly matches the campaign entity. In some implementations, the determination is made that the match exists based on the confidence score exceeding a predetermined confidence score threshold.
- The campaign is identified as a candidate to use in response to the received request, based at least in part on the determining (508). In some implementations, an auction is conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide is selected based on results of the auction. If the campaign entity is a negative entity, the campaign can be identified as not being a candidate to use in response to the received request based on determining that the request entity matches the response entity.
-
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of anexample process 600 for providing content in response to a received request for content. Theprocess 600 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . - A query including at least one query term is received from a user (602). For example, a search query can be received from a user device. In association with the query, a request for content can be received.
- An entity is identified from a plurality of entities associated with the query (604). In some implementations, the entity is inferred and not explicitly provided by the user. For example, the entity can be determined based on one or more criteria selected from the group including profile data associated with the user, context of the request, content of a page from whence the request originated, or search results associated with the request. In some implementations, the user can provide the entity (or information indicating the entity). For example, the user can be prompted to provide an entity and a designation of a specific entity can be received from the user.
- In some implementations, a user selection of a suggested entity can be received. For example, one or more candidate entities can be identified, such as based at least in part on historical query data. A plurality of candidate entities can be presented to the user in an interface so as to enable selection from among the candidate entities. For example, the candidate entities can be ranked and up to a pre-determined number (e.g., five) of top ranking candidate entities can be presented to the user. A selection of an entity from the presented candidate entities can be received from the user.
- The identified entity is associated with the query (606). One or more content items are identified for delivery along with search results responsive to the query (608), wherein identifying one or more content items includes using the entity information along with the query to locate a matching content item in an inventory of available content items. For example, the query and the identified entity can be compared to selection criteria associated with content items in inventory. The identified entity can be compared to respective entity designations associated with respective content items in inventory. A determination can be made that a match exists, such as if the identified entity exactly matches an entity designation associated with a given content item in inventory. A campaign that includes the content item can be identified as a candidate to use when providing the identified one or more content items. An auction can be conducted with all candidate campaigns and a content item to provide can be selected based on results of the auction.
- In some implementations, a plurality of entities associated with the query are identified, along with a weight associated with each identified query, where a respective weight indicates a strength of association between a respective entity and the query. In some implementations, a plurality of entity designations associated with a content item can be identified along with a weight associated with each entity designation, where a respective weight indicates a strength of association between the entity designation and the content item. The content item can be identified for delivery, for example, if one or more matches exist between an entity associated with the query and an entity designation associated with the content item. In some implementations, a match can be determined if one or more matches are above a threshold. For example, a calculation can be performed using the weight of an entity associated with the query and a weight associated with an entity designation associated with the content item. For example, a match can be determined if a weight product of a weight of an entity associated with the query times a weight of an entity designation associated with the content item is above a threshold. For example, weights can range from 0 to 1, and the threshold can be 0.5. If, for example, the weight of an entity associated with the query is 0.7 and the weight of an entity designation associated with the content item is 0.8, a weight product of 0.7*0.8 (e.g., 0.56) can exceed the threshold and the content item can be identified for delivery.
- The identified one or more content items are provided responsive to the received query (610). For example, the one or more content items can be provided along with the search results.
- Although the above description describes a strength of match between an entity associated with a query and an entity designation associated with a content item determining whether the content item is delivered in response to a request for content associated with the query, other actions can be taken based on the strength of match. For example, pricing of selection criteria (e.g., a bid amount for a keyword) can be determined based on the strength of match.

FIG. 7 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices Computing device 700 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 750 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be illustrative only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 700 includes aprocessor 702,memory 704, astorage device 706, a high-speed interface 708 connecting tomemory 704 and high-speed expansion ports 710, and alow speed interface 712 connecting tolow speed bus 714 andstorage device 706. Each of thecomponents processor 702 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 700, including instructions stored in thememory 704 or on thestorage device 706 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 716 coupled tohigh speed interface 708. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 700 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
