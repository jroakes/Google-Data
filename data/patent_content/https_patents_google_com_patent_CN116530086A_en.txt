Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
The present application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/097,203, filed on 11/13/2020, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Technical Field
The disclosed subject matter relates to a system, method, and medium for obfuscated Personal Identification Number (PIN) typing on a media device.
Background
Many devices provide the ability to authenticate a user account by entering a PIN code into an authentication interface displayed on the device. However, since the screen size of a television device is typically large and the location of the television device is centered in a room, typing a PIN code on the television device is highly visible to others in the same room. In some instances, the compromised PIN code may result in unauthorized content purchases, unauthorized application downloads, and the like.
Current methods of PIN entry on television devices using remote controls typically require dedicated keys on the remote control to enter the PIN code. Thus, these methods for PIN entry cannot be used across different media devices and/or different remote controls.
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems, methods, and media for obfuscated personal identification number typing on a media device.

Detailed Description
According to various embodiments, mechanisms for obfuscating personal identification number entry on a media device are provided.
Existing methods of typing PIN codes on media devices may be highly visible to others present in the same room due to the screen size of the media device and/or the location of the media device (e.g., centrally located in the room).
The mechanisms described herein may provide an obfuscated PIN typing mode on a media device, thereby providing secure PIN typing.
The mechanism may generate and present a PIN entry interface screen for entering one or more digital characters using the remote control in response to receiving a request to enter a personal identification number using a remote control device connected to the media device (e.g., in response to a request to authenticate a user account with a PIN number, in response to a request to access parental controls associated with the user account, in response to a request to add time to a timer associated with a sub-account, in response to a request to purchase a media content item, in response to a request to download an application on the media device).
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface screen may include a virtual directional keypad interface (sometimes referred to herein as a "virtual d-pad"). For example, the virtual directional keypad interface may include certain buttons from a remote control device connected to the media device, such as a directional keypad with directional buttons and a select button that may be located in a central portion of the directional keypad. In a more specific example, the virtual directional keyboard interface may indicate how the buttons of the remote control are remapped or otherwise assigned to enter numeric characters or execute function options. Continuing with this example, the virtual directional pad interface may indicate that, when a left directional button on the remote control directional pad is pressed in the confusion PIN entry mode, a number "1" may be entered into the PIN entry field. Alternatively, the virtual directional keypad interface may indicate that upon pressing an up directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control in the confused PIN entry mode, a functional option may be initiated that allows the user to reset the PIN associated with the user account.
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface screen may include a PIN pad or keypad in which a plurality of numeric characters and one or more functional options are presented. It should be noted that the PIN pad may be subdivided in any suitable way. For example, each row of the PIN pad may include a particular number of numeric characters (e.g., three characters, four characters, etc.). Continuing with this example, a PIN pad interfacing with the virtual directional pad may indicate which subsection or region of the PIN pad is active for selection using the remote control. In a more specific example, the PIN pad may indicate that the remote control may be used to enter numbers in the range of 0-3, and in response to pressing a down direction button on the remote control, the PIN pad may activate numbers in the adjacent range of 4-7 for selection using the remote control.
It should be noted that the PIN entry interface screen may present the virtual directional pad interface and PIN pad in any suitable manner. For example, the virtual directional keypad interface may be presented adjacent to the PIN pad. In another example, the virtual directional keypad interface may be integrated into a PIN keypad, wherein active subsections or regions of the PIN keypad may be replaced with shifted virtual directional keypad interfaces. In yet another example, a PIN pad may be provided on a different screen than the virtual directional pad interface (e.g., where the user selects a set of digits from the PIN pad and the user may be presented with a corresponding virtual directional pad interface).
In response to receiving a key press from the remote control, the mechanism may update a PIN entry area on the PIN entry interface screen with numeric characters corresponding to the received key press and the active subsections of the PIN pad. It should be noted that the presentation of received key presses and entered numeric characters on the PIN entry interface screen may be prohibited.
In response to receiving the PIN via the remote control input using the PIN entry interface screen, the mechanism may determine whether the correct PIN has been provided and, in turn, whether to perform a corresponding action on the media device. For example, in response to determining that the entered PIN matches a PIN associated with the user account, the mechanism may authenticate the user account and may perform a corresponding action, such as adding time to a timer associated with the corresponding sub-account (e.g., adding 30 minutes of viewing time to the sub-account).
These and other features of confusing personal identification number entry on a media device are described in connection with fig. 1-18B.
Turning to fig. 1, an illustrative example of a top view of a remote control 100 in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter is shown. In some embodiments, remote control 100 may include various buttons, such as buttons 110, 120, and 130. It should be noted that in some embodiments, any of buttons 110, 120, and 130 may be omitted, and in some such embodiments, the functions described herein in relation to buttons 110, 120, and 130 may be implemented using soft buttons that are dynamically generated on a display area (not shown) of remote control 100.
In some embodiments, the remote control 100 may include a directional keypad 110, and the directional keypad 110 may be pressed to indicate directional input. For example, pressing the keypad 110 at a particular point may complete (or disable) one or more circuits, and the completion of the one or more circuits may be detected by a processor of the remote control 100 (e.g., as shown in fig. 2 and described below in connection with fig. 2). The processor may then determine which direction is indicated based on which circuit(s) are completed. For example, if the right side of the directional keypad 110 is pressed, this may complete a circuit indicating to the processor that the right side of the directional keypad is pressed. Continuing with this example, as described below, if the right side of the directional keypad 110 is pressed while the PIN entry interface screen is presented on the display, a numeric character or function option corresponding to the right directional input of the directional keypad 110 may be input to the media device (e.g., the number "3" is entered in the PIN entry field). In another example, in an instance in which a PIN entry interface screen is presented on the display, adjacent rows or subsections of numeric characters may be navigated to in response to a button being pressed and held to the left or right from directional keypad 110 for a particular period of time (e.g., three seconds).
It should be noted that according to some embodiments, directional keypad 110 may be configured to accept any suitable number of inputs for various directions. For example, the processor of the remote control 100 may be configured to detect inputs in four directions (e.g., up, down, left, and right) from the directional keypad 110. In another example, the processor of the remote control 100 may be configured to detect eight directional inputs (e.g., up, down, left, right, and middle directions such as an upper right diagonal, an upper left diagonal, a lower right diagonal, and a lower left diagonal) from the directional keypad 110. In yet another example, the processor of the remote control 100 may be configured to detect input in any arbitrary direction from the directional keypad 110. In such examples, directional keypad 110 may include touch sensors that may be used to detect any arbitrary location of input to directional keypad 110.
In some embodiments, remote control 100 may include a "OK" or "select" button 120. For example, if the select button 120 is pressed, this may complete a circuit that indicates to the processor that the select button is pressed. In another example, if the select button 120 is pressed, this may complete a circuit indicating to the processor to select the element currently highlighted on the display navigated using the remote control 100. In another example, as described below, if the selection button 120 is pressed while the PIN entry interface screen is presented on the display, a numeric character or function option corresponding to the selection button 120 may be entered into the media device (e.g., the number "5" is entered in the PIN entry field). In a further example, in an instance in which a PIN entry interface screen is presented on a display, a different row or subsection of a numeric character may be navigated to in response to pressing and holding the select button 120 for a particular period of time (e.g., three seconds).
It should be noted that while fig. 1 shows the select button 120 located in a central portion of the directional keypad 110, this is merely exemplary and the button 120 may be located in any suitable location on the remote control 100.
In addition to direction buttons and selection buttons, remote control 100 may include any suitable number of buttons, each performing one of a plurality of functions.
In some embodiments, the remote control 100 may include a back button 130. In some implementations, selection of the back button 130 can cause a previously presented user interface to be presented on a display of a media device controlled by the remote control 100. For example, in an instance in which a user of remote control 100 uses remote control 100 to navigate from a first user interface to a second user interface, selection of back button 130 may cause the display to present the first user interface. In another example, as described below, in the instance that a PIN entry interface screen is presented on the display and one or more numeric characters have been entered into the PIN entry field, selection of the back button 130 may cause the last entered numeric character in the PIN entry field to be deleted. In yet another example, in instances where a PIN entry interface screen is presented on the display and one or more numeric characters have been entered into the PIN entry field, any numeric characters that have been entered in the PIN entry field may be deleted in response to the back button 130 being pressed and held for a particular period of time (e.g., three seconds).
In some implementations, the remote control 100 may include a power button for controlling the power state of a media device, such as a television device, a streaming media device, a sound bar, and/or any other suitable media device. For example, if the power button is pressed, the remote control 100 may cause a signal to be transmitted to the media device to power on (e.g., from an off or sleep state). Additionally, in some embodiments, a selector (not shown) may be included that may be used to select the apparatus to be powered on from a plurality of devices by pressing a power button. Such a selector may be, for example, a slide switch, buttons each corresponding to various media devices, or the like. In some implementations, the remote control 100 may include an indicator to the user indicating which media device is currently selected.
In some implementations, the remote control 100 may include an application button or any other suitable button corresponding to an application executing on the media device. In some implementations, the application buttons can correspond to particular applications (e.g., applications associated with a particular media streaming service, and/or any other suitable applications). In some such embodiments, selection of an application button may cause a media device controlled by remote control 100 to launch a corresponding application. In some implementations, selection of the application button when the media device controlled by the remote control 100 is powered off may cause the media device to power on prior to launching the application. It should be noted that the remote control 100 may include any suitable number of application buttons (e.g., two, three, four, and/or any other suitable number), each application button corresponding to a different application.
In some implementations, the remote control 100 may include microphone buttons for initiating microphone functions on a media device controlled by the remote control 100. After pressing the microphone button, the user may be prompted to speak a voice command for causing the media device to perform some function. Any suitable technique may be used to prompt the user for voice commands, such as sound, images, etc. Alternatively, the user may not be prompted to speak the voice command, but pressing the microphone button may cause instructions to the media device in preparation for receiving the voice command (e.g., by activating a microphone on the media device). In some implementations, the media device and/or remote control 100 may be configured to recognize any suitable voice command. For example, a command to replicate an action caused by pressing a button on the remote control 100 may be recognized. As another example, the user may initiate a search using a voice command. As yet another example, a user may tune to a particular channel (e.g., channel 451, channel 2, "CBA," "food channel," etc.) by number and/or name. As a further example, a user may launch an application on a media device using a voice command (e.g., "use < application > play < video >").
In some embodiments, a microphone for receiving voice commands may be included in remote control 100. If a microphone is included in the remote control 100, voice commands may be interpreted by a processor of the remote control 100 and/or may be sent to a media device controlled by the remote control 100 for interpretation, to an intermediate device or streaming media device associated with the system (e.g., as shown in FIG. 2 and described below in connection with FIG. 2), and/or to a server (e.g., as shown in FIG. 2 and described below in connection with FIG. 2). Additionally, in some implementations, a microphone may be used to detect trigger sounds (e.g., clapping hands, spoken language, and/or any other suitable trigger sounds). In some embodiments, in response to detecting the trigger sound, the remote control 100 may be programmed to present an indication of the location of the remote control 100, for example, by emitting a particular tone, beep, or other audible sound.
In some implementations, the remote control 100 may include a home button for returning to a home screen of the media device controlled by the remote control 100 and/or exiting from a current screen and returning to a main input. For example, if the media device controlled using the remote control 100 is a digital media receiver running an operating system with a home screen, the instructions transmitted in response to pressing the home button may cause the digital media receiver to go to the home screen. As another example, if the media device controlled using remote control 100 is a set top box from a cable provider, the instructions transmitted in response to pressing the home button may cause the set top box to exit any screen currently being displayed and return to the last channel tuned by the set top box. In some implementations, pressing the home button can cause the media device to display a home screen of the application if the media device is currently running the application. Additionally, in such embodiments, pressing and holding the home button may cause the media device to go to the home screen of the media device.
In some embodiments, the remote controller 100 may include a mute (mute) button for muting sound output from a media device controlled by the remote controller 100.
In some embodiments, remote control 100 may include a volume button. The volume buttons may be used to control the volume of the media device and/or one or more speakers associated with the media device controlled by the remote control 100. For example, a volume rocker button may be provided on the remote control 100, wherein pressing the top of the volume rocker button may cause the volume of the media device to increase, and wherein pressing the bottom of the volume rocker button may cause the volume of the media device to decrease. In some embodiments, the volume button may be located at any suitable location on the remote control 100 (e.g., the side of the remote control 100).
In some embodiments, the remote control 100 may further include a motion sensor (not shown) for sensing rotational and/or linear motion of the remote control 100 and/or orientation of the remote control 100. For example, as a user moves remote control 100 containing motion sensors (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, etc.), the motion sensors may transmit motion and/or positioning information related to remote control 100. As described herein, the motion sensor may be used to detect a signal indicative of motion of the remote control 100, to detect a signal indicative of an orientation of the remote control (e.g., which portion of the remote control 100 is facing upward), to detect a signal indicative of a particular gesture (e.g., shaking, swinging, etc.), and so forth.
In some embodiments, remote control 100 may include any other suitable selectable buttons not shown in fig. 1. For example, in some implementations, the remote control 100 may include input buttons for controlling selected inputs of the media device. For example, if the media device is a television, it may have multiple inputs, such as one or more High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) inputs, one or more coaxial inputs, one or more component video inputs, one or more displayport inputs, one or more fiber optic inputs, and the like. Pressing the input button may cause the remote control 100 to transmit an instruction to the media device to alter the selected input. The selection of the inputs may be performed using any suitable technique. For example, in some implementations, after pressing the input button, a list of selectable inputs may be displayed on a display connected to the media device, and the user may select a desired input by holding down and/or repeatedly pressing the input button, or by navigating to and selecting a particular input using the directional keypad 110 and the selection button 120.
As another example, in some embodiments, remote control 100 may include a picture-in-picture (PiP) button. For example, if the user presses the PiP button, the remote control 100 may transmit instructions to the media device to display content from a second source (e.g., a second channel) on the content from the first source (e.g., the first channel) that is currently being displayed. In such examples, the content from the second source may be displayed, for example, in a corner of a display connected to the media device.
As yet another example, in some implementations, remote control 100 may include a guide button that may initiate program guidance of available media content. For example, such directions may be electronic program directions that display available programs to the user, and may be organized based on time, channel, category, etc. As another example, such directions may include a list of top-level content, such as television programs and/or movies, that may be retrieved and displayed by a media device controlled by the remote control 100.
As yet another example, in some implementations, the remote control 100 may include a menu button for invoking a menu on a media device controlled by the remote control 100. For example, pressing a menu button may cause the media device to open a menu. As another example, if the media device is running an application, pressing the menu button may cause additional options and/or menus related to the application to be presented to the user.
As yet another example, in some implementations, the remote control 100 may include media buttons for controlling playback of media by media devices controlled by the remote control 100. For example, the media buttons may include a play button, a pause button, a fast forward button, a rewind button, a skip forward button, any other suitable media buttons, and/or any suitable combination thereof. In some embodiments, buttons that may be more common to the user (e.g., play and pause buttons) may be centrally located and raised as compared to buttons that are less common (e.g., rewind and fast forward). Additionally or alternatively, different media buttons may have different shapes to distinguish the buttons from each other. These features may assist the user in pressing the correct button, while the user's gaze is not directed to the remote control 100, but instead to a display connected to the media device, for example.
Turning to fig. 2, an illustrative example of a general schematic of a system 200 according to some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, the system 200 includes a media device, a remote control that controls the media device, and a server.
As shown, the system 200 may include a remote control 202 that may be used to control one or more media devices, such as media device 220. In a more specific example, as shown in fig. 2, the remote control 202 may include a battery 206, a directional keypad 208, a processor 210, one or more input devices 212, a memory 214, and a transmitter/receiver 216, which may be interconnected.
In some embodiments, the battery 206 may be any suitable type of battery for powering the remote control 202. For example, in some embodiments, the battery 206 may be a rechargeable battery. In some such embodiments, the battery 206 may be charged using power from an external source, which may be connected to the remote control 202 in any suitable manner (e.g., a micro USB port on the remote control 202, and/or in any other suitable manner). Additionally or alternatively, the battery 206 may be charged wirelessly, wherein the wireless power transceiver of the charging device may receive power from a power source, and the wireless power transceiver of the charging device may in turn transmit power to the battery 206 of the connected remote control 202 via a suitable converter circuit.
In some implementations, the remote control 202 may include a directional keypad 208. The directional keypad 208 may include a plurality of switches that, when activated, indicate directional input, as shown and described above in connection with fig. 1. For example, the directional keypad 208 may include buttons that a user may press to indicate directions. This button may activate one or more of the switches and may correlate, via the processor 210, signals from the one or more switches to the direction indicated by pressing the button. In another example, as shown in fig. 1, a directional keypad 208 may be configured around the periphery of the central selection button.
According to some implementations, the directional keypad 208 and the processor 210 may be configured to accept any suitable number of inputs for various directions. For example, the processor 210 may be configured to detect input from four directions (e.g., up, down, left, and right) of the directional keypad 208. In another example, the processor 210 may be configured to detect eight directional inputs (e.g., up, down, left, right, and middle directions such as an upper right diagonal, an upper left diagonal, a lower right diagonal, and a lower left diagonal) from the directional keypad 208. In yet another example, the processor 210 may be configured to detect input in any arbitrary direction from the directional keypad 208. In such examples, directional keypad 208 may include touch sensors that may be used to detect any arbitrary positioning of input to directional keypad 208.
In some implementations, the processor 210 may use a computer program to cause a signal to be transmitted from the remote control 202. In some implementations, the signals may be transmitted using a transmitter/receiver 216, and the transmitter/receiver 216 may include one or more transmitters, receivers, antennas, transmitters/receivers, and the like. The transmitter/receiver 216 may transmit and/or receive signals using any suitable technique and/or frequency. For example, the transmitter/receiver 216 may transmit and/or receive bluetooth signals (e.g., bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals), wi-Fi signals, radio signals, infrared signals, near infrared signals, ultrasonic signals, and the like. In a more specific example, the transmitter/receiver 216 of the remote controller 202 may transmit a directional input, a selection button key press, or a back button key press in the form of a BLE signal to a media streaming device connected to the display device via an HDMI port on the display device, wherein the media streaming device transmits the directional input, the selection button key press, or the back button key press over an HDMI-CEC channel between the media streaming device and the display device. In another example, the transmitter/receiver 216 of the remote control 202 may transmit and/or receive Wi-Fi signals with the transmitter/receiver 228 of the media device 220 over the communication network 206. In yet a more specific example, the transmitter/receiver 216 of the remote control 202 may transmit and/or receive BLE signals between the transmitter/receiver 228 of the media device 220 and/or any other suitable intermediate device or streaming media device.
In some implementations, the memory 214 may store a computer program for controlling the processor 110. For example, the computer program may be stored in read-only memory (ROM), electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, or the like.
In some embodiments, it should be noted that the remote control 202 may include any other suitable input device 212. The input device 212 may include other suitable input features such as an alphanumeric keyboard, power buttons, input buttons, channel buttons, volume mute buttons, direction buttons, media play buttons (e.g., rewind, pause, play, and fast forward buttons), dedicated buttons to access downloadable applications for use with the media device, a microphone or other suitable audio input, a camera, and so forth. For example, in some embodiments, remote control 202 may include a microphone that may be used for any suitable purpose. As a more specific example, in some implementations, a microphone may be used to receive a voice query (e.g., begin playing a particular media content item, perform a search query, and/or any other suitable voice query), which may be processed by the remote control 202, or transmitted from the remote control 202 to another device for processing (e.g., to the media device 220, the server 230, and/or any other suitable device). As another more specific example, in some embodiments, a microphone may be used to detect any suitable audible sound (e.g., clapping hands, spoken words or phrases, etc.), which may be used as a trigger to present an indication of the position of the remote control 202 (e.g., by causing the remote control to emit an audible tone or beep). In some implementations, the input device 212 may include hardware buttons and/or software buttons (e.g., programmable buttons). In some implementations, the input device 212 may also include other inputs, such as a computer keyboard, cursor control, dials, switch sets, levers, touch screens, and/or any other suitable input device.
The system 200 may include one or more media devices 220, such as media devices for viewing a list of media content and/or obtaining and presenting content items from various sources (e.g., broadcast content, on-demand content, locally stored content, internet content, streaming content, live streaming content, etc.). For example, the media device 220 may be implemented as a television, smart television, set-top box, streaming media device, digital media receiver, computer, game console, optical media player, or the like. The remote control 202 and the media device 220 may be local to each other or remote from each other. For example, the enhanced remote 202 and the media device 220 may be located in the same room.
More specifically, in some implementations, the media device 220 may include a display/input device 222, a processor 224, a memory 226, and one or more transmitters, receivers, and/or transmitters/receivers 228, which may be interconnected.
In some implementations, media device 220 may include a storage device, such as a hard disk drive, a digital video recorder, a solid state storage device, a removable storage device, or any other suitable device for storing instructional information and/or remote control instructions. In a more specific example, the storage device may store a computer program for controlling the processor 224 in the media device 220 (e.g., in response to instructions received from the remote control 202).
Processor 224 may present content on display/input device 222 using a computer program and control an interface that allows a user to interact with the content and send and receive data using transmitter/receiver 228. In some implementations, the transmitter/receiver 228 may transmit and/or receive bluetooth signals (e.g., BLE signals), wi-Fi signals, radio signals, infrared signals, near infrared signals, ultrasonic signals, and the like. For example, the transmitter/receiver 228 of the media device 220 may transmit and/or receive Wi-Fi signals with the transmitter/receiver 216 of the remote control 202 via the communication network 206. In another example, the transmitter/receiver 228 of the media device 220 may transmit and/or receive BLE signals between the transmitter/receiver 216 of the remote control 202 and/or any other suitable intermediate device or streaming media device.
The display/input device 222 may include an input device such as a computer keyboard, cursor control, one or more buttons, dials, switch sets, levers, a touch screen, and/or any other suitable input device.
In some implementations, the instructions issued by the remote control 202 may be formatted based on the model and/or brand of the media device 220 being controlled. For example, the remote control 202 may be programmed with different codes and may be used as a universal remote control for controlling different types of media devices. In some implementations, formatting may be performed by a converter (not shown) that converts signals transmitted by the remote control 202 into signals for use by the particular media device 220.
In a more specific example, the remote control 202 and the media device 220 may be any one of a general purpose device such as a computer or a special purpose device such as a remote control, smart phone, tablet, set top box, smart television, game console, digital media receiver, server, etc., or any suitable combination of such devices. Any of these general purpose or special purpose devices may include any suitable components, such as a hardware processor (which may be a microprocessor, digital signal processor, controller, etc.), memory, a communication interface, a display controller, an input device, etc. For example, the media device 220 may be implemented as a set-top box, digital media receiver, smart television, notebook computer, personal computer, server, smart phone, tablet computer, game console, or the like.
In some implementations, the server 230 can be any suitable server that provides media content (e.g., television programming, video content, movies, live video content, audio content, video game content, and/or any other suitable media content), receives and maintains user preference settings, and/or performs any other suitable function. For example, in some implementations, the server 230 may determine whether to authenticate the user account based on the entered PIN, and may determine whether to perform a particular action (e.g., add time to a timer, unlock parental controls, purchase a media content item, etc.) based on the authenticated user account.
In some implementations, the remote control 202, the media device 220, and the server 230 may communicate in any suitable manner. For example, in some implementations, remote control 202 may transmit commands (e.g., commands to navigate within a user interface, volume commands, power commands, and/or any other suitable commands) to media device 220 using any suitable direct communication link 225 (e.g., an infrared communication link, a radio communication link, and/or any other suitable type of communication link).
As another example, in some implementations, server 230 may receive information via communication network 260 and transmit the information to remote control 202, media device 220, and/or streaming media device 250 (described in more detail below). In some implementations, the communication network 260 may be any suitable type of communication network, such as a Wi-Fi network, a Local Area Network (LAN), and/or any other suitable type of network. In some implementations, signals may be transmitted between remote control 202, media device 220, server 230, and/or streaming media device 250 via communication network 260 using communication links 215, 235, 245, and/or 255, as shown in fig. 2. In some implementations, the communication links 215, 235, 245, and/or 255 may be any suitable type of wired or wireless communication link.
In some implementations, communication between the remote control device 202 and the media device 220 can be through the streaming media device 250 paired with the media device 220 via the communication link 295. For example, in some implementations, streaming media device 250 may be connected to media device 220 via an HDMI connection. In some implementations, streaming media device 250 can launch any suitable application for rendering content on media device 220, for example, by launching the application and navigating to a particular deep link associated with the requested content.
In some implementations, the remote control device 202 may communicate with the streaming media device 250 in any suitable manner. For example, in some implementations, remote control device 202 may communicate with streaming media device 250 via communication link 275. In some such embodiments, the communication link 275 may be a Wi-Fi link, a bluetooth link, and/or any other suitable type of communication link. In a more specific example, remote control device 202 may transmit instructions to streaming media device 250 via a Wi-Fi signal or via a bluetooth signal, wherein streaming media device 250 may transmit corresponding instructions to media device 220 connected to streaming media device 250 (e.g., via an HDMI-CEC channel). It should be noted that in some implementations, remote control device 202 and streaming media device 250 may be paired in any suitable manner, such as via a discovery protocol (discovery and initiation (DIAL) and/or any other suitable discovery protocol) associated with the local network. Additionally, it should be noted that in instances where the communication link 275 is a Wi-Fi link, the remote control 202 may have Wi-Fi capability.
As another example, in some implementations, remote control device 202 may communicate with streaming media device 250 via intermediary device 240. In some implementations, the intermediary device 240 may be a Wi-Fi dongle that allows the intermediary device 240 to communicate with the streaming media device 250 via the Wi-Fi communication link 285. In some implementations, the remote control device 202 may communicate with the intermediary device 240 via a communication link 265. In some implementations, the communication link 265 may be a bluetooth link, and/or any other suitable type of communication link. It should be noted that in some embodiments, the intermediary device 240 may be omitted.
Turning to fig. 3, an illustrative example 300 of a process for providing obfuscated personal identification number entry on a media device is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. In some implementations, the blocks of process 300 may be performed by any suitable device, such as a media device (e.g., a television, a streaming media device paired with a television, a speaker, and/or any other suitable type of media device).
Process 300 may begin at 310 by receiving a request to type a PIN on a media device. It should be noted that such a request may be received in any suitable manner. For example, a media application executing on the media device may determine that a PIN associated with the user account is required to authenticate the user account, unlock parental controls (e.g., for modifying one or more parental controls), control settings associated with the sub-account, add time to a timer (e.g., add time to total available viewing time of the sub-account), access and/or purchase media content items, download the application for installation on the media device, execute the application on the media device, play a game with a particular rating on the media device, and so forth.
It should be noted that in some implementations, the process 300 may receive a request to type a PIN code or any other suitable password and may determine whether an obfuscated PIN-typing mode is suitable for typing a PIN on the media device. For example, in some implementations, the process 300 may determine that the media device is located within a home where the entered PIN code or password will be seen by others at or around the same location based on the device data and/or location data. In a more specific example, process 300 may determine that the confounding PIN entry mode is a suitable mode to enter a PIN in response to a request based on device data indicating that the media device is a television device and location data indicating that the television device is located in a living room of a home.
In some implementations, in response to receiving a request to type a PIN on the media device and/or in response to determining that an obfuscated PIN-typing mode is suitable for type a PIN on the media device, the process 300 may initiate an obfuscated PIN-typing mode by determining whether the user of the user account has previously typed a PIN on the media device using the obfuscated PIN-typing mode at 320. For example, in some implementations, the process 300 may determine whether this is the first time that a user signing a user account is using an obfuscated PIN entry mode. In another example, in some implementations, the process 300 may determine whether user preferences associated with the user account indicate that a tutorial about using an obfuscated PIN entry mode should be presented before entering a PIN on the media device (e.g., always present a tutorial screen, present a tutorial screen only when the user is first time using an obfuscated PIN entry mode, etc.).
In some implementations, in response to determining that the user of the user account has not previously entered a PIN on the media device using the confused PIN entry mode ("yes" at 320), the process 300 may cause a confused PIN entry tutorial screen to be presented in the media device. An illustrative example of a user interface providing a tutorial for confusing PIN entry on a media device in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter is shown in fig. 4.
Turning to fig. 4, in some implementations, a tutorial for confusing PIN entry may include presenting a user interface that provides instructions for entering a PIN via a remote control, where buttons on the remote control have been assigned to specific numeric characters and/or functional options. In a more specific example as shown in fig. 4, such a user interface may include an image indicating how buttons on a remote control have been remapped or otherwise assigned to particular numeric characters and/or function options by showing an image of the remote control 410 and an adjacent image of a virtual directional keyboard 420 in the form of a directional keyboard and selection buttons of the remote control 410. Continuing with this example, as shown in FIG. 4, the user interface may instruct the user to press the remote control up and down direction buttons to allow the user to navigate between rows of numeric characters or function options (e.g., between a set of numbers in the range of 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9, and 0, and a "forget PIN" operation). In some implementations, a PIN pad 430 may be presented that indicates which row or sub-section of the plurality of sub-sections in the PIN pad is active for user selection. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, an active subsection of the PIN pad may be indicated by highlighting a row with highlight region 440. Additionally or alternatively, as also shown in fig. 4, the active subsections of the PIN pad may be indicated by highlighting the active characters (e.g., the numeric characters "1", "2", and "3" are highlighted in PIN pad 430 as compared to the remaining numeric characters and function options that are inactive).
In some implementations, the tutorial of confusing PIN entry may provide instructions to the user as to how to select the numeric characters for the PIN and how to select the functional options. For example, as shown in fig. 4, the user interface may instruct the user to press a left button, a center select button, or a right button of the remote control such that a corresponding numeric character from an active row that has been assigned to a particular button is entered. In a more specific example, as shown in fig. 4, in an active row containing a number character in the range of 1-3, a number character "1" may be assigned to a left button on the remote control, a number character "2" may be assigned to a center select button of the remote control, and a number character "3" may be assigned to a right button on the remote control. In response to pressing the left button, center select button, or right button of the remote control, a corresponding numeric character may be entered into the PIN entry field 450 (which may be represented by a symbol such as × or +.x) to indicate that the character has been entered.
In some implementations, the tutorial for confusing PIN entry may provide instructions to the user as to how to delete entered numeric characters in the PIN entry field 450. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the user interface may instruct the user to press a back button on the remote control to delete the last entered numeric character in the PIN entry field 450. In another example, the user interface may instruct the user to press and hold a back button on the remote control for a certain period of time to delete all entered numeric characters in the PIN entry field 450.
In response to determining that the user has indicated confirmation of a course for the confounding PIN entry (e.g., by pressing a central selection button on a "know (Got it)" interface element in the course screen), process 300 may determine that the confounding PIN entry course no longer needs to be presented to the user of the user account (at block 320 of FIG. 3). In some implementations, the process 300 may increment a counter value associated with the user account that indicates the number of confusing PIN typing tutorials have been presented to the user. Continuing with this example, in response to the counter value being greater than a particular threshold, process 300 may determine that an confusing PIN entry tutorial should not be presented to the user (e.g., "no" at block 320).
In response to determining that the user should not be presented with the confusing PIN typing course at block 320, or in response to presenting the user with the confusing PIN typing course at block 330, process 300 may cause a PIN typing interface to be presented at 340. The keypad buttons, center select buttons, and back buttons of the remote control may be assigned specific numeric characters and/or one or more functional options as described above in connection with the confusing PIN entry tutorial of fig. 3. Illustrative examples of PIN entry interfaces for obfuscated PIN entry on a media device according to some implementations of the disclosed subject matter are shown in fig. 5A-18B.
Turning to fig. 5A, an illustrative example of a PIN entry interface 500 in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As shown, in some implementations, PIN entry interface 500 may include an action descriptor 510, a user account representation 520, a virtual directional pad interface 530, a PIN pad 540, an active highlight region 550, and a PIN entry region 560.
The action descriptor 510 may be any suitable representation that indicates an action to be performed on the media device when the correct PIN is received. For example, as shown in fig. 5A, the action descriptor indicates that an obfuscated PIN entry mode has been initiated to add a bonus time to the timer. In a more specific example, the obfuscated PIN typing mode may be used to verify that a parent account corresponding to user account representation 520 desires to add a particular amount of time (e.g., thirty minutes) to a viewing time associated with a corresponding child account.
It should be noted that while the action descriptor 510 in fig. 5A indicates that the user desires to add time to the viewing time associated with the sub-account, this is merely illustrative and the obfuscated PIN entry mode may be used in any suitable application. For example, a media application executing on the media device may determine that a PIN associated with the user account is required to authenticate the user account represented by the user account representation 520, unlock parental controls (e.g., for modifying one or more parental controls), access and/or purchase media content items, download the application for installation on the media device, execute the application on the media device, toy a game with a particular rating on the media device, and so forth.
Virtual directional keypad interface 530 may be any suitable representation of directional keypad buttons and central selection buttons for controlling a remote control of a media device. For example, as shown in fig. 5A, each virtual button on the virtual directional keyboard interface 530 may be mapped to a button on the remote control for providing input to the media device (e.g., left directional input, right directional input, up directional input, down directional input, center selection input, back input, etc.). In a more specific example, as shown in fig. 5A, the virtual directional keypad interface 530 may be shaped to correspond to a directional keypad button and a center selection button of a remote controller for controlling the media device. In another more specific example, virtual directional keypad interface 530 may generally identify how to assign numeric characters and/or functional options in PIN entry interface 500 to directional keypad buttons and select buttons of a remote control.
PIN pad 540 may be any suitable representation of numeric characters and/or functional options that may be selected using PIN entry interface 500. For example, as shown in fig. 5A, PIN pad 540 may be positioned adjacent to virtual directional pad interface 530, where the set of numeric characters from 0-9 and "forget PIN" operations may be divided into rows of PIN pad 540. More specifically, in fig. 5A, PIN pad 540 may be divided into rows or subsections representing: (1) numbers in the range of 1-3, (2) numbers in the range of 4-6, (3) numbers in the range of 7-9 and number 0, and (4) the "forget PIN" option. As also shown in fig. 5A, PIN pad 540 may also include an active highlight 550 that indicates which row or rows of PIN pad 540 are active for selection using buttons of the remote control. For example, in FIG. 5A, the rows corresponding to numbers in the range of 1-3 are highlighted. Continuing with this example, as also shown in fig. 5A, PIN pad 540 may indicate that the remaining rows are inactive for selection using buttons of the remote control.
In some implementations, numeric characters and/or functional options in the active row of PIN pad 540 may be indicated on virtual directional pad interface 530. For example, as shown in fig. 5A, the number "1" has been positioned on the left directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, the number "2" has been positioned on the center select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, and the number "3" has been positioned on the right directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530.
It should be noted that although the embodiments described herein generally relate to entering numeric characters of a PIN, this is merely illustrative and that the virtual directional keyboard interface may be configured to enter any suitable character, such as one or more alphanumeric characters (e.g., letters a-Z), one or more symbols (e.g., |, @, # etc.), one or more spanish characters with a varying sound marking, etc.
Turning to fig. 5B, in response to selecting the left directional button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual directional pad 530 in fig. 5B), a corresponding number "1" from the active row of PIN pad 540 may be entered into PIN entry field 560. Continuing with this example, in response to selecting the central select button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual directional keypad 530 in fig. 5C), a corresponding number "2" from the active row of PIN pad 540 may be entered into PIN entry field 560.
It should be noted that as shown in fig. 5B and 5C and the additional figures, although the corresponding numeric character "1" may be entered as a first digit of the PIN and the corresponding numeric character "2" may be entered as a second digit of the PIN, the entered numeric character may be symbolized, such as x or ∈, to indicate that a character has been entered via a corresponding key press on the remote control. It should also be noted that in some embodiments, as shown in fig. 5B and 5C and the additional figures, PIN entry field 560 may highlight the location in the PIN where the numeric character is to be entered (e.g., a darkened blank line below the digits in the PIN entered in PIN entry field 560). It should be further noted that while the indicia 570 in fig. 5B and 5C, as well as the additional figures, indicate that the left directional button of the remote control is pressed in fig. 5B to enter the number "1" in the PIN entry field 560, and the center select button of the remote control is pressed in fig. 5C to enter the number "2" in the PIN entry field, the indicia 570 and other indicia described herein are typically not displayed in the PIN entry interface 500 so that other users in the same room as the media device cannot determine which buttons on the remote control were pressed when entering a PIN.
Continuing with the example in fig. 5C, in response to selecting the down direction button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual direction keyboard 530 in fig. 5D), the active row of PIN keyboard 540 may be changed from a row corresponding to a number in the range of 1-3 to an adjacent row corresponding to a number in the range of 4-6. Turning to fig. 5E, the number "4" has been positioned on the left directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, the number "5" has been positioned on the central select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, and the number "6" has been positioned on the right directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, and highlight region 550 has been positioned on the new active row of PIN keyboard 540 that includes numbers in the range of 4-6. In response to selecting the right directional button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual directional keypad 530 in fig. 5E), a corresponding number "6" from the active row of PIN pad 540 may be entered into PIN entry field 560.
Continuing with the example in fig. 5E, in response to selecting the down direction button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual direction keyboard 530 in fig. 5F), the active row of PIN keyboard 540 may be changed from a row corresponding to a number in the range of 4-6 to an adjacent sub-section corresponding to a number in the range of 7-9 and a number 0. Turning to fig. 5G, the number "7" has been positioned on the left directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, the number "8" has been positioned on the central select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, the number "9" has been positioned on the right directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, and the number "0" has been positioned on the down directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530. Further, as shown in FIG. 5G, highlight region 550 has been positioned over a new active subsection of PIN pad 540 that includes numbers in the range of 7-9 and number 0. In response to selecting the down directional button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual directional keypad 530 in fig. 5G), a corresponding number "0" from the active row of PIN pad 540 may be entered into PIN entry field 560.
It should be noted that in some embodiments, the numeric characters and/or functional options in PIN pad 540 may be divided into any suitable number of subsections. For example, in response to selection of a down directional button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 570 on the virtual directional keypad 530 in fig. 5F), the active row of the PIN pad 540 may be changed from a row corresponding to numbers in the range of 4-6 to an adjacent subsection corresponding to numbers in the range of 7-9 (as opposed to the subsection corresponding to numbers in the range of 7-9 and number 0 as indicated in fig. 5F). In turn, as shown in FIG. 6, the number "7" has been positioned on the left directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, the number "8" has been positioned on the center select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530, and the number "9" has been positioned on the right directional button of virtual directional keyboard interface 530. Continuing to select the down directional buttons of the remote control, the active row of PIN pad 540 may be changed from a row corresponding to a number in the range of 7-9 to an adjacent row corresponding to a number 0, where the number "0" may be positioned on the central select button of virtual directional pad interface 530.
Referring back to fig. 3, in response to receiving a PIN in PIN entry field 560 of PIN entry interface 500, process 300 may determine whether the correct PIN has been provided and, in turn, whether to perform an action on the media device. For example, as shown in fig. 5A-5G, the user has used a remote control in conjunction with PIN entry interface 500 to enter PIN "1260". Continuing with this example, process 300 may determine whether PIN "1260" matches the correct PIN associated with the user account represented by user account representation 520, and in response to determining that the correct PIN has been entered, process 300 may authenticate the user account and may cause additional time to be added to the timer associated with the corresponding sub-account (e.g., 30 minutes of viewing time to be added to the sub-account).
As shown in fig. 5H, in response to determining at 350 that the correct PIN has been provided in PIN entry interface 500, PIN entry interface 500 may be updated with notification 580 and updated virtual directional pad interface 590. The notification 580 may be any suitable notification indicating that the correct PIN has been entered and that the media device is to perform a corresponding action (e.g., adding thirty minutes of bonus time). The updated virtual directional keypad interface 590 may, for example, indicate that the remote control for controlling the media device has exited from the obfuscated PIN entry mode. As shown in fig. 5H, the directional arrow is returned to the updated virtual directional keyboard interface 590 and the numeric characters and/or function options are no longer converted to buttons on the updated virtual directional keyboard interface 590.
It should be noted that while fig. 5A-5H illustrate a PIN entry interface including a virtual directional keypad interface 530 and an adjacent PIN pad 540, this is merely illustrative and that the virtual directional keypad interface and numeric characters and/or functional options for selection may be presented in any suitable manner.
In some implementations, multiple virtual directional pad interfaces may alternatively be provided in the PIN entry interface for providing a PIN entry interface that includes a virtual directional pad interface 530 and an adjacent PIN pad 540. For example, this may present each set of digits in a single interface (e.g., digits 0-2, 3-5, and 6-9 in three virtual directional keyboard interfaces).
For example, fig. 7 shows an illustrative PIN entry interface 700 that includes a first virtual directional keypad interface 710, a second virtual directional keypad interface 720, and a third virtual directional keypad interface 730. Continuing with this example, the first virtual directional keypad interface 710 may be used to enter numbers in the range of 0-2, wherein an up directional button on the remote control is assigned to enter the number character "0", a center select button on the remote control is assigned to enter the number character "1", and a down directional button on the remote control is assigned to enter the number character "2". Note that in this embodiment PIN pad 540 has been omitted from PIN entry interface 700.
It should be noted that while fig. 5A-5H show an indication of an active row or subset of numeric characters of PIN pad 540 through the use of highlight region 550, this is merely illustrative and the active region or subsection within the PIN entry interface may be highlighted in any suitable manner. For example, fig. 7 illustrates that the virtual directional keyboard interface may be highlighted to indicate that it is active for selecting numeric characters and/or functional options. As shown, the first virtual directional keypad interface 710 is highlighted to indicate that the user can use the remote control to select a number from the range of 0-2 for entry into the first digit of the PIN.
It should be noted that while fig. 5A-5H show navigation between rows of PIN pad 540 by pressing up and down buttons on the remote control, this is merely illustrative and the PIN entry interface may provide navigation options to the user in any suitable manner. For example, as shown in FIG. 7, the left and right buttons on the remote control may be used to navigate between virtual directional keypad interfaces. Continuing with this example, in response to selecting the right directional button of the remote control, the active virtual directional keyboard interface may change from the first virtual directional keyboard interface 710 to the second virtual directional keyboard interface 720. Alternatively, in response to selecting a left directional button of the remote control, the active virtual directional keypad interface may change from the first virtual directional keypad interface 710 to an interface containing one or more function options, such as a "forget PIN" option that allows the user to reset a PIN associated with the user account or a profile option that allows the user to switch between different user accounts.
In some implementations, the virtual directional pad interface may alternatively be integrated with the PIN pad for providing a PIN entry interface that includes the virtual directional pad interface 530 and an adjacent PIN pad 540 in fig. 5A-5G. For example, this may cause the integrated virtual directional keyboard interface to shift as the user focuses on a particular set of digits (e.g., digits 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 0).
For example, fig. 8A and 8B show an illustrative PIN entry interface 800 that includes a PIN pad interface 810, wherein a virtual directional pad interface 820 may be integrated within PIN pad interface 810. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 8A, the active rows of numeric characters in the range of 1-3 in PIN pad interface 810 may be replaced with virtual directional pad interface 810. Similar to fig. 5A-5G, the number "1" has been positioned on the left directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the left directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "1" into the PIN, the number "2" has been positioned on the central select button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the central select button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "2" into the PIN, and the number "3" has been positioned on the right directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the right directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "3" into the PIN. Continuing with this example, PIN pad interface 810 may present the remaining inactive rows in the PIN pad below virtual directional pad interface 820.
Continuing with the example in fig. 8A, in response to selecting the down directional button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 830 on the virtual directional keypad 820), the active row of the PIN pad interface 810 may be shifted from a row corresponding to numbers in the range of 1-3 to an adjacent sub-section corresponding to numbers in the range of 4-6. In turn, as shown in FIG. 8B, the virtual directional keypad 820 representing the previously active digit rows in the range of 1-3 in the PIN pad interface 810 may be replaced with rows of digits 1-3, and the newly active digit rows in the range of 4-6 in the PIN pad interface 810 may be replaced with the virtual directional keypad 820. As also shown in fig. 8B, the number "4" has been positioned on the left directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the left directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "4" into the PIN, the number "6" has been positioned on the central select button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the central select button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "6" into the PIN, and the number "7" has been positioned on the right directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 820 to indicate that pressing the right directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "7" into the PIN.
In some implementations, for providing a PIN entry interface including virtual directional pad interface 530 and adjacent PIN pad 540 in fig. 5A-5H, the virtual directional pad interface and PIN pad may be presented in different interfaces. For example, as shown in fig. 9A, an illustrative PIN entry interface 900 may be presented that includes a virtual directional keypad interface 910. More specifically, the number "7" has been positioned on the left directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 910 to indicate that pressing the left directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "7" as the last digit of the PIN, the number "8" has been positioned on the upward directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 910 to indicate that pressing the upward directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "8" as the last digit of the PIN, and the number "9" has been positioned on the right directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 910 to indicate that pressing the right directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs the number "9" as the last digit of the PIN.
Continuing with the example shown in FIG. 9A, a "OK" indicator may be positioned on the center select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 910. In response to selecting a central select button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 920 on the virtual directional keypad 910), the virtual directional keypad interface 910 may be replaced with a PIN keypad interface 930 that indicates numeric characters and/or functional options that are available for selection in the obfuscated PIN entry mode. As also shown in fig. 9B, a highlighting area 940 may be used to indicate which line or section of numeric characters and/or functional options is currently active. By pressing the up and down directional buttons on the remote control, the user can navigate between subsections of numerical characters and/or functional options that can be selected through the virtual directional keyboard interface 910. For example, in response to pressing an up direction button on a directional pad of a remote control, the PIN pad interface 930 is navigated from a row containing numbers in the range of 7-9 to an adjacent row containing numbers in the range of 4-6.
Alternatively, in some implementations, the illustrative PIN entry interface 900 may begin by presenting a PIN pad interface 930, and the user may select a subsection of the PIN pad interface 930 in the PIN pad interface 930 for entering one or more numeric characters. In response to selecting a subsection of PIN pad interface 930, PIN entry interface 900 may be updated to present a corresponding virtual directional pad interface 910 where a user may use a remote control to enter one or more numeric characters into the PIN entry area.
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface including the virtual directional pad interface 530 and the adjacent PIN pad 540 in fig. 5A-5G may alternatively include alternative instructions for navigating between a range of numeric characters and/or functional options for selection. For example, as shown in the PIN entry interface 1000 of fig. 10A, each directional button and central selection button of the remote control may be assigned to enter one of a series of numerical characters. More specifically, as shown in virtual directional pad interface 1010, a number "0" has been positioned on the center select button of virtual directional pad interface 1010 to indicate that pressing the center select button on the directional pad of the remote control inputs a number "0" into the PIN, a number "1" has been positioned on the upward directional button of virtual directional pad interface 1010 to indicate that pressing the upward directional button on the directional pad of the remote control inputs a number "1" into the PIN, a number "2" has been positioned on the rightward directional button of virtual directional pad interface 1010 to indicate that pressing the rightward directional button on the directional pad of the remote control inputs a number "2" into the PIN, a number "3" has been positioned on the downward directional button of virtual directional pad interface 1010 to indicate that pressing the downward directional button on the directional pad of the remote control inputs a number "3" into the PIN, and a number "4" has been positioned on the leftward directional button of virtual directional pad interface 1010 to indicate that pressing the leftward directional button on the directional pad of the remote control inputs a number "4" into the PIN.
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface 1000 may provide a remote control gesture to navigate between a current numeric character in the range of 0-4 to a numeric character in the range of 5-9. For example, as shown in FIG. 10A, notification 1020 may indicate that a press and hold gesture on a right directional arrow on a directional keypad of a remote control causes virtual directional keypad interface 1010 to navigate between numeric characters in the range of 0-4 to numeric characters in the range of 5-9. This is shown, for example, in fig. 10B, where numeric characters in the range of 5-9 are positioned on the directional arrow buttons and center select button of virtual directional keyboard interface 1010. The notification 1040, in turn, may indicate a press and hold gesture on a left directional arrow on the directional keypad of the remote control that causes the virtual directional keypad interface 1010 to navigate back to a numeric character in the range of 0-4.
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface 1000 may provide a remote control gesture to navigate between a current numeric character in the range of 0-4 and one or more function options. For example, as shown in fig. 10A and 10B, notification 1030 may indicate that a press and hold gesture on a central select button of the remote control causes virtual directional keyboard interface 1010 to navigate from entering numeric characters to selecting one or more functional options (e.g., selecting a "forget PIN" operation).
Alternatively, in some embodiments, the PIN entry interface may include alternate instructions for navigating between a range of numeric characters and/or function options for selection, wherein buttons on the remote control may be assigned to perform multiple functions. For example, as shown in PIN entry interface 1100 of fig. 11A, virtual directional keypad interface 1110 may indicate that pressing a central select button of the remote control may navigate from a numeric input range of 0-3 (e.g., the directional buttons assigned to the remote control as shown) to a numeric input range of 4-7 (as shown on the central select button of virtual directional keypad interface 1110). Continuing with this example, in response to pressing the central select button of the remote control, virtual directional keypad interface 1110 may be updated in which number "4" is positioned on the upward directional button of virtual directional keypad interface 1110 to indicate that pressing the upward directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs number "4" into the PIN, number "5" is positioned on the rightward directional button of virtual directional keypad interface 1110 to indicate that pressing the rightward directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs number "5" into the PIN, number "6" is positioned on the downward directional button of virtual directional keypad interface 1110 to indicate that pressing the downward directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs number "6" into the PIN, and number "7" is positioned on the leftward directional button of virtual directional keypad interface 1110 to indicate that pressing the leftward directional button on the directional keypad of the remote control inputs number "7" into the PIN. In addition, the central selection button of the remote control may also be used to access the function options in the confused PIN entry mode. For example, notification 1130 in fig. 11A may indicate that a press and hold gesture on a central select button of the remote control causes virtual directional keyboard interface 1110 to navigate from entering numeric characters to selecting one or more functional options (e.g., selecting a "forget PIN" operation).
Alternatively, in some embodiments, the PIN entry interface may include alternate instructions for navigating between ranges of digital characters and/or functional options for selection, wherein multiple buttons on the remote control may be assigned to access different ranges of digital characters. For example, as shown in the PIN entry interface 1100 of fig. 11B, the virtual directional keypad interface 1110 may indicate that pressing the central select button of the remote control may navigate from a number input range of 8-9 (e.g., assigned to the up and right directional buttons of the remote control as shown) to a number input range of 0-3 (as indicated on the central select button of the virtual directional keypad interface 1110) or to a number input range of 4-7 (e.g., as indicated on the down directional button of the virtual directional keypad interface 1110).
In some implementations, the PIN entry interface may include any suitable number of notifications. For example, as shown in fig. 12, PIN entry interface 1200 may present a plurality of notifications-e.g., notification 1220 indicating that a press and hold gesture applied to a central select button of a remote control may cause a virtual directional keyboard interface to navigate from a current range of numeric characters to an adjacent range of numeric characters; and a notification 1230 indicating that pressing the back button of the remote control causes the last entered PIN number to be deleted. It should be noted that any suitable notification may be provided, such as a notification for switching from an obfuscated PIN entry mode to a different PIN entry mode.
In some embodiments, while the embodiments described herein generally use a highlight region or a highlight character to indicate an active row of a PIN pad, this is merely illustrative and active characters selectable by a remote control may be identified in any suitable manner. For example, as shown in FIG. 13, a slider interface 1320 may be provided in connection with the PIN pad 1310. As shown, slider interface 1320 may include a slider positioning indicator 1330 that indicates which of a plurality of rows is active in PIN pad 1310. Specifically, FIG. 13 indicates that a line including numeric characters in the range of 7-9 is currently active for selection using buttons on the remote control.
As described above, a PIN entry interface including a virtual directional pad interface and an adjacent PIN pad may be used to access one or more functional options. For example, referring back to fig. 5A, in response to selection of an up direction button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 1440 on the virtual directional keypad interface 1430 in fig. 14A), the active row of PIN keypad 1410 highlighted with highlight region 1420 may change from a row corresponding to numbers in the range of 1-3 to a function option to reset the PIN associated with the user account (e.g., a "forget PIN" operation shown by highlight region 1420 in PIN keypad 1410 of fig. 14B). In response to navigating to the "forget PIN" operation as shown in fig. 14B, the virtual directional keypad interface 1430 may be updated wherein a central select button of the remote control is assigned to initiate the "forget PIN" process. Continuing with this example, in response to selecting the central select button of the remote control, the media device may initiate a process that allows the user to reset the PIN associated with the user account. Such processes may include verifying an identity of a user associated with the user account, providing alternative information for authenticating the user account, and so forth.
The remote control may select any other suitable functional option in combination with the obfuscated PIN typing mode.
For example, as shown in fig. 15A and 15B, a function option may be provided in which a user of the remote control may switch from a first user account to a second user account. In a more specific example, as shown in fig. 15A, a virtual directional keyboard interface 1510 may map the up directional buttons of the remote control to a "switch profile" operation 1520. In response to the user selecting the up direction button of the remote control, the PIN entry interface 1500 may be updated to allow the user to select between different user accounts 1530 shown in fig. 15B. The highlighting area 1540 may be used to indicate which user account may be selected using the remote control (e.g., navigation using a directional keypad and selection using a central select button of the remote control).
In another example, a function option may be provided in which the user may indicate whether a PIN pad is presented in the PIN entry interface. For example, referring back to fig. 5A, in response to selection of an up direction button of the remote control (as indicated by the label 1640 on the virtual directional keypad interface 1630 in fig. 16A), the active row of PIN pads 1610 highlighted with highlight region 1620 may be changed from a row corresponding to numbers in the range of 1-3 to a functional option to hide the keypad presented in PIN pads 1610 (e.g., a "hide keypad" operation shown by highlight region 1620 in PIN pads 1610 of fig. 16B). In response to navigating to the "hidden keypad" operation as shown in fig. 16B, virtual directional keypad interface 1630 may be updated, wherein a central select button of the remote control is assigned to initiate the "hidden keypad" process. Continuing with this example, in response to selecting the central select button of the remote control, the media device may initiate a process that inhibits the presentation of PIN pad 1610 in PIN entry interface 1600.
Alternatively, in response to selecting a central selection button of the remote control, the media device may initiate a process of switching the confused PIN entry mode to a different PIN entry mode, such as PIN entry interface 1700 of fig. 17 that includes keypad 1710. For example, the keypad 1710 may indicate that each entered PIN number is selected from the keypad 1710. Continuing with this example, in response to selecting the "hidden keypad" operation 1720, the media device may change the PIN entry mode in which PIN entry interface 1700 is presented to the obfuscated PIN entry mode mentioned above.
Additionally or alternatively to presenting the function options in the virtual directional keypad interface, in some implementations the virtual directional keypad interface may include an option to access a plurality of function options for use in conjunction with the obfuscated PIN entry mode. For example, as shown in fig. 18A, in response to selecting an up directional button of the remote control (as indicated by "more options" 1820 on virtual directional keyboard interface 1810 in fig. 18A), virtual directional keyboard interface 1810 and other interface elements may be replaced with a plurality of functional options 1830. These function options 1830 may include, for example: an operation to display or hide a PIN pad, an operation to switch between a confused PIN entry mode and another PIN entry mode, an operation to allow a user associated with a user account to reset a PIN, an operation to allow a user of a remote control to switch from one user account to another user account, and the like.
Where the systems described herein collect personal information about a user or use personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location). In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways to remove personal information before it is stored or used. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be summarized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and/or used by the content server.
Accordingly, systems, methods, and media for obfuscated personal identification number typing on a media device are provided.
In some implementations, any suitable computer readable medium may be used to store instructions for performing the processes described herein. For example, in some implementations, the computer readable medium may be transitory or non-transitory. For example, non-transitory computer-readable media may include media such as non-transitory forms of magnetic media (such as hard disks, floppy disks, etc.), non-transitory forms of optical media (such as compact disks, digital video disks, blu-ray disks, etc.), non-transitory forms of semiconductor media (such as flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) in non-transitory form, etc.), any suitable media that does not evanescent or lack any persistent appearance during transmission, and/or any suitable tangible media. As another example, a transitory computer-readable medium may include a signal on a network, a wire, a conductor, an optical fiber, a signal in a circuit, any suitable medium that is evanescent during transmission and lacks any persistent appearance, and/or any suitable intangible medium.
It should be understood that the steps of the process described above in connection with fig. 3 may be implemented or performed in any order or sequence, and are not limited to the order and sequence shown and described in the figures. Furthermore, some of the above-described steps of the process of fig. 3 may be performed or executed substantially simultaneously or in parallel, where appropriate, to reduce latency and processing time.
It should also be noted that the term mechanism, as used herein, may encompass hardware, software, firmware, or any suitable combination thereof.
While the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes in detail of the embodiments of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the appended claims. The features of the disclosed embodiments can be combined and rearranged in various ways.
