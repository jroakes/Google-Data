- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of a process for receiving and responding to requests for review summaries, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the reviews engine 106 collects and stores reviews submitted to document hosts 104 , as well as reviews submitted to the reviews engine 106 by users. Users may request from the reviews engine reviews information for a subject, such as a product, service, or provider, through a client 102 . For example, the user may click on a link, in a web page displayed on client 102 , which triggers transmission of a request to the reviews engine 106 . An exemplary process for handling such a request is described below.
- a user may request, from the reviews engine 106 , a reviews summary for a subject or a class of subjects.
- the reviews engine 106 receives a request from a client 102 for a reviews summary for a subject ( 202 ).
- Reviews for the subject that are stored in the reviews repository 112 are identified ( 204 ).
- a subset of the identified reviews is selected ( 206 ).
- a response including content from the selected subset is generated ( 208 ).
- the response is transmitted to the client 102 ( 210 ).
- the client 102 upon receiving the response, renders the response in a client application, such as a web browser, for presentation to the user.
- the generated response is a document that is transmitted to a client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user.
- the response document may include a review summary for the subject.
- the reviews summary includes information such as the overall rating for the subject, further details of which are described below in relation to FIG. 3 .
- the review summary may also include collective ratings for the subject given by review sources, if available.
- the collective rating, given to the subject by a review source is a rating that is determined by the review source based on the ratings associated with reviews for the subject submitted to that source. How the collective rating is determined may vary by review source, but that is not of concern here. Not all review sources may have a collective rating for the subject due to various reasons. For example, some review sources may decide not to have collective ratings at all, while other review sources may require that the number of ratings for the subject reach a predefined minimum before a collective rating is determined and given. Inclusion of the collective ratings in the reviews summary is optional.
- the reviews summary also includes a reviews sample.
- the reviews sample may include the full contents of at least some of the selected reviews.
- the full content of a review is the entire text of the review.
- the full content of a review is the full video clip of the review.
- the reviews sample may include snippets of at least some of the selected reviews, further details of which are described below, in relation to FIG. 6 . It should be appreciated, however, that in some embodiments the reviews sample may include both the full content of some selected reviews and snippets of other selected reviews.
- the review sample may also include one or more links to the sources of the reviews for which the full contents or snippets are included in the reviews sample.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of a process for selecting representative reviews, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the reviews engine 106 can select a number of reviews for inclusion in a reviews sample of a subject, such that the reviews in the sample are representative of the overall rating for the subject.
- Reviews for a particular subject and the sources of the reviews are identified ( 302 ).
- the reviews may be identified from the reviews repository 112 by searching the reviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with the particular subject.
- the identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the particular subject.
- the collective ratings for the subject are identified from each identified source, if available ( 304 ). For each identified review source, the number of reviews in the corpus that are in the respective source is identified ( 306 ). This is simply a count of how many reviews in the corpus are included in each source.
- the overall rating score is determined for the subject ( 308 ).
- the overall rating score may be a mathematical combination of the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources.
- the overall rating score is a weighted average of the collective ratings. The weights are based on the number of reviews in the corpus that are included in each source. Thus, the collective ratings from sources with more reviews in the corpus are favored in the weighted average.
- OR is the overall rating
- S is the number of review sources that has at least one review in the corpus (i.e., at least one review for the subject) and an aggregated rating for the subject
- r i is the collective rating from source i
- n i is the number of reviews in the corpus that is in source i. If the review sources each use different scales and/or forms for their collective ratings, the collective ratings are first converted and/or normalized to the same scale and form as the scale/form used for the overall rating.
- the overall rating is based on a 1-5 numerical rating scale, and thus the collective ratings are converted and/or normalized to that scale. It should be appreciated, however, that alternative rating scales may be used for the overall rating.
- a rating range in which the overall rating falls is identified ( 310 ).
- a rating scale may be divided into two or more rating ranges. For example, a 1-5 scale may be divided into 3 ranges. A rating between 3.66 and 5, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been positive overall. A rating between 1 and 2.33, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been negative overall. A rating between 2.34 to 3.65, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been mixed overall. As another example, the same 1-5 scale may be divided into four ranges. A rating between 4.1 and 5, inclusive, may indicate an excellent rating. A rating between 3.1 and 4, inclusive, may mean a good rating. A rating between 2.1 to 3, inclusive, may mean a fair rating.
- a rating between 1 and 2, inclusive, may mean a poor rating. It should be appreciated that the rating range examples above are merely exemplary and alternative manners of dividing a rating scale may be used. However, for convenience of explanation, we will discuss the process illustrated in FIG. 3 as if the rating scale was divided into three ranges: a high/positive range, a low/negative range, and a middle/mixed range.
- reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the low range are selected ( 312 ).
- Reviews may be selected on a per source basis or selected from the corpus as a whole. If reviews are selected on a per source basis, up to a first predefined number of reviews associated with ratings in the low range may selected from each source. If the reviews are selected from the corpus as a whole, up to a second predefined number of reviews may be selected from the corpus, without regard to the review source.
- reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the high range and reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the low range are selected (314).
- reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the middle range are selected.
- the reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the corpus as a whole.
- reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the high range are selected (316).
- the reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the set of reviews as a whole.
- additional selection criteria may be included.
- an additional criterion may be that the reviews to be selected do not have objectionable content, such as profanity or sexually explicit content.
- an additional criterion may be that the reviews to be selected must have a reputation-based metric value that exceeds a predefined threshold. More generally, reviews associated with ratings in the rating range into which the overall rating falls and which also satisfies zero or more other predefined criteria may be selected.
- a response including content from the selected reviews is generated ( 318 ).
- the generated response is a document that is transmitted to a client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user.
- the response document includes the review summary for the subject.
- the reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources.
- the reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes at least some of the selected reviews or snippets thereof, as described above.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for selecting high quality reviews, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the reviews engine 106 can select a number of reviews for inclusion in a reviews sample of a subject, such that the reviews include high quality content.
- Reviews for a particular subject and the sources of the reviews are identified ( 402 ).
- the reviews may be identified from the reviews repository 112 by searching the reviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with a particular subject.
- the identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the subject.
- the initially identified reviews are filtered at 402 , or at a later stage of the process, so as to remove any reviews that contain objectionable content.
- a quality score is determined for each identified review ( 404 ).
- the quality score is a measure of the quality of the content of the review.
- the quality score provides a basis for comparing reviews to each other with regard to their quality.
- the quality score may be based on one or more predefined factors.
- the predefined factors include the length of the review, the lengths of sentences in the review, values associated with words in the review, and grammatical quality of the review.
- a sub-score may be determined for a review based on each factor and the sub-scores combined to determine the quality score for the review. It should be appreciated, however, that additional and/or alternative factors may be included.
- reviews that have proper grammar and capitalization are favored.
- reviews with “proper” grammar and capitalization get higher sub-scores for this factor.
- Reviews with poor grammar and improper capitalization tend to be less readable.
- reviews that are entirely in uppercase are often considered to be rude.
- detection of sentences in a review may be based on a detection of sentence delimiters, such as periods in the review.
- reviews may be evaluated for adherence to additional indication of grammatical quality, such as subject-verb agreement, absence of run-on sentences or fragments, and so forth.
- evaluation of the grammar and capitalization of a review may be performed with the aid of a grammar checker, which is well known in the art and need not be further described.
- the review length may be based on a word count. In some other embodiments, the review length may be based on a character count or a sentence count.
- the review length sub-score may be based on a difference between the length of the review and a predefined “optimal” review length.
- lengths of the sentences in the reviews may also be considered.
- the reviews engine may prefer sentences of “reasonable” length, rather than extremely long or short sentences.
- a sentence length sub-score for a review may be based on the average of the differences between the lengths of the sentences in the review and a predefined “optimal” sentence length.
- the word values are based on the inverse document frequency (IDF) values associated with the words. Words with high IDF values are generally considered to be more “valuable.”
- the IDF of a word is based on the number of texts in a set of texts, divided by the number of texts in the set that includes at least one occurrence of the word.
- the reviews engine 106 may determine the IDF values across reviews in the reviews repository 112 and store the values in one or more tables.
- tables of IDF values are generated for reviews of each type. For example, a table of IDF values is generated for all product reviews; a table is generated for all product provider reviews, and so forth.
- the set of texts used for determining the table of IDF values for product reviews are all product reviews in the reviews repository 112 ; the set of texts used for determining the table of IDF values for product provider reviews are all product provider reviews in the reviews repository 112 , and so forth.
- Each subject type has its own IDF values table because words that are valuable in reviews for one subject type may not be as valuable in reviews for another subject type.
- a frequency for each distinct word in the review is determined and multiplied by the IDF for that word.
- WV R is the word value sub-score for review R
- f w,R is the number of occurrences (term frequency, or “TF”) of distinct word w in review R
- log IDF w is the logarithm of the IDF value for word w.
- the IDF values for words w are taken from a table of IDF values appropriate for the subject type of the review. For example, if the subject of review R is a product, the IDF w values are taken from the IDF values table for product reviews.
- word values are based on a predefined dictionary of words that are deemed valuable in a reviews context. Separate dictionaries may be defined for different subject types, as different words may be valuable for use in reviews regarding different subject types. For example, there may be a dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a product and another dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a provider. In these embodiments, the word value sub-score may be based on a count of how many of the words in the predefined dictionary are included in the respective review.
- the reviews engine 106 evaluates each identified review based on each predefined factor and determines a sub-score for each factor based on its evaluation.
- Q is the quality score for the review
- F is the number of factors that go into the quality score
- q j is the sub-score for factor j
- weight j is a weight for factor j.
- the weights are all equal to 1, in which case the quality score Q is a sum of the scores for the factors.
- the weights may be defined differently for each factor. In general, the weights may be defined based on the importance of each factor to the quality score and whether a factor is a positive or negative contribution to the quality of the review.
- the age of a review may be considered as a factor in the quality score of a review.
- newer reviews are favored because they are more reflective of recent experience with the review subject, which are more important than experience in the more distant past.
- Bonus points that increase the quality score may be applied to the quality score of a review based on the age of the review. For example, a review that is one day old may get an increase in its quality score (either by addition or multiplication), while a review that is a year old gets no bonus.
- Reviews are selected based on the quality scores ( 406 ).
- the reviews with the highest quality scores are selected. Reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the corpus as a whole. If reviews are selected on a per source basis, a number of the highest scoring reviews for each source are selected. For example, the 10 highest scoring reviews may be selected per source. In some embodiments, the selection is performed by sorting the reviews by quality scores and reviews are taken from the highest scoring reviews until the desired number of reviews has been selected.
- predefined content criteria may also be an additional criterion for selecting reviews.
- the criteria may be defined in order to disfavor reviews with content in the reviews that may offend a user, such as profanity and sexually explicit content; such words and phrases often contribute little or nothing to an understanding of the subject and can make the user who is reading the reviews uncomfortable.
- Evaluation of a review for content meeting predefined criteria may be performed by defining a dictionary of content commonly associated with offensive or objectionable content and matching content in the review against the dictionary. A review that has objectionable content such as profanity or sexually explicit language is eliminated from consideration for selection.
- Evaluation of the content of a review for content meeting the predefined content criteria may be done at during the score determination ( 404 ) or at review selection ( 406 ); when the evaluation is performed is a matter of design choice.
- rating score criteria may be an additional criterion for review selection.
- the process for selecting representative reviews, as described above may be combined with the current process so that the high quality reviews that are representative of the overall rating of the subject are selected.
- reviews that are associated with ratings in the rating range in which the overall rating falls and that have high quality scores may be selected.
- the reviews engine may select the highest scoring (in terms of the quality score) reviews that satisfy zero or more other predefined criteria.
- a response including the selected reviews is generated ( 408 ).
- the generated response is a document that is transmitted to a client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user.
- the response document includes the review summary for the subject.
- the reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources.
- the reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes content from the selected reviews, as described above, in relation to FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process for clustering reviews and selecting reviews from the clusters, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- Reviews for a particular subject are identified ( 502 ).
- the reviews may be identified from the reviews repository 112 by searching the reviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with a particular subject.
- the identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the subject.
- Word value vectors of the reviews are generated ( 504 ).
- the word value vectors include term frequency—inverse document frequency values for words in the reviews.
- Term frequency—inverse document frequency also known as “TF-IDF” or “TFIDF” is a technique for evaluating the importance of words in a document, or in the case of these embodiments, in a review.
- the value of a word with respect to a review increases with the number of times the word appears in the review, but that is offset by the number of reviews in the corpus of reviews that include that word.
- a vector of word values may be generated.
- V n V n ] where v 1 through v n are word values, with respect to review T, of all of the distinct words in the corpus of reviews.
- a word and its related forms are counted together.
- the verb tenses of a verb may be counted as occurrence of the same verb, rather than as distinct words merely because the spelling may be different.
- the reviews in the corpus are organized into clusters based on the word value vectors ( 506 ).
- the word value vectors are embedded in a vector space, in which each word value vector is a “point” in that vector space.
- the “points” may be grouped into one or more clusters using a clustering algorithm.
- One exemplary clustering algorithm is the K-means clustering algorithm.
- the K-means clustering algorithm is well known in the art. However, to facilitate understanding of the disclosed embodiments, the K-means algorithm is described below.
- K-means algorithm an arbitrary number k is predefined. In some embodiments k is a value between 2 and 16, while in some other embodiments k is a value between 2 and 50.
- K random vectors in the vector space of the word value vectors are generated. The k random vectors are the initial centroids for the vector space. Each initial centroid represents the “center” of a cluster. In other words, k initial clusters and their centers are arbitrarily defined.
- Each word value vector is assigned to one of the k clusters based on the similarity (distance) between the respective word value vector and each centroid. A word value vector is assigned to the centroid with which it is most similar (shortest distance).
- the range of values for cosine similarity in these embodiments is between 0 and 1, inclusive (the cosine similarity can never be negative because the word values can never be negative).
- reviews with cosine similarity closer to 1 are more similar (shorter distance), while reviews with cosine similarity closer to 0 are more dissimilar (longer distance).
- alternatives manners of determining the distance or similarity may be used.
- a number of predefined canonical reviews may be used as the initial centroids.
- the canonical reviews are a set of predefined reviews that serve as exemplars of reviews commenting on particular aspects of a subject.
- the set of canonical reviews may vary, depending on what the subject of the corpus of reviews is. For example, the set of canonical reviews for a subject that is a product, which may include canonical reviews for aspects such as ease of use and performance, may be different than the set of canonical reviews for a subject that is a product provider, which may include canonical reviews for aspects such as customer service and shipping timeliness.
- centoids for the k clusters are determined anew. That is, the centroids are re-determined for each cluster.
- the centroid for a cluster may be determined by taking the “average” of the word value vectors in the cluster (not including the initial centroid; the initial centroid is relevant for only the initial cluster assignment).
- the word vector values are reassigned into clusters, this time based on the similarity to the new centroids.
- a word value vector is assigned to the centroid to which it is most similar.
- the iteration of re-determining the centroids and re-assigning the word value vectors repeat. The iteration repeats until a termination condition is met.
- the termination condition is when a convergence criterion is met. The convergence criterion may be that no word value vectors are reassigned to a different cluster after the completion of an iteration. In some other embodiments, the termination condition is that a predefined number of iterations have been performed.
- the sizes of the review clusters are identified ( 508 ). This is simply the number of reviews (represented by the word value vectors, not including the centroid) in each cluster.
- Reviews are selected from each cluster ( 510 ).
- reviews are selected from each cluster in proportion to the cluster sizes.
- a predefined total number of reviews are selected from the corpus of reviews to serve as a sample of the corpus of reviews.
- the reviews in the sample are selected from the clusters in proportion to the sizes of the clusters. The sample would have more reviews selected from a larger cluster than a smaller cluster.
- a cluster that is extremely small for example, less than a predefined number of reviews or less than a predefined percentage of the number of total reviews in the corpus

Abstract
A method and system of selecting reviews for display are described. Reviews for a subject are identified and an overall rating for the subject is determined. A subset of the identified reviews is selected based on the rating range in which the overall rating falls. The selection may also be based on zero or more other predefined criteria. A response that includes content from the selected reviews is generated. The content may include the full content or snippets of at least some of the selected reviews.
Description
- This application is related to the following applications, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference:
- U.S. Patent Application No. to be assigned, “Selecting High Quality Reviews for Display,” filed Sep. 30, 2005, Attorney Docket 060963-5116-US;
- U.S. Patent Application No. to be assigned, “Selecting High Quality Text Within Identified Reviews for Display in Review Snippets,” filed Sep. 30, 2005, Attorney Docket 060963-5117-US;
- U.S. Patent Application No. to be assigned, “Identifying Clusters of Similar Reviews and Displaying Representative Reviews from Multiple Clusters,” filed Sep. 30, 2005, Attorney Docket 060963-5118-US; and

- The disclosed embodiments relate generally to search engines. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods and systems for selection of reviews and content from reviews for presentation.
- Many Internet users research a product or a service before obtaining it. Many Internet users also research a provider of products or services before patronizing that provider. Currently, an approach that many users follow is to use Web sites that provide ratings and reviews for products, services and/or providers thereof. For example, Web sites such as www.pricegrabber.com, www.bizrate.com, and www.resellerratings.com provide ratings and reviews for products and providers thereof.
- To get a holistic view of the reviews and ratings for a product, service, or provider, a user may visit a number of Web sites that provide reviews and ratings and read a number of the ratings and reviews provided by those Web sites. However, this process is fairly time-consuming and cumbersome. Users may be content with a simple summary of the ratings and reviews, in order to avoid spending the time sifting through reviews and ratings on various Web sites.
- Thus, it would be highly desirable to enable users to more efficiently conduct research on the products and services they are interested in obtaining (e.g., by purchase, lease, rental, or other similar transaction) and on the providers of products and services they are interested in patronizing.
- In some embodiments of the invention, a method of processing reviews includes identifying a set of reviews from one or more review sources, determining an overall rating score with respect to the set of reviews, identifying one of a plurality of rating ranges corresponding to the overall rating score, selecting a subset of the reviews based on at least the identified rating range, and generating a response including content from the selected subset.

FIG. 7 illustrates a system for processing reviews, according to some embodiments of the invention. - Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings.
- Users who conduct research on a subject (such as a product, service, or provider thereof) may not want to spend time reading numerous reviews and ratings across several Web sites and may be content with a summary of the reviews and ratings for the subject. The summary may include a sample of reviews for the subject. However, merely choosing reviews at random for inclusion in the sample is not very helpful to the user. The disclose embodiments select reviews for inclusion in a reviews sample based on predefined, non-random criteria and selects text from a review for use in a snippet of the review.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates a network, according to some embodiments of the invention. Thenetwork 100 includes one ormore clients 102, one or more document hosts 104, and areviews engine 106. Thenetwork 100 also includes anetwork 108 that couples these components. - The document hosts 104 store documents and provide access to documents. A document may be any machine-readable data including any combination of text, graphics, multimedia content, etc. In some embodiments, a document may be a combination of text, graphics and possible other forms of information written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), i.e., web pages. A document may include one or more hyperlinks to other documents. A document stored in a
document host 102 may be located and/or identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address, or any other appropriate form of identification and/or location. The document hosts 104 also store reviews submitted to them by users and provide access to the reviews via documents such as web pages. - The
clients 102 include client applications from which users can access documents, such as web pages. In some embodiments, the client applications include a web browser. Examples of web browsers include Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Opera. In some embodiments, users can also submit reviews to documenthosts 104 or thereviews engine 106 via theclients 102. - A review includes content (e.g., comments, evaluation, opinion, etc.) regarding a subject or a class of subjects. In some embodiments, the content is textual. In other embodiments, the content may also include audio, video, or any combination of text, audio, and video.
- The subject of a review is a particular entity or object to which the content in the review provides comments, evaluation, opinion, or the like. In some embodiments, a subject of a review may be classified according to the type of subject. Examples of subject types include products, services, providers of products, providers of services, and so forth. A review may be directed to a class of subjects. A class of subjects includes a plurality of particular entities or objects that share a common trait, characteristic, or feature. For example, a particular product line may be a class of subjects that may be the subject of a review. As another example, all products having a particular brand may be a class of subjects that may be the subject of a review.
- A rating may be associated with a review and stored along with the review. The rating (or “rating score”) represents a score, on a predefined scale, for the subject (or class of subjects) of the review. The format of a rating may be a numerical value or any non-numerical format that can be mapped to a numerical value. For example, the non-numerical thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings may be mapped to binary values 1 or 0, respectively. Examples of forms of ratings include symbolic or descriptive formats (positive/negative, thumbs-up/thumhs-down, and the like) and numerical formats (1-3, 1-5, 1-10, 1-100, and the like). In some embodiments, in addition to the rating, a review may also be associated with sub-ratings for particular aspects of the subject. The sub-ratings may be scores for particular aspects of the subject.
- The
reviews engine 106 includes areviews server 110, areviews repository 112, and areviews collector 114, and adocument repository 116. Thereviews server 110 generates responses that include reviews and/or snippets of reviews for transmission to theclients 102. Thereviews server 110 also provides an interface to users ofclients 102 for the submission of reviews and ratings to thereviews engine 106. - The
reviews collector 114 collects reviews from documents. Thereviews collector 114 parses documents and extracts the reviews, ratings, and other pertinent information (such as authors of the reviews, dates of the reviews, subjects of the reviews, etc.) from the documents. The extracted reviews are transmitted to thereviews repository 112 for storage. The documents from which thereviews collector 114 extracts reviews may be stored in the document hosts 104 and/or thedocument repository 116. - The
document repository 116 is a store of copies of at least a subset of the documents stored in document hosts 104. The documents stored in thedocument repository 116 may be collected from document hosts 104 and stored there by thereviews engine 106. In some embodiments, thedocument repository 116 may be located at a search engine (not shown) that is accessible to thereviews engine 106, and the search engine is responsible for collecting documents from document hosts 104 and storing them in thedocument repository 116. - The reviews stored in the
reviews engine 106 are written by users ofclients 102 and submitted to documenthosts 104 or thereviews engine 106. The reviews that are submitted to documenthosts 104 may be extracted from documents stored at document hosts 104 or copies of the documents that are stored in thedocument repository 116. Reviews may also be submitted to thereviews engine 106 by users. Both reviews extracted from documents and reviews submitted to thereviews engine 106 are transmitted to thereviews repository 112 for storage. - The document hosts 104 or the
reviews engine 106 may provide the ability for users to submit reviews to them. For example, the document hosts 104 or thereviews engine 106 may provide online forms that the users can fill with their reviews and ratings and then submit. The reviews, after submission and storage, may be accessed by other users through documents such as web pages. - The source of a review is the entity to which the review was submitted. The source may be identified by the location and/or identifier of the
document host 104 to which the review was submitted. In some embodiments, the source of a review may be identified by the domain of thedocument host 104 to which the review was submitted. For example, if a review was submitted to a document host under the domain “www.xyz.com,” then the source of the extracted review may be “xyz.com.” In the case of reviews submitted to thereviews engine 106 by users, thereviews engine 106 may be considered as the source. - The
reviews repository 112 stores reviews and associated ratings. Thereviews repository 112, also stores the subject or class of subjects and the subject type (i.e., whether the subject or class of subjects is a product, product provider, etc.) for each review. Thereviews repository 112 may also store the source, the author, and the date for each review. In some embodiments, a review and rating may be associated, in thereviews repository 112, with one or more evaluations of the review and rating itself. An evaluation of the review and rating may evaluate the helpfulness and/or trustworthiness of the review and rating. For example, the evaluation of the review and rating may include a helpful/unhelpful rating. As another example, the review and rating may be associated with a metric value that is based on a measure of the reputation of its author. An example of a reputation-based metric value is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. to be assigned, “Reputation Management,” filed Sep. 30, 2005, Attorney Docket 060963-5119-US, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. - It should be appreciated that each of the components of the
reviews engine 106 may be distributed over multiple computers. For example, thereviews repository 112 may be deployed over M servers, with a mapping function such as the “modulo M” function being used to determine which reviews are stored in each of the M servers. Similarly, thereviews server 110 may be distributed over multiple servers, and thereviews collector 114 and thedocument repository 116 may each be distributed over multiple computers. However, for convenience of explanation, we will discuss the components of thereviews engine 106 as though they were implemented on a single computer. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of a process for receiving and responding to requests for review summaries, according to some embodiments of the invention. Thereviews engine 106, as described above, collects and stores reviews submitted to document hosts 104, as well as reviews submitted to thereviews engine 106 by users. Users may request from the reviews engine reviews information for a subject, such as a product, service, or provider, through aclient 102. For example, the user may click on a link, in a web page displayed onclient 102, which triggers transmission of a request to thereviews engine 106. An exemplary process for handling such a request is described below. - Via
clients 102, a user may request, from thereviews engine 106, a reviews summary for a subject or a class of subjects. Thereviews engine 106 receives a request from aclient 102 for a reviews summary for a subject (202). Reviews for the subject that are stored in thereviews repository 112 are identified (204). A subset of the identified reviews is selected (206). A response including content from the selected subset is generated (208). The response is transmitted to the client 102 (210). Theclient 102, upon receiving the response, renders the response in a client application, such as a web browser, for presentation to the user. - The generated response is a document that is transmitted to a
client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user. The response document may include a review summary for the subject. The reviews summary includes information such as the overall rating for the subject, further details of which are described below in relation toFIG. 3 . The review summary may also include collective ratings for the subject given by review sources, if available. The collective rating, given to the subject by a review source, is a rating that is determined by the review source based on the ratings associated with reviews for the subject submitted to that source. How the collective rating is determined may vary by review source, but that is not of concern here. Not all review sources may have a collective rating for the subject due to various reasons. For example, some review sources may decide not to have collective ratings at all, while other review sources may require that the number of ratings for the subject reach a predefined minimum before a collective rating is determined and given. Inclusion of the collective ratings in the reviews summary is optional. - The reviews summary also includes a reviews sample. In some embodiments, the reviews sample may include the full contents of at least some of the selected reviews. For text-based reviews, the full content of a review is the entire text of the review. For video based reviews, the full content of a review is the full video clip of the review. In some other embodiments, the reviews sample may include snippets of at least some of the selected reviews, further details of which are described below, in relation to
FIG. 6 . It should be appreciated, however, that in some embodiments the reviews sample may include both the full content of some selected reviews and snippets of other selected reviews. The review sample may also include one or more links to the sources of the reviews for which the full contents or snippets are included in the reviews sample. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of a process for selecting representative reviews, according to some embodiments of the invention. Upon receiving a request from a user for a reviews summary for a subject, thereviews engine 106 can select a number of reviews for inclusion in a reviews sample of a subject, such that the reviews in the sample are representative of the overall rating for the subject. - Reviews for a particular subject and the sources of the reviews are identified (302). The reviews may be identified from the
reviews repository 112 by searching thereviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with the particular subject. The identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the particular subject. The collective ratings for the subject are identified from each identified source, if available (304). For each identified review source, the number of reviews in the corpus that are in the respective source is identified (306). This is simply a count of how many reviews in the corpus are included in each source. - An overall rating score is determined for the subject (308). The overall rating score may be a mathematical combination of the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources. In some embodiments, the overall rating score is a weighted average of the collective ratings. The weights are based on the number of reviews in the corpus that are included in each source. Thus, the collective ratings from sources with more reviews in the corpus are favored in the weighted average. An exemplary formula for calculating the overall rating is:
where OR is the overall rating, S is the number of review sources that has at least one review in the corpus (i.e., at least one review for the subject) and an aggregated rating for the subject, ri is the collective rating from source i, and ni is the number of reviews in the corpus that is in source i. If the review sources each use different scales and/or forms for their collective ratings, the collective ratings are first converted and/or normalized to the same scale and form as the scale/form used for the overall rating. In some embodiments, the overall rating is based on a 1-5 numerical rating scale, and thus the collective ratings are converted and/or normalized to that scale. It should be appreciated, however, that alternative rating scales may be used for the overall rating. In some embodiments, the collective ratings are weighted by the logarithms of the numbers of reviews in the corpus that are in each review source, as shown in the formula above. The logarithm may be in any suitable base, such as base 2, base 10, or base e. In some other embodiments, the collective ratings are weighted by the numbers of reviews in the corpus that are in each review source, as shown in the formula: - Upon determining the overall rating, a rating range in which the overall rating falls is identified (310). A rating scale may be divided into two or more rating ranges. For example, a 1-5 scale may be divided into 3 ranges. A rating between 3.66 and 5, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been positive overall. A rating between 1 and 2.33, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been negative overall. A rating between 2.34 to 3.65, inclusive, may indicate that experience with the subject has been mixed overall. As another example, the same 1-5 scale may be divided into four ranges. A rating between 4.1 and 5, inclusive, may indicate an excellent rating. A rating between 3.1 and 4, inclusive, may mean a good rating. A rating between 2.1 to 3, inclusive, may mean a fair rating. A rating between 1 and 2, inclusive, may mean a poor rating. It should be appreciated that the rating range examples above are merely exemplary and alternative manners of dividing a rating scale may be used. However, for convenience of explanation, we will discuss the process illustrated in
FIG. 3 as if the rating scale was divided into three ranges: a high/positive range, a low/negative range, and a middle/mixed range. - If the overall rating falls in the low range (310-low), reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the low range are selected (312). Reviews may be selected on a per source basis or selected from the corpus as a whole. If reviews are selected on a per source basis, up to a first predefined number of reviews associated with ratings in the low range may selected from each source. If the reviews are selected from the corpus as a whole, up to a second predefined number of reviews may be selected from the corpus, without regard to the review source.
- If the overall rating falls in the middle range (310-middle), reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the high range and reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the low range are selected (314). In other words, amongst the selected reviews are reviews associated with ratings in the high range and reviews associated with ratings in the low range. In alternative embodiments, reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the middle range are selected. As described above, the reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the corpus as a whole.
- If the overall rating falls in the high range (310-high), reviews in the corpus that are associated with ratings in the high range are selected (316). As described above, the reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the set of reviews as a whole.
- In some embodiments, additional selection criteria may be included. For example, an additional criterion may be that the reviews to be selected do not have objectionable content, such as profanity or sexually explicit content. As another example, an additional criterion may be that the reviews to be selected must have a reputation-based metric value that exceeds a predefined threshold. More generally, reviews associated with ratings in the rating range into which the overall rating falls and which also satisfies zero or more other predefined criteria may be selected.
- A response including content from the selected reviews is generated (318). The generated response is a document that is transmitted to a
client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user. The response document includes the review summary for the subject. The reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources. The reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes at least some of the selected reviews or snippets thereof, as described above. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for selecting high quality reviews, according to some embodiments of the invention. Upon receiving a request from a user for a reviews summary for a subject, thereviews engine 106 can select a number of reviews for inclusion in a reviews sample of a subject, such that the reviews include high quality content. - Reviews for a particular subject and the sources of the reviews are identified (402). The reviews may be identified from the
reviews repository 112 by searching thereviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with a particular subject. The identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the subject. In some embodiments, the initially identified reviews are filtered at 402, or at a later stage of the process, so as to remove any reviews that contain objectionable content. - A quality score is determined for each identified review (404). The quality score is a measure of the quality of the content of the review. The quality score provides a basis for comparing reviews to each other with regard to their quality. The quality score may be based on one or more predefined factors. In some embodiments, the predefined factors include the length of the review, the lengths of sentences in the review, values associated with words in the review, and grammatical quality of the review. A sub-score may be determined for a review based on each factor and the sub-scores combined to determine the quality score for the review. It should be appreciated, however, that additional and/or alternative factors may be included.
- With regard to the grammatical quality of the review, reviews that have proper grammar and capitalization (e.g., actually use sentences, review not entirely in uppercase) are favored. Thus, reviews with “proper” grammar and capitalization get higher sub-scores for this factor. Reviews with poor grammar and improper capitalization tend to be less readable. Furthermore, reviews that are entirely in uppercase are often considered to be rude. In some embodiments, detection of sentences in a review may be based on a detection of sentence delimiters, such as periods in the review. In some embodiments, reviews may be evaluated for adherence to additional indication of grammatical quality, such as subject-verb agreement, absence of run-on sentences or fragments, and so forth. In some embodiments, evaluation of the grammar and capitalization of a review may be performed with the aid of a grammar checker, which is well known in the art and need not be further described.
- With regard to the length of the review, reviews that are not too long and not too short are favored. Short reviews (e.g., a few words) tend to be uninformative and long reviews (e.g., many paragraphs) tend to be not as readable as a shorter review. In some embodiments, the review length may be based on a word count. In some other embodiments, the review length may be based on a character count or a sentence count. The review length sub-score may be based on a difference between the length of the review and a predefined “optimal” review length.
- In some embodiments, lengths of the sentences in the reviews may also be considered. The reviews engine may prefer sentences of “reasonable” length, rather than extremely long or short sentences. In some embodiments, a sentence length sub-score for a review may be based on the average of the differences between the lengths of the sentences in the review and a predefined “optimal” sentence length.
- With regard to values associated with words in the review, reviews with high value words are favored over reviews with low value words. In some embodiments, the word values are based on the inverse document frequency (IDF) values associated with the words. Words with high IDF values are generally considered to be more “valuable.” The IDF of a word is based on the number of texts in a set of texts, divided by the number of texts in the set that includes at least one occurrence of the word. The
reviews engine 106 may determine the IDF values across reviews in thereviews repository 112 and store the values in one or more tables. In some embodiments, tables of IDF values are generated for reviews of each type. For example, a table of IDF values is generated for all product reviews; a table is generated for all product provider reviews, and so forth. That is, the set of texts used for determining the table of IDF values for product reviews are all product reviews in thereviews repository 112; the set of texts used for determining the table of IDF values for product provider reviews are all product provider reviews in thereviews repository 112, and so forth. Each subject type has its own IDF values table because words that are valuable in reviews for one subject type may not be as valuable in reviews for another subject type. - For any identified review, a frequency for each distinct word in the review is determined and multiplied by the IDF for that word. The word value sub-score for the review is:
where WVR is the word value sub-score for review R,f w,R is the number of occurrences (term frequency, or “TF”) of distinct word w in review R, and log IDFw is the logarithm of the IDF value for word w. The IDF values for words w are taken from a table of IDF values appropriate for the subject type of the review. For example, if the subject of review R is a product, the IDFw values are taken from the IDF values table for product reviews. - In some other embodiments, word values are based on a predefined dictionary of words that are deemed valuable in a reviews context. Separate dictionaries may be defined for different subject types, as different words may be valuable for use in reviews regarding different subject types. For example, there may be a dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a product and another dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a provider. In these embodiments, the word value sub-score may be based on a count of how many of the words in the predefined dictionary are included in the respective review.
- The
reviews engine 106 evaluates each identified review based on each predefined factor and determines a sub-score for each factor based on its evaluation. The sub-scores for each of the factors may be combined into the quality score using the exemplary formula below:
where Q is the quality score for the review, F is the number of factors that go into the quality score, qj is the sub-score for factor j, and weightj is a weight for factor j. In some embodiments, the weights are all equal to 1, in which case the quality score Q is a sum of the scores for the factors. In some other embodiments, the weights may be defined differently for each factor. In general, the weights may be defined based on the importance of each factor to the quality score and whether a factor is a positive or negative contribution to the quality of the review. - In some embodiments, the age of a review may be considered as a factor in the quality score of a review. In general, newer reviews are favored because they are more reflective of recent experience with the review subject, which are more important than experience in the more distant past. Bonus points that increase the quality score may be applied to the quality score of a review based on the age of the review. For example, a review that is one day old may get an increase in its quality score (either by addition or multiplication), while a review that is a year old gets no bonus.
- Reviews are selected based on the quality scores (406). The reviews with the highest quality scores are selected. Reviews may be selected on a per source basis or from the corpus as a whole. If reviews are selected on a per source basis, a number of the highest scoring reviews for each source are selected. For example, the 10 highest scoring reviews may be selected per source. In some embodiments, the selection is performed by sorting the reviews by quality scores and reviews are taken from the highest scoring reviews until the desired number of reviews has been selected.
- In some embodiments, predefined content criteria may also be an additional criterion for selecting reviews. With regard to content meeting predefined criteria, the criteria may be defined in order to disfavor reviews with content in the reviews that may offend a user, such as profanity and sexually explicit content; such words and phrases often contribute little or nothing to an understanding of the subject and can make the user who is reading the reviews uncomfortable. Evaluation of a review for content meeting predefined criteria may be performed by defining a dictionary of content commonly associated with offensive or objectionable content and matching content in the review against the dictionary. A review that has objectionable content such as profanity or sexually explicit language is eliminated from consideration for selection. Evaluation of the content of a review for content meeting the predefined content criteria may be done at during the score determination (404) or at review selection (406); when the evaluation is performed is a matter of design choice.
- In some embodiments, rating score criteria may be an additional criterion for review selection. For example, the process for selecting representative reviews, as described above may be combined with the current process so that the high quality reviews that are representative of the overall rating of the subject are selected. Thus, reviews that are associated with ratings in the rating range in which the overall rating falls and that have high quality scores may be selected.
- It should be appreciated that the additional criteria described above are merely exemplary and that any combination of the above criteria and other criteria may be additional considerations for review selection. More generally, the reviews engine may select the highest scoring (in terms of the quality score) reviews that satisfy zero or more other predefined criteria.
- A response including the selected reviews is generated (408). The generated response is a document that is transmitted to a
client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user. The response document includes the review summary for the subject. The reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources. The reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes content from the selected reviews, as described above, in relation toFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process for clustering reviews and selecting reviews from the clusters, according to some embodiments of the invention. Reviews for a particular subject are identified (502). The reviews may be identified from thereviews repository 112 by searching thereviews repository 112 for all reviews associated with a particular subject. The identified reviews form a corpus of reviews for the subject. - Word value vectors of the reviews are generated (504). The word value vectors include term frequency—inverse document frequency values for words in the reviews. Term frequency—inverse document frequency (also known as “TF-IDF” or “TFIDF”) is a technique for evaluating the importance of words in a document, or in the case of these embodiments, in a review. The value of a word with respect to a review increases with the number of times the word appears in the review, but that is offset by the number of reviews in the corpus of reviews that include that word. For any review of a corpus of identified reviews, a vector of word values may be generated. For example, a review R may have the weighting vector:
R=[V1 V2 V3 . . . Vn ]
where v1 through vn are word values, with respect to review T, of all of the distinct words in the corpus of reviews. In some embodiments, a word and its related forms are counted together. For example, the verb tenses of a verb may be counted as occurrence of the same verb, rather than as distinct words merely because the spelling may be different. - A value of a word w with respect to a review R may be determined by the exemplary formula:
Vw,R=ƒw,R log IDFw
where Vw,R is the value of a word w with respect to review R,fw,R is the number of occurrences of word w within review R (the term frequency), and log IDFw is the logarithm of the IDF value for word w, as described above. If review R does not have word w (fw,R=0), the word value Vw,R is 0. Word value Vw,R can never be negative, as fw,R≧0 (number of occurrences are never negative) and log IDFw>0. - Upon generation of word value vectors for each review in the corpus, the reviews in the corpus are organized into clusters based on the word value vectors (506). The word value vectors are embedded in a vector space, in which each word value vector is a “point” in that vector space. The “points” may be grouped into one or more clusters using a clustering algorithm. One exemplary clustering algorithm is the K-means clustering algorithm. The K-means clustering algorithm is well known in the art. However, to facilitate understanding of the disclosed embodiments, the K-means algorithm is described below.
- The following pseudocode illustrates the basic steps of the K-means algorithm:
Randomly generate k centroids associated with k clusters Assign each vector to one of the k clusters Repeat until termination condition met: Re-determine cluster centroids Reassign each vector to a cluster - In the K-means algorithm, an arbitrary number k is predefined. In some embodiments k is a value between 2 and 16, while in some other embodiments k is a value between 2 and 50. K random vectors in the vector space of the word value vectors are generated. The k random vectors are the initial centroids for the vector space. Each initial centroid represents the “center” of a cluster. In other words, k initial clusters and their centers are arbitrarily defined. Each word value vector is assigned to one of the k clusters based on the similarity (distance) between the respective word value vector and each centroid. A word value vector is assigned to the centroid with which it is most similar (shortest distance).
- In some embodiments, the similarity (distance) between a word value vector and a centroid is the cosine similarity (also known as “cosine distance”):
where X * Y is the dot product of vectors X and Y, ∥X∥×∥Y∥ is the length of vector X times the length of vector Y, and cos θ is the cosine similarity. If vectors X and Y are exactly the same, the cosine similarity value is 1. The range of values for cosine similarity in these embodiments is between 0 and 1, inclusive (the cosine similarity can never be negative because the word values can never be negative). Thus, reviews with cosine similarity closer to 1 are more similar (shorter distance), while reviews with cosine similarity closer to 0 are more dissimilar (longer distance). In some other embodiments, alternatives manners of determining the distance or similarity may be used. - In some embodiments, a number of predefined canonical reviews may be used as the initial centroids. The canonical reviews are a set of predefined reviews that serve as exemplars of reviews commenting on particular aspects of a subject. The set of canonical reviews may vary, depending on what the subject of the corpus of reviews is. For example, the set of canonical reviews for a subject that is a product, which may include canonical reviews for aspects such as ease of use and performance, may be different than the set of canonical reviews for a subject that is a product provider, which may include canonical reviews for aspects such as customer service and shipping timeliness.
- After the word value vectors are assigned to the k clusters, centroids for the k clusters are determined anew. That is, the centroids are re-determined for each cluster. The centroid for a cluster may be determined by taking the “average” of the word value vectors in the cluster (not including the initial centroid; the initial centroid is relevant for only the initial cluster assignment). The formula for determining a centroid C is:
where CS is the size of the cluster (number of word value vectors in the cluster), and Vi are normalized (converted to vectors of unit length) vectors of the word value vectors in the cluster. - Upon determination of the new centroids, the word vector values are reassigned into clusters, this time based on the similarity to the new centroids. A word value vector is assigned to the centroid to which it is most similar. After each word value vector is reassigned to a cluster, the iteration of re-determining the centroids and re-assigning the word value vectors repeat. The iteration repeats until a termination condition is met. In some embodiments, the termination condition is when a convergence criterion is met. The convergence criterion may be that no word value vectors are reassigned to a different cluster after the completion of an iteration. In some other embodiments, the termination condition is that a predefined number of iterations have been performed.
- It should be appreciated that alternative manners of clustering, such as hierarchal clustering, the fuzzy c-means algorithm, and others, may be used.
- Upon grouping the reviews into clusters, the sizes of the review clusters are identified (508). This is simply the number of reviews (represented by the word value vectors, not including the centroid) in each cluster.
- Reviews are selected from each cluster (510). In some embodiments, reviews are selected from each cluster in proportion to the cluster sizes. A predefined total number of reviews are selected from the corpus of reviews to serve as a sample of the corpus of reviews. The reviews in the sample are selected from the clusters in proportion to the sizes of the clusters. The sample would have more reviews selected from a larger cluster than a smaller cluster. In some embodiments, a cluster that is extremely small (for example, less than a predefined number of reviews or less than a predefined percentage of the number of total reviews in the corpus) may be excluded from the review selection; no review from that cluster will be selected for inclusion in the sample. If a cluster is excluded, then one or more reviews may be selected from other clusters so that the number of reviews in the sample reaches the predefined total number.
- In some embodiments, reviews may be selected from a cluster based on additional predefined criteria. For example, reviews may be selected from a cluster based on the quality of the reviews, as described above, in relation to
FIG. 4 . Reviews of high quality are generally more informative and easier to read than reviews of low quality. Thus, for example, if 10 reviews are to be selected from a cluster, then with the additional quality criterion, the 10 highest quality reviews from that cluster may be selected. As another example, reviews may be selected from a cluster based on the ratings associated with the reviews, such as the selection process described above, in relation toFIG. 3 . More generally, as long as a cluster contributes to the review sample a number of reviews that is proportional to the cluster size, reviews from that cluster may be selected based on zero or more predefined criteria. - A response that includes the selected reviews is generated (512). The generated response is a document that is transmitted to a
client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user. The response document includes the review summary for the subject. The reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources. The reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes content from the selected reviews, as described above, in relation toFIG. 2 . - By clustering reviews and selecting reviews from the clusters, a review sample that is representative of the topical focus of the reviews is selected. Clustering helps the reviews engine identify reviews that focus on particular aspects of a subject. By separating the reviews by the aspect upon which the review focuses (into the clusters) and selecting reviews from the clusters for inclusion in a reviews sample, a user, upon being shown the reviews sample, can get a better understanding of which aspects of the subject are particularly noteworthy or were of particular concern to other users who have had experience with the subject.
-
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a process for generating a snippet from high quality content within a review, according to some embodiments of the invention. To save time, a user may prefer to read only parts of reviews rather than the full content of reviews. The reviews engine may select particular content within reviews for inclusion in the reviews sample as review snippets. - A review is identified (602). The identified review is divided into partitions (604). In some embodiments, the partitions are the sentences of the review. That is, each sentence of the review is a partition of the review. Sentences in the review may be identified based on sentence delimiters such as periods. It may be the case that a review may only have one partition, such as when the review has only one sentence. For convenience of explanation, the process of
FIG. 5 will be described below as if the partitions of reviews are the sentences of the reviews. It should be appreciated, however, that alternative manners of partitioning a review (such as partitions of Z words, where Z is a predefined whole number) may be used. - A quality score is determined for each sentence of the review (606). The quality score for a review sentence is similar to the quality score for a review, as described above in relation to
FIG. 4 . The sentence quality score provides a basis for a relative ordering of the sentences of a review with regard to their quality. The quality score may be based on one or more factors. A sub-score may be determined based on each of the factors. The sub-scores may be combined into the quality score for a sentence, using the weighted sum equation similar to that described in relation toFIG. 3 above. In some embodiments, the predefined factors include the length of the sentence, values associated with words in the sentence, and the position of the sentence within the review. - With regard to the length of a review sentence, sentences that are not too long and not too short (i.e., sentence of “reasonable length”) are favored. Extremely short sentences may not include much information and extremely long sentences may be difficult to read. In some embodiments, a sub-score based on sentence length may be based on the deviation of the sentences in the review from a predefined “optimal” sentence length. The sentence length may be based on a word count or a character count.
- With regard to values associated with words in the sentence, sentences with high value words are favored over sentences with low value words. In some embodiments, the word values are based on the inverse document frequency (IDF) values associated with the words, similar to the word value factor used in scoring reviews, described above in relation to
FIG. 4 . For a sentence, a frequency for each distinct word in the sentence is determined and multiplied by the IDF for that word. The word value sub-score for the review is:
where WVp is the word value sub-score for sentence P,fw,p is the number of occurrences of word w in sentence P, and log IDFw is the logarithm of the IDF value for word w. - In some other embodiments, word values are based on a predefined dictionary of words that are deemed valuable in a reviews context. Separate dictionaries may be defined for different subject types, as different words may be valuable for use in reviews regarding different subject types. For example, there may be a dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a product and another dictionary of valuable words for reviews where the subject is a provider. In these embodiments, the word value sub-score may be based on a count of how many of the words in the predefined dictionary are included in the respective sentence.
- With regard to the position of the sentence within the review, in some embodiments the reviews engine may favor sentences that occur in the beginning of the review. Thus, a sub-score based on position may be based on the position of the sentence in the review, normalized for the number of sentences in the review. For example, for the 4th sentence of a review with 10 sentences, the position sub-score for that sentence may be 4/10=0.2.
- Upon determination of the sub-scores for a sentence, the sub-scores may be mathematically combined into a quality score for the sentence, using the formula similar to that described above, in relation to
FIG. 4 . - Combinations of the review sentences are identified (608). Each combination includes one or more consecutive sentences of the review that satisfies predefined length criteria. In some embodiments, the length criteria are that the length of the combination is equal to a predefined maximum snippet length (which may be based on a word count or a character count) or exceeds the maximum snippet length by a portion of the last sentence in the combination. An exemplary algorithm for identifying the combinations is illustrated by the pseudocode below:
For each sentence i in the review: integer j = i combination i = sentence j while (length(combination i) < max_snippet_length) combination i = combination i + sentence (++j)
As illustrated in the pseudocode above, the combination starts out as one sentence in the review, and subsequent sentences are appended to the combination, up to and including the first sentence that makes the length of the combination equal to or greater than the maximum snippet length. Thus, a combination is a concatenation of as many consecutive sentences of the review as possible without making the length of the combination exceed the maximum snippet length, plus possibly one additional sentence that, when added to the combination, makes the length of the combination equal to or greater than the maximum snippet length. - In some other embodiments, the algorithm may be refined to also consider how much of the sentence to be appended will be within the maximum snippet length, i.e., how much “space” remains in the combination to accommodate an additional sentence. For example, it may be more worthwhile to not append an additional sentence to a combination when the combination is only one or two words short of the maximum snippet length.
- A combination with the highest combined quality score is selected (610). In some embodiments, the combined quality score for a combination is a simple sum of the quality scores of the sentences within the combination. In some other embodiments, the combined quality score may be a weighted sum, simple average, or weighted average of the quality scores of the sentences within the combination.
- A snippet is generated using the selected combination (612). The snippet includes the selected combination, up to the maximum snippet length. If the combination exceeds the maximum snippet length, content is truncated from the end of the combination until the length of the combination is equal to the maximum snippet length. In some embodiments, the combination may be truncated to be shorter than the maximum snippet length if only a small part (e.g., one or two words) of the last sentence in the combination remains after the truncation to the maximum snippet length. In other words, it may be more worthwhile to truncate by removing the last sentence in the combination if only a few words of that sentence will remain after truncating the combination to the maximum snippet length.
- A response including the snippet is generated (614). The generated response is a document that is transmitted to a
client 102 for rendering and presentation to a user. The response document includes the review summary for the subject. The reviews summary may include information such as the overall rating for the subject and optionally the collective ratings for the subject given by the review sources. The reviews summary also includes the reviews sample, which includes content from the selected reviews, as described above, in relation toFIG. 2 . -
Reviews engine 106 selects reviews from its reviews repository and generates a response including content from the selected reviews (such as full reviews and/or snippets) for transmission to aclient 102.FIGS. 3, 4 , and 5 illustrate three processes for selecting reviews for the sample.FIG. 6 illustrates a process for generating a snippet of a review, which may be a review selected in the processes ofFIGS. 3, 4 , and/or 5. It should be appreciated that the processes above may be combined. For example, thereviews engine 106 may select a number of reviews that correspond to the rating range into which the overall score falls and have high quality scores. As another example, thereviews engine 106 may cluster reviews for a subject and select from each cluster, in proportion to the cluster sizes, reviews that correspond to the rating range into which the overall score falls and have high quality scores. Snippets of these selected reviews are generated and a response including the snippets is generated. More generally, reviews may be selected based on one or more predefined criteria and snippets of these reviews may be generated and included in a response sent to theclient 102. -

In some embodiments,
memory 712 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore,memory 712 may store additional modules and data structures not described above. - Although
FIG. 7 shows a “reviews processing system,”FIG. 7 is intended more as functional description of the various features which may be present in a set of servers than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately inFIG. 7 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. The actual number of servers used to implement a reviews processing system and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods. - It should be appreciated that the description above are not limited in their application to reviews that are purely textual, i.e., consisting of strings of characters. The description is capable of adaptation to reviews that includes audio, video, or other forms of media. For example, for a review that includes audio (such as audio-only reviews or a video reviews with an audio track), the audio may be converted to text using speech to text conversion, which are well known in the art. The converted text may be used as the “review” for the selection and snippet generation processes described above. The snippet of an audio or video review would the portion of the audio or video that has the speech with the words that were selected for a snippet based on the converted text of the review. If review quality is a criterion for selecting audio/video reviews, the grammatical quality factor may be adapted for the medium. For example, capitalization is not very relevant when the content of the review is verbal rather than textual, and thus can be disregarded.
- The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
