- the environment control system 140 would include various other components for controlling other environmental factors within the predefined area, such as a humidifier or de-humidifier for controlling the humidity, a control for the building's lighting and sound system, etc.
- the personal area network 100 resides in an office building environment, and the base stations 110 are strategically deployed within the areas of the office building to provide continuous radio communication coverage throughout.
- the base stations 110 may be deployed in conference rooms, work areas, corridors, etc. of the office building, thus creating multi-zoned radio communications coverage areas throughout the building.
- the portable communication units 125 may maintain continuous communication between these coverage areas by conventional handoff techniques that are well established in the art.
- the personal area network 100 may alternatively be deployed in a home environment, for example or various other environments, and, thus, need not be limited to an office environment as provided in the illustrated embodiment.
- the network controller 105 tracks the location of the users within the network 100 based upon the base station 110 with which their associated portable communication unit 125 is communicating.
- Each portable communication unit 125 has stored therein an environmental preference profile, which includes the network user's preferences for environmental conditions within the predefined area within which the network user is located.
- the environmental conditions may include temperature setting, light intensity, sound level, etc. within the predefined area in which the user is present.
- the network controller 105 determines an optimal environmental control setting based upon the preferences transmitted from the plurality of users.
- the network controller 105 determines the presence of the users within the conference room, obtains their preferences for environmental conditions within the room, such as temperature setting, for example, and formulates an optimal temperature setting for the conference room based on the various temperature setting preferences from all those users present within the conference room. The network controller 105 then forwards a signal to the environment control system 140 to have the optimal temperature set in the conference room of the building.
- the portable communication unit 125 is a wireless PDA or a cell phone in the illustrated embodiment; however, it may take the form of various other wireless communications devices, such as a pager, radiotelephone, or the like.
- the portable communication unit 125 includes a radio transceiver 205 that is adapted to communicate over the RF link 120 with the base station 110 .
- the radio transceiver 205 may be either supplemented or replaced with appropriate circuitry to support an alternative communication medium between the portable communication unit 125 and the base station 110 .
- the radio transceiver 205 is coupled to a processor unit 210 , which controls the overall operation of the portable communication unit 125 .
- a user interface 215 is also coupled to the processor unit 210 to enable user control of the communication unit 125 .
- the user interface 215 includes a display 220 and a keypad 225 to enable user interaction with the portable communication unit 125 .
- a memory 230 is also coupled to the processor 210 to store various software programs needed by the processor or various data related to the user of the communication unit 125 .
- the memory 230 stores a user's environmental preferences 235 , which define the user's preferred environmental conditions within or without the predefined area in which the user is present.
- the environmental preferences 235 may be programmed into the memory 230 via the user interface 215 , for example.
- the portable communication device 125 may optionally be configured with an environmental sensor 240 , which may include light, sound, or temperature sensors 245 , 250 , 255 to monitor the current lighting, sound or temperature conditions in the vicinity of the portable communication unit 125 within the predefined area.
- the current environmental conditions ascertained by the portable communication unit 125 may then be transmitted to the network controller 105 as an indication of current environmental conditions within the predefined area. It will be appreciated that various other types of sensors relating to environmental conditions within the predefined area may also be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- the environmental preferences 235 indicate the network user's preference for the environmental conditions of the predefined area in which he or she is present.
- the user preferences 235 may include a temperature setting 305 in which the user of the portable communication unit 125 desires the area (e.g., a conference room) to be set to.
- the user's preferred temperature setting may be 65° F., which would be indicated in the temperature setting field 305 of that particular user's portable communication unit 125 .
- the temperature may be controlled differently within various sections of a large room depending on which section within the room a particular user is located.
- a large room accommodating 300 or more people may be divided into six different heating/air conditioning zones.
- the network controller 105 may be configured to determine a different temperature setting for each zone within the room based on the users' preferences within each individual zone. Finding the location of a particular user within a building and/or a section of a room is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of location finding techniques known in the art include signal strength comparisons to detect a specific user's proximity to a particular base station 110 , the use of directional antennas to determine the angle of arrival of the signal etc.
- the user may also desire to indicate a preferred room humidity setting 310 , and preferred lighting conditions 315 within the predefined area, such as interior lighting intensity, which may be indicated as a low, medium or high intensity, for example.
- the user may also indicate the amount of natural light desired, in which case curtains or blinds of a room with windows may be controlled in accordance with the user's natural light preference. That is, if the network user prefers more natural light in a room, the room's curtains or blinds may be automatically opened when the network controller 105 determines that the user is present within the room.
- the controller 105 may also be configured to determine when certain preferences are irrelevant or inappropriate, such as the desire for natural light when it is during evening hours (i.e., when it is dark outside).
- a sound field 330 may also be provided in the environmental preferences 235 indicating the sound level in which announcements and/or background music is desired (e.g., low, medium or high volume or on a scale from one to ten, with one being the lowest volume and ten being the highest).
- the sound field 330 may provide an indication for the sound level of emergency announcements, specific verbal instructions, or alarms within the predefined area.
- a handicap field 340 may also be provided to indicate whether the user of the portable communication unit 125 is hearing, visually, or physically impaired. For example, if the user is visually impaired, a heavier weight may be placed on the user's lighting preferences than that of other users who are not visually impaired. Alternatively, a blind person would not be given any consideration. Likewise, those users indicating that they are hearing impaired may also be given a heavier emphasis on their sound preferences within the predefined area.
- the network controller 105 may be further configured to ignore the preferences from other users that are located within the same space as a handicap individual, for example.
- the handicap field 340 may also be used to indicate various medical conditions of the individual, such as a heart condition, for example.
- the handicap field 340 may also be used to direct security, medical, or other personnel within the building to assist with the special needs of the handicap individual. For example, if a handicapped individual who is hearing impaired is scheduled to attend a meeting in a conference room, the handicap field 340 may be used to apprise building personal that there is a need for a special hearing device in the conference room for that individual, or a sign language interpreter, etc.
- the user preferences 235 may also indicate a foreign language type field 350 , which may indicate the user's language preference.
- the language type field 350 may even further indicate if it is the only language spoken by the user. For example, if the user indicates that he or she only speaks Spanish, announcements made over the public address (PA) system, for example, that are usually only provided in English may be followed with a Spanish translation, providing that a Spanish-only speaking individual is present within the predefined area.
- PA public address
- the user's environmental preferences 235 may include various other parameters (in addition to the examples provided) that are appropriate for controlling the environmental conditions of the predefined area in which the user is located.
- the user's preferences 235 may include different types of services that are to be supplied to individuals within the predefined area, such as the types of snacks and/or beverages an individual desires to be served at a meeting.
- the user preferences 235 may also include in addition to desired food or beverage types, preferences for types of entertainment, favorite television shows, images to be displayed in the area (e.g., a decoration or cultural symbol), types of music, favorite radio stations, languages spoken, religion, political preferences, or other specific likes or dislikes.
- the user preferences 235 may also include other information on the individual in addition to his or her preferences.
- the age, gender, marital status, allergies or sensitivities to certain items within the predefined area e.g., allergies to perfume
- medical conditions e.g., medical conditions, and various other personal attributes or preferences of the individual that may pertain to a specific location and/or event attended may be individual.
- preferences 235 may apply to several different environments. For example, if the network 100 is deployed in a family's home, one user preference may be to mute the television sound when the telephone rings or the doorbell rings.
- the environmental preferences 235 for each portable communication unit 125 user may further be provided with a weighting factor field 360 , which may be used to weight the preferences of one user in relation to other users located within the same space of the network 100 .
- a corporation's senior executive may be provided with the highest weighting factor of five, for example, while a low ranking employee may be given a weighting factor of one.
- Other types of weighting factors 360 may be based on a job code, a company employee number, etc. in which the network controller 105 may convert the job code or employee number to a weighting factor (e.g., on a scale from one to five).
- a weighting factor may be taken into account when considering the network user's age. For example, an elderly person's preference may be given more weight by the network controller 105 for temperature setting, lighting and sound conditions within a given area.
- the network controller 105 includes a base processing system 405 that comprises a process controller 410 , which controls the overall operation of the personal area network 100 .
- the network controller 105 also includes a base station interface 420 , which permits communication between the base stations 110 that are distributed throughout the building and the network controller 105 .
- the base processing system 405 is also coupled to a PSTN interface 425 , which enables connection to the PSTN 130 , and is also coupled to an environment control system interface 430 for connection to the environment control system 140 of the physical space in which the network 100 is deployed.
- a memory 415 is also coupled to the process controller 410 of the base processing system 405 .
- the memory 415 includes a user database 440 for maintaining information on the subscribers/users of the personal area network 100 .
- the information provided in the user database 440 may include information for registration and authentication of the wireless portable communication units 125 associated with each user within the personal area network 100 .
- the memory 415 also includes a user location database 445 , which maintains current location information for each portable communication unit 125 associated with the users registered within the personal area network 100 .
- the base stations 110 may be configured to transmit a polling signal to the portable communication units 125 present within the base stations' coverage areas at predetermined intervals, such as every five minutes, for example.
- the portable communication units 125 that are present within a particular base station's coverage area transmit an identification signal to the base station 110 , thereby identifying their location within the network 100 within the coverage area of the particular base station 10 .
- the users environmental preferences 235 are transmitted to the network controller 105 (via the base station 110 ) with the identification signal.
- each user's environmental preferences 235 may be alternatively stored within the network controller's memory 415 and cross-referenced with the identification of the user's: portable communication unit 125 .
- the process controller 410 may retrieve the user's environmental preferences 235 from the memory 415 based upon the identifier sent by the portable communication unit 125 .
- the memory 415 further includes building control system specifications and data 450 , which provides information on the building's environmental control systems in which the personal area network 100 is installed.
- the building control system specifications and data 450 also provides information as to which base station coverage areas within the building correspond to the various control zones of the building control system. For example, the control system specifications and data 450 will enable the process controller 410 to determine the heating and air conditioning control zone for a particular conference room within the building based on the base stations 110 with which the portable communication units 125 are communicating.
- the specifications 450 may also establish operational limits within which the network controller 105 is required to stay. For example, there may be certain temperature ranges in which it is not economically feasible to run the building's air conditioning or heating system. That is, a lower limit of 65° F. and an upper limit of 75° F. may be established such that the building's air conditioning or heating system does not fall above or below this specified range regardless of the users' preferred temperatures. Additionally, the network controller 105 may be configured to turn on the building's air conditioning in a particular zone of the building, providing that a certain number of users are present within the particular area.
- the network controller 105 may be further configured to turn on the air conditioning within a particular work area of the building, providing that a predetermined number of users (e.g., five or more) are present within that particular work area.
- the network controller 105 may be further configured to only turn on the air conditioning system within the predefined area where an individual having a particular weighting factor 360 is present within such area.
- the process 500 commences at block 510 , where the network controller 105 detects network users within a predefined area and obtains the user's environmental preferences for the predefined area.
- the base station 110 which provides communication coverage for the predefined area, transmits a polling signal within the predefined area.
- the portable communication units 125 which are associated with the network users in the predefined area, transmit an identification signal to the base station 110 , thereby identifying themselves to the network controller 105 as being present within the area.
- the portable communication units 125 also transmit their corresponding user's environmental preferences 235 that are stored in the memory 230 . It will be appreciated that the preferences 235 for each user may alternatively be stored in a centralized database of the network controller 105 , as opposed to being stored in each corresponding portable communications unit 125 .
- the environmental preferences 235 may include a user's desired temperature setting, lighting and sound conditions, etc. for the predefined area within which the user is present. It will be appreciated that various other environmental factors may be considered either in addition to or in lieu of the examples provided. Of course, the applicability of the environmental preferences 235 may vary from one predefined area to another.
- the network controller 105 determines whether these preferences are allowable and/or relevant for the user within the given area. For example, some users' environmental preferences 235 may fall outside of established operating limits as defined in the building control system specifications and data 450 that is stored in memory 415 of the network controller 105 . That is, a user may have a preferred temperature setting of 80 degrees F., for example, but this temperature setting may not be economically feasible. Accordingly, the network controller 105 may be configured to disregard the user's preference or substitute other limits or preference for that particular temperature setting. Furthermore, certain preferences 235 of the user may not be relevant to the particular location where the user is currently present.
- the network controller 105 may be configured to determine that it is dark outside, thus making the user's preference for natural light irrelevant. The network controller 105 may accomplish this by determining the time of day in which the user is present in the predefined area (e.g., if it is 8:00 p.m., a preference for natural light is not relevant). The network controller 105 may also be configured to determine whether or not a particular network user has the right for a particular environmental preference.
- a particular preference for a low ranking employee may be disregarded, where such a preference is only allowed for a higher ranking employee, for example.
- a preference to have a room temperature of 65° F. during the summer months for a high ranking employee may be considered acceptable, it may be unacceptable for a lower ranking employee where his or her lower temperature limit may be set at 72° F., for example.
- the process 500 proceeds to block 530 , where limits are established by the network controller 105 on those users' preferences 235 . If the preferences for the detected users are allowable or have been determined at block 530 , the network controller 105 performs a “weighted average” for the detected users' preferences to establish an optimal condition setting for those preferences at block 540 . For example, with regard to temperature setting within the area, the network controller 105 may average the temperature setting preferences for the detected users and take into account additional factors, such as each user's weighting factor 360 , whether the user has a handicap 340 , etc. In one embodiment, the network controller 105 may use following formula to calculate the optimal condition setting based on temperature and weighting factor.
- Weighted Target Temperature ( w 1 T 1 +w 2 T 2 +w n T n )/( w 1 +w 2 +w n )
- w n is the weighting factor for the nth user
- T n is the desired temperature of nth user
- the controller 105 may be configured to accommodate all of the users' preferences, such as preferred beverages, for example, as opposed to determining the most popular beverage. Accordingly, the controller 105 need not necessarily average the users' preferences as described above with regard to temperature.
- the network controller 105 Upon determining the optimal environmental condition setting at block 540 , the network controller 105 updates the optimal settings at block 550 as calculated at block 540 for each relevant user preference. It will be appreciated that the network controller 105 may be configured to update the optimal settings at predetermined time intervals to account for users entering or exiting the predefined area. At block 560 , the network controller 105 then forwards the updated optimal settings to the environment control system 140 , such that the appropriate environmental building component (e.g., air conditioning unit, heating unit, etc.) may be controlled accordingly to establish the desired environmental conditions in the predefined area.
- the appropriate environmental building component e.g., air conditioning unit, heating unit, etc.
