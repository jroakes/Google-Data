Description
Technical Field
The disclosed subject matter relates generally to display technology, including, but not limited to, systems and methods for providing knowledge-based media content recommendations, displaying a unified user interface with content-based media recommendations, mixing multiple media content items to be displayed on a focal region, and/or projecting controlled media content associated with a networked television device. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to displaying a unified user interface with tab interfaces, wherein upcoming media content items from multiple content providers can be displayed in one of the tab interfaces.
Background
Media display devices are used to stream various media content (e.g., television programs, movies, live, personal video, etc.) via one or more communication networks. Media display devices include a variety of connected display devices such as mobile phones, set-top boxes, or connected television devices. The connected television device is typically controlled via a remote control interface that may be displayed directly on the media display device or separately on a second screen mobile device (e.g., a tablet, notebook, or mobile phone). The user may browse through a list of content items and search for media content on a user interface displayed on the television apparatus while controlling playback of the media content via a dedicated remote device or a second screen mobile device (e.g., tablet, notebook, or mobile phone). However, the list of content items is typically organized based on a media player application configured to play the content items in the list.
Further, when a user consumes media content using these media player applications, the user may be aware of the upcoming distribution of the media content, but typically is required to use a particular media player application to search for upcoming distributions of the media content that are only available from content providers corresponding to the particular media player application.
It is therefore desirable to provide new mechanisms for providing knowledge-based media content recommendations and a unified user interface for presenting upcoming media content to a networked television device.
Disclosure of Invention
According to various implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a networked television device having a unified user interface for knowledge-based media content recommendation and presentation of upcoming media content is provided.
The subject matter of the present disclosure is directed to presenting a unified user interface with content-based media recommendations on a networked Television (TV) device (sometimes referred to as a smart TV). The unified user interface may be configured to display a plurality of media content recommendations selected for a particular user based at least in part on knowledge of the interests and activities of the particular user (e.g., search queries, search results, previous viewing histories, purchase histories, application usage histories, application installation histories, user actions on a networked television device, physical activities of the user, etc. of the user). In some implementations, media content recommendations may be organized into clusters based on one or more categories, such as: content type (e.g. "action movie"), viewing history (e.g. "because you have watched movie ABC"), and release time (e.g. "trend"), etc. In some implementations, media content provided by different content sources (e.g., action movies from two different streaming media services and broadcast television channels) may be recommended in the same cluster. In some implementations, the unified user interface can include a tab interface, where one of the tab interfaces includes upcoming media content organized into a plurality of clusters based on one or more categories such as: release time (e.g., "this week", "next month", etc.), user actions and user application interactions (e.g., "my upcoming" content item), media play application usage (e.g., upcoming item from application ABC "), etc.
It should be noted that the tab interface may present a media recommendation stream comprising an ordered set of upcoming media content items, wherein the upcoming media content items in the media recommendation stream may be selected from different content sources based on user activity data with the unified user interface, each of the plurality of media player applications, and each of the plurality of user applications. It should also be noted that the tab interface may include a plurality of clusters, wherein each cluster may include upcoming content items from a plurality of content sources.
In some implementations, the unified user interface can include a focus area (e.g., a highlighting area of the user interface) configured to sequentially display a series of media content items (e.g., advertisements, movie trailers, merchandise images) according to a temporal order to promote the media content items, products, or events. In some implementations, notifications of upcoming media content items that have become available can be presented within a focus area.
In some implementations, a user can initiate playback of a content item from a unified user interface by selecting an icon or thumbnail corresponding to the content item. In some implementations, playback of media content items selected from a unified user interface may be handled by a dedicated application associated with a particular media streaming service or broadcast channel, a cable or over-the-air (OTA) tuner, a web browser, or an internal projection application associated with a connected television displaying the user interface. In some implementations, playback of a content item is handled cooperatively by a media player application and a local content projection application, particularly when playback occurs in a restricted mode that is not supported by the media player application (e.g., in an age-restricted system context, such as a media player interface customized for children). In some embodiments where the unified user interface provides both restricted and unrestricted modes and the media player application supports only unrestricted modes, the media player application is used to play media content when the user interface is in the unrestricted mode and the local projection application is used to play media content items when the system is in the restricted mode media player.
In embodiments where the content item is an upcoming media content item, selecting an icon, thumbnail, or tile corresponding to the upcoming media content item may present the user with an option interface that includes options such as an option to present notifications to the user of the user account in a unified user interface (e.g., overlay notifications, notifications within a focus area, etc.), an option to remove the upcoming media content item from the user being recommended to the user account within a particular cluster, etc.
In various embodiments, the unified user interface is coupled with a server system that hosts a virtual user domain that includes user accounts associated with users of the user interface. The hardware device and the software application are integrated with each other via a user account in the virtual user domain. In some implementations, the user account is associated with a networked television device and the unified media application is configured to present a unified user interface on the television device. The user account may also be associated with one or more home devices (e.g., cameras, doorbell, and/or hazard detector), one or more media player devices (e.g., set top boxes and/or associated television devices), one or more auxiliary devices (e.g., speaker assistants and/or display auxiliary devices), and their corresponding home security, media player, and auxiliary applications. The user account may also be associated with general user applications such as email applications, social media applications, map applications, and online retailer applications.

Detailed Description
According to various implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a networked television device is provided having a unified user interface for knowledge-based media content recommendation and presentation of upcoming media content.
In various implementations, the media environment includes a networked television device (also referred to as a smart television device) having one or more processors and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors. The networked television device links to a user account in a virtual user domain hosted by the server system. The networked television device executes a unified television application to display a unified user interface on which media content items provided by various media content providers are selected and displayed for a user of the networked television device. In some implementations, the networked television device is controlled by a dedicated remote control device or a client device having a remote control application for playing media content items for a user. In some implementations, the dedicated remote control device is disposed in proximity to the television device. In some implementations, a dedicated remote control device or client device with a remote control application is not physically close to the television device, but is associated with a user account maintained at a server system of the media environment.
When the networked television device executes the unified television application, it obtains a media recommendation stream from the server system. The media recommendation stream includes an ordered sequence of selectable information items corresponding to an ordered set of unique media content items or programs. Selectable information items in a media recommendation stream are identified for a particular user based at least in part on knowledge of the user of the networked television device (e.g., interests and activities of the user). In particular, user accounts associated with the unified television application are also associated with multiple media player applications and multiple user applications (e.g., search engines, map applications). The activity data of these applications is stored in association with the user account and is used to calculate the multidimensional unified user activity profile (also referred to as knowledge graph) of the user. An ordered sequence of selectable information items is determined from program information associated with a plurality of media player applications based on user activity characteristics and recommended to a user via a unified television application.
In a more specific example, when the networked television device executes the unified television application, the unified television application may obtain from the server system a media recommendation stream for the upcoming media content item that is not currently available for playback on the networked television device. The media recommendation stream may include an ordered sequence of selectable information items corresponding to an ordered set of upcoming media content items or programs. Selectable information items in the media recommendation stream may be identified for a particular user based at least in part on knowledge of the user of the networked television device (e.g., interests and activities of the user). In particular, user accounts associated with the unified television application may also be associated with multiple media player applications and multiple user applications (e.g., search engines, map applications). The activity data of these applications may be stored in association with a user account and may be used to calculate a multi-dimensional unified user activity profile (also referred to as a knowledge graph) for the user. An ordered sequence of selectable information items is determined from program information associated with a plurality of media player applications based on user activity characteristics and recommended to a user via a unified television application.
An ordered sequence of selectable information items is displayed on a unified user interface of the networked television device. For each selectable information item, the media recommendation stream includes a respective command to be executed in response to a user selection of the respective selectable information item at the networked television device. The selectable information items are organized into clusters and arranged without reference to their content provider. That is, two information items associated with media content items provided by different content providers may be placed adjacent to each other, allowing a unified user interface to focus on the content and be blind to the content provider on its surface.
In addition to the selectable information items, the unified user interface optionally displays a plurality of focus items sequentially in the focus area according to a temporal order, i.e. each focus item sequentially occupies the entire focus area. The focal region may be located on the top half of the unified user interface. Each focused item is associated with a respective focused item provider selected from the commercialization module, the advertiser, and the media recommendation engine. The focused item provided by the commercialization module of the server system optionally corresponds to a media content item provided by the TVOD content provider and requiring payment for viewing. In some implementations, the focused item is an advertisement item provided by an advertiser, and the advertisement item conforms to a customized Video Advertisement Service Template (VAST). In particular, the television apparatus sends a request to the advertiser for a focus item that includes information of a predefined user interface element of the focus area. The advertisement items are aggregated from a plurality of media content items provided by advertisers according to information of predefined user interface elements. In some implementations, notifications regarding upcoming media content items that have become available for playback can be presented within a focus area.
In some implementations, the unified television application has a restricted mode in which content selection criteria are applied to restrict media content provided via a standard media content application for playback on a unified user interface. For example, the content selection criteria may be related to age-based content ratings and define restricted modes as child friendly. In the restricted mode, the unified television application optionally determines whether the standard media content application is operating in the restricted mode. In accordance with a determination that the standard media content application is operating in the restricted mode, the media content is displayed on the unified user interface via the standard media content application. Alternatively, the media content is displayed on the unified user interface via a local content projection application that is different from the standard media content application in accordance with a determination that the third party media content application is not operating in the restricted mode.
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments described. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments described may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.
FIG. 1 is an example media environment 100 in which a networked television device 102, a server system 104, and third-party content sources 106-110 interact with one another via one or more communication networks 112, according to some implementations. The media environment 100 corresponds to a virtual user domain created and hosted by the server system 104, and the virtual user domain includes a plurality of user accounts. Third party content sources 106 through 110 include advertisement source 106, EPG source 108, and media content source 110. For each user account, the server system 104 is coupled to the third party content sources 106-110 and the one or more media devices 102 and 116-126 and is configured to recommend and stream media content for viewing by the user via the respective user account.
In particular, one or more media devices associated with a user and a user account are arranged in the media environment 100 to provide media content stored at and streamed from a remote content source to a user. The remote content source is optionally a third party media content source 110 or an internal media source hosted by the server system 104. In some implementations, one or more media devices include a networked television device 102 that streams media content directly from a remote content source, or integrates an embedded projection unit configured to stream media content for display to its viewers. The networked television device 102 is communicatively coupled to a dedicated remote control device 114 and/or a client device having a remote control application. The dedicated remote control device 114 may be disposed in proximity to the television device 102 and configured to communicate with the television device 102 using digitally encoded pulses of infrared signals. Alternatively, in some cases, the dedicated remote control device 114 is configured to communicate with the television device 102 via the communication network 112 (i.e., via a local wide area network and/or a wide area network) and does not have to be physically proximate to the television device 102.
The networked television device 102 includes one or more processors and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors. The instructions stored on the networked television device 102 include a unified television application, a local content projection application, and one or more media player applications associated with the third party content sources 106 through 110 and/or with internal media sources associated with the server system 104. These applications are linked to user accounts in the virtual user domain of the media environment 100.
Alternatively, in some implementations, a media device disposed in the media environment 100 includes a display device 116 that outputs media content directly to a viewer and a casting device 118 coupled to the display device 116 and configured to stream the media content to the display device 116. Examples of display device 116 include, but are not limited to, a Television (TV) display device and a music player. Examples of casting devices 118 include, but are not limited to, set Top Boxes (STBs), DVD players, and television boxes. In this example shown in fig. 1, display device 116 includes a television display that is hardwired to a DVD player or set top box 118. In contrast, in some implementations, a media device disposed in the media environment 100 includes a computer screen 120A that outputs media content to a viewer and a desktop computer 120B that streams the media content to the computer screen 120B. In some implementations, media devices disposed in the media environment 100 include mobile devices, such as a mobile phone 122, a tablet 124, and a laptop 126. Each of the media devices 118-126 includes one or more media player applications configured to receive and play media content items provided by the third party content sources 106-110 or internal media sources associated with the server system 104.
Server system 104 includes a Unified Media Platform (UMP) 128, which unified media platform 128 is configured to manage media content recommendation and streaming to one or more media devices in media environment 100. UMP 128 is configured to receive from knowledge graph engine 130 multidimensional unified user activity characteristics associated with a user account and program information or content items for programs provided by media content source 110 and generate media content recommendations personalized for the user account. The unified user activity characteristics associated with the user account are obtained from a plurality of information sources 132, such as a search engine, a mapping application, and an online retailer associated with the user account, each of which provides activity data related to the activity of the user account via a respective software program or application. Optionally, the media content recommendations generated by UMP 128 are presented on networked television device 102 via server-side television application 134, and server-side television application 134 enables display of the media content on the unified television application of television device 102 in response to a user selection from among the media content recommendations. In addition, UMP 128 may also function as a centralized media content management module configured to provide media content recommendations to other media devices 118-126 in addition to television device 102.
In some implementations, activity data associated with the user account is collected from the television application 134 and the projection service module 136 (which are thus part of the information source 132) and returned to the knowledge graph engine 130 to update the unified user activity characteristics and media content recommendations associated with the user account.
In some implementations, UMP 128 also includes a media search engine (e.g., engine 222 in fig. 2) configured to receive a search query from server-side television application 134 or projection service module 136 and identify one or more media content items from program information for the programs or content items provided by media content source 110.
Notably, the user accounts of the virtual user domains hosted by the server system 104 are also associated with one or more devices of other types, such as intelligent, multi-sensing, networked auxiliary devices 138 and home devices 140 installed in the media environment 100 associated with the user of the networked television device 102. Examples of auxiliary devices 138 include a speaker auxiliary device 142 and a display auxiliary device 144. Speaker auxiliary device 142 can collect audio input, identify user commands from the audio input, and effect operations (e.g., play music, answer questions) in response to the user commands. The display assistance device 144 is capable of collecting audio and/or video input, identifying user commands from the audio and/or video input, and effecting operations (e.g., playing music, presenting images or video clips, answering questions) in response to the user commands. Examples of home devices 140 include one or more of the following: smart, multi-sensing and networking-hazard detector 146, camera system 148, thermostats, entry interface devices (e.g., smart doorbell and "smart door lock"), alarm systems, microphone devices, wall switches, wall plug interfaces, and appliances (e.g., refrigerator, stove, oven, television, washing machine, dryer, light fixture, stereo, intercom system, garage door opener, floor fan, ceiling fan, wall mounted air conditioner, swimming pool heater, irrigation system, security system, space heater, window air conditioning unit, and electric plumbing vents).
Each of the auxiliary device 138 and the home device 140 is optionally managed by a unified home device application or a dedicated user application and linked to a user account in the virtual domain in connection with a unified television application of the networked television device. The activity data collected by knowledge graph engine 130 may also include data collected by a subset of auxiliary devices 138 and home devices 140, allowing media content recommendations provided to the user to reflect such activity data collected directly from the physical surroundings associated with media environment 100.
In some implementations, the server system 104 includes a device and application registry 150, the device and application registry 150 configured to store information for one or more user accounts managed by the server system 104 and information for user devices and applications associated with each of the one or more user accounts. For example, the device and application registry 150 stores information for the networked television device 102, the remote control device 114, the media devices 116-126, the auxiliary device 138, and the home device 140, as well as information for corresponding unified television applications, remote control applications, media player applications, unified home device applications, and dedicated user applications associated with the auxiliary device 138 and the home device 140. Optionally, the media devices, auxiliary devices, and home devices associated with the same user account are distributed in different geographic areas. Alternatively, the devices are located in the same physical location. Each media, auxiliary, or home device communicates with another device or server system 104 using one or more communication networks 112. The communication network 112 used may be one or more networks having one or more types of topologies, including, but not limited to, the internet, an intranet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a cellular network, an ethernet, a Storage Area Network (SAN), a telephone network, a bluetooth Personal Area Network (PAN), and the like. In some implementations, two or more devices in a sub-network are coupled via a wired connection, while at least some devices in the same sub-network are coupled via a local radio communication network (e.g., zigBee, Z-Wave, insteon, bluetooth, wi-Fi, and other radio communication networks).
FIG. 2 is an example operating environment 200 in which the server system 104 provides knowledge-based media content recommendations to the networked television device 102, according to some implementations. In example operating environment 200, server system 104 includes a plurality of information sources 132, knowledge graph engine 130, UMP 128, and server-side television application 134. The server system 104 hosts a virtual user domain that includes user accounts associated with the server-side television application 134 and the unified television application 202 implemented at the networked television device 102. The user accounts are also associated with a plurality of media player applications 204 and a plurality of user applications (e.g., search engine 206). The server system 104 stores activity data for each of the unified television application 202, the media player application 204, and the user application. Knowledge graph engine 130 of server system 104 calculates multidimensional unified user activity characteristics 208 (e.g., regarding user preferences or affinities) from stored activity data and obtains program information associated with a plurality of media player applications 204, resulting in de-duplicated program information 210 for a plurality of unique programs (also referred to as media content items). UMP 128 includes a recommendation engine 212, which recommendation engine 212 is configured to compare user activity characteristics 208 to program information 210 for a plurality of unique programs to identify an ordered subset 214 of unique programs to recommend to a user via unified television application 202.
In one example, knowledge graph engine 130 receives a plurality of search queries from search engine 206 regarding "star wars" and determines that a user associated with the user account is interested in "star wars". The plurality of unique programs associated with the program information are ranked in terms of user interest, preference, or affinity (i.e., represented by the unified user activity profile 208). A number of top-ranked unique programs are selected and categorized into clusters. Given the user's interest in "star wars" indicated by the search query, the top-ranked unique program includes one or more media content items related to "star wars", and the clusters include clusters related to "star wars", such as "science fiction movies like" star wars "
The ordered subset 214 of unique programs identified by the recommendation engine 212 is represented by an ordered sequence of information items, and the ordered sequence of information items is provided to the server-side television application 134 and enabled for display via the unified television application 202 of the networked television device 102. In some cases, the activity data used by knowledge graph engine 130 and the resulting unified user activity characteristics 208 are constantly changing. Ordered subsets 214 of unique programs may be dynamically identified. For example, the ordered subset 214 of unique programs is updated periodically or in response to a request by a user of the networked television device 102. In some cases, each unique program in ordered subset 214 has a lifetime determined based on the respective content type of the respective unique program and must be removed from the recommended ordered subsequent program after the lifetime expires. In some implementations, the unified user activity profile 208 can change the time of day and day of the week, as can the ordered subset 214 of unique programs recommended via the unified television application 202.
The plurality of user applications act as a plurality of information sources 132 to provide activity data for users of the television apparatus 102 and include at least an internet search engine 206. The server system 104 stores and provides the knowledge graph engine 130 with search queries and search results for a number of search operations implemented by the internet search engine 206 from the user account. Further, in some implementations, the server system 104 stores viewing information associated with a subset or all of the user accounts of the media player application 204 and purchase information associated with a user account of a subset of the user applications (e.g., online retailer applications). Such viewing information and purchase information is provided to knowledge graph engine 130 along with the search query and search results. In some implementations, the plurality of user applications includes a voice or video auxiliary application 218 associated with the speaker or display auxiliary device 142 or 144. In some implementations, the plurality of user applications includes a unified home device application and/or a dedicated home device application 220 associated with the one or more home devices 140. The activity data collected by these auxiliary applications 218 and home device applications 220 is also stored and provided to the knowledge graph engine 130.
Alternatively, one of the media player applications 204 is provided by the server system 104 itself. Optionally, the media player application 204 is provided by a third party media content source 110 that is distinct and/or remote from the server system 104. In an example, the virtual user domain is associated with a google user account (e.g., abc@gmail.com). The media player applications 204 include YouTube provided by google and other media player applications not provided by google and hosted independently of google (e.g., netflix, amazon Prime, hulu).
In some implementations, the program information associated with the plurality of media player applications 204 includes one or more of the following: schedule information, brief summaries of episodes, actor information, rating information, and comments of current and scheduled programs available or to be available on each media player application. Program information is optionally provided to the server system 104 in a section catalog by each of the third party media content sources 110 associated with the plurality of media player applications 204. Optionally, the program information is provided to the server system 104 by the EPG source 108. Alternatively, in some implementations, the program information associated with the plurality of media player applications 204 includes common media information downloaded from a common database that is independent of the user account. Program information associated with the media player application may be provided to the server system 104 independent of whether the user accounts associated with the television apparatus 102 and the unified television application 202 are subscribed to the media player application and have access to media content provided via the media player application.
In some implementations, the program information provided by different media content sources 110 regarding the same media content item is not the same and may vary to different levels, requiring deduplication of program information associated with multiple media player applications. In particular, in some implementations, the first media content item is provided by the first media player application and is associated with the first program information. The second media content item is provided by the second media player application and is associated with second program information in the second media player application. The second program information is different from the first program information. Knowledge graph engine 130 identifies a similarity level for the first and second program information and determines that the similarity level exceeds a similarity threshold. Based on the determination, knowledge graph engine 130 deduplicates and aggregates the first program information of the first media content item and the second program information of the second media content item, and determines that one of the plurality of unique programs is associated with both the first and second media content items. That is, the first and second media content items provided by two distinct media player applications correspond to the same unique program or media content item. Further, in some implementations, the knowledge graph engine 130 identifies a similarity level of the first program information and the second program information by identifying a first keyword from the first program information and a second keyword from the second program information. The first keyword and the second keyword are semantically compared to identify a similarity level of the first program information and the second program information. For example, two items of program information are typically identical, but reference is made to the different keywords "police" and "inspector" which are semantically similar. These two items of program information correspond to a relatively high level of similarity above a similarity threshold.
In some implementations, program information associated with the plurality of media player applications is processed in addition to deduplication to calculate a program characteristic of one of the unique programs. The multidimensional unified user activity profile is then compared to the calculated program profile to obtain a consistency score. The recommendation engine 212 is configured to determine whether the uniformity score exceeds a uniformity threshold and identify one of the unique programs to be recommended to the user via the unified television application when the uniformity score exceeds the uniformity threshold. Alternatively, in some implementations, to identify each of the ordered subsets of unique programs, the recommendation engine 212 identifies one or more keywords based on the multidimensional unified user activity characteristic and searches the deduplicated program information for the plurality of unique programs for the one or more keywords to identify the corresponding unique program in the ordered subset of unique programs.
In some implementations, the recommendation engine 212 receives authorization information for a subset of the plurality of media player applications. For each of the ordered subsets of unique programs, the recommendation engine 212 determines, based on the authorization information, that the respective unique program corresponds to a respective media player application to which the user of the networked television device has access. Based on the authorization information, the user may have access to the corresponding unique program because the user has subscribed to the corresponding media player application, or because the corresponding unique program may be viewed free of charge with or without registration. The corresponding unique programs that are viewable free include media content that is freely available over the air (e.g., via broadcast services or IPTV delivered feeds), as well as media content that has become available due to regional regulations or authorizations.
In other words, the personal preferences shown by the multi-dimensional unified user activity profile are used to select a set of unique programs from among the unique programs provided by the media content source 110 and rank the selected set of unique programs. The selected set of unique programs is further filtered according to authorization information indicating whether the user account is authorized (e.g., has access to) media content provided by the media content source 110 via the corresponding media player application 204. This authorization information associated with the media player application is optionally entered by a user of the unified television application during an initial application personalization process or execution phase of the unified television application 202. Optionally, the authorization information associated with the media player application is automatically extracted from the media player application.
In some implementations, UMP 128 also includes a media search engine 222 configured to receive a search query from server-side television application 134 and identify one or more media content items from program information 210 for the programs or content items provided via media player application 204.
The server system 104 has one or more processors and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors. In some implementations, the server system 104 includes a single server computer configured to implement the functionality of the knowledge graph engine 130, the recommendation engine 212, the media search engine 222, and the server-side television application 134. Alternatively, in some implementations, the server system 104 includes two or more separate server computers, each configured to implement the functionality of one or more of the knowledge graph engine 130, the recommendation engine 212, the media search engine 222, and the server-side television application 134.
Fig. 3 is an example unified user interface 300 for display on the networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The unified television application 202 is executed locally at the networked television device 102 to display the unified user interface 300. As explained above with reference to fig. 2, the server system 104 identifies an ordered subset 214 of unique programs based on the user activity characteristics 208 and the program information 210 of the plurality of unique programs. The unified television application 202 obtains a media recommendation stream from the server system 104 that includes an ordered sequence of selectable information items 302 through 332 corresponding to the identified ordered subset 214 of unique media content items or programs. For each selectable information item, the media recommendation stream includes a respective command to be executed in response to a user selection of the respective selectable information item displayed on the networked television device 102.
In some implementations, the corresponding ordered sequences of selectable information items are categorized into an ordered list of clusters 334-340. That is, a plurality of clusters 334-340 are created for display on the unified user interface 300 and physically arranged according to a predefined clustering order. Optionally, the clusters are dynamically created and arranged based on the multidimensional unified user activity characteristic 208. In some implementations, the clusters recommended via the unified television application 202 have a certain level of heterogeneity, i.e., have a number of different clusters that is greater than a predetermined number. For example, three or more different clusters must be recommended via the unified television application 202. Alternatively, in some implementations, clusters displayed on the unified user interface 300 have similarity scores that are controlled below a inter-cluster similarity threshold for multiple neighboring clusters. This is to avoid situations where similar clusters and information items are arranged adjacent to each other in highly correlated clusters. In some implementations, benchmarks are established to define inter-cluster similarity thresholds across multiple adjacent clusters.
Each cluster includes one or more information items in an ordered sequence, the information items being ordered into ordered sub-lists of information items in the respective cluster. For each cluster (e.g., first cluster 338), a respective subset of the ordered sequence of selectable information items (e.g., information items 318-324) is physically arranged according to a predefined information item order determined based on the multi-dimensional unified user activity characteristic 208 of the user account associated with the ordered sequence of selectable information items.
Examples of clusters displayed on unified user interface 300 include "new release" 334, "play Next" 336, "current trend" 338, "because you have watched movie ABC"340 and "action movie". In another example, the clusters are specific to a single media player application (e.g., youTube), and the subset of information items associated with the clusters correspond to a mix of shows, movies, and television content programs provided by the single media player application. Thus, each cluster corresponds to a respective ordered sub-list of information items and is defined according to one or more of the following categories: content type (e.g. "action movie"), viewing history (e.g. "because you watched movie ABC"), release time (e.g. "trend"), or content source (e.g. different streaming services and broadcast tv channels providing action movies). In particular, the information items in the "new release" cluster are determined based on one or more of content type/format, content quality, recency, popularity, seasonal and application lifecycle associated with the media content item or program corresponding to the information item in the "new release".
In some implementations, media content items corresponding to information items in a "new post" or "current trend" cluster are provided by a Transactional Video On Demand (TVOD) content provider, and selection of media content items in the "new post" or "current trend" is configured to enable a user interface prompted to a user of the television apparatus 102 to collect payment for viewing the media content items. Optionally, this "new release" or "current trend" cluster is provided as part of an ordered sequence of information items corresponding to the ordered subset 214 of unique programs determined based on the unified user activity profile 208. Alternatively, the "new release" or "current trend" cluster is provided to all user accounts as a supplement to the ordered sequence of information items corresponding to the ordered subset 214 of unique programs, independent of the unified user activity profile 208 of the individual user accounts.
In some implementations, media content items corresponding to information items in a "motion picture" cluster are provided by a Subscription Video On Demand (SVOD) content provider. The selection of media content items in the cluster is configured to enable a media content item page (also referred to as a summary page, e.g., page 600 in fig. 6A) or initiate display of media content items without requesting immediate payment. Further, in some implementations, media content items corresponding to information items in the "play next" cluster are optionally provided by SVOD or TVOD content providers. In response to selecting a media content item in the "play next" cluster, the television apparatus 102 resumes displaying the media content item, thereby allowing the user of the television apparatus 102 to have one-touch access to continue watching the favorite show or movie.
For each cluster on the unified user interface 300, a portion or all of the ordered sub-list of information items is displayed according to the total number of information items that the respective sub-list has, the size of each information item, and the available display space associated with the respective cluster. In some implementations, each of the ordered subsets of unique programs 214 is distinct from any other unique program of the ordered subset of unique programs 214. Any two of the information items 302 through 332 displayed in the unified user interface 300 are different from each other. In some cases, any two of the information items 302-332 displayed in the same cluster of the unified user interface 300 are distinct from each other. Alternatively, in some cases, two of the information items 302-332 may be identical, but recommended in different clusters, e.g., the information item 310 associated with the "Tang vegetable garden" appears in the cluster "play Next" 336 and the cluster "drama".
In some implementations, the unified user interface 300 includes application availability items 342 that are distinct from the ordered list of clusters, as well as corresponding selectable information items that are displayed therewith. In response to a user action on availability item 342 (e.g., selection of item 342 via remote control device 114), unified television application 202 updates unified user interface 300 with pages of information items, each of which represents a respective media player application 204. In some implementations not shown in fig. 3, the unified user interface 300 also includes alternative clusters of information items, each information item representing a respective one of the plurality of media player applications 204.
In some implementations, the unified user interface 300 includes an EPG availability item 348. In response to a user action on availability item 348 (e.g., selection of item 348 via remote control device 114), unified television application 202 displays a unified EPG page that includes a schedule of a plurality of content items and programs provided by a broadcast service (e.g., television, cable, satellite, youTube) and organized chronologically. Content items and programs are selected based at least in part on the location of the networked television device 102. In some implementations, the plurality of content items and programs are also determined by comparing the multi-dimensional unified user activity characteristic 208 with deduplication program information corresponding to media content items and programs provided by the broadcast service.
The information items 302-332 are provided by more than one media content source 110, but are organized and displayed on the unified user interface 300 based on the content of the media content items or programs 214 (rather than the media content sources) recommended by the recommendation engine 212 of the server system 104. Specifically, each cluster displayed on the unified user interface 300 includes a subset of the ordered sequence of selectable information items. The first cluster 338 includes the first selectable information item 318 and the second selectable information item 320. The first and second selectable information items 318 and 320 of the first cluster 338 are displayed simultaneously on the unified user interface 300. In response to the first user selection of the first selectable information item 318, the television apparatus 102 displays information for the first media content item provided by the first content provider. In response to a second user selection of the second selectable information item 320, the television apparatus 102 displays information for a second media content item provided by a second content provider. The second content provider is different from the first content provider, although the information of the first and second content providers is optionally hidden on the unified user interface 300 showing clusters 334-340 and selectable information items 302-332.
In some implementations, each of the first and second content providers is selected from the group consisting of: broadcast television services, broadcast satellite services, cable television services, subscription Video On Demand (SVOD) content providers, transactional Video On Demand (TVOD) content providers, advertisement-based video on demand (AVOD) services, and playback and time-shifted content playback sources. Optionally, the first or second content provider relies on tuner-based delivery of the over-the-air media content. Optionally, the first or second content provider delivers a live television stream based on Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) or other internet delivered linear, live or composite live content source, and the first or second content provider is an internet based live streaming service. If one of the information items 302-332 corresponds to a broadcast television service (e.g., NBC, ABC, ESPN), a unique broadcast program corresponding to one of the information items 302-332 is allowed to be displayed at the location of the television apparatus 102 in accordance with geographic restrictions associated with the broadcast television service.
Note that the unified television application 202 is associated with a user account of a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. In some implementations, the first content provider is associated with a first media player application, and the first media player application is optionally associated with a user account of a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. In some implementations, the second content provider is associated with a second media player application, and the second media player application is optionally associated with a user account of a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104.
In some cases, the first cluster 338 has more selectable information items than a plurality of time slots on a corresponding space of the unified user interface 300 assigned to the first cluster 338. The subset of selectable information items corresponding to the first cluster 338 is physically arranged and configured to move along the first axis 344 of the unified user interface 300 such that different information items of the subset of selectable information items corresponding to the first cluster 338 may be displayed on the unified user interface 300 and recommended to a user of the television device 102. In particular, a first user action on information items 318 (e.g., a user pressing a "last" button on remote control device 114) may cause information items 318-322 to move one slot to the right to cause information items 324 to exit unified user interface 300 and cause new information items associated with first cluster 338 to enter unified user interface 300. Similarly, a second user action on information items 324 (e.g., the user pressing a "next" button on remote control device 114) may cause information items 320-324 to move one slot to the left to cause information item 318 to exit unified user interface 300 and to cause another new information item associated with first cluster 338 to enter unified user interface 300. When one of the first and second user actions is applied consecutively, the start or end information item in the first cluster 338 is displayed. When this occurs, the one of the first and second user actions optionally does not change the information items displayed on the unified user interface 300, or continues to display the end or beginning of the subset of selectable information items in the first cluster 338 as new information items after the beginning or ending information items, respectively.
Further, in some implementations, the plurality of clusters are distributed along the second axis 346 of the unified user interface 300 and include a first subset of clusters and a second subset of clusters. A first subset of the clusters may be moved out of the unified user interface and a second subset of the clusters may be moved into the unified user interface along a second axis. For example, the first subset of clusters includes clusters 334. A third user action on one of the information items 302-308 (e.g., a user pressing an "up" button on the remote control device 114) may cause the clusters 334-338 to move down one slot to cause the cluster 340 to exit the unified user interface 300 and cause a new cluster preceding the cluster 334 to enter the unified user interface from the top edge. Similarly, a fourth user action on one of the information items 326-332 (e.g., the user pressing a "down" button on the remote control device 114) may cause clusters 336-340 to move up one slot to cause cluster 334 to exit the unified user interface 300 and cause another new cluster subsequent to cluster 340 to enter the unified user interface. When one of the third and fourth user actions is applied consecutively, a top or bottom cluster of the plurality of clusters is displayed. When this occurs, one of the third and fourth user actions optionally does not change the cluster displayed on the unified user interface 300 or continues to display the bottom or top cluster of the plurality of clusters as the new cluster after the top or bottom cluster, respectively.
Fig. 4 is an example flowchart of a method 400 of providing knowledge-based media content recommendations to a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The method 400 is performed by the server system 104 and, optionally, is governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of the server system 104. Each of the operations shown in fig. 4 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1406 of server system 104 in fig. 14A). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 400 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The server system 104 hosts a virtual user domain that includes user accounts. The server system 104 associates 402 the user account with the unified television application 202, the plurality of media player applications 204, and the plurality of user applications. The unified television application 202 is associated with the networked television device 102 and the plurality of user applications includes at least an internet search engine 206. For each of the unified television application, the media player application, and the user application, the server system stores (404) the corresponding activity data. In particular, the server system 104 stores (406) search queries and search results of a plurality of search operations implemented by the internet search engine 206 from user accounts, stores (408) viewing information associated with user accounts of a subset of the media player applications 204, and stores (410) purchase information associated with user accounts of the subset of the user applications. Thereby computing (412) the multi-dimensional unified user activity profile 208 from the stored activity data.
The server system 104 also obtains (414) program information associated with the plurality of media player applications 204, generating deduplication program information 210 for the plurality of unique programs. In some implementations, the first media content item is provided by a first media player application and is associated with first program information, and the second media content item is provided by a second media player application and is associated with second program information in the second media player application. Server system 104 identifies 418 a level of similarity for the first and second program information. In accordance with a determination (418) that the similarity level exceeds the similarity threshold, the server system 104 deduplicates (420) the first program information of the first media content item and the second program information of the second media content item, and determines (422) that the unique program is associated with both the first and second media content items.
Based on the user activity characteristics 208 and the program information 210 for the plurality of unique programs, the server system 104 identifies (424) an ordered subset 214 of unique programs to be recommended to the user via the unified television application 202. The server system 104 enables 426 to display an ordered sequence of information items (e.g., items 302-332) corresponding to the ordered subset 214 of unique programs via the unified television application 202. Each information item represents a respective unique program or media content item provided by the corresponding media player application 204.
Fig. 5 is an example flowchart of a method 500 of presenting program information on a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The method 500 is performed by the networked television device 102, and optionally is governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of the networked television device 102. Each of the operations shown in fig. 5 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1506 of the networked television device 102 in fig. 15). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 500 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The networked television device 102 links to a user account in a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. The networked television device 102 executes 502 the unified television application 202 to display the unified user interface 300. A media recommendation stream is obtained (504) from the server system 104, the media recommendation stream comprising an ordered sequence of selectable information items 302 through 332 corresponding to the ordered set 214 of unique media content items or programs. For each selectable information item, the media recommendation stream includes (506) a respective command to be executed in response to a user selection of the respective selectable information item at the networked television device 102.
The networked television device 102 displays (508) a plurality of clusters on the unified user interface 300. Each cluster comprises (510) a subset of the ordered sequence of selectable information items 302 to 332. The first cluster 338 includes the first selectable information item 318 and the second selectable information item 320. The first and second selectable information items 318 and 320 of the first cluster 338 are displayed (510) simultaneously on the unified user interface 300. In some implementations, the information of the content provider associated with the first and second selectable information times is hidden on the unified user interface 300, the unified user interface 300 displaying the first and second selectable information items in the first cluster 338.
In response to a first user selection of the first selectable information item, the networked television device 102 displays (512) information for a first media content item provided by a first content provider (e.g., via a first media player application associated with the first content provider). In response to a second user selection of the second selectable information item, the networked television device 102 displays (514) information for the second media content item provided by the second content provider (e.g., via a second media player application associated with the second content provider). The second content provider is different from the first content provider. In some cases, displaying the information of the first media content item includes initiating playback of the first media content item provided by the first content provider directly from the first media player application, and displaying the information of the second media content item includes initiating playback of the second media content item provided by the second content provider directly from the second media player application. Alternatively, in some cases, the information of the first and second media content items is displayed on their respective media content item pages (e.g., page 600 in FIG. 6A) via the unified television application 202.
Fig. 6A and 6B are two example media content item pages 600 and 650, respectively, displayed on the networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. In some implementations, in response to user selection of a selectable information item (e.g., item 318) in the unified user interface 300, the media content item page 600 is displayed to present information for a first media content item provided by a first media player application associated with a first content provider. The information for the first media content item includes one or more of schedule information, a brief summary 612 of the episode, actor information 614, rating information 616, and comments for the first media content item. Optionally, the information of the first media content item includes one or more recommendations 618 related to the first media content item.
A list 602 of content providers providing the first media content item is displayed on the media content item page 600. The first content provider 604 is listed at the top of the list 602 of content providers and has the highest priority thereon. The user accounts associated with the unified television application 202 have subscribed to a subset or all of the content providers in the list 602. In some implementations, the user account has subscribed to at least the first content provider 604, allowing the recommendation engine 212 to rely on the authorization information of the first content provider 604 and add the first content item to an ordered sequence of selectable information items provided to the networked television device 102.
Further, in some cases, the list of content providers 602 includes a second content provider 606 that also provides the first media content item, and the first content provider 604 has a higher priority than the second content provider 606 on the list of content providers 602 that provide the first media content item. On the other hand, it should be noted that in response to user selection of a disparate selectable information item (e.g., item 320) in the unified user interface 300, a disparate media content item page can be displayed to present information of a second media content item. A list of disparate content providers is displayed, wherein the second content provider 606 is listed at the top of the list of disparate content providers in association with the second media content item.
Referring to fig. 6B, in some implementations, in response to user selection of a selectable information item (e.g., item 318) in the unified user interface 300, a media content item page 650 is displayed to present information of a first media content item provided by a first media player application associated with a first content provider. The user account does not have a subscription to the first media player application and the media content item page 650 includes an availability item 608 linked to the first media player application to allow the user account to subscribe to the service of the first content provider in response to a user action on the availability item 608. In an example, the first media content item is relatively new, e.g., has recently stopped showing in a theater and begun to be distributed by the TVOD content provider, and the availability item 608 is linked to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with the first media player application, wherein viewing of the first media content item is supported on a pay-per-view basis.
FIG. 7 is an example operating environment 700 in which the unified television application 202 and the media player application 204 cooperatively play media content items on the networked television device 102, according to some implementations. Both the unified television application 202 and the media player application 204 are executed by the networked television device 102. Playback of the media content item begins in the unified television application 202. In some cases, playback of the first media content item provided by the first content provider from the first media player application is directly initiated in response to a user action on the corresponding selectable information item 318 displayed on the unified user interface 300. Alternatively, in some cases, playback of the first media content item is initiated from the corresponding media content item page 600, for example, in response to a user selecting a media content provider from the list 602 of media content providers.
Upon initiating playback of the first media content item, the unified television application 202 plays the first media content item in dependence upon the first or other selected media player application 204. In some implementations, although the first media content item is played by the first media player application, the user interface element of the first media player application is bypassed and stopped from being displayed to the user of the networked television device 102. These bypassed user interface elements include those associated with the home user interface of the first media player application. Conversely, alternative user interface features may not be skipped, and examples of such non-skipped user interface features include a start-up image frame indicating that the first media item was provided by the first media content provider. By bypassing the user interface elements of the first media player application, the unified television application 202 and the media player application 204 are seamlessly integrated together to enable playback of the first media content item without requiring user intervention to switch between the two applications.
Fig. 8 is an example sequence 800 of user interfaces sequentially displayed on the networked television device 102 in response to user actions on the remote control device 114 coupled to the networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. When a media content item page 600 (also referred to as a summary page) for a first media content item is displayed on the television device 102, a first media content provider 604 is selected from the list 602 of media content providers by a first user action using an indication of the first media content provider (e.g., by pressing a play button 802 of the remote control device 114). In response to the user action, the first media content item is provided by the first media content provider 604 and played on the media player interface 804 via a first media player application associated with the first media content provider 604. The media player application is executed and hidden in the background to enable playback of the first media content item.
In some implementations, a user request to stop playback of a first media content item on a media player interface 804 enabled by a first media player application is received. In response to a user request to stop playback of the first media content item, a home user interface 806 of the first media player application is displayed and the networked television device 102 operates in a media environment managed by the first media player application. The user of the networked television device 102 may exit the media environment by selecting an exit availability item or pressing one or more predefined shortcut buttons of the remote control device 114 on the home user interface 806 of the first media player application.
Alternatively, in some implementations, display control returns directly to the unified television application 202 associated with the networked television device 102 in response to a user request to stop playback of the first media content item on the media player interface 804. That is, in response to a user request, the networked television device 102 displays the first media content item or the plurality of clustered media content item pages 600 on the unified user interface 300 via the unified television application 202. By these means, the participation of the first media player application may be completely invisible to the user of the networked television device 102, allowing the media player application 204 to be seamlessly integrated within the unified television application 202.
Fig. 9 is an example operating environment 900 in which the unified television application 202, the media player application 204, and the content projection application 902 of the web television device 102 cooperatively enable playback of media content items, according to some implementations. The media player application 204 is a dedicated application associated with a particular media streaming service or broadcast channel, a cable or Over The Air (OTA) tuner, a web browser, or the like. The content projection application 902 is internal to the television device 102 executing the connection of the unified television application 202. The networked television device 102 has a normal mode and a restricted mode, and the restricted mode is associated with content selection criteria. In the normal mode, media content allowed to be played via the unified television application 202 is selected from media content provided by each media content source 110 associated with the media player application 204 without any restrictions other than authorization of the user account (i.e., rights to access media content as allowed by subscription). Conversely, in the restricted mode, media content that is permitted to be played via the unified television application 202 is selected from among the media content provided by each of the media content sources 110 associated with the media player application 204 according to content selection criteria in addition to the authorization of the user account. Thus, implementations of the restricted mode involve operations on both the server side and the television device side.
On the server side, the recommendation engine 212 compares the user activity characteristics 208 with program information 210 for a plurality of unique content items or programs to identify an ordered subset 214 of unique programs to be recommended to the user in the normal mode. In the restricted mode, during the process of obtaining the ordered subset 214 of unique programs, the recommendation engine 212 applies content filtering criteria in conjunction with the user activity characteristics 208 and other filtering conditions (e.g., authorization information of the media player application 204), if any. That is, in the restricted mode, the ordered subset 214 of unique programs is determined based at least in part on content filtering criteria. The selectable information items displayed on the television device 102 correspond to an ordered subset 214 of unique programs and are thus selected from the program information 210 associated with the one or more media player applications 204 according to content selection criteria.
On the television device side, the unified television application 202 is executed to enable the display of the unified user interface 300 on the networked television device 102. In the normal mode, the unified television application 202 does not impose any restrictions on media content provided via the media player application 204 related to content selection criteria, and thus the unified television application 202 invokes the media player application 204 to play the media content. Conversely, in the restricted mode, the content selection criteria are applied via the unified television application 202. The unified television application 202 receives user actions on a first selectable information item on the unified user interface 300. The first selectable information item corresponds to a first media content item provided by a first content provider in a first media player application. In response to a user action on the first selectable information item, the unified television application 202 determines that the unified television application is operating in the restricted mode and the first media player application is not operating in the restricted mode, and the local content projection application is invoked by the unified television application 202 to display the first media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item on the networked television device 102.
Alternatively, in some implementations, the unified television application 202 determines that the unified television application is operating in the restricted mode and the first media player application may be operating in the restricted mode and the unified television application 202 invokes the first media player application to display the first media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item on the networked television device 102. In the restricted mode, the media player application 204 has a higher priority than the content projection application 902, which content projection application 902 is invoked only when the media player application 204 cannot operate in the restricted mode. The content projection application 902 is locally available to operate on behalf of the media player application 204 that is unable to meet the content selection criteria.
In some implementations, the media player applications 204 are associated with respective third party media content sources 110 that are independent of the unified television application, which is configured to introduce content selection criteria to limit media content provided via the respective media player applications. Alternatively, in some implementations, the media player application 204 is associated with the server system 104, and the server system 104 also implements the unified television application 202. Further, in some implementations, the content projection application 902 includes a plurality of media receiver modules 904 corresponding to the plurality of media player applications 204. In the restricted mode, the unified television application 202 applies content selection criteria to media content provided by the media content sources 110 associated with the media player application 204 via the respective media receiver modules 904 of the content projection application 902.
Fig. 10A is an example unified user interface 1000 displayed in a restricted mode on a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. Fig. 10B and 10C are two example sequences of user interfaces 1040 and 1080, respectively, sequentially displayed on the networked television device 102 in response to user actions on the remote control device 114 coupled to the networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. In the restricted mode, the content selection criteria define an age-based content rating and the first media content item corresponding to the plurality of selectable information items displayed on the unified user interface 1000 conforms to the age-based content rating. For example, a child area may be created in the corresponding unified television application 202. In some implementations, the first content provider is configured to provide one or more second media content items that are each distinct from the first media content items that correspond to selectable information items displayed on the unified user interface 1000. One or more second media content items may be played in the normal mode by a first media player application associated with the first content provider, but prohibited from being played in the restricted mode by the local content projection application 902.
In some implementations, the unified television application 202 loads the standard settings user interface and receives input on the standard settings user interface of the child age associated with the user account associated with the unified television application 202. The unified television application 202 is configured to automatically identify age-based content ratings based on input of child ages. When operating in the restricted mode, the server system 104 identifies an age-based content rating defined based on the child's age and selects a plurality of selectable information items for display on the unified user interface 1000 in accordance with the age-based content rating to create a child-friendly media environment on the television device 102.
As described above, in the restricted mode, the ordered subset 214 of unique programs is determined based at least in part on content filtering criteria. The selectable information items displayed on the television device 102 correspond to an ordered subset 214 of unique programs and are selected from the program information 210 associated with the one or more media player applications 204 according to content selection criteria. In some implementations, the program information 210 associated with one or more media player applications 204 includes a plurality of characteristic fields, such as an age rating field, for each media content item or program. The recommendation engine 212 compares the value of the age rating field with the age-based content rating to determine whether the corresponding media content item or program meets content selection criteria defining an age-based content rating.
Further, in some implementations, the first selectable information item is selected from first program information associated with the first media player application according to content selection criteria, and the first program information is provided at least in part by an information source that is distinct from the first media player application. For example, the first media player application (e.g., HBO) does not have a child zone and the corresponding program information 210 of the media content item provided thereby does not include an age rating field and may not be used to determine whether the media content item meets an age-based content rating. As one solution, the recommendation engine 212 may extract the program information 210 from another information source that is different from the first media player application to determine whether the media content items provided via the first media player application meet the age-based content ratings.
Referring to fig. 10B, in some implementations, when a unified user interface 1000 is displayed on the networked television device 102 to present a plurality of selectable information items, the television device 102 receives a user selection of a first selectable information item, for example, via the remote control device 114. In response to the user selection, the television apparatus 102 initiates playback of the first media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item. In an example, the television apparatus 102 sequentially displays a start-up image frame 1002 and a frame of the first media content item 1004 indicating that the first media content item was provided by the first media content provider. Referring to fig. 10C, in some cases, the television apparatus 102 responds to a user selection of a first selectable information item by initiating playback of a first media content item 1006 corresponding to the first selectable information item without displaying an initiating image frame 1002.
While the first media content item is being played on the television device 102, the television device 102 receives a user request to stop playback of the first media content item, for example, via the remote control device 114. In some implementations (fig. 10B), the television apparatus 102 ceases to display the first media content item and redisplays the plurality of clusters with selectable information items (i.e., the unified user interface 1000) in accordance with a determination that the unified television application 202 is operating in the restricted mode. Alternatively, in some implementations (fig. 10C), the television apparatus 102 ceases to display the first media content item and displays the home user interface 1008 of the first media player application in response to a user request, as determined by the unified television application 202 operating in the restricted mode. Further, in response to the additional user request, the television apparatus 102 exits the home user interface and redisplays the plurality of clusters (i.e., unified user interface 1000) with selectable information items. In contrast, in accordance with a determination that the unified television application is operating in the normal mode, the television apparatus 102 ceases to display the first media content item and one of the plurality of clusters and the home user interface 1008 of the first media player application is enabled to be redisplayed on the unified user interface 1000.
Fig. 11 is an example flowchart of a method 1100 of presenting selected media content provided by a media player application on a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The method 1100 is performed by the networked television device 102, and optionally is governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of the networked television device 102. Each of the operations shown in fig. 5 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1506 of the networked television device 102 in fig. 15). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 1100 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The television device 102 links to a user account in a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. The television device 102 executes (1102) the unified television application 202 to enable the unified user interface 1000 to be displayed on the networked television device. The unified television application 202 has 1104 a normal mode and a restricted mode and is associated with one or more standard media player applications 204 and a local content projection application 902. A plurality of clusters are displayed 1106 on the unified user interface 1000. Each cluster has a plurality of selectable information items. The television apparatus 102 identifies (1108) content selection criteria and selects (1110) a plurality of selectable information items from the program information 210 associated with the one or more media player applications 204 in accordance with the content selection criteria.
The television apparatus 102 receives (1112) a user action on a first selectable information item corresponding to a first media content item provided by a first content provider in a first media player application. In response to a user action (1114) on the first selectable information item, in accordance with a determination that the unified television application is operating in the restricted mode, and a determination that the first media player application is not operating in the restricted mode, the television device 102 displays (1116) a first media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item on the networked television device via the local content projection application. Alternatively, in response to a user action (1114) on the first selectable information item, the television apparatus 102 displays (1118) a first media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item on the networked television apparatus 102 via the first media player application in accordance with a determination that the unified television application is operating in the normal mode.
In some implementations, the first content provider is configured to provide one or more second media content items, each of the one or more second media content items being distinct from a plurality of media content items corresponding to the plurality of selectable information items. The first media player application is configured to play one or more second media content items in a normal mode. One or more second media content items are prohibited from being played by the local content projection application in the restricted mode.
FIG. 12 is an example operating environment 1200 in which focused items (also referred to as tiles) provided by a recommendation engine 212, one or more advertisement (ad) providers, and a commercialization module 1202 are mixed for display on a networked television device 102, according to some implementations. The one or more advertisement providers include an internal advertisement provider 1204 hosted and managed by the server system 104 and/or an external third party advertisement source 106 not hosted by the server system 104. The advertisement management module 1208 is coupled to one or more advertisement providers and is configured to manage advertisement content provided by the one or more advertisement providers. The recommendation engine 212 is configured to compare the multidimensional unified user activity characteristic 208 with program information 210 of a plurality of unique programs provided by the media content source 204 to identify an ordered subset 214 of unique programs to be recommended to the user via the unified television application 202. In particular, the recommendation engine 212 may recommend media content provided by broadcast services (television, satellite or cable) and Video On Demand (VOD) content providers to a target at a user of the television apparatus 102 based on the user activity characteristics 208. The merchandising module 1202 is hosted and managed by the server system 104 and is configured to provide focused items selected by the server system 104 for promotion. The focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 is optionally determined independently of the user activity characteristics 208 or based on the user activity characteristics 208 of the user. In some implementations, the focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 is an advertisement requesting the user to subscribe to a service provided by the SVOD content provider, purchase or rent certain media content, or play an online game. For example, the focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 includes a trailer clip associated with a newly released movie. In some implementations, the focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 is provided by the TVOD content provider independent of the user activity characteristics 208 of any particular user (i.e., the focused item is associated with the TVOD content provider and pushed to the television device 102 by the commercialization module 1202). Alternatively, in some cases, the focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 is determined by the server system 104 based on user activity characteristics 208 of multiple users across different use cases in a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. In an example, each focused item selected by the commercialization module 1202 is determined based on one or more of a content type/format, content quality, recency, popularity, seasonal, and application lifecycle of the respective focused item.
Referring to fig. 3, the unified television application 202 is executed to enable the unified user interface 300 to be displayed on the networked television device 102, and the unified user interface 300 has a focus area 362 (e.g., a highlighted area of the user interface) configured to display a plurality of focus items. The focus area 362 is optionally located on the top half area of the unified user interface 300. A plurality of focus items are sequentially displayed in the focus area 362 according to the time order. Optionally, the plurality of focus items are organized in time as a carousel, smoothly transitioning to the start focus item after the end focus item is displayed. Each focused item is associated with a respective focused item provider selected from the commercialization module 1202, the advertisement management module 1208, and the media recommendation engine 212. The server system 104 includes a mixer 1206, the mixer 1206 being configured to automatically mix the plurality of focused items according to a chronological order. In some implementations, the focal region 362 extends to partially overlap with a subset of the selectable information items 302-332. In an example, the focus area 362 covers the entire unified user interface 300 and overlaps with all of the selectable information items 302-332. That is, a subset or all of the selectable information items 302 to 332 are displayed on the background of the focus area 362, and a plurality of focus items are sequentially displayed on the background of the subset or all of the selectable information items 302 to 332.
In addition, the advertisement management module 1208 of the server system 104 also includes an advertisement conversion module (not shown in FIG. 12) configured to customize media content items received from the external advertisement source 106 for display in the focus area 362 of the unified user interface 300. For example, the plurality of focus items includes a first focus item. The television apparatus 102 sends a request for a first focused item to the first advertiser server 106 and the request includes information for a plurality of predefined user interface elements that unify a focus area of the user interface. In response to the request, the television apparatus 102 receives a plurality of media content items associated with the first focused item from the first advertiser server 106 and merges the plurality of media content items into the first focused item for display on the focus area during a time slot corresponding to the first focused item. In some implementations, the plurality of media content items includes a subset of media content items that conform to a Video Advertisement Service Template (VAST) standard for communication requirements between the first advertiser server and the networked television device. As such, the advertisement conversion module of the advertisement management module 1208 is configured to merge a subset of the content items into a first focused item and customize the first focused item for display on the unified user interface 3000 of the networked television device 102.
Examples of predefined user interface elements of the focus area 362 include one or more of the following: background images, stylized title/logo images, descriptions including popular, action calls, title text, application names, source tags, package names, click links, and video clips. The background image may include an image of characters without any text. The request for the first focused item sent to the first advertiser server defines which portion of the character image needs to be kept empty in order to place the title. In some implementations, logo images are necessary, while stylized fonts are optional and facilitate single line description of media content associated with the first focused item. The action call includes actions that may be selected for the first focused item, such as "immediately subscribed to," "rentable," "immediately watched," "requiring subscription," "entering a movie theater soon," "adding an application to a favorites line," and "adding a channel to a home screen," and the server system 104 associates the first focused item with a subset of the selectable actions. When a stylized title is not available, the title text will be used. The first focused item carries a source tag that highlights to the user of the television apparatus 102 whether the content is an advertisement, a commercial unit, or a recommendation. Clicking on the link includes including a link to an application, content in the application, or a commercial web page associated with the first focused item, and clicking on the first focused item automatically causes activation of the link.
In an example, the first focused item includes a still advertising image of a movie being theatred and the first focused item includes a link 364 for purchasing tickets and/or a link 366 for subscribing to a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD). In some implementations, the static advertising image display "now available on DVD …" has links to renting DVDs corresponding to movies.
In some implementations, the plurality of focused items include video clips or still images configured to highlight media content items provided by a broadcast television service, a broadcast satellite service, a cable television service, an SVOD content provider, or an AVOD service. The recommendation engine 212 of the server system 104 identifies the multi-dimensional user activity characteristics 208 of the user of the networked television device 102, obtains the program information 210 associated with the plurality of media player applications 204, and identifies the highlighted media content items for recommendation to the user via the unified television application. Specifically, the highlighted media content item is displayed to the user of the television apparatus 102 in the focus area 362 of the unified user interface 300. The information of the highlighted media content may be further provided to the recommendation engine 212 to update the multi-dimensional user activity characteristics 208 and subsequent recommendations of media content items.
In some implementations, the plurality of focus items sequentially displayed in the focus area 362 further includes a second focus item, and the second focus item includes a video clip or still image configured to highlight the media content item provided by the TVOD content provider. A video clip or still image is displayed during the time slot corresponding to the second focus item. In response to a user action on the displayed video clip or still image, a TVOD media application is executed to allow the user to purchase and play a media content item corresponding to the second focus item. In some cases, the video clip or still image is sponsored by the TVOD content provider or selected by the server system 104 to promote the corresponding media content item independent of the user activity characteristics 208 of the user of the networked television device 102.
Referring to FIG. 3, in some implementations, a plurality of focused items are displayed simultaneously with a plurality of selectable information items organized by cluster. While the selectable information items of each cluster are distributed parallel to the first axis 344, the focal region and the plurality of clusters are distributed along a second axis 346 of the unified user interface 300 that is distinct from the first axis 344. The focal region is fixed on the unified user interface 300 independent of the display of the plurality of selectable information items on a non-focal region distinct from and not overlapping the focal region. In particular, the focused item is displayed in a fixed focus area regardless of whether the selectable information item is moved within, into, or out of the non-focus area. In some implementations, a plurality of focus item indicators 368 are displayed with the focus item. Each focus item indicator 368 represents a respective one of a plurality of focus items. For each of the plurality of focus items, the television apparatus 102 displays a respective focus item indicator according to the activity specification 370a in accordance with a determination that the respective focus item is displayed in the focus area. In accordance with a determination that the respective focus item is not displayed in the focus area, the television apparatus 102 displays the respective focus item indicator in accordance with an inactivity specification 370b that is different from the activity specification 370 a.
In some cases, when one of the plurality of focused items is displayed in the focus area 362, the television apparatus 102 receives a predefined user action associated with the respective focused item (e.g., clicks a "last" or "next" button on the remote control device 114). In response to the predefined user action, the television apparatus 102 ceases to display the respective focused item and displays in the focused region of the unified user interface (1) a subsequent focused item chronologically subsequent to the respective focused item, or (2) a previous focused item chronologically preceding the respective focused item.
The focus item is often updated in the focus area 362 to preserve its freshness. For example, the server system 104 determines the number of times a plurality of focus items have been sequentially displayed in the focus area 362 according to the chronological order. Based on a determination that the number of times is equal to or greater than a predetermined play threshold (e.g., 2 times), the server system 104 replaces at least one of the plurality of focus items with the replaceable focus item.
Further, in some implementations, the server system 104 is configured to deduplicate the focused items that are sequentially displayed in the focus area 362. The plurality of focus items includes a second focus item in addition to the first focus area. The mixer 1206 receives two or more original items, each from a different content provider selected from the merchandising module 1202, the advertiser 106, and the media recommendation engine 212. The mixer 1206 deduplicates two or more original items according to the order of preference of the merchandizing module 1202, the advertiser 106, and the media recommendation engine 212 to produce a second focused item. In an example, the order of preference defines a decreasing preference of the advertiser 106, the commercialization module 1202, and the media recommendation engine 212, which prioritizes the advertiser 106 over any other content sources.
In some implementations, information of the user action associated with the focus area is provided to one of the commercialization module 1202, the recommendation engine 212, and the advertisement management module 1208 that provides the focus item displayed in the focus area. The information of the user action indicates user preferences of the user of the networked television device 102 with respect to the plurality of focus items displayed in the focus area. Each of the recommendation engine 212, the advertisement management module 1208, and the merchandising module 1202 may determine one or more additional focused items for a user based on user preferences of the user or based on user preferences of a plurality of users associated with the user of the networked television device 102.
Fig. 13 is an example flowchart of a method 1300 of mixing focused content (including VAST-based advertisements) on a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The method 1300 is performed by the server system 104 and is optionally governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of the server system 104. Each of the operations shown in fig. 13 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1406 of server system 104 in fig. 14A). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 1300 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The server system 104 hosts a virtual user domain that includes user accounts. The user account is associated with the unified television application 202 and the plurality of media player applications 204 (1302). The unified television application 202 is associated with the networked television device 102 (1304) and is configured to enable display of media content on the television device 102, and each of the plurality of media player applications 204 is configured to display media content provided by a respective content provider 110. The unified television application 202 is executed (1306) to enable a unified user interface to be displayed on the networked television device 102. The unified user interface 300 has a focus area 362 configured to display a plurality of focus items. A plurality of focus items (also referred to as tiles) are sequentially displayed (1308) in the focus region 362 according to a temporal order (e.g., similar to a carousel). Each focused item is associated with a respective focused item provider selected from the commercialization module, the advertiser, and the media recommendation engine.
The plurality of focus items includes a first focus item. The server system 104 sends (1310) a request for a first focused item to a first advertiser server. Information is requested that includes a plurality of predefined user interface elements that unify a focus area of a user interface. In response to the request, the server system 104 receives (1312) a plurality of media content items associated with the first focused item from the first advertiser server and merges the plurality of media content items into the first focused item for display on the focus area 362 during the time slot corresponding to the first focused item.
In some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, the unified user interface can include a plurality of tab interfaces, wherein one of the tab interfaces includes upcoming media content (e.g., an "upcoming" tab interface). For example, a tab interface including upcoming media content may present a media recommendation stream including an ordered set of upcoming media content items, wherein upcoming media content items in the media recommendation stream may be selected from different content sources based on each of a plurality of media player applications (e.g., youTube, google Play, netflix, hulu, amazon Prime, television channel applications, etc.) and a plurality of user applications (e.g., email applications, map applications, auxiliary applications, home device applications, online retailer applications, etc.) with a unified user interface. In continuing this example, upcoming media content in the tab interface can be organized into a plurality of clusters based on one or more categories such as: release time (e.g., "this week," "next month," etc.), user actions and user application interactions (e.g., "my upcoming" content items), media play application usage (e.g., upcoming items from a particular media play application), etc.
Fig. 16 is an example flowchart of a method 1600 of providing knowledge-based media content recommendations to a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. Method 1600 may be performed by server system 104, and may optionally be governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of server system 104. Each of the operations shown in fig. 16 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1406 of server system 104 in fig. 14A). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 1600 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The server system 104 may host a virtual user domain that includes a user account. Server system 104 associates the user account with unified television application 202, the plurality of media player applications 204, and the plurality of user applications (1602). The unified television application 202 may be associated with the networked television device 102 and the plurality of user applications include at least an internet search engine 206. For each of the unified television application, the media player application, and the user application, the server system stores (1604) the corresponding activity data.
In some implementations, the server system 104 can store (1606) search queries and search results for a plurality of search operations implemented by the internet search engine 206 from the user account. For example, the server system 104 may determine that a user of the user account has entered a search query for media content items. Such search queries may be received, for example, through a microphone on the networked television device 102 or on an associated remote control device. In continuing this example, when one or more search results include upcoming media content that is not currently available for playback on the networked television device, the search results may be included in a media recommendation stream that is used to present clusters of upcoming media content items on a tabbed interface (e.g., an "upcoming" tabbed interface). In another example, when one or more search results include upcoming media content that is not currently available for playback on a networked television device, a user of the user account may select upcoming media content items to include in a media recommendation stream for presenting clusters of upcoming media content items on a tab interface (e.g., the "my upcoming" clusters in the "upcoming" tab interface). It should be noted that the search queries and search results may also be performed by an auxiliary application executing on the networked television device 102 or any other suitable user application.
In some implementations, the server system 104 can store (1608) viewing information, media interaction information, and application usage information associated with user accounts of a subset of the media player applications 204. For example, the server system 104 may determine that a user of the user account has selected media content items available from the content source for playback, and in response, may select upcoming media content items that are similar to the selected media content items for inclusion in a media recommendation stream that is used to present clusters of upcoming media content items on the tab interface. In another example, the server system 104 can determine that a user of the user account has selected a media player application from one of the tab interfaces (e.g., the "home" tab interface) for viewing media content items, and in response, can select upcoming media content items associated with a content source corresponding to the selected media player application to be included in a media recommendation stream for presenting clusters of upcoming media content items on the tab interface (e.g., the "upcoming" tab interface) of the upcoming media content items.
In some implementations, the media interaction information may also include purchase information associated with user accounts of the subset of user applications. For example, the server system 104 may store purchase information indicating that the user has purchased an upcoming media content item that is not currently available for playback. In response, the server system 104 can add the upcoming media content items purchased by the user of the user account to a media recommendation stream that is used to present the clusters of upcoming media content items on a tab interface (e.g., an "upcoming" tab interface) of the upcoming media content.
In some implementations, the server system 104 can store 1610 user actions associated with the user account. For example, the server system 104 can determine that a user of the user account has entered a search query for media content items and that the user has selected upcoming media content items in search results in response to the search query for inclusion in a media recommendation stream for presenting clusters of upcoming media content items on a tab interface (e.g., "my upcoming" clusters in an "upcoming" tab interface). In another example, the server system 104 can determine that a user of the user account has interacted with an upcoming media content item on a different tab interface (e.g., a "home" tab interface) and that the user has selected the upcoming media content item in the search results in response to the search query to include in the media recommendation stream for presenting a cluster of upcoming media content items on the tab interface (e.g., a "my upcoming" cluster in the "upcoming" tab interface). In yet another example, the server system 104 can determine that a user of the user account has interacted with the media player application, and in response, the server system 104 can recommend upcoming media content items associated with a content source corresponding to the media player application for inclusion in a media recommendation stream for presenting clusters of upcoming media content items on a tab interface (e.g., an "upcoming" tab interface) of the upcoming media content items.
In some implementations, the multi-dimensional unified user activity characteristic 208 may thus be calculated (1612) from the stored activity data.
Similar to fig. 4, server system 104 may also obtain (1614) program information associated with the plurality of media player applications 204, generating deduplication program information 210 for the plurality of unique programs. In some implementations, a first upcoming media content item can be provided by a first media player application and can be associated with first program information, and a second upcoming media content item can be provided by a second media player application and can be associated with second program information in the second media player application. Server system 104 may identify (1618) a level of similarity for the first and second program information. Based on the determination that the similarity level exceeds the similarity threshold (1618), the server system 104 may deduplicate (1620) the first program information of the first upcoming media content item and the second program information of the second upcoming media content item, and may determine (1622) that the unique program is associated with both the first and second upcoming media content items.
Based on the user activity characteristics 208 and the program information 210 for the plurality of unique programs, the server system 104 may identify (1624) an ordered subset 214 of the unique programs for recommendation to the user via the unified television application 202. The server system 104 may enable (1626) the display of an ordered sequence of information items (e.g., items 1802-1830 in fig. 18) corresponding to the ordered subset 214 of unique programs via the unified television application 202. Each information item represents a respective unique program or media content item provided by the corresponding media player application 204. For example, as shown in FIG. 18, each information item may represent an upcoming media content item from a different content source.
Fig. 17 is an example flowchart of a method 1700 of presenting program information in a tab interface that includes upcoming media content items on a networked television device 102, according to some embodiments. The method 1700 may be performed by the networked television device 102, and may optionally be governed by instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of the networked television device 102. Each of the operations shown in fig. 17 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or a non-transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., memory 1506 of the networked television device 102 in fig. 15). The computer readable storage medium may include a magnetic or optical disk storage device, a solid state storage device such as flash memory, or other non-volatile storage device or devices. The instructions stored on the computer-readable storage medium may include one or more of source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction formats that are interpreted by one or more processors. Some operations in method 500 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
The networked television device 102 may be linked to a user account in a virtual user domain hosted by the server system 104. For example, the user account may be associated with a unified user interface presented on the networked television device 102, a plurality of media player applications executing in the networked television device 102, and a plurality of user applications executing in the networked television device 102. Examples of media player applications may include, but are not limited to, youTube, google Play, netflix, hulu, amazon Prime, HBO, and some television channel applications (e.g., ESPN, NBC, ABC, PBS, etc.). Examples of user applications may include, but are not limited to, email applications (e.g., google Gmail), map applications (e.g., google Maps), auxiliary applications (e.g., google Assistant), home device applications (e.g., google home, post Camera, post Hello, etc.), and online retailer applications (e.g., google scroll ping).
The networked television device 102 may execute (1702) the unified television application 202 to display the unified user interface 1800. The media recommendation stream may be obtained (1704) from the server system 104 and may include an ordered sequence of selectable information items 1802-1830 in fig. 18, corresponding to the ordered set 214 of unique media content items or programs. For each selectable information item, the media recommendation stream includes (1706) a respective command to be executed in response to a user selection of the respective selectable information item at the networked television device 102.
In some implementations, the unified user interface 1800 can include a plurality of tab interfaces 1850, where one of the tab interfaces 1850 corresponds to upcoming media content. As shown in fig. 18, a tab interface corresponding to upcoming media content (e.g., an "upcoming" tab) has been selected from a plurality of tab interfaces 1850. As also shown in fig. 18, one of the tab interfaces 1850 may correspond to a search engine interface for searching media content available to the networked television device 102, or a main interface presenting recommended media content items and configurable by a user of the user account. It should be noted that any suitable number of tabs may be included in the multiple tab interface 1850.
For example, in some implementations, a tab interface including upcoming media content may present a media recommendation stream including an ordered set of upcoming media content items, where upcoming media content items in the media recommendation stream may be selected from different content sources based on each of a plurality of media player applications (e.g., youTube, google Play, netflix, hulu, amazon Prime, television channel applications, etc.) and a plurality of user applications (e.g., email applications, map applications, auxiliary applications, home device applications, online retailer applications, etc.) having a unified user interface.
The networked television device 102 may display (1708) a plurality of clusters 1840-1844 on the unified user interface 1800. Each cluster 1840-1844 may include a subset of the ordered sequence of (110) selectable information items 1802-1830. For example, the first cluster 1840 may include, among other things, a first selectable information item 1802 and a second selectable information item 1804. The first and second selectable information items 1802 and 1804 of the first cluster 1840 may be displayed (510) simultaneously on the unified user interface 1800. In some implementations, the information of the content provider associated with the first and second selectable information times can be hidden on the unified user interface 1800 that displays the first and second selectable information items in the first cluster 1840. It should be noted that each cluster 1840-1844 may include any suitable number of information items, each representing an upcoming media content item.
As shown in fig. 18, the unified user interface 1800 may include a tabbed interface, wherein one of the tabbed interfaces includes upcoming media content organized into a plurality of clusters based on one or more categories, such as: release time (e.g., "this week", "next month", etc.), user actions and user application interactions (e.g., "my upcoming" content item), media play application usage (e.g., as an upcoming item from application ABC "), etc.
In response to a first user interaction with the first selectable information item, the networked television device 102 may display additional information for the first upcoming media content item (e.g., retrieved from the first content provider, provided from a first media player application associated with the first content provider, etc.). For example, as shown in fig. 19, in response to hovering over an information item 1802, highlighting the information item 1802, or otherwise interacting with the information item 1802 using a remote control or any other suitable input device, the unified user interface 1800 may be updated by modifying the size of tiles of the information item 1802 to information items 1910 and by displaying additional information 1920 (e.g., media title, release date, content type, media content item short description, rating information, actor information, time information, etc.) of the upcoming media content item.
In response to a second user interaction with the second selectable information item, the networked television device 102 may display additional information for the second upcoming media content item. For example, as shown in fig. 20, in response to hovering over an information item 1804, highlighting the information item 1804, or otherwise interacting with the information item 1804 after previously interacting with the information item 1802 using a remote control or any other suitable input device, the unified user interface 1800 may be updated by: the dimensions of the tiles of information items 1802 and 1804 are modified (e.g., wherein the dimensions of the tiles of information item 1910 are returned to information item 1802 and wherein the dimensions of the tiles of information item 1804 are modified to information item 2010), and additional information 1920 of the upcoming media content item of information item 1804 is displayed (e.g., media title, release date, content type, brief description of the media content item, rating information, actor information, timing information, etc.), while additional information 1920 of the upcoming media content item of information item 1802 is prohibited from being displayed.
It should be noted that both the first selectable information item and the second selectable information item may be associated with upcoming media content items provided by different content sources. For example, as shown in fig. 18, each information item in the cluster 1840 may be provided by a different content source (e.g., a different media content provider).
It should also be noted that in response to the first user interaction or the second user interaction being greater than a threshold period of time (e.g., more than five seconds), the information item 1910 in fig. 19 or the information item 2010 in fig. 20 may be replaced with a preview of the upcoming media content item. For example, in response to determining that a preview of an upcoming media content item is available from a corresponding content provider, and in response to determining that user interaction (e.g., hovering, highlighting, etc.) has continued for more than a threshold period of time, unified user interface 1800 may be updated by: a static representation (e.g., thumbnail, tile, etc.) of the upcoming media content item is replaced with a preview of the upcoming media content item retrieved from the corresponding content provider and automatically started to be played back. In continuing this example, in response to determining that the provision of user interaction has ceased (e.g., movement of the highlight region to another information item), the unified user interface 1800 may be updated by prohibiting presentation of the preview of the upcoming media content item and may replace the preview of the upcoming media content item with a static representation of the upcoming media content item.
In some implementations, the selection of the first selectable information item and the second selectable information item in clusters 1840 through 1844 may be configured in any suitable manner. For example, the first selectable information item and the second selectable information in the "current week" cluster 1840 may be selected based on: user activity data having a unified user interface (e.g., user interactions and/or user selections of items within the unified user interface, user interactions and/or user selections of items within different tabs of the unified user interface, etc.), user activity data with each of a plurality of media player applications (e.g., media player applications that have been installed on the networked television device 102, media player applications that are accessed more frequently, media player applications that are used more than a threshold number of times to play back media content items, etc.), and user activity data with each of a plurality of user applications (e.g., search requests entered by a user, search results selected by a user in an auxiliary application, etc.). In another example, as shown in fig. 18, the first selectable information item and the second selectable information in the "week" cluster 1840 may be selected based on a type of user activity data selected in response to selecting the channel customization interface element 1860. In continuing with this example, in response to selecting the channel customization interface element 1860, the unified user interface 1800 may be updated to provide the user with an opportunity to select user activity data (e.g., movie content and episode content from a particular content provider, movie content or episode content available in the next month, movie content and episode content related to selected user search results from an auxiliary application but unrelated to search results from a mapping application, etc.) that will be used to select an upcoming media content item in the media recommendation stream.
In a more specific example, selectable information items corresponding to upcoming media content items in the media recommendation stream may be selected based on search results entered by a user. As shown in fig. 21, in the "search" tab of the unified user interface 1800, a search query 2110 of "the kinegsman" may be received from a user (where the search query may be entered into a search interface presented on the networked television device 102 via text input using a remote control device, via audio input using a microphone on the networked television device 102 or remote control device, etc.). In response to receiving the search query 2110, the networked television device 102 may update the unified user interface 1800 to present the search results 2120 to 2140 responsive to the search query 2110, where each search result may be optional. In continuing with The example, in response to selecting a search result, such as search result 2140 for an upcoming media content item titled "The King's Man", the networked television device 102 may update The unified user interface 1800 to display additional information 2210 (e.g., media title, release date, content type, content category, brief description of The media content item, rating information, actor information, time information, etc.) for The upcoming media content item as shown in fig. 22.
In some implementations, the unified user interface 1800 can provide the user with an interface element 2210 when viewing additional information for the upcoming content item in the search results, which when selected causes the selected upcoming content item to be added to the media recommendation stream of upcoming media content presented in the tab interface of the unified user interface 1800. For example, as shown in fig. 23, in response to selecting interface element 2210 to add an upcoming content item entitled "The King's Man" to a media recommendation stream of upcoming media content, a selection confirmation interface 2310 (e.g., "add to upcoming") may be presented on unified user interface 1800. The upcoming media content item may be added to the clusters 1840, 1842, or 1844, for example, based on whether it meets the availability criteria associated with each cluster. In another example, the upcoming media content item may be added to a cluster (e.g., a "my upcoming" cluster) that includes the user-selected upcoming media content item.
In some implementations, the unified user interface 1800 can provide relevant media content items to a user when viewing additional information for upcoming content items in search results. For example, referring back to FIG. 22, unified user interface 1800 can provide one or more media content items 2230 related to search results to a user. Such media content items 2230 may include available media content items and/or upcoming media content items. Similar to fig. 22, in response to selecting one of the related media content items, the networked television device 102 may update the unified user interface 1800 to display additional information for the media content item (e.g., media title, release date, content type, content category, brief description of the media content item, rating information, actor information, time information, etc.).
It should also be noted that the first selectable information item and the second selectable information item may be associated with upcoming media content items of different content types, respectively. For example, as shown in fig. 19 and 20 in the additional information presented in relation to each upcoming media content item that the user has interacted with, the upcoming media content item corresponding to the first selectable information item 1910 in fig. 19 is associated with a movie, while the upcoming media content item corresponding to the second selectable information item 2010 in fig. 20 is associated with a series or other episode content. Any suitable content type may be included within each cluster, such as movie content, television content, series or episode content, audio content, game content, and the like.
In another more specific example, selectable information items corresponding to upcoming media content items in the media recommendation stream may be selected based on user activity in other tab interfaces of the unified user interface 1800. For example, referring back to fig. 18, the unified user interface 1800 may include multiple tab interfaces, where one of the tab interfaces includes upcoming media content (e.g., an "upcoming" tab interface) and another of the tab interfaces includes a media content recommendation interface (e.g., a "home" tab interface) that is presented when the unified television application is executed. Turning to fig. 24 and 25, in response to selecting a recommended media content item in the "home" tab interface of the unified user interface 1800, the networked television device 102 may store user activities such as the selected media content item, the media content item related to the selected media content item, metadata associated with the selected media content item, a media player application associated with the selected media content item, a content provider associated with the selected media content item, and the like. As shown in fig. 25, in response to selecting a recommended media content item 2410 provided by a particular content provider (e.g., provider a) in a "home" tab interface of the unified user interface 1800, the unified user interface 1800 may provide an option interface 2510 to the user that includes an upcoming option 2512 for adding the recommended content item to the tab interface of the upcoming media content (e.g., in response to determining that the selected content item is not currently available but meets the availability criteria of a cluster in the tab interface of the upcoming media content item), a queue option 2514 for adding the recommended content item to a playback queue of media content, and/or a removal option 2516 for removing the selected content item from the user being recommended to the user account in any tab interface of the unified user interface 1800.
In connection with the above-described examples in fig. 22 and 25, in response to selection of interface element 2210 in fig. 22 that causes the selected upcoming content item to be added to the media recommendation stream of upcoming media content presented in the tab interface of unified user interface 1800, and in response to selection of upcoming option 2512 in fig. 25 for adding a recommended content item to the tab interface of upcoming media, the upcoming content item may be added to the media recommendation stream of upcoming media content and presented in a cluster (e.g., a "my upcoming" cluster) that includes the user-selected upcoming media content item. For example, as shown in fig. 26, clusters 2610 on the tab interface of the upcoming media content item may be updated to include selectable information items 2140 and selectable information items 2410.
In some implementations, the tabbed interface of the unified user interface 1800 can also be updated to include clusters corresponding to particular media player applications or particular content providers based on user activity with particular media player applications or with particular content providers. For example, as shown in fig. 26, upcoming content items in a media recommendation stream of upcoming media content associated with a particular media player application may be presented in clusters 2620 (e.g., upcoming content "from application").
In some implementations, additionally or alternatively to interacting with selectable information items in the tabbed interface of the unified user interface 1800, selecting an information item corresponding to an upcoming media content item can result in presenting an option interface, such as option interface 2710 in fig. 27. For example, in response to selecting information item 1802, option interface 2710 may be an overlay interface that includes: notification options 2712 for being notified when an upcoming content item becomes available from a corresponding content provider (e.g., using a corresponding media player application); a queue option 2714 for automatically adding an upcoming content item to a playback queue of media content when the upcoming content item becomes available from a corresponding content provider; and/or remove option 2716 for removing upcoming content items from users being recommended to the user account in the media recommendation stream.
In response to selecting an option to be notified of the availability of an upcoming media content item (e.g., selecting notification option 2712 associated with information item 1802), the networked television device 102 may provide a notification to a user of the user account within the unified user interface. For example, as shown in FIG. 28, notification overlays 2800 can be presented within a unified user interface. In a more specific example, notification overlay 2800 may be positioned with a focus area, such as focus area 362 located on the top half of unified user interface 1800. As shown in fig. 28, notification overlay 2800 may be positioned over one or more focus items currently being presented within the focus area.
Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, a notification indicator may be presented within the unified user interface 1800 that, once selected, may provide one or more notifications to the user, such as a notification of availability of the upcoming media content item (e.g., a notification that the upcoming media content item is available for playback and may be added to a playback queue, a notification that the upcoming media content item will be available for playback in the next 24 hours, etc.).
Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, the networked television device 102 may provide detailed notifications with one or more tab interfaces. For example, as shown in fig. 29, a notification panel 2900 may be presented within the unified user interface 1800, wherein one or more clusters of recommended media content items may be moved downward such that the notification panel 2900 may be presented in the first row of each tab interface. As also shown in fig. 29, for an upcoming media content item that is now available for playback using a corresponding media player application, notification panel 2900 may include a title of the media content item (e.g., "upcoming movie title a"), a description of the media content item, and/or any other suitable information. In some implementations, the notification panel 2900 can include a detailed information option 2910 that, when selected, presents additional information (e.g., such as additional information in fig. 23) related to the media content item. In some implementations, the notification pane 2900 can include a dismissal option 2920, which dismissal option 2920, when selected, prohibits presentation of the notification pane 2900 within the unified user interface 1800. For example, in response to selecting dismissal option 2920, notification pane 2900 may be removed, and the cluster of recommended media content items may be moved upward to its initial location.
It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in each of fig. 4, 5, 11, 13, 16, and 17 are described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described order is merely the only order in which the operations may be performed. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize various ways to display information items and focus content in a unified user interface as described herein. Further, it should be noted that the details described with respect to one of the processes 400, 500, 1100, 1300, 1600, and 1700 may also apply in a similar manner to any other of the methods 400, 500, 1100, 1300, 1600, and 1700. Similar details are not repeated for the sake of brevity.
