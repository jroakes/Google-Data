- AGVs Autonomous Guided Vehicles
- stereo sensors may be advantageous to use stereo sensors as safety sensors for AGVs.
- stereo sensors may sometimes have problems with detecting obstacles located within a short range of the AGV.
- a stereo sensor uses two optical elements to measure the distance to objects in a scene. Images from each optical element are correlated to find possible matches in the scene. After matches are determined, the distance to objects may be calculated. As a result, a stereo sensor can calculate distances to objects only in the region of overlap between the field of view of its two optical elements. This method of operation is therefore limited by the field of view of each camera, making it difficult for a stereo sensor to detect objects located within a short distance from the sensor. As such, when the AGV is using a stereo sensor as a safety sensor, it may use a different system to detect objects of at least a predetermined minimum size up to some distance in the direction of travel of the AGV.
- laser sensors may be used to augment stereo sensors in a safety system of the AGV.
- the laser sensors may project narrow laser beams, which are effective at measuring distances to objects by detecting reflected beams.
- the objects may be located within a short distance from the sensor.
- the short range laser sensors may be aligned at a certain height in a horizontal plane on the front end of the AGV.
- the laser sensors may be arranged in other configurations (e.g., arranged horizontally in multiple rows on the front end of the AGV). The spacing of the sensors on the AGV may be chosen such that the sensors are able to detect obstacles of at least predetermined size up to a predetermined distance.
- the laser sensors may provide the controller of the system with laser sensor data indicative of a first region of coverage up to a first predetermined distance in front of the device.
- the stereo sensors may be mounted on the AGV in a configuration that provides the AGV safety system controller with stereo sensor data indicative of a second region of coverage past a second predetermined distance in front of the device.
- the predetermined distance for each sensor type is determined such that the distance is within the range of each sensor.
- the predetermined distances may also be chosen such that the resulting regions of coverage for each sensor overlap.
- the stereo sensor(s) may be arranged on the AGV such that its region of coverage is wider than the width of the AGV.
- the laser sensor(s) may have a region of coverage that has width that is substantially as wide as the AGV.
- the overall region of coverage for the safety system may be a combination of the first region and the second region.
- the controller of the safety system may use the data provided by both types of sensors to detect one or more obstacles in its overall region of coverage. Specifically, it may use laser sensor data to detect obstacles in the first region of coverage, and may use stereo sensor data to detect obstacles in the second region of coverage. Further, in embodiments with an overlapping region of coverage, the controller may use either the laser sensor data or the stereo sensor data to detect obstacles.
- the safety system may assist in the navigation of the AGV by providing instructions to the control system of the AGV.
- the control system may control the speed of the AGV based on the sensor data and instructions that it receives from the controller of the safety system.
- the control system may direct the AGV to maneuver around an obstacle based on the received data.
- the safety system may be implemented within the control system of the AGV, where both systems are governed by a single controller.
- the safety system of the AGV may also be equipped with a plurality of optical elements that make up two or more stereo sensors.
- the AGV is equipped with two stereo sensors comprised of two primary optical elements and one secondary stereo optical element.
- one primary optical element and the secondary optical element may be arranged on the AGV in a wide baseline arrangement.
- the other primary optical element and the secondary optical element may be arranged in a narrow baseline arrangement on the AGV, to make up the second stereo sensor.
- the two optical elements may be arranged closer together than the two optical elements in the wide baseline arrangement.
- the wide baseline sensor may be suitable for long range obstacle detection
- the narrow baseline sensor may be suitable for short range obstacle detection.
- laser sensors may be used with a multi-baseline stereo system to augment the multiple baseline stereo sensors for short range obstacle detection.
- Example embodiments may involve a robotic fleet deployed within a warehouse environment. More specifically, a combination of fixed and mobile components may be deployed within the environment to facilitate automated processing of boxes, packages, or other types of objects.
- Example systems may involve automated loading and/or unloading of boxes and/or other objects, such as into storage containers or to and from delivery vehicles.
- boxes or objects may be automatically organized and placed onto pallets.
- automating the process of loading/unloading trucks and/or the process of creating pallets from objects for easier storage within a warehouse and/or for transport to and from the warehouse may provide a number of industrial and business advantages.
- automating the process of loading and/or unloading delivery trucks at the warehouse and/or the process of creating pallets may include the deployment of one or more different types of robotic devices to move objects or perform other functions.
- some of the robotic devices can be made mobile by coupling with a wheeled base, a holonomic base (e.g., a base that can move in any direction), or rails on the ceiling, walls, or floors.
- some of the robotic devices may be made fixed within the environment as well. For instance, robotic manipulators can be positioned on elevated bases at different chosen locations within a warehouse.
- a warehouse may refer to any physical environment in which boxes or objects may be manipulated, processed, and/or stored by robotic devices.
- a warehouse may be a single physical building or structure, which may additionally contain certain fixed components, such as pallet racks for storing pallets of objects.
- some fixed components may be installed or otherwise positioned within the environment before or during object processing.
- a warehouse may include multiple separate physical structures, and/or may also include physical spaces that are not covered by a physical structure as well.
- boxes may refer to any object or item that can be placed onto a pallet or loaded onto or unloaded from a truck or container.
- “boxes” can refer to cans, drums, tires or any other “simple” shaped geometric items.
- boxes may refer to totes, bins, or other types of containers which may contain one or more items for transport or storage. For instance, plastic storage totes, fiberglass trays, or steel bins may be moved or otherwise manipulated by robots within a warehouse. Examples herein may also be applied toward objects other than boxes as well, and toward objects of various sizes and shapes. Additionally, “loading” and “unloading” can each be used to imply the other.
- palletizing refers to loading boxes onto a pallet and stacking or arranging the boxes in a way such that the boxes on the pallet can be stored or transported on the pallet.
- the terms “palletizing” and “depalletizing” can each be used to imply the other.
- a heterogeneous warehouse robot fleet may be used for a number of different applications.
- One possible application includes order fulfillment (e.g., for individual customers), in which cases may be opened and individual items from the cases may be put into packaging within boxes to fulfill individual orders.
- Another possible application includes distribution (e.g., to stores or other warehouses), in which mixed pallets may be constructed containing groups of different types of products to ship to stores.
- a further possible application includes cross-docking, which may involve transporting between shipping containers without storing anything (e.g., items may be moved from four 40-foot trailers and loaded into three lighter tractor trailers, and could also be palletized). Numerous other applications are also possible.
- FIG. 1A depicts a robotic fleet within a warehouse setting, according to an example embodiment. More specifically, different types of robotic devices may form a heterogeneous robotic fleet 100 that may be controlled to collaborate to perform tasks related to the processing of items, objects, or boxes within a warehouse environment. Certain example types and numbers of different robotic devices are shown here for illustration purposes, but robotic fleet 100 may employ more or fewer robotic devices, may omit certain types shown here, and may also include other types of robotic devices not explicitly shown. Additionally, a warehouse environment is shown here with certain types of fixed components and structures, but other types, numbers, and placements of fixed components and structures may be used in other examples as well.
- robotic device 112 One example type of robotic device shown within robotic fleet 100 is an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) 112 , which may be a relatively small, mobile device with wheels that may function to transport individual packages, cases, or totes from one location to another within the warehouse.
- AGV autonomous guided vehicle
- Another example type of robotic device is an autonomous fork truck 114 , a mobile device with a forklift that may be used to transport pallets of boxes and/or to lift pallets of boxes (e.g., to place the pallets onto a rack for storage).
- An additional example type of robotic device is a robotic truck loader/unloader 116 , a mobile device with a robotic manipulator as well as other components such as optical sensors to facilitate loading and/or unloading boxes onto and/or off of trucks or other vehicles.
- robotic truck unloader 116 may be used to load boxes onto delivery truck 118 , which may be parked adjacent to the warehouse.
- movements of delivery truck 118 e.g., to deliver packages to another warehouse
- one or more robotic devices may use different modes of transportation besides wheels on the ground.
- one or more robotic devices may be airborne (e.g., quadcopters), and may be used for tasks such as moving objects or collecting sensor data of the environment.
- the robotic fleet 100 may also include various fixed components that may be positioned within the warehouse.
- one or more fixed robotic devices may be used to move or otherwise process boxes.
- a pedestal robot 122 may include a robotic arm elevated on a pedestal that is fixed to the ground floor within the warehouse.
- the pedestal robot 122 may be controlled to distribute boxes between other robots and/or to stack and unstack pallets of boxes.
- the pedestal robot 122 may pick up and move boxes from nearby pallets 140 and distribute the boxes to individual AGV's 112 for transportation to other locations within the warehouse.
- robotic fleet 100 may employ additional fixed components positioned within a warehouse space.
- high density storage racks 124 may be used to store pallets and/or objects within the warehouse.
- the storage racks 124 may be designed and positioned to facilitate interaction with one or more robotic devices within the fleet, such as autonomous fork truck 114 .
- certain ground space may be selected and used for storage of pallets or boxes as well or instead.
- pallets 130 may be positioned within the warehouse environment at chosen locations for certain periods of time to allow the pallets to be picked up, distributed, or otherwise processed by one or more of the robotic devices.
- FIG. 1B is a functional block diagram illustrating components of a robotic warehouse fleet 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- the robotic fleet 100 could include one or more of various mobile components, such as AGV's 112 , autonomous fork trucks 114 , robotic truck loaders/unloaders 116 , and delivery trucks 118 .
- the robotic fleet 100 may additionally include one or more fixed components positioned within a warehouse or other environment, such as pedestal robots 122 , density storage containers 124 , and battery exchange/charging stations 126 .
- different numbers and types of the components illustrated within FIG. 1B may be included within a fleet, certain types may be omitted, and additional functional and/or physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by FIGS. 1A and 1B as well.
- a global control system 150 such as a remote, cloud-based server system, may communicate (e.g., through wireless communication) with some or all of the system components and/or with separate local control systems of individual components.
- certain of the fixed components 120 may be installed before deployment of the rest of the robotic fleet 100 .
- one or more mobile robots may be brought in to map a space before determining placement of certain fixed components 120 , such as the pedestal robots 122 or battery exchange stations 126 .
- the system may determine (e.g., by running simulations) how to layout the fixed components within the space available. In certain cases, a layout may be chosen to minimize the number of fixed components needed and/or the amount of space used by those components.
- the fixed components 120 and mobile components 110 may be deployed in separate stages or all at once. In additional examples, certain of the mobile components 110 may only be brought in during particular time periods or to complete particular tasks.
- global control system 150 may include a central planning system that assigns tasks to different robotic devices within fleet 100 .
- the central planning system may employ various scheduling algorithms to determine which devices will complete which tasks at which times. For instance, an auction type system may be used in which individual robots bid on different tasks, and the central planning system may assign tasks to robots to minimize overall costs.
- the central planning system may optimize across one or more different resources, such as time, space, or energy utilization.
- a planning or scheduling system may also incorporate particular aspects of the geometry and physics of box picking, packing, or storing.
- Planning control may also be distributed across individual system components.
- global control system 150 may issue instructions according to a global system plan, and individual system components may also operate according to separate local plans. Additionally, different levels of detail may be included within a global plan, with other aspects left for individual robotic devices to plan locally. For instance, mobile robotic devices may be assigned target destinations by a global planner but the full routes to reach those target destinations may be planned or modified locally.
- a central planning system may be used in conjunction with local vision on individual robotic devices to coordinate functions of robots within robotic fleet 100 .
- a central planning system may be used to get robots relatively close to where they need to go.
- Local vision and planning for individual robotic devices may therefore be used to allow for elasticity between different robotic devices.
- a general planner may be used to get a robot close to a target location, at which point local vision of the robot may take over.
- most robotic functions may be position-controlled to get the robots relatively close to target locations, and then vision and handshakes may be used when needed for local control.
- visual handshakes may enable two robots to identify one another by AR tag or other characteristics, and to perform collaborative operations within fleet 100 .
- items e.g., packages to be shipped
- visual tags may be provided with visual tags as well or instead, which may be used by robotic devices to perform operations on the items using local vision control.
- the tags may be used to facilitate manipulation of the items by the robotic devices. For instance, one or more tags on particular locations on a pallet may be used to inform a fork lift where or how to lift up the pallet.
- deployment and/or planning strategies for fixed and/or mobile components may be optimized over time.
- a cloud-based server system may incorporate data and information from individual robots within the fleet and/or from external sources. Strategies may then be refined over time to enable the fleet to use less space, less time, less power, less electricity, or to optimize across other variables.
- optimizations may span across multiple warehouses, possibly including other warehouses with robotic fleets and/or traditional warehouses.
- global control system 150 may incorporate information about delivery vehicles and transit times between facilities into central planning.
- a central planning system may sometimes fail, such as when a robot gets stuck or when packages get dropped in a location and lost.
- Local robot vision may also therefore provide robustness by inserting redundancy to handle cases where the central planner fails. For instance, as an automatic pallet jack passes and identifies an object, the pallet jack may send information up to a remote, cloud-based server system. Such information may be used to fix errors in central planning, help to localize robotic devices, or to identify lost objects.
- a central planning system may dynamically update a map of the physical environment containing robotic fleet 100 and objects undergoing processing by the robotic devices.
- the map may be continuously updated with information about dynamic objects (e.g., moving robots and packages moved by robots).
- a dynamic map could contain information on both the current configuration or placement of components within a warehouse (or across multiple warehouses) as well as information about what is anticipated in the near term. For instance, the map could show current locations of moving robots and anticipated locations of the robots in the future, which may be used to coordinate activity between robots. The map could also show current locations of items undergoing processing as well as anticipated future locations of the items (e.g., where an item is now and when the item is anticipated to be shipped out).
- some or all of the robots may scan for labels on objects at different points within the process.
- the scans may be used to look for visual tags that may be applied to individual components or specific items to facilitate finding or keeping track of components and items. This scanning may yield a trail of items constantly moving around as the items are manipulated or transported by robots.
- a potential benefit is added transparency, both on the supplier side and the consumer side.
- information about current locations of inventory may be used to avoid overstocking and/or to move items or pallets of items to different locations or warehouses to anticipate demand.
- the information about current locations of particular items may be used to determine when a particular package will be delivered with improved accuracy.
- some or all of the mobile components 110 within robotic fleet 100 may periodically receive charged batteries from a battery exchange station 126 equipped with multiple battery chargers.
- the station 126 may replace a mobile robot's old batteries with recharged batteries, which may prevent robots from having to sit and wait for batteries to charge.
- the battery exchange station 126 may be equipped with a robotic manipulator such as a robotic arm. The robotic manipulator may remove batteries from an individual mobile robot and attach the batteries to available battery chargers. The robotic manipulator may then move charged batteries located at the station 126 into the mobile robot to replace the removed batteries.
- an AGV 112 with a weak battery may be controlled to move over to battery exchange station 126 where a robotic arm pulls a battery out from the AGV 112 , puts the battery in a charger, and gives the AGV 112 a fresh battery.
- battery exchanges may be scheduled by a central planning system.
- individual mobile robots may be configured to monitor their battery charge status. The robots may periodically send information to the central planning system indicating the status of their batteries. This information may then be used by the central planning system to schedule battery replacements for individual robots within the fleet when needed or convenient.
- a fleet 100 may contain a number of different types of mobile components 110 that use different types of batteries.
- a battery exchange station 126 may therefore be equipped with different types of battery chargers for different types of batteries and/or mobile robots.
- the battery exchange station 126 may also be equipped with a robotic manipulator that can replace batteries for different types of robots.
- mobile robots may have battery containers containing multiple batteries.
- an autonomous fork truck 114 such as a pallet jack may have a steel bucket with 3 or 4 batteries.
- the robotic arm at the station 126 may be configured to lift out the entire bucket of batteries and attach individual batteries to battery chargers on a shelf at the station 126 . The robotic arm may then find charged batteries to replace the old batteries, and move those batteries back into the bucket before reinserting the bucket into the pallet jack.
- global control system 150 and/or a separate control system of the battery exchange station 126 may also automate battery management strategies. For instance, each battery may have a barcode or other identifying mark so that the system can identify individual batteries.
- a control system of the battery exchange station 126 may count how many times individual batteries have been recharged (e.g., to determine when to change water or empty batteries completely). The control system may also keep track of which batteries have spent time in which robotic devices, how long the batteries took to recharge at the station 126 in the past, and other relevant properties for efficient battery management. This battery usage information may be used by the control system to select batteries for the robotic manipulator to give to particular mobile robots.
- a battery exchange station 126 may also involve a human operator in some cases.
- the station 126 could include a rig where people can safely perform manual battery changing or deliver new batteries to the station for deployment into the fleet 100 when necessary.

- laser sensors 306 may be arranged on the front end of robotic device 302 . Each laser sensor 306 may project a narrow laser beam 310 along direction of travel 308 .

- different factors may be taken into consideration when arranging laser sensors on a robotic device. These factors may be properties of the laser and/or stereo sensors. They also may be properties of the environment that the laser sensors are in. For example, the divergence of laser beams may be taken into consideration when choosing the spacing of laser sensors on the robotic device. Laser sensor beams may diverge and spread out as each beam moves away from its respective source. As a result, the distance between adjacent laser beams may increase as the distance from the laser sources increases. This may lead to detection problems, as the beams may not be able to detect an obstacle of a predetermined minimum size (i.e. as set by the safety standards). In order to properly detect obstacles of a predetermined minimum size, the divergence of the laser beams may be accounted for.

Specifically, as seen in FIG. 4 , laser beams 406 diverge and spread out as they move away from sensors 404 .
- FIG. 4 is an example representation of a possible arrangement of laser sensors, and should not be taken to be limiting. The divergence of the lasers is slightly exaggerated for representation purposes. Also, in subsequent representations of the laser coverage area, the area is shown as a continuous block in order to show the border regions of the coverage area, and not the individual beams as shown in FIG. 4 .
