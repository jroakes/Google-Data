Abstract
Description
- This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/582,104, entitled “Creating Real-Time Conversations,” filed Dec. 30, 2011; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- This specification relates to the creation of a conversation in an online environment. The Internet has provided a medium for many new forms of communication. From e-mail to chat rooms to instant messaging, Internet users have the ability to talk to one or many of their friends within moments from anywhere in the world. Moreover, as computing devices have become smaller and wireless, these new forms of communication have become increasingly mobile.
- Users can quickly share information about places, things, and events that occur nearby the users, by creating real-time online conversations. For each conversation created by a user, a server can create a conversation object that is tied to a geographic location and a time, and can index the conversation object such that the conversation can be easily found by other users that are near the location shortly after the conversation is created.
- One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification is embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving, at a server, a topic for a real-time conversation from a user; receiving, at the server, location information related to a location of the user; creating, at the server, a real-time conversation object that includes the received topic; tagging the created real-time conversation object with the received location information; indexing, based on the received topic and the received location information, the tagged real-time conversation object with respect to other real-time conversation objects; and providing the tagged real-time conversation object in response to a search for real-time conversation objects received from another user.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification is embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving, at a server, location information related to a location of a user; determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects that are associated with locations within an area related to the received location of the computing device, the location associated with each of the plurality of real-time conversation objects indicating a location of a user at the time the user requested creation of the real-time conversation object; and sending, to a computing device of the user, information representing the determined real-time conversation objects.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification is embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving, at a server, location information related to a location of a user; determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects that are associated with locations within an area related to the received location of the user and associated with a threshold level of message activity over a certain period of time; and sending, to a computing device of the user, information representing the selected real-time conversation objects.
- Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices. A system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue having instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, the location information may received from a computing device of the user and based on an output of a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor included in the computing device of the user. Alternatively or additionally, the actions may include: receiving, from the user, a list of other users to invite to be associated with the created real-time conversation object; sending, to the other users included in the received list, invitations to be associated with the created real-time conversation object; receiving, from one or more of the other users, an acceptance of the invitation; and updating the created real-time conversation object to include indicators of the one or more other users that accepted the invitation.
- Indexing the tagged real-time conversation object may include updating, based on the location information, an index of real-time conversation objects stored on the server to include the tagged real-time conversation object. Updating the index of real-time conversation objects stored on the server to include the tagged real-time conversation object may include sorting the real-time conversation objects included in the index based on locations associated with each of the real-time conversation objects. Updating the index of real-time conversation objects stored on the server to include the tagged real-time conversation object may include sorting the real-time conversation objects included in the index based on a level of message activity over a certain period of time associated with each real-time conversation object.
- The actions may further include receiving a request from the user to create the real-time conversation object. Receiving location information related to the location of the user may include receiving location information that indicates the location of the user at the time the user requested the creation of the real-time conversation object. And tagging the created real-time conversation object with the received location information may include tagging the created real-time conversation object with the location of the user at the time the user requested the creation of the real-time conversation object and maintaining the location with which the created real-time conversation object is tagged regardless of whether a current location of the user changes.
- The actions may further include receiving, at the server, a selection of a real-time conversation objects from the determined real-time conversation objects; and sending, to the computing device of the user, a link to the selected real-time conversation object. The action may further include receiving, from the computing device of the user, message information to be posted to the real-time conversation object; and updating the real-time conversation object with the received message information and the time at which the message information was received.
- Determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects may include determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects that are associated with a threshold level of message activity over a certain period of time. Determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects may also include determining a plurality of real-time conversation objects that are associated with one or more other users with whom the user of the computing device has indicated a relationship.
- The subject matter described in this specification provides several advantages. For example, real-time conversations created by the systems described herein do not need to be associated with a particular business or venue (e.g., a restaurant). Similarly, the real-time conversations may be associated with any topic. In other words, users that create real-time conversations are not limited to a list of pre-selected topics. In addition, the systems described herein allow users to quickly discover the most relevant real-time conversations that are associated with locations near a user's current location.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Following is a description of systems and processes for creating and hosting interactive, real-time conversations based on a user's location. Real-time conversations provide a platform for users to exchange messages in a continuously streaming environment. As will be described in more detail with reference to the figures, the described system harnesses the mobility of modern computing devices and allows a user to create a real-time conversation based on the user's location and any topic the user chooses.
- There are various types of real-time conversations. One example such example is instant messaging, a form of direct, text-based chatting communication where the messages are pushed to participants in real-time. Other examples include Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and certain forms of mobile text messaging. However, the real-time conversations referred to herein are not limited to any of these implementations and encompass any types of conversation platforms that permit the exchange of messages in real-time.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example system for creating a real-time conversation. Theconversation system 100 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. Theconversation system 100 includes aconversation database 102, aconversation object creator 104, and aconversation indexer 106. - The
conversation database 102 stores real-time conversation objects that represent real-time conversations between users. Each real-time conversation object is related to a location and a topic, as well as other parameters (e.g., time). Theconversation object creator 104 receives various parameters regarding a proposed real-time conversation, including the location and the topic, and creates a real-time conversation object that includes the received parameters. Beyond a location and topic, the parameters of a real-time conversation may include, for example, a list of users that should be invited to join the conversation, an icon representing the conversation, and one or more messages to begin the conversation. - Each real-time conversation object stores the entire contents of the real-time conversation. For example, the real-time conversation object stores all previous messages contributed to the conversation, the time and date each message was contributed, the user that contributed the message, identifiers of all users that have joined the conversation, and an indication of those members that are currently participating in the conversation. Moreover, each real-time conversation object provides a platform for a plurality of users associated with a common location to interactively communicate about a geographically relevant topic. However, in the creation of a real-time conversation object, the user is not limited to a predetermined list of topics or categories. Rather, a user may organically create a real-time conversation based on any topic relevant to the user's location.
- The conversation indexer 106 stores the real-time conversation objects created by the
conversation object creator 104 in theconversation database 102 and indexes the created real-time conversation object with respect to a plurality of other real-time conversation objects stored in the conversation database. By indexing the created conversation, theconversation indexer 106 enables other users to search for the created conversation in theconversation database 102. - A
user 112 generally interacts with theconversation system 100 through auser device 114. For example, theuser device 114 can be a mobile device coupled to theconversation system 100 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet. Theuser 112 may interface with theconversation system 100 in various ways. For example, theuser 112 may interface with theconversation system 100 by accessing a webpage associated with theconversation system 100 on a browser application on theuser device 114. Alternatively or additionally, an application may be installed on theuser device 114 that, when executed, provides an interface to theconversation system 100. - When creating a real-time conversation, the
user 112 may be presented with acreation screen 116. Through interaction with thecreation screen 116, theuser 112 may submit conversation parameters (e.g., location and topic) to theconversation system 100. For example, while walking down Elm Street, theuser 112 may encounter a house that is on fire. Throughcreation screen 116, theuser 112 may submit, to theconversation system 100,conversation parameters 118 that include a location of “Elm Street” and a topic of “Fire.” - The
conversation object creator 104 receives and creates a real-time conversation object based on theconversation parameters 118. The conversation indexer 106 stores the real-time conversation objects created by theconversation object creator 104 in theconversation database 102 and indexes the created conversation object with respect to a plurality of other real-time conversation objects stored in the conversation database. Theconversation indexer 106 provides users with the ability to discover what is happening around them right now. Theconversation system 100returns data 120 regarding the created and indexed conversation object to theuser device 114. Thedata 120 may include, for example, a link to the real-time conversation object so that theuser device 114 may display the conversation and allow theuser 112 to interact with the conversation. Moreover, when theuser device 114 accesses a screen providing a list ofconversations 122, the created and indexed conversation may be included. - In certain implementations, protective steps may be taken with respect to user privacy. For example, depending on the particular type of data being used, the services being provided, and the ability to provide certain services with modified data, a system may provide users with the opportunity to opt in/out of services that may collect personal information, may partially or fully anonymize data so as to prevent personally identifiable information from being disclosed, and may perform similar operations with respect to user location data, user preference data, and other data relating to users of the system.

FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of anexample method 200 for creating and indexing a real-time conversation. For convenience, themethod 200 is described with reference to a system of one or more servers that performs the method. The system can be, for example, theconversation system 100 described above with reference toFIG. 1 . - The system receives a topic for a real-time conversation from a user (202). The topic may be identified by any string of characters that the user chooses to use to represent the conversation. For example, the topic could be “Concert in the Park” or “Free doughnuts on the corner!” The user may provide her own topic or may select from a list of topics provided by the system. The topic of conversation provides an indication to other users of the subject of the conversation.
- The system also receives location information for the conversation (204). The location information may indicate the present location of the user. The location information may also indicate a location other than a business, for example, a street, a neighborhood, or a landmark. The location information may be determined in various manners. In some implementations, the location information may correspond to a location provided by the user device from which the user is submitting the location information. In other implementations, the user may specify the location information by manually providing an indication of the location information by, for example, selecting the location from a map displayed by the user device or by providing an address of the location.
- The system may also receive other parameters related to the real-time conversation. For example, the user may specify an icon to represent the real-time conversation. The user may select the icon from a list of icons provided by the system or the user may provide her own icon from a different source. Additionally or alternatively, the user may specify a list of other users she would like to invite to the real-time conversation. When the system receives a list of other users to invite to the real-time conversation, the system may send a link to the real-time conversation object to the other users. The other users may access the link to the real-time conversation object and participate in the real-time conversation.
- Additionally or alternatively, the user may specify whether the real-time conversation is to be made public or private. The system may make public conversations accessible to any other users that search for them. On the other hand, the system my limit accessibility of private conversations to those other users that the user creating the real-time conversation invites to join. Additionally or alternatively, the user may provide one or more messages to be included in the real-time conversation object. In other words, the user may provide a seed for the conversation by including an initial message to which other users may respond.
- The system creates a real-time conversation object that includes the received topic and location information (206). The system may also include, in the real-time conversation object, any of the other received parameters related to the conversation. The real-time conversation object may be any data structure that relates the received parameters and the messages related to the conversation. For example, the system may create a real-time conversation object by creating an XML structure that represents the conversation. Alternatively, the system may create a real-time conversation object by creating a database object related to the conversation.
- The created real-time conversation object includes a thread of messages received by the system from one or more users. Once created, the system continuously updates the thread of messages to include any additional messages that are received in relation to the real-time conversation. In some implementations, the system may also include information related to the state of the conversation in the real-time conversation object. For example, the real-time conversation object may include information indicating the number of other users that have joined the conversation or that have actively participated in the conversation, as well as an indication of these other users' identities. In other words, the real-time conversation object represents on ongoing exchange in which users contribute in real-time.
- The system may use the indication of the identities other users who have joined the real-time conversation to send updates of the conversation to the other users. The real-time conversation object may include information indicating the last time that a message was posted in the conversation, which the system may use to sort the real-time conversation object with respect to other real-time conversation objects.
- Moreover, the system may tag the real-time conversation object with the received location information. In particular, the real-time conversation object may be updated to store a representation of the location information. The system may use any format for specifying the location of the real-time conversation.
- In some implementations, the location information associated with the real-time conversation object may be static. For example, the real-time conversation object may be permanently tagged with the location specified by the user during the creation of the real-time conversation object. In other implementations, the location information associated with the real-time conversation object may be dynamic. For example, as the user that created the real-time conversation object moves, the location information associated with the real-time conversation object may be continuously or periodically updated with the new location of the user.
- The system indexes the created real-time conversation object with respect to a plurality of real-time conversation objects such that the created conversation object is searchable by other users (208). The system stores a plurality of real-time conversation objects. Each real-time conversation object may include any combination of the conversation parameters described above, as well as any other parameters.
- In some implementations, each real-time conversation object includes at least a location and a topic. The system may index the real-time conversation objects based on one or more of the parameters included in the real-time conversation object. For example, the system may index the real-time conversation objects based on the location and the topic of the conversation. Indexing the real-time conversation objects allows the system to make the real-time conversation objects searchable by users, as will be described in greater detail below with regard to
FIG. 5 . -
FIGS. 3A-3C illustrate examples of interfaces for use in the creation of a real-time conversation object. The interfaces are described with reference to a system of one or more servers that provide the interfaces to a user and a user device. The system can be, for example, theconversation system 100 described above with reference toFIG. 1 . The user device may be, for example, a mobile telephone. - The
interface 300 shown inFIG. 3A represents a portal for a user to provide parameters in the process of creating a real-time conversation. Theinterface 300 includes various regions. Theinterface 300 may include aregion 302 that provides a user with a choice of icons with which to represent the real-time conversation being created. Theinterface 300 may include aregion 304 that permits a user to specify the name or topic of the real-time conversation. Theregion 304 may include text field in which a user may enter a name or topic. Alternatively or additionally, theregion 304 may include a pull-down menu that includes a list of suggested topics or names. However, theinterface 300 is designed so as to permit a user to freely create a real-time conversation without limits on the subject or category of the conversation. - The
interface 300 may include aregion 306 that permits a user to specify a list of other users that the user would like to invite to join the real-time conversation being created. Theregion 306 may include a search field that permits a user to search for other users to include in the invitation list and/or may include a pull-down menu that includes a list of other users that are associated with the user creating the real-time conversation (e.g., a list of “friends”). - The
interface 300 may include aregion 308 that relates to a location associated with the real-time conversation. In some implementations, where the location of the conversation is automatically determined and provided by the user device, theregion 308 may include a map showing the location of the user device and an advisory to the user that the conversation will be visible to nearby users, if the conversation is not made private. - In some implementations, where the location of the conversation is manually provided by the user device, the
region 308 may include a map with which the user may interact to specify a location for the conversation. Alternatively or additionally, theregion 308 may include a text field in which a user may enter, for example, an address or keyword to specify a location for the conversation. - The
interface 300 may include aregion 308 that permits a user to enter a message to be included in the conversation. Theregion 308 may include a text field in which a user may enter a message. Theinterface 300 may include other regions for specifying other parameters related to the conversation being created. For example, the interface may include a region that permits the user to designate the conversation as either private or public. - Generally, the
interface 300 provides a single mechanism through which a user may create a conversation about any topic. The user need not enter a location and have a topic selected for her. Similarly, the user need not search through a list of pre-selected locations, for example, a list of businesses. Rather, theinterface 300 allows a user to specify any topic that is relevant to the user's experience at a given location. - The
interface 320 shown inFIG. 3B represents a status of a created conversation. Theinterface 320 includes various regions. Theinterface 320 may include aregion 322 that indicates the number of users that have joined the real-time conversation. Theinterface 320 may include aregion 324 that permits a user to join the conversation.Region 324 may be a button that, when pressed, causes the system to join the user to the conversation. -
Region 326 may include a list of users that are currently joined to the real-time conversation. For users included in theregion 326, theinterface 320 may include an indication of the user's identity, the last time the user participated in the real-time conversation, and an icon that represents the user. For example, the indication of the user's identity may be the user's name or a handle associated with the user. The indication of the last time the user participated in the real-time conversation may include the date and time at which the user last contributed a message to the real-time conversation. When a user is currently viewing the message thread of the real-time conversation or actively typing a message to be posted in the message thread, the indication of the last time the user participated in the conversation may indicate that the user is “in conversation,” “currently participating,” or some variation thereof. Thus, participating in and being joined to a real-time conversation are distinct states. When a user is participating in a real-time conversation, the user is actively interacting with the real-time conversation object. On the other hand, a user joins a conversation regarding which the user wants to be notified of updates and with which the user generally wants to be associated. - Once a user has joined a real-time conversation, the user may access the conversation's settings through, for example, an interface similar to the
interface 330 that is shown inFIG. 3C . Theinterface 330 includes various regions. Theinterface 330 may include aregion 332 that permits a user to change the tone or music emitted by the user device when the real-time conversation is updated with, for example, a new message. Theinterface 330 may include aregion 334 that indicates the name or topic of the real-time conversation. In some implementations, theregion 334 may permit a user that has joined the real-time conversation to change the name or topic. Alternatively, theregion 334 may only permit the user who created the real-time conversation to change the name or topic and may simply display the name or topic to all other users. - The
interface 330 may include aregion 336 that indicates whether the real-time conversation is public or private. Similar toregion 334,region 336 may permit a user that has joined the real-time conversation to change the setting of the conversation from public to private and vice versa. Alternatively, theregion 334 may only permit the user who created the real-time conversation to change the setting of the conversation from public to private and vice versa. - The
interface 330 may include aregion 338 that permits a user to manage the notifications that the user device provides to the user in relation to the real-time conversation. For example, the user device may be configured to notify the user when a new message has been posted in the real-time conversation or only when messages from certain users have been posted in the real-time conversation. Additionally or alternatively, the user device may be configured to notify the user when another user has joined and/or left the real-time conversation. Additionally or alternatively, the user device may be configured to notify the user when the user is located within a certain distance of the location associated with the real-time conversation. Theinterface 330 may include aregion 340 that permits a user to leave the real-time conversation. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example system for finding and joining real-time conversations. Once a real-time conversation object has been created, theconversation system 400 provides users with the ability to find out what is happening around them in real-time. As a user moves between streets or neighborhoods, theconversation system 400 will present the user with a list of real-time conversations that are both relevant to the user's location and are being actively conducted concurrent with the user's travels. - The
conversation system 400 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. Theconversation system 400 may be implemented on the same one or more computers asconversation system 100 as described above with regard toFIG. 1 . However,conversation system 400 may be implemented as a separate system on one or more other computers. - The
conversation system 400 includes aconversation database 402, aconversation search engine 404, and aconversation participation interface 406. Theconversation database 402 stores indexed conversation objects that represent real-time conversations between users. Each real-time conversation object may be related to a location and a topic, as well as other parameters. As described above, the stored real-time conversation objects are indexed by the parameters to which the real-time conversation objects are associated. - The
conversation search engine 404 may receive an indication of one or more parameters based upon whichconversation search engine 404 searches for real-time conversations. For example, theconversation search engine 404 may receive an indication of a location based upon whichconversation search engine 404 searches for real-time conversations. Alternatively or additionally, theconversation search engine 404 may receive one or more search terms related to the name or topic of a real-time conversation. Theconversation search engine 404 may search the stored indexes for the received parameters and return a list of real-time conversations related to the received parameters. - The
conversation participation interface 406 provides an interface through which a user may view and post messages to a selected real-time conversation. Theconversation participation interface 406 may receive a message from a user device and store the message in a message thread included in the corresponding real-time conversation object. Theconversation participation interface 406 may also receive requests from a user to join and/or leave a real-time conversation and update a list of associated users included in the corresponding real-time conversation object. Theconversation participation interface 406 may also receive updates to the settings associated with a real-time conversation object, as described above with regard toFIG. 3C . - A
user 412 generally interacts with thesearch system 400 through auser device 414. For example, theuser device 414 can be a mobile device coupled to theconversation system 400 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet. Theuser 412 may interface with theconversation system 400 in various ways. For example, theuser 412 may interface with theconversation system 400 by accessing a webpage associated with theconversation system 400 on a browser application on theuser device 414. Alternatively or additionally, an application may be installed on theuser device 414 that, when executed, provides an interface to theconversation system 400. - When creating a real-time conversation, the
user 412 may be presented with aconversation search screen 416. Through interaction with theconversation search screen 416, theuser 412 may submit conversation parameters (e.g., location or topic) to theconversation system 400 and search for existing real-time conversations. For example, while walking down Elm Street, theuser 412 may encounter a house that is on fire. Throughconversation search screen 416, theuser 412 may submit, to theconversation system 400,search parameters 418 that include a location of “Elm Street” and/or a topic of “Fire.” Theseparameters 418 may be specified by the user and/or provided automatically by theuser device 414. For example, as a user walks onto Elm Street, theuser device 414 may provide the user's location to theconversation system 400 in order to obtain a list of conversations relevant to Elm Street. - The
conversation search engine 404 receives thesearch parameters 418 and searches indexes related to the stored real-time conversation objects using the receivedsearch parameters 418. Theconversation search engine 404 may returndata 420 that includes a set of links to real-time conversation objects resulting from the search. Theuser device 414 may display the set of links to real-time conversation objects as a list of conversations. The user may then select a real-time conversation from the list of conversations to view. - When a user selects a real-time conversation from the list, the
user device 414 may access the link to the corresponding real-time conversation object. When accessing a real-time conversation, theuser 412 may be presented with aconversation participation screen 422. Theconversation participation screen 422 provides a portal to theconversation participation interface 406. Through interaction with theconversation search screen 416, theuser 412 may view the various contents of the selected real-time conversation object. For example, theuser 412 may be presented with the messages in the message thread included in the real-time conversation object. - Moreover, the
user 412 may interact with theconversation participation screen 422 to sendchanges 424 toconversation participation interface 406 regarding the real-time conversation object. For example, theuser 412 may post a new message to the message thread. Theconversation participation interface 406 receives thechanges 424 and may update the real-time conversation object stored inconversation database 402 accordingly. Theconversation participation interface 406 may also sendupdates 426 touser device 414 related to any real-time conversation objects to whichuser 412 is joined. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of anexample method 500 discovering and participating in a real-time conversation. For convenience, themethod 500 is described with reference to a system of one or more servers that performs the method. The system can be, for example, theconversation system 400 described above with reference toFIG. 4 . - The system receives location information from a user (502). The location information may indicate the present location of the user. The location information may also indicate a location other than a business, for example, a street, a neighborhood, or a landmark. The location information may be determined in various manners. In some implementations, the location information may correspond to a location of the user device from which the user is submitting the location information. For example, the user device may determine its location through a global positioning sensor (GPS) included in the user device, through a process of cell tower triangulation, through a process of evaluating a Wi-Fi network connection's signal strength, though an IP address assigned to the user device, or through any combination of these or other methods. In other implementations, the user may specify the location information by manually providing an indication of the location information by, for example, selecting the location from a map displayed by the user device or by providing an address of the location.
- The system may receive other search parameters. For example, the system may receive one or more search terms related to the name or topic of a real-time conversation. Alternatively or additionally, the system may receive identifiers associated with users that created or are joined to one or more real-time conversations.
- The system determines one or more real-time conversation objects that relate to the received location information (504). The one or more conversation objects may include other conversation parameters (e.g., a topic). To determine the one or more real-time conversation objects that relate to the received location information, the system may search one or more indexes stored by the system. The indexes may include various conversation parameters associated with the real-time conversation objects, including, for example, a location associated with each of the real-time conversation objects. In some implementations, the system determines one or more real-time conversation objects that relate to the received location information by comparing the received location information with the location associated with each of the real-time conversation objects. The system may, for example, determine that a real-time conversation object relates to the received location information where the received location information is within a certain distance of the location associated with the real-time conversation object.
- The system may also search for real-time conversation objects based on user preferences. For example, the user may specify that she only wants to search for and be presented with real-time conversations that her friends created or have joined. In other words, the system allows a user to specifically determine what her nearby friends are doing. Alternatively, the user may specify the distance within which the locations associated with real-time conversation objects should be located in order to be included in the returned results. The system may utilize the stored user preferences in conjunction with the specified conversation parameters to search the one or more indexes stored by the system.
- The system may present the user with an interface that includes the one or more determined real-time conversation objects, for example, the interface described below with regard to
FIG. 6B . The system receives, from the user, a selection of a real-time conversation object from the one or more determined real-time conversation objects (506). In implementations where an interface includes the one or more determined conversation objects, the user may select a real-time conversation object from the one or more determined conversation objects included in the interface. The user device from which the user selects the real-time conversation object may include a list of links to the one or more determined conversation objects. When the user selects the real-time conversation object, the user device may send a request for the link to the system. Thus, the system may receive the request for the link associated with the selected conversation object. - The system accesses the selected conversation object (508). In some implementations, for example, where the system receives a request for a link associated with a selected conversation object, the system accesses the selected conversation object by accessing the link associated with the real-time conversation object. The system may send the accessed conversation object to the user device from which the real-time conversation object was selected. The user device may present the accessed conversation object to the user via an interface, for example, the interface shown in
FIGS. 7A and 7B . - The system may receive, from the user, a message associated with the accessed conversation object (510). For example, through interaction with an interface that presents the accessed conversation object to the user on the user device, the user may enter and submit a message for the real-time conversation. The system updates the real-time conversation object to include the received message (512). Thus, the system may receive the message entered by the user and update the real-time conversation object to include the received message.
-
FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate examples of interfaces for use in finding a real-time conversation object. The interfaces are described with reference to a system of one or more servers that provide the interfaces to a user and a user device. The system can be, for example, theconversation system 400 described above with reference toFIG. 4 . The user device may be, for example, a mobile telephone. - The
interface 600 shown inFIG. 6A represents a menu screen for an application running on the user device. The application may, among other functions, provide the interface through which the user interacts with the system. Theinterface 600 may include various links to the functions provided by the application. For example, theinterface 600 may include a link titled “Nearby” 602, which links to a function for searching the system for real-time conversations that are near in location to the location of the user device. Theinterface 600 may include aregion 604 that may provide an indication of new notifications received by the user device. The notifications may be similar to those described above with regard toregion 338 ofinterface 330. - The
interface 610 shown inFIG. 6B represents results from searching the system for real-time conversations that are near in location to the location of the user device. For example, when a user selects thelink 602 from theinterface 600, the system may search one or more indexes stored by the system that include various conversation parameters associated with real-time conversation objects, including, for example, a location associated with each of the real-time conversation objects. The system may determine one or more real-time conversation objects that relate to the location of the user device by determining that the location of the user device is within a certain distance of the location associated with the determined conversation objects. - The
interface 610 may present the user with a list of the determined real-time conversation objects from the system's search. Theinterface 610 may include multiple regions for organizing the determined conversation in different manners. For example, theinterface 610 may include aregion 612 that lists nearby real-time conversations that are popular over a long period of time. The system may determine the long-term popularity of a real-time conversation in various ways, including, for example, by analyzing the total number of messages posted to the real-time conversation since its creation and/or the total number of users joined to the real-time conversation. Theinterface 610 may also include aregion 614 that lists nearby real-time conversations that are currently popular. The system may determine the current popularity of a real-time conversation in various ways, including, for example, analyzing the number of users currently participating in the real-time conversation or the number of messages posted to the real-time conversation within the last day. - A real-time conversation included in the list of conversations displayed by the
interface 610 may be represented in the list by a number of conversation parameters. For example, a real-time conversation may be represented by its topic, its icon, the number of users joined to the real-time conversation, the names of friends of the user of the user device joined to the real-time conversation, and/or the number of messages posted to the real-time conversation that have not been read by the user. The interface may also include abutton 616 that allows the user to create a new conversation, if, for example, the system does not return a real-time conversation related to the topic about which the user wants to talk. -
FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate examples of interfaces for use in participating in a real-time conversation. The interfaces are described with reference to a system of one or more servers that provide the interfaces to a user and a user device. The system can be, for example, theconversation system 400 described above with reference toFIG. 4 . The user device may be, for example, a mobile telephone. - Each of the
interfaces FIGS. 7A and 7B , respectively, represent a visual representation of an accessed real-time conversation object.Interface 700 represents an example where the real-time conversation has not yet been joined by the user. Conversely, theinterface 701 represents an example where the real-time conversation has been joined by the user. However, theinterfaces -
Interfaces region 702 that indicates the topic or name of the real-time conversation object.Interfaces region 704 that represents the number of members joined to the real-time conversation and a list of identifiers associated with the joined users. For example, theregion 704 may include a list of icons associated with a user (e.g., a picture of the user). Theregion 704 may allow the user to scroll through the list. -
Interfaces region 706 that lists the messages posted to the real-time conversation. In addition to the text of the message itself, each message included in theregion 706 may be represented by one or more identifiers associated with the user that posted the message and an indication of when the message was posted. The one or more identifiers associated with the user that posted the message may include, for example, the name of the user and a photo of the user. Theregion 706 may allow the user to scroll through all of the messages posted to the real-time conversation. Additionally, theregion 706 may order the listed messages in various manners. For example, the messages may be listed by the time at which the message was posted and/or by the relationship between the posting user and the viewing user. -
Interfaces region 708 that indicates whether other users that have joined the real-time conversation are currently typing messages to post to the conversation.Interfaces region 710 that permits a user to enter a message to be instantly posted to the real-time conversation. Theregion 710 may include a text field that allows the user to enter a message and a submit button that allows the user to post the entered message. - However, with regard to
interface 700, a user who is viewing or browsing the real-time conversation, but has not joined the real-time conversation, may be prevented from posting a message to the conversation. Theinterface 700 may prevent a user from interacting withregion 710 altogether. Alternatively, if a user interacts withregion 710,interface 700 may trigger a pop-up notification that asks the user whether the user would like to join the real-time conversation. - The
interface 700 may include aregion 712 that, when interacted with, permits a user to join the real-time conversation. Conversely,interface 701 may includeregion 714 that, when interacted with, permits a user to view and edit the settings of the real-time conversation. For example,region 714 may be a button that, when pressed by the user, presents the user with aninterface 330. Interface may also include aregion 716 that, when interacted with, permits a user to invite other users to join the real-time conversation. For example, when a user selectsregion 716, the system may send a notification (e.g., an e-mail) to the invited users with a link to the real-time conversation object and an identity of the inviting user. The system may not permit a user who has not joined the real-time conversation to view or edit the settings of the real-time conversation of invite other users to join the real-time conversation. -
FIG. 8 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices 800, 850 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 800 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, for example, laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 850 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, for example, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. - Computing device 800 includes a
processor 802,memory 804, astorage device 806, a high-speed interface 808 connecting tomemory 804 and high-speed expansion ports 810, and alow speed interface 812 connecting tolow speed bus 814 andstorage device 806. Each of thecomponents processor 802 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 800, including instructions stored in thememory 804 or on thestorage device 806 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, for example, display 816 coupled tohigh speed interface 808. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 800 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 804 stores information within the computing device 800. In some implementations, thememory 804 is a computer-readable medium. In other implementations, thememory 804 is a volatile memory unit or units. In still other implementations, thememory 804 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
