Now by for determining that the prime responsibility offer used higher or lower than the average energy further describes.This responsibility
Information can be used, such as, show responsibility symbol in energy user interface screen, such as " the weather in Fig. 7 C
(weather) " " user (user) " symbol 798 in " leaving (away) " symbol 774 and Fig. 7 I in symbol 764, Fig. 7 D.Logical
Crossing and determine prime responsibility and display it to user, user it will be seen that with in order to save the energy and cost makes preferably choosing
Select.
According to some embodiments, Figure 10 be illustrate a kind of for determining the main duty used above and below the average energy
The flow chart of the method appointed.According to these embodiments, the energy uses and is assigned to user, weather, automatically leaves or leave, these
It is referred to collectively as " agency " in this article.Term " blame " (blame) will refer to specifically to act on behalf of cause the energy use increase time
Between.Term praises (credit) to refer to, and the energy uses minimizing.Term blame and commendation are equal and contrary, therefore when determining
When acting on behalf of the whole structure using the energy, the impact using the energy deducts blame equal to commendation.If this effect is just
, then this agency be responsible for save the energy, and if this effect be negative, then this agency be responsible for waste the energy.Each determining
When planting the prime responsibility in agency, it is considered as prime responsibility agency that the energy uses the agency with maximum entire effect.Recognize
For, if used higher than meansigma methods, then this agency will have clean negatively influencing in use, and vice versa.Implement according to some
Example, the method each midnight (local time) shown in Figure 10 is performed.According to some embodiments, calculate and carry out with the degree-second, with
Just storage temperature change amplitude and the persistent period.According to some alternate embodiments, calculating can with degree-hour carry out, with
Avoid the fixing spilling counted.
In step 1010, calculate user to praise and the value of user's blame.It should be noted that in this example, right
In time being not in leaving or automatically leaving pattern when thermostat, user is just praised or is blamed.When heat supply, for every 30 seconds
Period, target temperature and plan temperature in this time compare.If system is in " shut " mode" and ambient temperature is less than
Plan temperature time, user avoid poor efficiency set point, therefore user praised 30 seconds be multiplied by plan temperature and ambient temperature it
Between difference.If target temperature and plan temperature are identical, this difference is zero, it is meant that the set point of this equipment operational plan,
Therefore user is neither praised and is not the most blamed.If target temperature is less than ambient temperature, and ambient temperature is less than plan temperature,
Then user saves the energy, and user is praised the difference being multiplied by between ambient temperature and target temperature for 30 seconds.If plan temperature is low
In ambient temperature, and ambient temperature is less than target temperature, then user wastes the energy, and therefore we blame user and are multiplied by environment in 30 seconds
Difference between temperature and plan temperature.
When refrigeration, for every 30 second period, target temperature and plan temperature in this time compared.If system
When being in " shut " mode" and plan temperature less than ambient temperature, then user avoids the set point of poor efficiency, and therefore user is praised
Within 30 seconds, it is multiplied by the difference between ambient temperature and plan temperature.If the two temperature is identical, this difference is zero, it is meant that this sets
The set point of standby operational plan, therefore user is neither praised and is not the most blamed.If plan temperature is less than ambient temperature, and ring
Border temperature is less than target temperature, then user saves the energy, therefore user praised 30 seconds be multiplied by target temperature and ambient temperature it
Between difference.If target temperature is less than ambient temperature, and ambient temperature is less than plan temperature, then user wastes the energy, therefore uses
Family is blamed because of the difference that is multiplied by between ambient temperature and target temperature for 30 seconds.
In step 1012, calculate weather to praise and the value of weather blame.It should be noted that according to some embodiments,
When finding that prime responsibility is acted on behalf of, this weather value is averaged so that constant synoptic model is left in the basket.For every 30 seconds time
Section (bucket), is multiplied by 30 seconds (size of period) for the difference between outdoor temperature and plan temperature and calculates.If my god
Gas is in stronger direction (such as, colder or warmer in refrigeration situation in heat supply situation) in temperature, and this amount is blamed
Standby in weather.If weather is in less strong direction in temperature, this amount praises weather.
In step 1014, calculate the value automatically leaving commendation.It should be noted that according to these embodiments, any
In the case of the most do not blame and leave or automatically leave；They only can be praised.In heat supply mode, if temperature is left in heat supply
Less than ambient temperature, and ambient temperature is less than planned target temperature, then leave to be praised and within 30 seconds, be multiplied by target temperature and environment temperature
Difference between degree.In refrigeration mode, if refrigeration is left temperature and is higher than ambient temperature, and ambient temperature is more than planned target temperature
Degree, then leave the difference being multiplied by between ambient temperature and target temperature for 30 seconds by commendation.
In step 1016, calculate and leave the value of commendation, its identical, except hands for step 1014 with foregoing description
That moves startup leaves number of times.
In step 1018, the method for step 1020,1022 and 1024 is used to calculate prime responsibility agency.In step 1020
In, by amounting to total activity (heat supply, freeze, assist) in the sky in a week in the past, (sky in this past week has enough
Data (such as missing less than 2 hours)), and by it divided by effective natural law, calculate number of seconds above/below meansigma methods.So
Activity total equal to today higher than the number of seconds of week meansigma methods afterwards deducts mean activity.In step 1022, if be above today
Meansigma methods, then blame has the agency of maximum (blame-praise).If all of value both less than zero, then set blame the unknown.
In step 1024, if subaverage today, then the agency with maximum (praising-blame) is praised.If all of
Value both less than zero, then set and praise the unknown.It should be noted that according to some embodiments, the weather data when at least 18 is little
When being available, weather just can be blamed/praised.In step 1030, summed up by a logout energy, this event
It is considered negative to using higher or lower than the average energy including which agency (user, weather, automatically leave or manually leave)
Prime responsibility.

According to some embodiments, Figure 12～Figure 15 is the flow chart illustrating and determining when the step by display leaf.Figure 12
Algorithm for showing leaf when heat supply enlivens is shown.In step 1210, when set point is less than 62, leaf is always
Display.In step 1212, if set point is manually changed to than current planning set point low 2 or more, then leaf quilt
Display, in addition to following: according to step 1214, if set point is higher than 72, does not the most show leaf.
Figure 13 illustrates the algorithm showing leaf when refrigeration is enlivened.In step 1310, if set point is higher than 84,
Leaf is always shown.In step 1312, if set point is manually set to exceeding current planning set point 2 or more
Time, leaf is shown, and in addition to following: according to step 1314, if set point is less than 74, does not show leaf.In order to for
This day obtain leaf purpose, such as this leaf be used in the energy shown herein as show with energy electronic mail in, then when
During at least one in that day hour display leaf, this leaf is awarded.
Figure 14 and Figure 15 shows the algorithm of leaf when illustrating for selecting and leaving temperature.Figure 14 shows general algorithm.?
In step 1410, by by the hourage standardization set point for each set point, calculate and averagely plan temperature.In step
In 1412, in heat supply situation, arrange to the average plan temperature low 2 or more of ratio if leaving temperature, then show leaf.Phase
May be used for refrigeration with algorithm, if leaving temperature to exceed average plan temperature 2 or more, then showing leaf.Additionally, according to
Some embodiments, for showing and/or not showing that the absolute threshold (in Figure 12 and 13) of leaf can also be calculated leave temperature
Method is carried out.Without planning chart, if such as thermostat is just mounted, then use the algorithm in Figure 15.In step
In 1510, if leaving temperature during heat supply to be arranged on 62 or less than 62, then leaf is shown.In step 1512, if
Leave temperature during refrigeration and be arranged on 82 or higher than 82, then leaf is shown.
According to some embodiments, Figure 16 is a series of display screen on thermostat, and wherein leaf icon fades in lentamente
Or fade out.Thermostat 110 is shown as: have the current environment temperature of the current set point at 70 degree and 70 degree in screen 1610
Degree.User starts to rotate outer shroud counterclockwise to reduce set point.In screen 1612, user has reduced set point to 69 degree.
It should be noted that leaf has not yet been displayed.In screen 1614, user has reduced set point to 68 degree and according to described algorithm
(as shown in Figure 12), leaf symbol 1630 shows.But, according to these embodiments, this leaf is first with light weak color (i.e.
To mix with background color) display.In screen 1618, user is rotated further and turns down set point, now to 67 degree.Now leaf
Subsymbol 1630 shows with color (such as green) brighter, bigger contrast.Finally, if user is rotated further setting and sets
Fixed point is to lower temperature (to save the more energy), and in the case of screen 1620, this set point is 66 degree now, leaf
Subsymbol 1630 shows with the most saturated contrast color.In this way, user is given useful and feedback information intuitively, i.e.
Reducing further of heat supply set point temperatures provides bigger energy conservation.
Thermostat management server 520 have as previously mentioned with and the ability that communicates of thermostat 101 matched of this server,
And especially have information (such as data, firmware, instruction etc.) is sent to thermostat 101, receive information from thermostat 101
(such as data, firmware, instruction etc.) also process the ability of this information.One exemplary nonrestrictive example of this information
Son relates to the function of thermostat and the HVAC system by its control (such as, to be planned temperature, leaves state and temperature, manual temperature
Change, and AD HOC (such as heat supply mode, " shut " mode", refrigeration mode) or particular state (automatically leave or manually from
Open) in time quantum)).According to some embodiments, Figure 17 A～Figure 17 D description standard set point temperatures planning chart relative to reality
Run the time plot of setpoint profile figure, corresponding to automatically leaving/automatically arrive the exemplary operation of algorithm.In order to originally beg for
The purpose of opinion, arrives the planning chart pattern simply thermostat being back to it automatically, and wherein this set point temperatures is back to meter
Draw temperature, user except manually changing.For clearly disclosed purpose, Figure 17 A shows and (is probably retirement for user
Personnel or stop the father that is in or mother and young child) relatively simple for (such as, week on specific working day
Two) exemplary thermostat temperature planning chart 1702.Planning chart 1702 consists of: between morning 7:00 and afternoon 9:00
Simple planning chart (such as, when habitant is typically to wake), for this simple planning chart, it is desirable to and the temperature of plan
Degree is 76 degree；And in the afternoon between 9:00 and morning 7:00 planning chart (such as, when habitant may typically fall asleep),
For this planning chart, it is desirable to and plan temperature be 66 degree.For the purpose immediately described, planning chart 1702 can be referred to as
" standard " set point planning chart or only planning chart.Planning chart is one or more set point temperatures of different time in a day
(such as, be 76 degree at 7 in the morning, and in the afternoon 9 be 66 degree) set, when reach plan time time, thermostat will
Control HVAC system to realize this plan configuration point temperature.Thermostat by control HVAC system to realize this plan temperature, unless
Exceeding, such as, manually arrange temperature set-point by user, this temperature will be maintained until the different plan temperature of instruction
Next planned time, and thermostat will be back to control HVAC system to realize this planning chart.Standard setting point planning chart
1702 can arbitrary by the various methods that describe before in one or more commonly assigned applications being incorporated to
Method or other method is established by some.
According to preferably automatically leaving algorithm, use the multi-sensor technology of thermostat 111 (in such as thermostat 110
Passive infrared proximity transducer), sense continuously and automatically and close space dwelling state.According to some embodiments, occupy-place senses
Device measures with at a relatively high frequency (such as 1Hz～2Hz).In these measured values are collected into " period " of time subsequently,
Such as 5 minutes.For each " period ", use simple algorithm for determining whether inhabitation to be detected.Such as, if one
In period, more than two sensor reading illustrates the movement detected, then this 5 minutes " period " is considered " inhabitation being detected ".Cause
This, each " period " is divided into one of two states: " inhabitation being detected " or " being not detected by living ".Implement according to some
Example, in order to make this period be classified as " inhabitation being detected ", the reading of certain threshold percentage must indicate motion.Such as,
It is found that even for the layout of relative mistake, when being lived in the closing space of regulation, the reading instruction fortune of about 10%
Dynamic.In this example, the threshold value of 5% may be used for sorting out this period for " inhabitation being detected ".
According to some embodiments, being based at least partially on the state being currently sensed of these periods, thermostat can be by
The spatial classification closing space or regulation is any state in several state, such as rather than in a restricted way, and " being in "
(also referred to as " inhabitation ") and " leaving " (automatic or manual).According to some preferred embodiments, between for predetermined minimum
Every, when the inhabitation being currently sensed has been " being not detected by living ", herein referred as leave state confidence window (away-
State confidence window, ASCW), then this automatically leave feature trigger close space state from " being in " to from
Open the change of (the most automatically leaving).Manually leaving is to leave state when user manually arranges thermostat entrance, is referred to as hands
Move and leave.Changing to the result leaving (automatic or manual) as state, actual operation set point temperatures change to make a reservation for
Energy-conservation leave state temperature (away-state temperature, AST), whether by the thermostat schedule indication of standard
The set point temperatures shown how, and wherein AST is preferably far below any plan temperature set-point.
Automatically the purpose leaving and manually leaving feature is in order to when not having habitant to experience practically or to enjoy
When the comfortableness of planning chart 1702 is arranged, it is to avoid unnecessary heat supply or refrigeration, thus reduce HVAC and use and save the energy.With
Way of example, this AST can be configured so that 62 degree of during winter (or will need the outdoor temperature of heat supply) and uses
The acquiescence predetermined value of 84 degree of (or the outdoor temperature of refrigeration being needed) during summer.Alternatively, for heat supply and refrigeration
AST temperature can be that user can be arranged.
This leaves state confidence window (ASCW) corresponding to sensing the time interval of non-inhabitation, after which, and can be with
The statistical accuracy of rationality is made and being run the most reliably it is assumed that i.e. really do not have habitant in closing space.For greatly
Majority typically closes space, it has been found that, the predetermined amount of time in the range of 90 minutes～180 minutes is the conjunction for ASCW
The suitable time period, to adapt to common situations, such as quiet reading, walk go out to corner mailbox, take a break, without sense
Measure motion or the relevant instruction of occupancy sensor sensing.(PCT/ is included in aforementioned one or more commonly assigned patent applications
US11/61457) provide in and leave entering of state feature (such as and not in a restricted way, setting up ASCW, and regulate ASCW)
One step details.
In the example of Figure 17 B～Figure 17 D, it is provided that automatically leave operation in the case of heat supply scheme and manually leave behaviour
The exemplary description made, wherein has the ASCW and the AST of 62 degree of 120 minutes, it should be appreciated that in view of this specification, be used for
The corresponding example that refrigeration and other ASCW/AST value select will be apparent from for those skilled in the art and herein
In the range of described embodiment.For illustrative purposes, setpoint profile Figure 170 2 planned shown in Figure 17 B and reality
Operation setpoint profile Figure 170 4 on border and sensing activity time axle (As), this sensing activity time axle illustrates that little black is ellipse
Circle mark, this little black ellipse labelling is corresponding to the activity (i.e. sensing " period " of the time of inhabitation) sensed, currently
By 11:00 in the morning.It should be noted that by 11:00 in the morning, before morning 10:00, have significant User Activity to be felt
Measure, be inert 1 hour interval 1706 (or classifying as the period of " being not detected by living ") afterwards.Due in Figure 17 B
Non-activity is spaced the most about 1 hour, and it is less than this ASCW, automatically leaves feature and not yet triggers state to leaving changing of state
Become.
The setpoint profile figure planned shown in Figure 17 C and until the actual setpoint profile figure of 4:00 in afternoon.As
In Figure 17 C explanation, inactive 120 minutes (from upper one " inhabitation being detected " since the period 120 minutes) after under
Noon 12:00, triggers state (automatically leaving) of leaving automatically, and the actual set point 1704 that runs changes from the set point 1702 of plan
To the AST temperature of 62 degree.Until 4:00 in afternoon, trigger automatically leave after not yet have activity to be sensed, therefore automatically from
Open still effective, and thermostat 110 will control HVAC system and maintain ASW.
With reference to Figure 17 D, after the example shown in Figure 17 A～Figure 17 C and about Figure 17 A～Figure 17 C description, it is shown that
Until the plan of 12:00 in the morning and actual setpoint profile figure.As illustrated in fig. 17, at about point in afternoon 5, for
Brief time interval 1708 starts to sense dwelling activity, and it triggers cuts closing space " auto-returned " or " automatically arriving "
Shifting to " being in " state, now, the set point 1704 of operation is back to the set point planning chart 1702 of standard.Alternatively, as
Fruit manually leaves and has been set, dwelling activity by triggerings by thermostat from leaving state " auto-returned " or " arrival automatically " cuts
Shift to be in or standard state, set point 1702 that is that set point 404 is back to standard or that plan will be run.
For some embodiments, set point temperatures is maintained energy conservation AST temperature by state of leaving, until following is non-
One of restrictive situation occurs: (i) receives being manually entered from user, and state change is back to the state of being in by it, will
Control to return to plan temperature set-point；(ii) receiving being manually entered from user, it changes set point temperatures, until plan
Before the future time of temperature set-point, this temperature will control, or (iii) is based on the dwelling activity sensed, and trigger and " automatically arrive
Reach " operational mode, state is changed the state of being in that is back to, thus returns control to the temperature of plan by it.For this area
For technical staff, other situation (such as vacation is left and sleep state) will be apparent from, aforementioned one or more common
With in assign an application (including PCT/US11/61457), many this situations are described more up hill and dale.
Figure 18～Figure 37 describe for determine contributor or agency when cause the use of HVAC system or do not use with
And be used for reporting this use or untapped alternative embodiment.It should be appreciated that likely there are many contributors to cause
The activation of HVAC system or do not activate, in the way of for example and not limitation, described many contributors can include leaving (automatically or
Manually), weather, manually arrange between temperature set-point, the difference of temperature schedule between the time period, time period of comparing
Time difference (the such as middle of the month the most on the same day) and(closed air conditioner compressed before arriving set point temperatures
Machine).
Figure 18 describes for determining and report when contributor or agency cause the use of HVAC system/untapped to replace
Choosing method 1800, or alternatively discuss the use of the estimation of HVAC system/do not use when be attributed to contributor or agency.
In step 1802, it is thus achieved that the data of the tolerance used in the embodiment of the inventive method.This can be by thermostat itself
Processor is carried out, but more preferably by thermostat management server 520 or alternatively communicate with thermostat any other
Processing equipment or their combination in any are carried out.Such as but the most in a restricted way, the data of tolerance can include weather (such as
External temperature), leave the time (t of stateLeave. manually. heat supply, tLeave. manually. refrigerationOr tLeave. automatically. heat supply, tLeave. automatically. refrigeration), heat supply/refrigeration/pass
Time (the t of close patternHeat supply,tRefrigeration,tClose), the time (t of temperature is manually setManually. heat supply,tManually. refrigeration), HVAC system actual motion

Substantially rewrite this planning chart, hence in so that this planning chart is substantially unnecessary.For purposes of this discussion, planning chart
Difference between 2002 (solid lines) and planning chart 2004 (chain-dotted line) reflected in this time period (in this case, being 24 hours)
Permanent planning chart change, or this could be for the day planner in calendar month.Due to the set point temperature between planning chart
This change on degree, if any, the energy will be had and use result.For purposes of this discussion, solid line 2002 will be by
The planning chart of each calendar day being considered in the time period of calendar month, and chain-dotted line 2004 will be considered as
After the planning chart of each calendar day of calendar plan table, this calendar plan table subsequently has identical natural law in the calendar month.
This means that user, for the day planner between the moon, changes the meter on the equipment communicated on thermostat or with thermostat
Draw table.
Referring again to Figure 20, for two curves, be identical in plan at 5 in morning temperature 2006, and therefore for
Realize and keep for this temperature the effort needed for HVAC, between the two planning chart, there is no difference.At point in the morning 6, for
The plan temperature 2007 of planning chart 2004 is the most identical, and the plan temperature simultaneously for planning chart 2002 is increased to temperature 2008
(such as, get up for household and prepare, plan temperature raises), until point in the morning 7.This causes being maintained, by HVAC, the plan temperature that this is new
Effort required for degree increases, and this is represented by shadow region 2009.At point in the morning 7, for planning chart 2004, plan temperature
2007 is the most identical, be increased to temperature 2010 simultaneously for the plan temperature of planning chart 2002 until point in the morning 10 (such as, as
Family prepared and was finally away from home at 10 in the morning morning, and plan temperature raises).Compared with planning chart 2004, little with for this
Time itself compare, for planning chart 2012 temperature raise cause the effort of these plan temperature needs (to be begged for about Figure 18 before
Opinion), and will still need HVAC effort, it is represented by cross-hatched area 2011.At point in the morning 10, temperature is for planning chart
2004 (at temperature 2007) are the most identical, and temperature drops to temperature 2012 (such as because of household for planning chart 2002 simultaneously
Having had been moved off room, therefore temperature is to decline).Temperature decline for plan temperature 2012 causes needing less HVAC
Make great efforts to maintain planning chart 2002, but, compared to planning chart 2004, will still need HVAC effort, pass through shadow region
2013 represent.4 point in the afternoon, planning chart 2002 and planning chart 2004 all rise high-temperature to the most identical temperature 2014, and in the afternoon 11
Before Dian, this temperature keep identical, in the afternoon 11 time, two planning charts drop to temperature 2016.Therefore, each planning chart from
At 4 in afternoon is until will have identical HVAC to make great efforts demand to maintain plan temperature at 6 in the morning.It should be appreciated that region 2009,
2011 will represent with the summation of 2013 and make great efforts with for the HVAC needed for planning chart 2002 compared with, the minimizing needed for planning chart 2004
HVAC effort, or on the contrary, the HVAC effort exceeding planning chart 2004 required for planning chart 2002.
As described above, the region representation under temperature schedule is in order in the specific time period (in this case, be
24 hours) the middle amount effort kept needed for this temperature schedule, or the sub-time period within the time period of given 24 hours
Amount effort (as shown by the region by different shades) needed for this temperature schedule of middle holding.In certain embodiments,
These regions can be relevant to certain optional reference temperature, calculates in the relevant time, and this time period is for each meter
It is identical for drawing table.As further described, this allows to compare these regions (i.e. making great efforts), and last in this time period
In HVAC use or do not use, this is because reference temperature will simply from this relatively deduct.Shadow region in Figure 20
Also represent such a comparison.In fig. 20, relative to certain optional reference temperature (such as, 0 degree), planning chart 2002 He
The difference in these regions of planning chart 2004 is only the summation in region 2009,2011 and 2013.
The most desired contributor is modeled or characterizes, for determining that the HVAC owing to any specific contributor uses
Or first the preferred embodiment of untapped estimator determines that contributor is for causing the HVAC of this estimation use or do not use
Whether it is qualified.Contributor is the most qualified is not the most absolute, but, in given real situation or push away
In the case of Duan, determine any specific contributor whether to be likely to the HVAC energy and use or do not use and contribute, or
It is likely to not make such contribution.Figure 21 to Figure 26 describes for determining that contributor or agency are for the energy causing offer
Source uses or does not uses the most qualified preferred implementation.
Figure 21 explanation is used for determining that weather (change of such as outdoor temperature or humidity) is at relevant time period (such as,
One calendar month or two calendar months) in cause HVAC use or do not use the most qualified embodiment 2100.In step 2102
In, collect external temperature data for the moon 1 and the moon 2, preferably access the constant temperature for pairing by thermostat management server 520
The online weather data of the postcode of device 110.In step 2102, by thermostat 110, thermostat management server 520
Or other processor communicated with this thermostat, it is also the moon 1 and collects for heat supply mode by the moon 2 (or other time period selected)
The time is used with the HVAC of refrigeration mode.The actual use time represents what HVAC system in relevant time period was run practically
Time quantum, no matter it is just in heat supply or refrigeration (i.e. in heat supply mode or refrigeration mode).Referring again back to section 0, beg for here
How opinion those skilled in the art will fill loss data is used for analyzing.In step 2104A and step 2104B, determine from the moon 1
To the moon 2 or select time period in, whether average outdoor temperature is raised and lowered.If for step 2104A or step
2104B answer is yes, the most respectively, determines that the HVAC of reality uses (heat supply) in step 2106A (i.e. be yes for 2104A)
Whether reduce or the HVAC of reality uses whether (refrigeration) increases, or determine in step 2106B (i.e. be yes for 2104B)
Whether actual HVAC use increases or the HVAC of reality uses whether (refrigeration) reduces.If for step 2106A or 2106B
Answer is yes, and if applicable, then weather is qualified by being considered for causing this use/do not use.If for
Step 2106A or 2106B answer are no, if applicable, then weather will be considered as underproof and be considered for
HVAC use/does not uses and does not contribute.If mean temperature does not change (for step 2104A and 2104B answer it is
No), then weather is also underproof.Weather qualification determines that ultimate principle behind is, if average outdoor temperature from the moon 1 to
The moon 2 raises, and HVAC heat supply uses minimizing or HVAC refrigeration use to increase, then can draw, weather can be qualifiedly as this
The reason being decreased or increased known to Zhong.If on the contrary, average outdoor temperature reduced from the moon 1 to the moon 2, and HVAC heat supply uses
Increase or HVAC refrigeration use and reduces, then can draw, weather can qualifiedly as known to the reason that is increased or decreased.
Figure 22 explanation is used for determining that the state of leaving (the most automatically leave or manually leave) is for drawing in relevant time period
Play HVAC use or do not use the embodiment 2200 that (typical consequence leaving state) is the most qualified.Step 2202 is for heat supply
Pattern and refrigeration mode, make great efforts (the region of Figure 19 to keeping the HVAC needed for set point temperatures in the time period leaving state
1923) summation.The equation 1922 using Figure 19 calculates the relevant range representing related endeavors.The left side of equation took for the moon
2 and the area difference (being discussed with reference to Figure 19) of effort that representative for the moon 1 reduces.It should be appreciated that regionRepresent the summation in all regions 1922 (Figure 19) for the moon 2, andRepresent all regions for the moon 2
The summation of 1922 (Figure 19), when the difference between both is characterized in heat supply mode due to leave state (no matter its be manually from
Open or automatically leave), effort required for the HVAC difference compared with the moon 1 in the moon 2.When thermostat is in refrigeration mode, class
As region for characterizing for the moon 2 compared to the HVAC effort of the moon 1.In step 2202, if for leaving state (manually
Or automatically) the summation of area difference more than zero, then step 2204 determines time difference and the system of heat supply mode between the moon 2 and the moon 1
Whether the summation of the time difference of chill formula is greater than zero.If step 2202 (required HVAC make great efforts reduce) and 2204 (from
The time of on-mode increases) be true, then leaving state (automatic or manual) contributor is eligible, causes HVAC system
Do not use owing to compared to total actually used in the moon 2 of moon 1HVAC system.Will be noted that, step 2202 is not even
Consider to leave whether state will cause net energy source to use, because this situation will be abnormal.As will be discussed, from
The saving manually left is different from from the saving automatically left, although this difference is the problem selected.
Compared to the actually used difference between the time period, Figure 23 explanation is for determining that change-plan contributor is the most right
It is the embodiment 2300 of eligible in causing HVAC to use in second time period or not using.APlan-0Represent planning chart-temperature
Degree is relative to the region under the curve of time, the first temperature (T in the poorest T2-T11) be reference temperature and select easily
It is selected as zero, as herein with reference to described by Figure 20.Therefore, area differenceWill be for each between the moon 2 and the moon 1
Planning chart to provide the HVAC of area difference or needs to make great efforts poor.If this difference is not equal to zero (step 2302), and the most extremely
When within rare 3 days, being in heat supply mode or refrigeration mode (step 2304), then changing-plan contributor will be eligible, as drawing
Rise compared to the moon 1, using HVAC system or not using owing to the total actually used of HVAC system in the moon 2 or not making
Reason, otherwise plan-contributor is underproof.One month in office needs only to be in heat supply mode or refrigeration mode
The ultimate principle of 3 days represents, people are actually currently in use this system (such as, at home rather than in vacation), in plan
Table there are differences, cause planning chart to cause use or untapped qualification.
Figure 24 illustrates, it is poor to use compared to the actual HVAC between the time period, is used for determining that pass mold closing changes contribution
Person uses for causing the HVAC in the second time period or does not uses the most qualified embodiment 2400.In this embodiment, close
Lattice require 2402 to determine simply, and whether the time difference of the " shut " mode" from the moon 2 to the moon 1 is more than zero.If step 2402 is
Very, it means that in the second time period, the more time spends in " shut " mode", and therefore this " shut " mode" will be eligible, and
It is likely to cause not using of HVAC system.If this difference is equal to or less than zero, then " shut " mode" is underproof.
Figure 25 illustrates compared to the actually used difference between first time period and the second time period, is used for determining and is reaching
(embodiment is referred to as present assignee to close compressor of air conditioner before set point temperatures) for
HVAC system is caused not use the most qualified embodiment 2500 during second time period.Air conditioning unit based on following principle work
Make: blow unregulated or warm air through cooling coil, at cooling coil, cooling coil and unregulated air it
Between occur heat exchange, heat flow to coil pipe from air.Gas in compressor compresses coil pipe is so that heat exchange can occur.Heat is handed over
Shift to occur at least partially through the condensation evaporation on coil pipe.Concept be that thermostat will reach in ambient temperature
Close compressor before set point temperatures, but will continue to blow unregulated air through coil pipe, coil pipe on them still
There is condensation.Even after close compressor, remaining condensation continues evaporation will regulate air.Entered one
Step is described in detail in the Patent patent application serial numbers 13/434 submitted on March 29th, 2012, and in 573, it is at this
It is incorporated herein by.With reference to step 2502, ifIt is active in period the second time period (moon 2), and
Thermostat is in refrigeration mode (t during the second time periodRefrigeration> 0), then compared to actual HVAC between these two time periods
Use difference,It is qualified for causing the HVAC of the second time period not use.
Figure 26 illustrate compared to the time period between actually used difference, be used for determining time phase (such as calendar) for
Cause using or not using the most qualified embodiment 2600 of the HVAC system in the second time period.By calculating simply it is
No have any difference to determine qualification between this time period (such as, January is to February), and if it is, this calendar is qualified
Person, and if it is not, then this calendar is failure.
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other contributor may cause more or less of use HVAC
System is to obtain closing the comfort level wanted in space.That provided above those are merely exemplary and with citing but
There is provided the most in a restricted way.Whether it is as causing use or untapped eligible, depending on according to determining contributor or agency

Execute example and use experience determiner, herein referred to as heat supply slope and refrigeration slope.The description of heat supply slope will be provided, its
Middle those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that how to determine refrigeration slope from the description of heat supply slope.It is said that in general, heat supply is oblique
Rate is in time from the measurement closing the how many heat of space leakage.With reference to Figure 27 A～27B, curve 2702 represents set point Indoor Temperature
The curve (such as planning chart) of degree, for a closing space with the HVAC controlled by programmable thermostats 110.Although it is bent
Line 2702 is not the curve of environment indoor temperature, and in the 24 hours sections described, it is the ambient temperature in this closing space
The reasonable approximation of (at least around the temperature sensor that this thermostat uses).For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that it is bent
Line 2702 is the planning chart of set point temperatures, and the every day at many months is kept constant by it.It should be appreciated that in order to illustrate
Purpose is made this and is supposed and be not limited to how that experience determines heat supply slope.Curve 2704 ' represent first day of the moon 24
The outdoor temperature (Figure 27 A) of hours section, this information can be by accessing on the Internet for managing server with thermostat
The Weather information of postcode of the thermostats of 520 pairings and obtain, as described above.Curve 2704 " (Figure 27 B) representative
The outdoor temperature of the 24 hours sections of second day, is wherein not provided for the curve of other days.It should be noted that and be not
Outdoor temperature curve is provided the every day of this month, and has the identical curve of different high and low temperatures to be provided to be easy to explanation and standard
Standby.
It should be appreciated that the HVAC actual run time by need that HVAC makes great efforts a certain amount of or alternatively described or make
By the amount of time, this closing space to be maintained environment indoor temperature (2702) that is required or that plan, and make great efforts or fortune
The amount of row time will depend upon which the amplitude of difference between outdoor temperature and required set point temperatures.Outdoor temperature and the room of plan
Between interior temperature, difference is the biggest, would be required to the biggest effort or more HVAC system runs the time with the Indoor Temperature realized a plan
Degree, two regions 2706 ' and 2706 the most on the same day by for describing " represent.Experience determines, is plotted in 24 little
Time the time period in required actual HVAC run the time to realize the set point temperatures planning chart required, as at set point meter
Draw the function (reference area 2706 ' and 2706 ") in region over time between table and outdoor temperature curve, by the line of data
Property matching cause data distribution by sufficiently close to.
Figure 28 describes imaginary data point 2802, each represent the operation time (longitudinal axis) for 24 hours sections with
And the region between indoor and outdoor temperature or the effort (transverse axis) required for the set point temperatures required by maintenance over time.
This empirical data matching has slope to linearity curve 2804, linearity curve 2804, referred to herein as heat supply slope.This confession
The unit of hot slope (or refrigeration slope) is best described as).It should now be appreciated that institute
That need or save have unit (degree. the time (deg. time)) the effort of estimation be multiplied by this heat supply slope, will produce
The raw HVAC estimated uses the time to meet the effort of this estimation.How this heat supply slope can be typically considered closing space
The measurement of ' leakage ' heat.Determine because it is experience and is likely to change over time, thus obtaining new the most over time
Data point and update this heat supply slope determine, as understood by those skilled in the art.If thermostat is pacified the most recently
Dress and insufficient data are available to calculate the heat supply slope for this closing space, and many differences close the flat of spaces
All analyses of heat supply slope have been calculated as And For the slope that freezes, it can serve as default value, until enough data exist to calculate heat supply
Slope and refrigeration slope.
With reference to Figure 29～Figure 35, heat supply slope (with refrigeration slope) combines the model of the qualified contributor of all or part
Using, the HVAC to use for the HVAC of each qualified contributor's quantitative estimation or estimate runs the time (step of Figure 18
1808) minimizing (also referred herein as not using) that, this qualified contributor uses owing to actual HVAC or uses.Should
The model of contributor causes adapting to or complete some changes for this system, and (state of such as leaving is activated, and user manually adjusts
Joint temperature set-point, external temperature fluctuations etc.) required for or the effort of approximation saved.
Figure 29 describes and quantifies the HVAC of the estimation due to weather (if qualified) and use or unused time preferred
Embodiment.In this preferred embodiment, the use from A, B with the estimation of C be summed together with determine for two months
In second month owing to the use of the estimation of the HVAC system of weather or do not use.It should be appreciated that any easily
Time period can be selected for analyzing.For step 2902 (Figure 29), between the moon 1 and the moon 2, the difference of average outdoor temperature is taken advantage of
The minima of the time quantum of heat supply mode it is in the thermostat for the moon 1 or the moon 2.If this thermostat is in heat supply in the moon 2
Pattern 500 hours and be in heat supply mode 450 hours in the moon 1, this temperature difference will be multiplied by 450 hours, and its product is for these
450 hours, cause the effort of estimation required for the temperature difference between these months.Then to be multiplied by heat supply oblique in this effort estimated
Rate is to obtain use or the unused time of the estimation of the change owing to outdoor temperature.Refrigeration slope is used to do one for refrigeration
Individual similar calculating, and two results are amounted to together.
Step 2902 considers the impact for 450 hours weather, and this time quantum is common between two months.For hot-die
Formula has extra 50 hour, and in the given example, it can also affect HVAC within the time period paid close attention to and use.At Figure 28 B
Described in method and Figure 28 C refrigeration simulation for process in AD HOC (heat supply/refrigeration) extra non-overlapped time
Between, but only Figure 28 B will come into question and be applied to Figure 28 C as same analysis.
Whether step 2904 is that threshold value determines, i.e. from two months summations in the heat supply mode time more than zero.If it is permanent
Temperature device is in heat supply mode for arbitrary moon, and this condition will be genuine, and if not really, then weather can not be to being used for
Any HVAC of heat supply uses or does not uses responsible.For refrigeration same will be so, and if both at zero, then sky
The HVAC of contribution zero estimation is used the time by gas, and it is meaningful, and step 2902 result also will be zero.In step 2906
In, determine to run time or the difference of the time of use from the moon 2 to the moon 1 at the HVAC that heat supply mode is actual, and if be not equal to zero, hold
Row step 2908；If equal to zero, then the HVAC of zero estimation being used for heat supply mode will be used the time responsible by weather.?
In step 2908, determine the moon 1 and between the moon 2 in the difference of heat supply mode time, and if be not equal to zero, then perform step 2910,
If equal to zero, then there is no overlapping time at heat supply mode, and owing to the use of heat supply mode or do not use for non-overlapped
Time will be zero.In step 2910, determine the use of the extra estimation owing to weather for heat supply mode or do not make
Use the time.Calculating used the absolute value of the difference of time between two months at the actual HVAC of heat supply mode.This value be multiplied by for
The time difference of two months heat supply modes and the ratio of the temporal summation of heat supply mode.By the total time at two months heat supply modes
It is upper average that this is poor, and by two months between the use of the reality of heat supply mode the amplitude of difference be multiplied by this ratio, have and cause surpassing
The impact of the time of overlapping time when crossing heat supply mode between two months.If being more than the moon 1 for the time of the moon 2 heat supply mode,
By instruction, at the product using more heat supply and generation the moon 2, according to the sign rule used, (positive is to save, and negative is to make
With) should be negative, therefore this product is multiplied by-1.Identical decision and from the result of A, B and C by always is makeed for refrigeration mode
Meter is together to provide the use (negative time) owing to actually used estimation or not use (positive time) or in the moon 1 and the moon 2
Between by the minimizing (also referred herein as not using) of the use of HVAC system.
Figure 30 and Figure 31 descriptive equation formula, for compared to the moon 1, quantify HVAC system for the use of the estimation of the moon 2 or
Do not use.With reference to these regions of Figure 19 calculating discussed above equation in Figure 30 and Figure 31, such asIt should be appreciated that the region 1923 in Figure 19 represents to enter as thermostat leaves state
The effort of saving of estimation of result, this region has unit degree. time (deg. time) and be at these equations
Used in identical region or the effort of estimation, except can applied just like the isolated area discussed with reference to Figure 19
Time period in amount to together to prove the region shown in Figure 30～Figure 31.The equation of Figure 30 and Figure 31 determines to be used for
The moon 1 and the difference automatically left between the region manually left of the moon 2, this difference is multiplied by applicable slope (heat supply or refrigeration),
The HVAC being changed the estimation caused by the state of leaving (automatically and manually) between the moon 1 and the moon 2 is caused to use or do not use.
Figure 32 describes an equation, changes, due to user, the HVAC system that the planning chart of set point temperatures causes for quantization
The use of estimation of system or do not use.Provide a similar equation in fig. 33, manually change due to user for quantization
Become the use of the estimation of the HVAC system that set point temperatures causes or do not use.It is to be further understood that and according to conjunction above
Lattice are discussed, and the equation of Figure 33 only will the most manually regulate set point temperatures as user, as not inputting planning chart
Time the same, used.With reference to described by Figure 20, calculate the region for these equations about reference temperature (such as 0 degree).
Region (plan the temperature integration to the time period) divided by the ratio of the time in this pattern (heat supply or refrigeration) be for this time
Between the weighted average plan temperature of section.For the equation of Figure 33, region is divided by according to this system of manual guidance set point
Time in heat supply mode.The equation of Figure 32 and Figure 33 takes the moon 1 and the weighted average plan temperature of the moon 2 (the most manual
Temperature is set) between difference and be multiplied by for this time period in heat supply (or refrigeration) pattern, (in Figure 33, Non-follow control supplies
Heat pattern) time.This result by estimate due to planning chart change cause required for or the amount of effort saved, then by it
It is multiplied by applicable slope use with the HVAC drawing the estimation required for realizing the effort of this estimation or do not use.
Figure 34 describes an equation, for quantifying user, thermostat is set to off HVAC system that close pattern causes
Estimate use or do not use.The party's formula takes the difference of time between two time periods at " shut " mode", and this difference divided by with
Summation in all times in other both of which of two time periods.This computing standardization the two effectively time period
Difference at " shut " mode".Then this ratio is multiplied by the summation of all times that the two time period HVAC actually runs, nothing
Opinion is at refrigeration mode or heat supply mode.This impact is the use being multiplied by reality in the standardized time difference of " shut " mode".
Figure 35 describes an equation, for quantifying the HVAC system caused by the time difference between two time periods
The use estimated or do not use, in the difference of natural law for this discussion between two calendar month.It is similar to the equation of Figure 34, Figure 35's
Equation takes the difference between two months at natural law, and this difference is divided by the summation of all times of two time periods.This computing mark
The standardization the two moon is in the difference of natural law.Then this standardized time difference is multiplied by the institute that the two time period HVAC actually runs
There is the summation of time, either at refrigeration mode or heat supply mode, cause the use of the estimation of HVAC system or do not use, as
In the result of change of natural law between the two moon.
Quantify byNot using of the estimation caused will be in any given moonIt is practically in
The time used.AsDirectly owing to section any preset timeIt it is active time quantum
As a result, this time, as will be understood, not as the real estimated value of the time that HVAC system is not run.Should
It is understood by, exceptProcess can be used to reach this purpose and the estimating of use owing to these other processes
The time quantum of meter is known to those skilled in the art.
In a preferred embodiment, the HVAC of the estimation quantified is used and non-use value will perform so-called ' reason ' inspection
Looking into, the amplitude digital with guarantee and symbol (save or use the energy) are meaningful when considering the situation of various reality.Figure
36 describe the process 3600 for the HVAC use/untapped estimated value estimated that converts.If condition 3602 is true, logical
Crossing the HVAC use/non-use value of the ratio all estimations of conversion, this ratio is that actual HVAC uses poor (equation 3603)
HVAC divided by all qualified estimations uses and the summation of non-use value.The effect of this conversion is, all scaled estimations
Use and untapped summation is by the HVAC use/untapped difference equal to reality, thus avoid report beyond actual HVAC
The HVAC of use/untapped estimation use/does not uses.It should be noted that the HVAC of not all estimation uses and do not makes
All can convert by value.Such as, the HVAC owing to the estimation of weather use/does not uses and can not convert, and is used forSimilarly can not convert with those of calendar.If condition 3604 is false, process 3600 arranges conversion system
Number is 1.If condition 3604 is false, it is meant that all not-the estimations HVAC of conversion uses the symbol of the summation with non-use value
It is different from the symbol of actually used difference (equation 3603).This situation will imply that a numeral in these numerals refers to
Show the energy conservation of total amount, and other instruction energy use, and are untenable situation in terms of macroscopic perspective.In these latter feelings
In condition, the HVAC of estimation uses and does not uses numeral to be used other processes to consider to determine that they are meaningful the most respectively
, and for nonsensical those, they are left in the basket and are not reported, or can because these numerals are the most nonsensical
Stop this process the most completely.
After the initial conversion of the HVAC use/non-use value estimated, the process 3650 of Figure 36 is used to perform additionally to convert,
To avoid reporting the excessive numeral for the HVAC use/non-use value estimated.In step 3651, maximum _ to use (Max_
Usage) minima (including negative value) in estimation HVAC use/non-use value after being defined as all conversions, it is because adopting
Sign rule will be possible for negative.Maximum _ not use (Max_NonUsage), also it is defined in step 3651, for
The maximum in estimation HVAC use/non-use value after all conversions, it will be because the sign rule used just will be possible for
Value.In step 3652, if difference actually used between two months (Δ from equation 3603Use(ΔUsage)) more than zero
(compared to the moon 1, use in the net energy source of the moon 2) and maximum _ use (the HVAC use value that minimum negative value is maximum estimation) little
In-1.9 × ΔUse, then the second conversion coefficient is multiplied by Δ for-1.9UseRatio divided by maximum _ use (Max_Usage) value.This
Ensure that the HVAC of the estimation again converted of report uses numeral, when at actually used increase (ΔUse> 0) time, when actually used
Difference (energy uses as just) is (at this situation energy in identical direction with the direction of the use of maximum estimated/non-use value
Use) time be maintained in reasonable value.Work as ΔUse(it is reflected in the saving in the actual net energy source of second month or less makes less than zero
With) and maximum _ do not use (Max_NonUsage) value to be multiplied by Δ more than-1.9UseTime (result is just), identical analysis application
The conversion of process 3650 in step 3654.When the actual energy uses or do not use (saving) and the HVAC use value estimated
Tending to identical direction (use or do not use, the situation as possible), step 3652 and 3654 ensures maximum (in amplitude
On) HVAC of estimation that reports use or do not use (respectively step 3652 and step 3654) be not more than 1.9 be multiplied by for
Report time section (moon 2) is at actually used (ΔUse) increment or decrement (respectively corresponding step 3652 and step 3654).
When the HVAC use/non-use value that the actual energy uses or do not uses and estimates tends to contrary direction,
Step 3656 and 3658 attempts to process this situation.(if condition is true), actually used poor Δ in step 3656UseLess than zero
(use of minimizing) and maximum _ use (Max_Usage) are less than ΔUse(maximum estimation HVAC uses in amplitude more than reality
The use reduced) indicate maximum estimation HVAC to use the rightabout being inclined to the actual change that HVAC uses.If step
The condition of 3656 is true, and the conversion of use is ΔUseDivided by maximum estimated service life, it is ensured that the HVAC of the most scaled estimation
Use/do not use the conversion actual change without departing from the amplitude of use of numeral.Step 3658 is analogue, wherein a ΔUseMore than zero (the actual HVAC of increase uses) and maximum _ do not use (Max_NonUsage) less than ΔUseSo that maximum estimated
The untapped amplitude of HVAC is beyond the amplitude of actually used change, but the HVAC that instruction is estimated use/does not uses with actually used
Change incline in the opposite direction, in above-mentioned situation.In this case, conversion is arranged to ΔUseDivided by maximum _ do not make
By the use of (Max_NonUsage)/non-use value, it is ensured that the conversion of the HVAC use/non-use value of the most scaled estimation
Actual change without departing from the amplitude of use.Normally, this conversion process ensure report and scaled estimation HVAC use/
Non-use value is maintained at 1～2 and is multiplied by within the actual HVAC use of the moon 2.By this way, it is to avoid report is the biggest
Numeral.As discussed above, process 3650 converts the HVAC use/non-use value of the most scaled estimation again, to keep away
Exempt to report the value nonsensical about real data, the actual change especially used at HVAC from the moon 1 to the moon 2.
Above-mentioned discussion with reference to Figure 35 quantifies use/not make owing to the HVAC of the estimation of the difference of natural law between the moon 1 and the moon 2
With.The conversion of this mode just described is disobeyed in the use of this calendar attribution/do not use.With reference to Figure 37, it is provided that
One preferred process 3700, to ensure that the use/do not use owing to the moon 1 and the estimation of the moon 2 natural law difference is not result in unintentionally
Justice numeral, and by the upper limit at maximum number to avoid this situation.Such as, if two months differ one day, then owing to day
The HVAC going through poor estimation use/does not uses and may be more than 24 hours." quantity of equipment " refers in this closing space
The quantity of programmable thermostats, and calendar _ use/do not use (cal_usage/nonusage) to be attributed to the moon 1 and the moon 2
The use/untapped value of estimation of natural law difference.
Make great efforts to avoid reporting nonsensical numeral to also have the HVAC of the estimation of remainder to make although being described above
By/non-usage amount.The summation of the most scaled HVAC use/non-usage amount is likely to be not equal to ΔUse.In certain situation
In, the two numeral may be a good distance away, and in many cases, perhaps most numerals is fairly close, but due to user
Check report will be likely to notice this differ from thus these differences can not or should not be left in the basket.For processing the one of residue problem
Individual embodiment, will determine that the most sufficiently small HVAC to be included into the estimation owing to weather of remainder use/does not uses.Such as but not
In a restricted way, if (assuming that weather is qualified) remainder (=ΔUseThe HVAC of-scaled estimation use/does not uses
The summation of value) absolute value more than 0.2* ΔUseAbsolute value, then owing to weather the estimation regulated HVAC use/not
Use will be for=ΔUseHVAC use/non-the use value of-all estimations is except the summation owing to weather.If this remainder is more than
abs(0.2*ΔUse), this will be a constant and be investigated by needs, and will not generate report.
Referring back to Figure 18, the HVAC uses/non-use value of the estimation quantified in step 1810 conversion and reference Figure 36
～after Figure 37 is described immediately above, the HVAC use/non-use value owing to qualified contributor or the estimation of agency is pressed
Amplitude according to them sorts from being up to minimum.Value is less than ΔUse5% be dropped as inessential number.In step 1814
