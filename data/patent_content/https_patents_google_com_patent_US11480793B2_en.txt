Definitions
- the present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to laser projectors and particularly relate to aligning lenses in laser projectors.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- a challenge in the design of wearable heads-up displays is to minimize the bulk of the face-worn apparatus will still providing displayed content with sufficient visual quality.
- a projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object.
- a projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser.
- the at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object.
- the at least one controllable mirror may include: a single digital micromirror (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- MEMS microelectromechanical system
- DLP digital light processing
- a wearable heads-up displays typically requires projector alignment.
- the projector needs to be aligned with the display element (hologram, light guide, etc.) of the wearable heads-up display to ensure that the image formed by the laser projector is visible to the user at a desired location within the field of view of the user.
- Laser projectors may contain more than one laser light source to allow full-color images to be displayed by the projector, where each laser light source projects a portion of an image and the combined light of all laser light sources forms a single image.
- a full-color laser projector typically contains a red, a green, and a blue laser light source.
- Each laser light source in the laser projector needs to be aligned with the display element of the wearable heads-up display and must also be aligned with each other laser light source within the projector to ensure that the projector forms a single image, rather than multiple overlapping images.
- a method to perform alignment projector alignment may be summarized as including directing laser light emitted by at least one laser light source to at least one lens, directing the laser light by the at least one lens to a diffractive optical element (“DOE”), diffracting the laser light by the DOE to form a diffracted light, measuring a property of the diffracted light with a light sensor, in response to the measured property of the diffracted light being outside a specified range, adjusting a position of the at least one lens to optimize a quality of the diffracted light, and, in response to the measured property of the diffracted light being inside the specified range, fixing the at least one lens at a current position.

- Directing the light from the at least one lens to a DOE may include directing the laser light from the at least one lens to a dynamic mirror and directing the laser light from the dynamic mirror to the DOE.
- Directing the laser light from the dynamic mirror to the DOE may include directing the laser light from the dynamic mirror to a splitter and directing the laser light from the splitter to the DOE; directing the laser light from the splitter to the DOE may include splitting the laser light into at least two portions of light; and wherein each portion of light may comprise an exit pupil.
- Sweeping across a two-dimensional area of the DOE with laser light may include scanning a raster across the DOE, and wherein measuring a property of the diffracted light with a light sensor may include measuring a property of the diffracted light scanned across the two-dimensional area of the light sensor as a raster.
- Sweeping across a two-dimensional area of the DOE with laser light may include sweeping a Lissajous curve across the DOE, and wherein measuring a property of the diffracted light with a light sensor may include measuring a property of the diffracted light swept across the two-dimensional area of the light sensor as a Lissajous curve.
- Directing the laser light by the at least one lens to the DOE may include directing the laser light by the at least one lens to a beam combiner and directing the laser light by the beam combiner to the DOE.

- the various embodiments described herein provide systems, devices, and methods for aligning a lens in a laser projector and are particularly well-suited for use in wearable heads-up displays (WHUDS).
- WUDS wearable heads-up displays
- a laser projector may produce an image that is visible to a user by projecting a pattern of light onto a non-user object such as a screen, a wall, or similar surface. The image formed by the pattern of light may then be viewed by the user by the process of having the viewer look at the non-user object to view the image formed on the non-user object.
- a laser projector may produce an image that is visible to the user by projecting a pattern of light onto the retina of the eye of the user; in this case the projector forms part of a virtual retina display (VRD).
- VRD virtual retina display
- the projector light must pass through the pupil of the eye of the user in order to reach the retina of the eye of the user, which may be achieved with projector light that originates (or appears to originate) within the field of view (FOV) of the eye of the user.
- the projector light may be directed through the pupil of the eye of the user by mounting the projector itself within the FOV of the eye of the user, or by redirecting the projector light via an optical element within the FOV of the eye of the user. Said optical element may obstruct at least a portion of the FOV of the eye of the user, as in the case of Google Glass®.
- projector light may be directed through the pupil of the eye of the user via a transparent combiner where the transparent combiner redirects projector light into through the pupil of the eye of the user while allowing environmental light to pass through the transparent combiner and also be visible to the eye of the user.
- a transparent combiner includes a diffractive optical element (DOE).
- DOE diffractive optical element
- Non-exclusive examples of transparent combiners include holographic combiners and light guides.
- a VRD employing a transparent combiner is advantageous as it allows the user to see the image produced by the projector without necessarily obstructing the field of view of the user, however the transparent combiner typically requires careful alignment of the projector in order for the projector to successfully direct light onto the retina of the eye of the user.
- a holographic transparent combiner is very sensitive to the angle at which projector light impinges on the holographic transparent combiner.
- Holographic transparent combiners are only able to redirect light that satisfies the Bragg condition for angle for at least one of the holograms within the holographic combiner; typical holographic transparent combiners have a very narrow range of angles that satisfy the Bragg condition.
- a small mis-alignment of the projector may cause a large change in the apparent position of the projected image and/or cause the holographic transparent combiner to be unable to redirect projector light into the eye of the user.
- the sensitivity of projector mis-alignment further increases for multi-laser projectors due to wavelength-dependent angular shifts in hologram playback causing the separate laser images to fail to overlap.
- a transparent combiner comprising a light guide is very sensitive to the angle at which projector light impinges on the light guide.
- a light guide based transparent combiner typically operates by incoupling projector light into the light guide with an incoupler, propagating the projector light through the light guide, and then outcoupling the light from the light guide into the eye of the user with an outcoupler.
- the incoupler and the outcoupler in a typical light guide comprise DOEs; throughout this specification and the appended claims, the terms “in-coupler” and “out-coupler” are generally used to refer to any type of optical grating structure, including without limitation: diffraction gratings, holograms, holographic optical elements (e.g., optical elements employing one or more holograms), volume diffraction gratings, volume holograms, surface relief diffraction gratings, and/or surface relief holograms.
- Incoupling, propagation, and outcoupling of projector light are all strongly affected by the angle at which projector light impinges on the light guide; even a small mis-alignment of the projector may cause failure of incoupling, propagation, or outcoupling.
- the above-mentioned increase in sensitivity for multi-laser projectors is further increased in light guides due to the propagation of the laser light through the light guide.
- a typical wearable heads-up display may comprise a support structure that (while in use) is worn on a head of a user, a transparent combiner carried by the support structure, and a projector carried by the support structure.
- Alignment of the projector in a WHUD may be defined as fixing the position of the projector at a distance and at an angle relative to the transparent combiner to direct projector light into the eye of the user; projector alignment may thereby be achieved by fixing the position and orientation of the projector relative to the transparent combiner.
- Typical manufacturing processes for producing the projector are inherently imprecise and assembly of the projector and the transparent combiner within the carrier without application of an additional alignment process to the projector will result in mis-alignment of the projector. There is a need in the art for a process to align a projector with a transparent combiner comprising a DOE to allow the projector to direct light into the eye of the user.

- first lens adjuster 120 comprises a sub-component of projector 110
- first lens 112 may be fixed at a current position by disabling first lens adjuster 120 , where disabling first lens adjuster 120 renders first lens adjuster 120 incapable of adjusting the position of first lens 112 .
- First lens adjuster 120 may be disabled permanently (for example, adhering at least a portion of first lens adjuster 120 in place or breaking a portion of the adjuster, for instance breaking a head off a set screw) or temporarily (for example, physically decoupling a portion of first lens adjuster 120 from another component).

- FIG. 2 is an example of a lens 200 possessing a principal axis 210 and the dimensions through which lens 200 may be translated or rotated.
- the term “principal axis” generally refers to the line passing through the optical center and optical centers of curvature of the faces of a lens.
- FIG. 2 depicts first dimension X, second dimension Y, and third dimension Z.
- Second dimension Y is perpendicular to first dimension X.
- Third dimension Z is perpendicular first dimension X and second dimension Y.
- FIG. 2 depicts first axis of rotation ⁇ , second axis of rotation ⁇ and third axis of rotation ⁇ .
- First axis of rotation ⁇ is aligned along first dimension X.
- Second axis of rotation ⁇ is aligned along second dimension Y, therefore second axis of rotation ⁇ is perpendicular to first axis of rotation ⁇ .
- Third axis of rotation ⁇ is aligned along third dimension Z, therefore third axis of rotation ⁇ is perpendicular to first axis of rotation ⁇ and second axis of rotation ⁇ .
- the position of lens 200 may be adjusted, where adjusting the position of lens 200 may be performed as part of a process to align a projector.
- the position of lens 200 may be adjusted via lateral displacement of lens 200 in at least one of: first dimension X, second dimension Y, and third dimension Z. Lateral displacement of lens 200 in a dimension includes linear movement in said dimension.
- the position of lens 200 may be adjusted via angular displacement of lens 200 around at least one of: first axis of rotation ⁇ , second axis of rotation ⁇ , and third axis of rotation ⁇ .

- Z third dimension
- a person of skill in the art will appreciate that the alignment of three perpendicular dimensions (and associated axes of rotation) is an arbitrary frame of reference, and lens 200 could be depicted with principal axis 210 oriented in any direction.
- lenses are depicted with their principal axes initially aligned with the Z axis for the sake of clarity when discussing angular and/or lateral displacement.
- a spherical lens is symmetrical around the Z axis and therefore rotation around third axis of rotation ⁇ will not cause any observable change in light passing through lens 200 along the Z axis; in contrast rotation of lens around first axis of rotation ⁇ and/or second axis of rotation ⁇ will cause a change in the optical path of light that was initially passing through lens 200 along the Z axis. If lens 200 is not spherical (e.g., if lens 200 has a cylindrical optical power) then rotation around third axis of rotation ⁇ may be referred to as “clocking” lens 200 .
- Adjusting the position of first lens 112 to optimize a quality of diffracted light 162 may include adjusting the position of first lens 112 to maintain a brightness of the diffracted light within a brightness range, the brightness range delimited by a nominal minimum brightness and a nominal maximum brightness.
- the brightness may be measured on an absolute scale, e.g., a minimum power (for example, a minimum value of watts per square meter).
- the brightness may be measured on an arbitrary scale, for example a minimum value on a scale from 1 to 255.
- the brightness may be measured on an relative scale, for example a scale where the minimum brightness is the lowest brightness that may be measured by the light sensor and where the maximum brightness is the maximum brightness that may be measured by the light sensor.
