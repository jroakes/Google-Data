In some this example embodiments, these rules are influenced whether notice is to be synchronized to all endpoints (for example, operating all Tathagata
From the phone, wrist-watch, personal computer of the browser of Google Chrome) for, these rules are of overall importance, but
In other this example embodiments, these rules are not of overall importance.In addition, for example, in some embodiments, it is certain form of
Notice is put into " blacklist ", that is, is automatically determined to be worth triggering that can cause the electronic equipment 100 for showing those immediately
Operation.
In addition, for this filtering, it is also understood that whether the filtering of execution is according to electronic equipment 100 with complete
Awakening mode, middle model or close pattern are operated and changed.In fact, more typically, the filtering of execution can usual root
Change according to the operation mode of electronic equipment, and should be understood that the disclosure contemplate in the presence of than complete awakening mode, in
Between the operation mode of pattern and close pattern electronic equipment embodiment (and including embodiment) possibility, and it is also contemplated that
Pattern to electronic equipment can include " subpattern ", correspond to composition function associated with any given operation mode
The operation of subdivision --- for example, the breathing pattern and the pattern of the preview mode of operation that such as operate are considered hereafter
The subpattern that the middle model further discussed is included.Although particular term as used herein refer to various patterns (and son
Pattern), it should be understood that other terms can also be selected to refer to these patterns (and subpattern).For example, it is possible that
Term " breathing pattern " can be used to refer to be described herein as it is associated with " middle model " functional, including " preview mould
Formula " operates, and specific function associated with " breathing pattern " described herein can be referred to by different modes.(so
And for description provided herein purpose, " middle model " includes " breathing pattern " and " preview mode " operation).
Moreover, it will be understood that according to embodiment or environment, filtering can include a variety of different types of filtration steps and
Processing, including, such as a variety of different types of regular applying steps, sequence step and/or processing or mining data (for example,
Analysis or cross reference text string or the name detected in various text strings) wrap involved step or application.
After step 322 (or being used as its result), as step 324 further represents, electronic equipment 100 is based on
The filtering, determines whether the notice received meets really for middle model (or AoD patterns as noted)
One or more criterions of display.If so, as shown in Figure 3, which leaves complete awakening mode and enters intermediate
Pattern is shown as indicated by the arrow 325, is pierced by from complete awakening mode region 302 and enters middle model region 306.More
It says, once into middle model region 306, which specifically reaches step 326, in the step 326, starts breathing operation body
(if alternatively, having been carried out, continuing to execute).Below in conjunction with Fig. 4 A to 10B, more specifically description can be referred to as exhaling
The example breathing operation (as noted, being considered intermediate or AoD patterns subpattern) of suction mode operation.
Alternatively, if be unsatisfactory in the notice that step 324 determines to receive (based on the filtering of step 322) with intermediate die
The criterion that formula is shown, the then processing advance to step 328 from step 324.In step 328, by electronic equipment 100 (according to breathing
Pattern) determine whether breathing operation has carried out and be performed.If breathing operation is carrying out, handle from step
328 return to step 326, and the breathing operation carried out continues without change, i.e. and the electronic equipment continues just with not weakening
Often perform breathing operation.If however, determining that breathing operation is not yet carrying out in step 328, which returns from step 328
Step 314, show that 105 be to close so that the processing returns to close pattern, especially touch-screen, and the generation that breathes no more
(therefore, breathing operation does not change and screen remains turned-off).
As Fig. 3 in addition shown in and being discussed in further detail to 10B below in conjunction with Fig. 4 A, when electronic equipment 100
During through reaching the step 326 of middle model to be operated with breathing pattern, then breathing operation can indefinitely continue.However,
Several action or event may occur, and breathing operation is caused to be stopped and/or the operation mode is caused to change.First, as in Fig. 3
It is shown, it until step 330, is pressed if receiving power knob at electronic equipment 100, electronic equipment return is called out completely
Awake pattern, the especially processing proceed to the step 332 in complete awakening mode region 302, wherein, which is called out
It wakes up (especially, processor 203 powers on), correspondingly, the respiratory exercise work of step 326 terminates.This power knob presses behaviour
Work can also be considered as that " home button " is pressed, if complete awakening mode is considered as " homepage " pattern.Step 332 it
Afterwards, then the processing is otherwise returned to step 310, and in the step 310, touch-screen shows that 105 unlatchings (and show reception on it
The notice arrived).
Alternatively, as represented by step 326 to be linked to the arrow 333 of step 320, it is also possible to, in step 326
Breathing operation during, electronic equipment 100 receives further new notice, as step 320 represents again.If this
Point occurs, then the processing again passes by step 320,322,324 and possible step 328, and then, this processing returns to step
326.That is, when receiving new notice, finally, the breathing of step 326 operation continues because the notice received meet with
The criterion or carried out because breathing operates that middle model determined by step 324 is shown, such as step 328 institute really
Fixed.It should be understood that although step 320,322,324 and 328 are shown as being included in complete awakening mode region 302,
But in an alternative embodiment it is also possible to, when electronic equipment 100 is in breathing pattern and filtered model and responds new logical
Know and receiving these steps for newly notifying can all perform as the part of intermediate operation mode, it is at least real in some replacements
It applies in example.
In addition as shown in figure 3, in some cases, during the breathing operation of step 326, user can touch touch-screen
" click field " on display 105, when touch is activity especially during breathing, following article combination Fig. 9 is had more
Body description.If this touch is happened at step 334, which advances to step 336, wherein, electronic equipment 100 is kept
In intermediate operation mode (AoD patterns), but during this period, preview can occur.As this preview operation representated by step 336
Being considered composition, (user touch point hits the switch process in field as the preview operation pattern of subpattern of middle model
334 are considered the part of breathing pattern or preview mode).As discussed with reference to Fig. 9, as representated by step 336
The execution of operation of part of preview mode can ultimately result in the processing and return to any one of various modes, such as by scheming
What 3 arrow 337 represented, (correspond to step 326), complete awakening mode or close pattern including breathing pattern.
Finally, also as shown in figure 3, it is also possible that during the operation with the corresponding breathing pattern of step 326, no
It is pressed by power key (or button) or touch-screen is interactive or starts or incoming in the notice that step 320 is solved exhales
It cries, remind, (in other words, some other type of notice does not correspond to appointing in step 320,330 or 334 to other wake events
What one) it will occur.If this event occurs, the processing of flow chart 300 advances to step 339, in the step 339, electricity
Sub- equipment 100 is waken up, and reaches complete awakening mode region 302 again.However, after step 339, if such as step
Representated by 340 when touch-screen display 105 is closed, then the processing return middle model, specifically, return to step
326, and recover breathing again.
Now respectively with reference to figure 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D, show the touch-screen display 105 of electronic equipment 100 first,
Second, third and the 4th exemplary view, it is intended to during each several part for being illustrated in the processing representated by the flow chart 300 of Fig. 3, specifically
For, (with 306 corresponding process part of middle model region) during the breathing included in middle model and preview mode,
In image process is shown, the exemplary operations of touch-screen display.Fig. 4 A are had been shown in particular when touch-screen display 105 closes completely
The blank image 400 occurred when closing.Following article combination Fig. 6 further discusses that blank image 400 appears in and step 326
Specific time during corresponding breathing operation.
In contrast, Fig. 4 B show breathing view image 402, are not blank, on the contrary, including being shown by touch-screen
One or more image sections shown by device 105, and wherein, this example, which has specifically included, can form and can be existed by user
During operation under breathing pattern (for example, Fig. 3 step 334) touch clicks field icon 404, can also form separately
The other icon 406 and time showing 408 of outer click field (or multiple regions).Following article combination Fig. 6 (and Fig. 7) institute into
One step discussion, breathing view image 402 is not to be kept it turned on during the operation under breathing pattern in institute's having time, on the contrary,
Periodically become as it can be seen that then disappearing (at this point, the blank image 400 of Fig. 4 A is presented again in touch-screen display 105).
Next, with reference to Fig. 4 C, it is illustrated that preview animated image 410.As shown in the figure, preview animated image 404 also includes
As one or more image sections shown by touch-screen display 105, and more specifically, in this embodiment, these
One or more image sections not only include all image sections (that is, icon 404, icon 406 and the time showing shown in Fig. 4 B
408), and animation feature 412 is additionally comprised, the upper and lower row that extend vertically in this example comprising three points are (that is, above
Time showing 408 and following icon 406).As further discussed, in the breathing pattern phase that can receive touch
Between time point (for example, breathing view image 402 shown in Fig. 4 B shown time point) with having completely passed into preview mode
And it the transition period between the time point that the preview view image of all example images as shown in Figure 4 D is shown, is shown by touch-screen
Device 105 is particularly shown animation feature 412.On the step 334 of Fig. 3, the display of the preview animated graphical overview of Fig. 4 C may be considered that
It is a part for breathing pattern or a part for preview mode.
In addition, on Fig. 4 D, preview view image 414 shown here is the Ke Yiyou once come into preview mode
The example of image shown by touch-screen display 105.As shown in the figure, preview view image 414 is no longer included in preview animation
The arrangement of identical image section shown in image 410, although the appearance of some image sections appears the same as.More
It says, for preview view image 414 is compared with preview animated image 410, no longer with animation feature 412 or time showing body
408, and it is to continue with that there is the icon 405 identical with 404 appearance of icon and the icon 407 identical with 406 appearance of icon, only
Icon 405 is now arranged in the position in preview animated graphical overview compared with icon 404, and the position moved up is (special in animation
It is more than the above-listed topmost portion position of the point of sign), and icon 407 be now arranged in compared with its in preview animated graphical overview first
The position that front position is moved vertically downward (below the position of the following minimum point of the point of animation feature).
In addition, in preview view image 414, one or more (being in this example three) texts serial 416 also by
It is shown on icon 405.Text serial 416 can include information or one with being received by electronic equipment 100 or more
It is a passing to notify corresponding information.Therefore, the serial display of these texts allows user's " preview " via electronic equipment 100
Receive (for example, receive recently) notice, therefore be this operation side for causing term used herein " preview mode "
The feature of formula.
In addition respectively with reference to figure 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D, other 500,502,510 and of view of first, second, third and fourth
514.First, second, third and fourth view 500,502,510 and 514 moves respectively including each blank, breathing view, preview
View and preview image 400,402,410 and 414 are drawn, is shown respectively in Fig. 4 A, 4B, 4C and 4D, but is also shown and user
Those images --- the especially finger 512 of the hand of user --- combined are illustrated with those image interactions.Because in blank sheet
In the case of as 400 and breathing view image 402, not yet close to touch-screen display, the first of Fig. 5 A is another for the finger 512 of user
External view 500 only again illustrates blank image 400, and the second other view 502 of Fig. 5 B only again illustrates breathing and regards
Figure image 402.In contrast, for the 3rd other view 510 of Fig. 5 C, it is contemplated that user has utilized the finger 512 of user to touch
Touch-screen display 105 is touched, and which results in the displays of preview animated graphical overview 410.Especially, it is noted that finger
512 are touching image 404, constitute one of the click field on touch-screen display 105 in this example.In addition, because
It touches animation feature 412 for the finger 512 of (in response to) user and is shown as the click field occurred (following article will combine
What Fig. 9 was more specifically discussed, as the response for the touch in one of click field, animation feature progressively occurs).
Finally, in Fig. 5 D, the 4th other view 514 shows the preview view image 414 of Fig. 4 D, and also shows again
The finger 512 of user is still close to (touch) touch-screen display 105.As indicated by the arrow 515, when in preview operation mould
When in formula, user can further provide for gesture (or gesture part), perform to start electronic equipment 100 and several do not go together
Any one (below with reference to what Fig. 9 was further discussed again) one of moved or be transformed into several different modes.
In this example, the gesture in this respect of electronic equipment 100 is started and cannot be implemented, until except the breathing pattern phase in operation
Between click on field original touch beyond (in this example, and being one of icon 404 and 406), then user is further：
(i) in the transition period from breathing pattern to preview mode, continuation continuously touches the click field (for example, with touch screen display
Show device from breathing view 402 be transformed into preview animated graphical overview 410 and most Zhongdao preview view 414, continue touch icon 404,
One of 406)；(ii) finger 512 is manipulated to slide (for example, according to the arrow 515 of Fig. 5 D any one) up or down until finger
Appropriate one of the image section of the click corresponding preview view image in field of arrival and original touch is (for example, reach pre-
The icon 405, one of 407 look at shown in view 414) and (iii) is then, by the way that finger 512 is moved from touch-screen display
It removes, discharges the click field.
Turning now to Fig. 6, the flow chart 600 of modification is provided, to illustrate with the processing of the flow chart 300 of Fig. 3 the step of
During operation under 326 corresponding breathing patterns, the exemplary operations of electronic equipment 100, more specifically, the electronic equipment
The operation of touch-screen display 105.The flow chart 600 of modification respectively include breathing pattern under operate first, second, third,
Four steps 602,604,606 and 608.First step 602 specifically represents the stage of breathing operation, wherein, breathe view image
It is shown with high-high brightness on touch-screen display 105.As an example, Fig. 6 shows the breathing view image 402 of Fig. 4 B
For the breathing view image of display (it includes icon 404, icon 406 and time showing 408 again).However, it should be understood that
Breathing view image 402 is only that can be shown as breathing many images of view image and an example of image section.With most
The breathing view image that big brightness is shown can be referred to as providing breathing view image in breathing plateau, as will be referred to Fig. 7 institutes
It further describes.
Further meaning on step 602 is that can be considered the image sections of all related displays (be still icon
404th, icon 406 and time showing 408) it is located in First partial region 610.On First partial region 610, it should be understood that
It is that this is not physical features, and only defines including the part as the space occupied by touch-screen display and possible
The region of the part in the space beyond the display scope.Therefore, although regional area 610 is shown as prolonging in this example
The scope with the corresponding breathing view image 402 in physical boundary/edge of touch-screen display 105 is extended over, but it is true
On, regional area 610 is intended to refer to a part for the touch-screen display 105 in the border rather than by the whole of the borders
A space.
Moreover, it will be understood that First partial region 610 is not formed in the actual displayed on touch-screen display 105
Images of items (rectangle part for the touch-screen display that such as can be so illuminated), but only indicate that can be actuated touches
Touch a part for panel type display.Therefore, in this example, touch-screen display 105, which is only actuated, is located exactly at showing in office
The image section of position (location of pixels) on display in portion region 610 is located exactly at without actuateding display and is touching
On the upper area 612 above regional area 610 on panel type display 105 or the display in following lower area 614
Any image section of position (location of pixels).In consideration of it, the image section being located in regional area 610 is (in this situation
Under, icon 404, icon 406 and time showing 408) be located within the regional area 610 for, regional area 610 itself can be with
It is referred to as including those image sections.That is, for the ease of quoting the image section in regional area 610, can will show
Regional area 610 itself be known as show just be physically located at in the corresponding space of the regional area image section (
Be still icon 404 and 406 and time showing 408 under this situation) display.
Still referring to Fig. 6, in the present embodiment, regional area 610 (that is, the image section being located therein) is in first step
602 are shown (plateau) with high-high brightness.After period shows the period of regional area 610 with high-high brightness, screen display is touched
Show that device 105 is actuated so that the luminance-reduction of regional area 610, until the display brightness level as shown in second step 604
It is lowered to minimum.It is further discussed as will be referred to Fig. 7, it is bright in high-high brightness associated with plateau level and minimum
Conversion between degree level can occur within the time of specified quantitative.This operation that luminance level is reduced may be considered that by
The arrow 616 of link first step 602 and second step 604 represents.
When as represented by second step 604 when reaching minimum brightness level, regional area 610 (and be to include therebetween
Image section) be still shown (controlled because touch-screen display is still opened according to such as sensor hub 223
Middle model operation).Reach second step 604 however, once handling, then (that is, the figure included therebetween of regional area 610
As part) it is no longer visible for user, because the luminance level that regional area is being shown is minimum level.Even so,
In the point, the touch-sensing performance of touch-screen display 105, specifically, on click field (for example, icon 404 and 406)
Touch-screen touch-sensing property retention activity.I.e., in general, the touch-screen display 105 during operating is being breathed
Touch-sensing performance is always maintained at activity, and during this period, the luminance level of the regional area 610 on touch-screen display is in
(for example, between the first and second steps 602 and 604 represented by 616 from anywhere between maximum, minimum or both
Conversion time during).
It is contrasted with second step 604, in third step 606, touch-screen display 105 completely closes, and
In the image that the point is shown not only complete blank (for example, such as blank image 400 of Fig. 4 A), but also touch-screen display 105
Touchscreen senses performance completely close.It is represented, indicated by arrow 608 from second step 604 to the conversion of third step 606
Reaching by the complete blank represented by second step 604 but technology still after opening, touch-screen display and its
Performance is touched to be closed completely.It can be according to reality in the time quantum that the holding of 606 touch-screen display 105 of third step completely closes
It applies example or situation and changes.During the entire period, electronic equipment 100 continues to operate with breathing pattern, even if touching screen display
Show that device 105 is blank and is touched for user without response.
Finally, completed with the 606 corresponding shut-in time of third step, and touch-screen display 105 and its touch property
It can be turned on again, as the result for causing the conversion represented by the arrow 620 of four steps 608.That is, once this turn is completed
Change, which reaches four steps 608, in the step, breathes view image, specifically, First partial region 610 (that is, its
In the image section that includes) in a manner of identical with the situation in second step 604, shown again with minimum brightness.Therefore,
Again in this example, it is blank in the touch-screen display 105 of the step, but in the touch-screen display of regional area 610
105 touch performance is activity.After four steps 608, which returns to first step 602, in the step 602, breathing
View image 402 and specifically, regional area 610 (that is, the image section included wherein) is shown with maximum intensity.From
Four steps 608 to the touch-screen display that touch-screen display 105 is in minimum brightness level is in high-high brightness level
The conversion of first step 602 is represented by linking the arrow 622 of those steps.Once reach step 602, touch-screen display
105 be maintained at high-high brightness level, breathing plateau, continue with step 602 relatively morning be performed identical other time quantum or
Person's different time amount, is specifically dependent upon the embodiment or operational circumstances.
It is it should also be understood that opposite in step 602,604,606 and 608 with being operated under breathing pattern as shown in Figure 6
The exact way of generation is converted between the different luminance levels answered, can be changed according to embodiment or situation.With reference to figure 7, tool
For body, timing curve 700 is shown is related to display image portion point with regard to touch-screen display, specifically, on touch screen display
Show that device is configured to receive (one or more) regional area (for example, regional area 610) touched, touch-screen display 105
Unlatching/closed state and luminance level how an example of time to time change.Touch-screen display has been shown in particular in Fig. 7
How 105 luminance level changes between minimum brightness level 702 and high-high brightness level 704 at any time.More specifically such as
Shown in figure, in this example, the brightness increase between minimum brightness level 702 and high-high brightness level 704 is happened at Fig. 6's
Between step 608 and 602 (as shown in arrow 622), it is shown in Figure 7 between time 706 and time 708, with linear portion
The linear mode shown in 709 is divided to occur.However, in alternative embodiments, rising can be according to any linear, logarithm, sine
Curve or other kinds of mode.
Further as shown in fig. 7, once reaching high-high brightness level in the time 708, touch-screen display 105 is operated with most
Big luminance level display breathing view image (e.g., including breathing view image 402 of Fig. 4 B in First partial region 610),
It is the time 710 in this example until later time.The period that period touch-screen display 105 is in most bright level can
To be referred to as " breathing plateau ").In this respect, it should be understood that the time quantum of high-high brightness level is demonstrated, i.e. when
Between 710 and 708 difference can be changed according to embodiment and operational circumstances.For example, in some embodiments, plateau
Time is for by newly notifying and/or other breathings of the respiratory quotient of equipment gesture trigger are longer.That is, in another example, held in step 326
Capable continuously repeats the plateau for breathing and can generally having consistent length, but is related to the arrow according to Fig. 3 in processing 300
333 and step 320 new notice in the case of or some other type of event, for such event, extended plateau
It is appropriate (for example, being discussed below in conjunction with Fig. 9 and 10A-10B), then can has in next breathing performed by step 326
There is the plateau of longer time length.
After time 710, the luminance level of touch-screen display 105 reduces again, until the time 712, in the time,
Reach minimum brightness level, this be between the first (high-high brightness) step 602 and second (minimum brightness) step 604 by scheming
The corresponding operation of conversion represented by 6 arrow 616.The luminance-reduction is shown in Figure 7 for again with 711 institute of linear segment
The linear mode of expression occurs.Nonetheless, reduction in other embodiments can by linear, logarithm, sine or other
Type fashion occurs.Then, after the time 712 corresponding with step 604 reaches minimum brightness level, then, touch-screen
Display 105 closes (that is, the slave second step 604 represented by the arrow 618 of Fig. 6 according to step 606 immediately immediately or almost
Execution to the conversion of third step 606 can immediately or substantially occur immediately).Then, from time 712 to the time 714, touch
It touches panel type display 105 to close, and does not show anything.
It should be understood that the display operation between the time 706 and 712, wherein, breathing view image (for example, Fig. 6
Image 402) become brighter, then, reach plateau, then become dark, be considered the respiratory exercise in electronic equipment
Once " breathing " during work.In addition, it should also be understood that after this breathing touch-screen display 105 close it is definite
Time quantum can change according to embodiment or situation, and can during the operation of electronic equipment 100 time to time change.
For example, in some embodiments, when detecting that electronic equipment activity is considerably less (or once seldom activity), then the shut-in time will
Increase, so that breathing is made to operate " slowing down ".
Finally, it is (minimum bright according to the 3rd (screen closing) step 606 to the four of slave Fig. 6 as representated by arrow 620
Degree) step 608 conversion, Fig. 7 include arrow 716, by the arrow indicate touch-screen display 105 closed state most terminate
Beam and the processing are switched again to the cycle of the increase brightness started again in the time 706, and in the time 706, touch-screen is shown
It opens and horizontal in its minimum brightness.It should be understood that although the arrow 716 of the timing curve 700 of Fig. 7 shows the processing
For time of return 706, but this only should be construed as breath cycle and repeats the instruction continued, and not operate back to behaviour
Make initially to start cut phase really in the same time.I.e. when processing repeats itself, start in the time point for being later than the time 714, Huo Zhe
Time 714 itself starts, this understanding that will represent to convert immediately corresponding to arrow 716.
In view of Fig. 6 and 7, it should be understood that can be with the corresponding breathing operation mode of the step 326 of the processing 300 of Fig. 3
Be related to continuously repeated in interlude length (Xun Huan) step 602,604,606 and 608 (and by arrow 616,618,
Switch between step represented by 620 and 622).According to above, it will be appreciated that, be related to breathing pattern these steps permitted
More details and the whole duty cycle for the pattern, can be according to operational circumstances (for example, the time span of plateau or closing
Cycle) and change, and it should further be appreciated that these details can also change according to operational circumstances (for example, working as electronics
When equipment is not used by, breathing the duty cycle of operation can be contracted by).However, being as will be appreciated, these breathe the whole of steps
Volume property and sequence are as breathing operation continues and keeps identical.
Therefore, during the operation of breathing pattern, as long as most of the time touch-screen is shown as blank, the user experience electricity
Sub- equipment is substantially or largely to seem the equipment " closed ", but in a manner of gradually showing and fade away, it is even
The image section of your the interested project/notice of the possible user of display instruction.Nonetheless, although the breathing operation mode can be with
Indefinitely continue, as having been combined Fig. 3 discusses and be discussed further below, however, in many cases any
Under a kind of situation, electronic equipment 100 can exit breathing pattern, into another operation mode, such as preview view operation mode,
Or middle model is exited to enter fully active pattern or close pattern.
Turning now to Fig. 8 A and 8B, as within the specific limits with reference to discussing Fig. 4 A-4D, 5A-5D and 6, in this implementation
In example, during the operation under the 306 corresponding middle model of region with Fig. 3, the touch-screen display of electronic equipment 100
105 specific part is actuated (except the other parts of touch-screen display) in specific time, to show specific image portion
Divide and/or so as to receive specific touch input.The specific part for the touch-screen display 105 actuateding in this respect can be with
Depending on embodiment or operational circumstances.However, in the present embodiment, with each corresponding all image portions in different images
Divide and be stored in single frame buffer, the single frame buffer determines all figures that can be used for display during middle model operates
As part.
For example, the image section on Fig. 4 A-4D, as already discussed, the display of preview animated graphical overview 410 be related to
Those (such as animation part 412, the different figures of icon 405 and 407 and serial 416) of text shown in preview view 414
As the display (for example, icon 404 and 406 and time showing 408) of part.It is touched however, these different images parts are located at
In the different zones of panel type display 105, and, as a result, all these image sections have been stored as in single frame buffer 800
Whole image, corresponding to the full display screen view as shown in figure A.In this respect, frame buffer 800 can be considered as further
One group of image section/image information, is stored in the memory devices 205 of electronic equipment 100, and under middle model
It is utilized during the operation that touch-screen display is controlled during operation by sensor hub 223, middle model is included respectively with Fig. 3's
Step 326 and 336 corresponding breathing patterns and preview view pattern.It should be noted that the information of storage is in this regard
It can be with time to time change, for example, as new notice occurs (for example, in this case, one or more texts are serial
416 may change).
With further reference to Fig. 8 B, the frame buffer of given all frame buffers 800 as shown in Figure 8 A, it should be understood that touch
It touches panel type display 105 to be controlled, if so that touch-screen display is divided into the difference part that can be independently started
Region then shows and/or can receive touch input, specifically, on the more specific of the image section in frame buffer.
From power saving and reduce display excessively started so that can as viewed from the perspective of vitiable chance, touch-screen display 105
(it can cause such as some pixel line ranges or some pixels over the display for regional area rather than starting of entirely showing
Row scope is started) it is advantageous.
In the example provided by Fig. 8 B, Figure 80 2 has been shown in particular how touch-screen display 105 is divided into five offices
Portion's image-region, five local image regions are each to be overlapped and including coming from frame buffer (such as 800 institute of frame buffer
Show) the specific image section of corresponding complete image.As shown, Fig. 8 B may be begged for not only including having been combined Fig. 6
The First partial region 610 of opinion, and also comprise the second regional area 804, the 3rd regional area 806,808 and of regional area
5th regional area 810, wherein, it is in this example, each including simultaneously in successive regional area 610,804,806 and 808
And preceding office portion region is extended beyond, except the 5th regional area 810, including except by regional area 610,804,806
With 808 included by those outside touch-screen display different piece.
More specifically, as having been combined that Fig. 6 discussed on First partial region 610, which includes and can
To be considered the image section of the breathing view 402 comprising Fig. 4 B, i.e. icon 404 and 406 and time showing 408.Compared to it
Under, the second regional area 804 includes each content being comprised in First partial region 610, and also comprises in Fig. 4 C
The first portion of shown animation frame 412, in this example respectively comprising time showing 408 above and below icon 406
First (most interior) point range of each point range.As further shown, the 3rd regional area 806 is included in the second regional area 804
In included all image sections, and further comprise each point range included in animation feature 412 second (in
Between) point range.In addition as shown in the figure, the 4th regional area 808 includes all image sections included by the 3rd partial zones 806, and
And further comprise the 3rd (or outermost) point range of included each point range in animation feature 412.Therefore, it is pre- in Fig. 4 C
Animated graphical overview 410 of looking at is that wherein touch-screen display is actuateding to show at the 4th regional area 808 and potentially connect
Receive the view of touch input.
For the 5th regional area 810 of Fig. 8 B, as already noted, the regional area (with regional area 610,
804th, 806 and 808 is different) do not include any part of any other regional area, but consist essentially of from the 4th partial zones
All remainders for the touch-screen display 105 that domain 808 excludes.5th regional area 810 as depicted is specifically included in
4th regional area, 808 area above and the part below the 4th regional area 808.Therefore, the 5th regional area 810
Be particularly adapted to include with the 414 corresponding image section of preview view image shown in Fig. 4 D (and Fig. 5 D), it is specific and
Speech is closely located to the icon 405 of the upper end of touch-screen display 105 and text serial 416 and is closely located to the touch-screen
The icon 407 of display bottom.
Fig. 9 is turned next to, other modification process Figure 90 0 is provided, partly by means of the touch screen display of electronic equipment 100
Show a series of other exemplary views of device 105, it is illustrated that electronic equipment 100 turns between breathing and preview view operation mode
Exemplary operations when changing, breathing and preview view operation mode together form the intermediate behaviour included by the intermediate region 306 of Fig. 3
Operation mode and further between 304 corresponding middle model of the region of Fig. 3 and non-respiratory pattern (close pattern)
Conversion.Processing represented by flow chart 900 is shown as so that indicator 902 and 940 is signified by first and second respectively
Any beginning for the two ways shown.
Once start in the first beginning indicator 902, then it is corresponding in the discussion with the step 326 of Fig. 3 and figure 6 above
Step 904, processing start operated under breathing pattern.As shown in figure 9, electronic equipment 100 is operated with breathing pattern, it is specific because
To have received that one or more notices (according to the step 320 of Fig. 3,322 and 324), and have determined that those notices are suitable
Together in proving to show that breathing is appropriate according to reference to the operation under the described breathing patterns of Fig. 6 and 7.Therefore, as one
A example, step 904 include Figure 90 3 of the breathing view image 402 with Fig. 4 B.In addition, Figure 90 3 shows First partial area
Domain 610, because in this example, touch-screen display 105 is operable to only show that First partial region 610 (that is, is wrapped wherein
The image section contained) rather than the regional area 804,806,808 or 810 of Fig. 8 B in any one.It should further be appreciated that
Although the flow chart 900 of Fig. 9, which is related to from breathing pattern, is transformed into preview view pattern, if do not changed, exhale
Inhaling processing will continue, as having been combined that Fig. 6 discussed (until being suitable such as according to another conversion of the slave breathing pattern of Fig. 3
When time).
Except showing breathing view image 402 (and region 610), it is illustrated that Figure 90 3 of the step 904 of Fig. 9 further shows
The finger 512 of the user positioned at the click field (in this case, icon 404) included in the images is gone out, to illustrate
Wherein user response breathing display and the situation of touch input is provided.According to the step 334 of Fig. 3, clicked on during breathing
This touch input provided at field may trigger the conversion from breathing pattern to preview view pattern.That is, according to respiratory exercise
Operation mode, (when the step 606) of such as Fig. 6 breathing view image 402 is not shown, touch-screen display 105 is unripe
The user for receiving the click field on such as icon 404 touches, but can only be received in the presence of view image is breathed tactile
It touches (for example, in the figure 7 between the shown time 706 and 712).In step 904, it is assumed that breathing view image 402 is shown
Show and touch-screen display 105 is being operable to receive the touch of user's finger 512.
User touch point hits field when performance activities are being touched, then the processing of flow chart 900 is proceeded to from step 904
Step 906, as indicated by arrows 905, then, step 906 is followed by the step 908, step 910 and step 912 of fast successive.Step
Rapid 906,908 and 910 specifically indicate that, if user continuously touched with user's finger 512 as depicted click field (for example,
Icon 404), then touch-screen display 105 from be merely displayed in the image section that contains in First partial region 610 be transformed into it is only aobvious
Showing the image section that contains in the second regional area 804, (so as to the most interior point of the row included by animation feature 412, become can
See), then, image section contained in the 3rd regional area 806 is merely displayed in (so as in the row included by animation feature
Between point become visible), then, be shown in the 4th regional area 808 contained all image sections (so that all animations are special
Sign becomes visible).That is, first, second, and third regional area 610,804 and 806 be revoked in succession and respectively by second, the
Three and the 4th regional area 804,806 and 808 substitutes.In some cases, show and cancel this place of local screen's information
Reason can be based on many factors and perform and/or change (including temporal variation), for example, situation, content of announcement, notice are preferential
Grade or equipment state.
Finally, if user continuously across step 906,908 and 910 until the execution of step 912 starts, continue touch point
Field (for example, being the first icon 404 again) is hit, then in step 912, the 5th regional area 810 is shown.In the point, by touching
Image shown by panel type display 105 is switched to the preview view image 414 of Fig. 4 D from the preview animated image 410 of Fig. 4 C, and
And electronic equipment 100 is operated now with the corresponding preview view pattern of step 336 with Fig. 3.It will be appreciated that display is each
Step 906, the ad hoc fashion of 908,910 animation feature 412 are specifically intended to transfer (as visual cues or hint) to user
User can be by the figure that is moved to the finger 512 of user from icon 404, one of 406 shown in preview view image 414
Mark 405, one of 407 further completes the operation of preview view pattern.It should also be understood that although this discussion is expected from step
094 until institute's having time of step 912, and the finger 512 of user keeps continuously touching click field, to reach preview view mould
Formula, but in other embodiments, this touch need not be completely or substantially continuous.
Still referring to FIG. 9, once step 912 and preview view pattern have reached, then when basis is in preview view pattern
How interactive user is with touch-screen display 105, and any one of many Different Results may occur.In the present embodiment, reflect
In the setting in " click field " between preview view image 414 and breathing view image 402 (and preview animated image 410)
The difference of aspect depends on the gesture behavior of user with the interaction of preview view pattern and touch-screen display 105.It is specific and
Speech, in this exemplary embodiment, although when electronic equipment 100 is operated with breathing pattern (for example, in step 904), icon
404th, 406 be considered as tangibly click field, but in step 912, click field changes to include 405 He of icon
It is each in 407, it is now currently located in preview view image 414 towards the upper and lower end of touch-screen display 105.Even if such as
This, in the present embodiment, the manipulation of the user of the finger 512 of the user of the icon 405 and 407 on preview view image 512
Further operation is determined.
More specifically, in the implementation, wherein, the click field of replacement is icon 405 and 407, passes through mobile subscriber
The user gesture of finger 512 generate following results under preview view pattern.First, sub-step 914 and sub-step are such as passed through
Rapid 916 indicated by step 912, if user touched keep specific (" length ") time quantum (for example, step 902 with
Institute's having time between step 912), then, once reaching preview view pattern in step 912, then finger 512 is slided to reach
To icon 407, then, after this action is completed, further finger is removed from touch-screen display, then, processing advances to
Step 918.This causes the wake-up of electronic equipment 100, opens processor 203, and initiates and the corresponding intention (example of icon 407
Such as, the initiation of application).Therefore, icon (or one or more of those icons) 407, electronic equipment 100 are selected by user
Complete awakening mode is advanced to from the preview view pattern in middle model.
Similarly, as sub-step 914 and sub-step 920 further shown in, if user keeps its touch specific
(" length ") time quantum and finally reach corresponding with close to the icon 405 at the top of touch-screen display 105 sliding finger 512
Click field after, discharge its touch, then, perform step 922, in the step 922, electronic equipment 100 is cut from middle model
Complete awakening mode is changed to, and is initiated with the corresponding intention of icon 405.It is pre- accordingly, with respect to step 918 is caused to perform
View mode of looking at operates and causes preview view pattern operation the two that step 922 performs, this, which is started, is related to slip with having tied
Close the 515 corresponding gesture part of arrow that Fig. 5 D are discussed, wherein, the finger 512 of user is steered, so as to from breathing pattern
The corresponding home position in click field (for example, icon 404,406) is moved to preview view pattern and clicks on field (for example, figure
Mark 405,407).
It should be noted that in this exemplary embodiment, in order to step 918 or 922 any one realize the initiation being intended to,
The finger of user from corresponding initial (breathing pattern) the click field of icon 404, one of 406 be moved to icon 405,
When 407 one or more corresponding final (preview view pattern) clicks on field, in the finger 512 of user and touch screen display
It is simultaneously continuous to show that the contact of the touch between device 105 must be kept constant during entire preview operation pattern.In fact, in this implementation
In example, in order to which any one initiation realized in step 918 or 922 is intended to, converted from breathing pattern to preview view pattern
The step 904 of beginning and in step 916 or 920 any one with preview view pattern it is appropriate click on field release when
Institute's having time between time, the finger of user are needed to be in constant with touch-screen display 105 and continuously contacted.However,
This operation is only an exemplary types of the gesture to be included herein, and the disclosure is intended to include the hand that will not cause user
Refer to this non-interrupted, the other kinds of gesture that continuously contacts between 512 and touch-screen display 105.
In addition, at least some embodiments, the intention such as step 918 and 922 the step of is initiated with tactile
Or other kinds of feedback, buzzing/vibration of such as phone, to remind user that the intention has been initiated.In addition, at least one
In a little embodiments, it cannot continue in each step 918 or the initiation of 922 intention, unless (being respectively in corresponding user's release steps
Step 916 or 920) after, at electronic equipment perform unlock operation.This unlock operation, which can be related to from user, to be received into one
Touch input (for example, touching one of image section of preview view screen 414 or another image section) is walked, instruction user wishes
Unlock the equipment so that such as initiating the further action of the intention can occur.It should be understood that although step can be directed to
918 and 920 perform this unlock operation, but are further intended to, and the disclosure includes wherein performing unlock in other times
Or lock step, such as on other the one or more steps for combining the described processing of this paper Fig. 3 to 10B.
In addition to aforesaid operations mode, in addition as with reference to shown in step 912, if the finger 512 of user is not moved
Move one of the click field of preview view image 414 as discussed above (or being released from), but it is one or more its
He occurs event, then other several results may occur rather than initiate to be intended in step 918 and 922.First, such as sub-step 928
It is indicated, in some cases, even if after preview view pattern has reached (for example, because the finger 512 of user
Through from step 904 until step 912 keeps suitably contacting), electronic equipment 100 can be forced to wake up because of certain reason, for example, by
In being pressed as explained above with the power knob that step 330 is discussed, (it can prolong that in some cases, this power knob, which is pressed,
Long presses, and such as 5 seconds buttons are pressed, and can reset new counter etc.).If this occurs, the processing is from pre-
The sub-step 928 of view mode of looking at again proceeds to complete awakening mode as depicted in sub-step 930, in the step,
Electronic equipment 100 is waken up and breathing pattern operation stops.
In addition, in addition in some cases, even if (in another example because user after preview view pattern has reached
Contact is kept to reach such as the special time amount indicated by sub-step 914, since step 904 until step 912), the hand of user
Refer to 512 can be in preview view image 414 not be corresponded to one of click field position, leave touch-screen display 105
(that is, in the position for any one for not corresponding to icon 405,407).Discharge the position of touch in this way according to user
It puts, then sub-step 914 proceeds to sub-step 924 or sub-step 926, as shown in the figure.More specifically, if user with sub-step
Rapid 926 corresponding position release touches, then the processing returns to breathing pattern, is such as returned from step 912 (and sub-step 926)
It returns to shown in the arrow 927 of step 904.
In addition, as shown in sub-step 924, if position of the user not on click field discharges the touch, the processing
It is also possible to proceed to step 932, and in the step 932, breathing pattern (and preview view pattern) operation is stopped, and
The most images shown on touch-screen display associated with breathing pattern/preview view pattern fade out (for example, pre-
View image 414 of looking at is faded out).Once step 932 is performed, then the processing is advanced further to step 934, in the step 934,
The size of regional area 610 is reduced, to exclude content of announcement (in fact, regional area 610 is by less than regional area 610
Different regional areas substituted, do not show in the fig. 8b).
In addition, the processing subsequently advances to step 936, in the step 936, user can start new breathing, as setting
The result of standby gesture 936.Finally, once this gesture is received in step 936, then the processing proceeds to step 938, in the step
Rapid 938, electronic equipment 100 enters other special pattern, can be referred to as only clock module.As shown in the figure, in only clock
Under pattern, gesture starts preview view image 939 to be displayed on touch-screen display 105.In this view, screen display is touched
Show that device 105 only shows that it (is already mentioned above) with it is particularly applicable to only aobvious in the regional area 940 further reduced on step 934
Show the size of time showing 408.This operation can also be considered as " privacy mode ", because compared in such as breathing view figure
As 402 and preview view image 414 other images in shown in, less information/equipment is shown.Furthermore, it should be noted that
It is, once electronic equipment locks, with regard to this operation can be reached, once and electronic equipment unlock, it can only browse on one
Content/information of notice in a little this embodiments.
Although not shown in FIG. 9, it will be appreciated that, when only clock module corresponding with step 938 is reached,
Then electronic equipment 100 can return at least one in such as complete awakening mode, middle model or close pattern in various ways
It is a.For example, if such as shown power knob presses generation in a step 330, in one embodiment, can reach
Full awakening mode.In addition, from Fig. 9 it should be further noted that, in the present embodiment, electronic equipment 100 can directly from
Close pattern rather than reach only clock module from middle model.More specifically as shown in the figure, once as started 940 institute of indicator
To show and start to operate in close pattern, then the processing may begin at step 942, and in the step 942, electronic equipment 100 does not breathe,
And display screen is to close, because not needing the known notice breathed.Despite such case, but as begged for above
Opinion, in the case where user starts new breathing as the result of equipment gesture, which can be further before step 942
Proceed to step 936.When this happens, as already discussed, which reaches the only clock module of step 938 again.
Turning now to Figure 10 A and 10B, it is further provided flow chart 1000 and 1050, it illustrates can be by Fig. 1 and 2's
The other example subprocessing that electronic equipment 100 performs, may be considered that usually by the example represented by the flow chart 300 of Fig. 3
Included by processing.The flow chart 1000 of Figure 10 A shows exemplary other operating procedure, wherein, electronic equipment 100 with Fig. 3
The corresponding breathing pattern of step 326 and Fig. 3 304 corresponding close pattern of region between convert.The flow chart of Figure 10
1050 further illustrate exemplary other operating procedure, wherein, the respiratory exercise of the electronic equipment 100 under breathing pattern responds
Change and further operating procedure in the gesture that electronic equipment is sensed, wherein, even if when electronic equipment 100 in addition
During in close pattern, specific breathing can be triggered by gesture and operated.
More specifically, the subprocessing represented by the flow chart 1000 of Figure 10 A starts from step 1004, the symbol by
Shown in 1002, in the step, electronic equipment 100 is operated with breathing pattern, because in the presence of one or more that is suitable for being breathed
A notice.Then, as indicated by step 1006, in some point, electronic equipment 100 can be placed in the position of face down by user
It puts.By one or more of its sensor 228, electronic equipment 100 can detect this positioning, and if electronics is set
Standby to determine that it is in the position of face down according to step 1006, then the processing advances to step from step 1004 via step 1006
Rapid 1008, in the step 1008, breathing is stopped, and is shown at all without any incoming notice by breathing pattern processing
Show.
Further as shown in the figure, even if electronic equipment 100 is not in the mode of the face down as determined by step 1006,
Then electronic equipment 100 may further determine that electronic equipment " has been shelved " predetermined time amount (for example, X seconds), such as step
Represented by 1010.According to this embodiment, when electronic equipment 100 " is shelved ", can depend on a variety of possible environment or behaviour
Make situation, and a variety of input signals that can be provided according to sensor 228 determine, it may for example comprise at instruction electronic equipment
Sensor input signal in such as confined area of user's pocket, user's wallet or desk drawer.If in step 1010
Determine that electronic equipment 100 has lain on the table predetermined time amount, then the processing again proceeds to step 1008, in the step
1008, breathing operation is stopped.Alternatively, if determining that equipment not yet lies on the table predetermined time amount in step 1010, at this
Return to step 1004 is managed, in the step 1004, breathing operation continues.
Once in addition as shown in the figure, the processing reaches the step 1008 in Figure 10 A, then electronic equipment 100 is with close pattern
Operation, during this period, user is transmitted to without any kind of notification message.That is, as shown in step 1012, when breathing is stopped
When lower, during the close pattern, even if new notice reaches, the reception of this new notice will not both cause to show any notice
Message will not cause breathing operation to start again at.On the contrary, even if when these new notification messages reach, which still returns
Step 1008 is returned, in the step 1008, breathing operation is stopped.
When step 1008 breathing operation stopped when, although breathing operation will not when receiving any new notice,
But if causing to breathe one that operates the condition stopped or other no longer being set up, then breathing operation can start again at.I.e., such as
As represented by step 1014, electronic equipment 100 continues to determine the electronic equipment when the close pattern in step 1008 fruit
Close pattern in face down, then electronic equipment holding step 1008.However, if electronic equipment is no longer just facing
Under, as determined by step 1014, then the processing advances to step 1016, in the step 1016, further determines that electronics is set
Whether the standby predetermined threshold (in another example X seconds) that lain on the table is true.The scheduled time threshold value if equipment has lain on the table
Still set up, then the processing continues to keep the close pattern of step 1008.If however, determine electronic equipment in step 1016
Through no longer lie on the table predetermined time threshold when, then the processing advances to 1018 from step 1016, in the step 1018, respiratory exercise
It is restarted, then, this processing returns to step 1004.
As indicated by step 1018, the breathing of the junction point restart can a kind of particular form be performed, at this
In mode, exist for the first breathing, the initial platform phase is extended (there are the extension periods of maximum intensity), afterwards, continues
Eupnea operates.It should be understood that it is wherein included into and examines on face-up/face down of breathing operation and the condition of shelving
The subprocessing of Figure 10 A of worry is especially advantageous, because when equipment lies on the table or during face down, by ceasing breathing, can subtract
Few chance that mobile phone (for example, mistake) is triggered due to carelessness.Although not shown in Figure 10 A, it will be appreciated that, other conditions
Breathing operation can also be triggered to be stopped.For example, at least some embodiments, electronic equipment 100 is it is contemplated that current time
Whether with the corresponding scope of evening hours/dormancy in (for example, 11PM-6AM), and if so, when the beginning of the scope
Stop breathing operation, and the automatic opening return breathing operation mode at the end of the scope is reached automatically during generation.It is this
Operation can be referred to as " sleep mode " operation.
The subprocessing shown in other flow chart 1050 for Figure 10, as shown in the figure, such as 1052 institute of indicator by
It representing, subprocessing may begin at step 1054 or step 1056, wherein, step 1054 constitutes occurent breathing mould
Electronic equipment 100 under formula is being operated, because there is notice to be breathed, and wherein, step 1056, which constitutes, to be in
The operation of the electronic equipment of close pattern, during this period, the equipment no breathing, because not needing the notice breathed.Especially
On step 1054, it should be understood that the step with or may be considered that identical with the step 1004 shown in Figure 10 A.I.e.
Just in this way, although it is not shown, the it is thus appreciated that specific processing step energy occurred in starting from Figure 10 B of step 1054
It is enough equally to continue (and the specific processing step of Figure 10 A continue from step 1054) from the step 1004 of Figure 10 A.
Figure 10 B are further related to, no matter whether subprocessing starts from step 1054 or 1056, is closed based on electronic equipment 100
In any movement (for example, by sensor 228) that the electronic equipment whether is had been detected by predetermined time amount determine,
The subprocessing can be since any one of these steps.If as indicated by the step 1058 after step 1054, electronics
Equipment 100 determines that within the predetermined amount time (for example, X seconds past) has had movement to be detected, and then, which continues
It is maintained at breathing pattern and continues to be circulated back to step 1054 from step 1058.Equally, if step after step 1056
Rapid 1060, electronic equipment 100 determines that in predetermined time amount (for example, X seconds past in) has been detected by movement, then at this
Reason returns and continuously loops back to step 1056, and the close pattern that breathing is kept not occur.
Alternatively, if do not had in step 1058 or 1060 any one definite electronic equipment 100 mobile up to specific
Time quantum, the then processing advance to step 1062 from step 1058 respectively on the contrary or advance to step 1064 from step 1060.
In step 1062 and 1064 each, the mobile gesture of the preparation reception of electronic equipment 100, i.e. mobile gesture is now ready for.To the greatest extent
Pipe is ready in step 1062 and 1064, but after these steps, electronic equipment 100 keeps the similary shape on breathing operation
State.That is, as shown in the figure, the processing advances to step 1066 from step 106, in the step 1066, ongoing breathing operation
Continue, and wherein, electronic equipment 100 waits other movement (mobile gesture).Equally, once step 1064 is performed, then
The step is followed by step 1068, and in the step 1068, respiratory exercise remains turned-off, and electronic equipment waits other shifting
It is dynamic.
Respectively after step 1066 and 1068, respectively as shown in step 1070 and step 1072, for example, by means of by passing
Sensor 228 (for example, accelerometer or GPS device) performs sensing, and then, whether electronic equipment 100 determine any movement now
Through reaching new scheduled time threshold value (Length Quantity) (for example, Y seconds).In the present embodiment, electronic equipment 100 is configured to
Think that any movement detected meets step 1070,1072 (touch even, for example, only or small movement), although at it
In his embodiment, electronic equipment 100 is configured to, the mobile detection of only specific type, scope or amplitude will meet step 1070,
One or both in 1072.In addition, although new scheduled time threshold value is shown as in step 1070,1072 and step
1058 and 1060 difference, but this is not necessarily such case.In fact, any and all time threshold described herein
It can be changed according to embodiment or situation.
Nonetheless, in the case of step 1070, if not detecting movement in new scheduled time threshold value,
This processing returns to step 1066, and in the step 1066, the breathing operation just carried out continues and electronic equipment continues waiting for moving,
And if in step 1702, movement is not detected in new predetermined threshold, then the step return to step 1068, in the step
Rapid 1068, respiratory exercise is made to keep stopping, and electronic equipment continues waiting for moving.
Alternatively, if in step 1070, movement is detected in new scheduled time threshold value, then it in this case, should
Processing proceeds to 1074 from step 1072, and in the step 1074, breathing operation continues, but is extended with existing for the first breathing
The mode of plateau be restarted.That is, show the period of the breathing plateau of the first breathing compared with normal with maximum intensity
Plateau length is extended.After step 1704 is performed, then this processing returns to step 1054, and breathe operation normally after
It is continuous.In addition, if in step 1072, movement is detected in new predetermined threshold, then the processing advances to step from step 1072
Rapid 1076, in the step 1076, electronic equipment 100 causes touch-screen display 105 to show single exhale within extended plateau
It inhales, then, after the display of single breathing, then electronic equipment return to step 1056, in the step 1056, breathes operation and is stopped
Only.
Finally, also as shown in Figure 10 B, it is noted that the stream of ongoing breathing operation and breathless operation
The part of the subprocessing of journey Figure 105 0 is linked, because in each case a, if new notice reaches, breathing can be weighed
It opens.For this respect, more particularly, in step 1054 when equipment is in breathing pattern, once new notice reaches, then such as
Shown in step 1078, which advances to step 1074, and in the step 1074, breathing is restarted, but has for the first breathing
There is extended plateau, hereafter, this processing returns to step 1054.Equally, as shown in step 1056, when equipment does not breathe, one
The new notice of denier reaches, then as shown in step 1080, which also advances to step 1074, in the step 1074, breathes and is weighed
It opens and (there is extended plateau for the first breathing), hereafter, which also advances to step 1054, in the step 1054, exhales
It inhales and continues.
