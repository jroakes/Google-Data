- the data may comprise any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, references to data stored in other areas of the same memory or different memories (including other network locations) or information that is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.
- the processor 120 may be any well-known processor, such as processors from Intel Corporation or AMD. Alternatively, the processor may be a dedicated controller such as an ASIC. Although FIG. 1 functionally illustrates the processor and memory as being within the same block, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the processor and memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. Accordingly, references to a processor or computer will be understood to include references to a collection of processors or computers or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- the computer 110 may be at one node of a network 195 and capable of directly and indirectly communicating with other nodes of the network.
- computer 110 may comprise a web server that is capable of communicating with client devices 170 - 72 via network 195 such that server 110 uses network 195 to transmit and display information to user 190 on display 160 of client device 170 .
- Server 110 may also comprise a plurality of computers that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting data to the client devices; in this instance, the client devices will typically still be at different nodes of the network than any of the computers comprising server 110 .

- cellular and wireless networks e.g., WiFi
- instant messaging HTTP and SMTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- FIGS. 1-2 Although only a few computers are depicted in FIGS. 1-2 , it should be appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected computers.
- Each client device may be configured similarly to the server 110 , with a processor, memory and instructions.
- Each client device 170 - 72 may be a personal computer intended for use by a person 190 - 191 , and have all of the components normally used in connection with a personal computer such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory (e.g., RAM and internal hard drives) storing data and instructions, an electronic display 160 (e.g., a monitor having a screen, a small LCD touch-screen, a projector, a television, or any other electrical device that is operable to display information), user input 162 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen or microphone), camera 163 , speakers, a network interface device, and all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another.
- CPU central processing unit
- memory e.g., RAM and internal hard drives
- an electronic display 160 e.g., a monitor having a screen, a small LCD touch-screen, a projector, a television, or any
- client devices 170 - 72 may comprise a full-sized personal computer
- the system and method may also be used in connection with mobile devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the Internet.
- client device 171 may be a wireless-enabled PDA or a cellular phone capable of obtaining information via the Internet.
- the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a Blackberry phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cell phone) or a touch screen (in the case of a PDA).
- computers in accordance with the systems and methods described herein may comprise any device capable of processing instructions and transmitting data to and from humans and other computers including general purpose computers, network computers lacking local storage capability, and set-top boxes for televisions.
- information may be sent via a medium such as an optical disk or portable drive.
- the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- some functions are indicated as taking place on a server and others on a client, various aspects of the system and method may be implemented by a single computer having a single processor.
- the memory may further include entity data 310 identifying entities associated with particular geographic locations, such as geographic regions (e.g., countries, states, provinces, cities, etc.).
- entity data 310 may represent a set 300 of states of the United States of America.
- Each object may be associated with additional information such as a unique identifier 321 , an image 322 , a name 323 , a geographic location 324 and a population 325 . (Images associated with actual geographic regions described herein may not be to scale and other information associated therewith may be approximate.)
- Geographic entities may include other geographically-located objects in addition to regions, such as points of interest (POI), landmarks, roads, bodies of land or water, items located in a store, items that can be moved to different locations, etc. Therefore, while many of the examples below refer to geographic regions, most aspects of the system and method are not limited to any particular type of geographic entity.
- POI points of interest
- the system is also not limited to any particular data structure.
- the data may be stored in a table such as a database table.
- the entity data may be stored as part of an XML file such as “ ⁇ entity> ⁇ id> CA ⁇ /id> ⁇ image> california.gif ⁇ /image> ⁇ name> California ⁇ /name> ⁇ loc>41° 59′ 42.35′′ N, 124° 16′ 38.58 W ⁇ /loc> ⁇ population> 36450000 ⁇ /population> ⁇ /entity>”.
- the entity may be defined by computer code such as JavaScript that is provided as the HTML code of a webpage, such as the following portion of a JavaScript program:
- FIG. 4 functionally illustrates a relationship 420 that identifies the states that border another state.
- the data 420 may identify a subject region 430 (such as California) and the geographic regions that physically touch its borders. Other examples of relationships are described below.
- the system is not limited to any particular data structure for storing relationships.
- the data functionally shown in FIG. 4 may be stored as two tables in a one-to-many relationship in a database, where the relationship is joined at the unique IDs of the entities.
- the relationship may also be stored as part of an XML file such as “ ⁇ Relationship> ⁇ Name> Neighboring States ⁇ /Name> ⁇ Subject Entity> CA ⁇ Related Entity> AZ ⁇ /Related Entity> ⁇ Related Entity> OR ⁇ /Related Entity> ⁇ Related Entity> NV ⁇ /Related Entity> ⁇ /Subject Entity> . . . ⁇ /Relationship>”.
- the data 135 may also identity actions 150 to be taken in connection with the relationships.
- the action data may include a combination of instructions that are provided to the user (e.g., JavaScript embedded in an HTML page that is sent to the user) and instructions on the server (e.g., the Google Chart API made available by Google, Inc.).
- sample values, types and configurations of data shown in the figures are for the purposes of illustration only.
- system and methods in accordance with the present invention may include different data values, types and configurations, and may be provided and received at different times (e.g., via different web pages) and by different entities (e.g., some values may be pre-suggested or provided from different sources).
- FIG. 5 illustrates information that server 110 may display on client device 170 via network 195 .
- the server may provide the client device with a web page 510 to be displayed via a browser 505 where the webpage 510 includes the images of the entities arranged in a map 520 .
- the device also displays a list of relationships from which the user may select one.
- webpage 510 may display a list 520 of different relationships.
- FIG. 5 further illustrates the selection of the first option, “Neighboring States”, which corresponds with the relationship 420 shown in FIG. 4 .
- the user may also select an entity in which they are interested. For instance and as shown in FIG. 6 , the user may maneuver the mouse cursor 680 to click the entity image 620 of the state of California. In response, the visual appearance of the selected image may change.
- the background pattern of the selected entity may change from a solid color to diagonal lines.
- Other visual indicia of selection may also be used to highlight the selected entity, such as changing one of the color's of the object, the thickness of lines, or drawing a box or other shape around the object.
- the entity may be selected in other ways as well, such as by using the arrow keys of a keyboard to toggle through all entities or using a touch-screen to touch the visual representation of the entity.
- the system may determine the entities related to the selected entities based on the relationship information, such as by querying relationship data 410 .
- relationship information such as by querying relationship data 410 .
- borders relationship data 420 identifies three entities (e.g., Arizona, Oregon and Nevada) as being related to California. If there was no relationship data for California, the system may ignore the request for related entities or inform the user that there are no related entities.
- the system may change the visual appearance of the related entities.
- the processor of the client device may change the appearance of the images 710 of the related entities (e.g., Arizona, Oregon and Nevada), such as from solid white to a stippled background.
- the processor may implement the change by modifying the fill color, fill pattern or line thickness of the entity images if the images are stored in memory as vector based graphics.
- the system may have used border relationship data 420 to determine the states bordering Nevada and change the visual appearance of the bordering states accordingly (e.g., OR, ID, UT, ZA and CA).
- the system may allow a user to view a different relationship for the same set of entities. For example, some relationships may reflect the relative size of a feature of the entity, such as the size of the geographic area it occupies. In that regard and as shown in FIG. 9 , the user may use mouse cursor 680 to select relationship 920 , which is based on the population of the geographic entities. A portion of sample data illustrating this particular relationship is functionally shown in FIG. 10 .
- the data may be stored as a linked list where each entity is related to one other entity, i.e., one state is related to the next state when the states are ranked in ascending order of population size.
- Nevada is the next largest state in terms of population after New Mexico
- Utah is the next largest state after New Mexico.
- the data may be stored in accordance with a number of different data structures. For example, it may be stored as a lookup table, or as part of an XML file such as “ ⁇ Relationship> ⁇ Name> Next Largest By Population ⁇ /Name> ⁇ Subject Entity> NM ⁇ Related Entity> NV ⁇ /Related Entity> ⁇ /Subject Entity> . . . ⁇ /Relationship>”.
- the system may determine the relationship from the population values such as by sorting the entities by population.
- the visual aspects of another entity 1130 may change in accordance with the relationship 920 .
- the relationship may be one-way. Based on the nature of the relationship, Nevada may be related to New Mexico (because it is the next largest in terms of population) but New Mexico may not be related to Nevada (because the relationship identifies the next-largest entity, not the next smallest). Accordingly, when the image 1130 of the Nevada entity is selected by the user, the system may change the appearance of the image 1240 of Utah.
- the system permits the user to select from among multiple relationships, where each relationship links a variety of geographic entities with other geographic entities based on the same linking criteria (e.g., the size of a feature, bordering regions, etc.).
- One of the advantages of the invention is its ability to accommodate a wide variety of alternatives and additions to the foregoing features.
- the system may permit other actions beyond changing the static visual appearance of an entity image.
- a user may have used a text box 1320 to search for a desired location, with the resulting map 1310 displayed in a panel of a webpage.
- the map may identify the requested location with a crosshair 1340 or the like.
- the selectable relationships may be provided in the form of clickable buttons 1340 - 41 .
- the visual appearance of the related entity may be change based on animation.
- the related entity e.g., Nevada
- the position of the related geographic region may thus change relative to the display screen.
- the system also provides an alternative method of traversing a map than panning a map by dragging it with a mouse or using the arrow keys on a keyboard. Rather, clicking on one entity on the map may cause the map to jump or automatically scroll to another entity on the map.
- the action may also be conditional.
- the user clicked one entity (CA), which caused three related entities (OR, NV, AZ) to change appearance.
- CA related entities
- the appearance of the selected entity was changed to reflect the selection pattern (diagonal lines) and the appearance of the related states was changed to reflect the related pattern (stippling).
- NV related states
- CA originally-selected state
- FIG. 15 illustrates an alternative to FIG. 8 ; the appearance of the entity depends on other information beyond its relationship to the selected entity.
- the action may indicate that the visual appearance of the entity should not change if it is different than a default appearance.
- Nevada NV
- the action may also indicate that when the visual appearance of an entity should change from the default, then its new appearance should be different from any other entity that is already indicating it was selected or related (e.g., cross-hatch).
- the action may define an appearance for a related entity that depends on both the relationship and other information.
- the system may also accommodate a wide variety of relationships in addition to those described above.
- other relationships may include roads (e.g., linking San Francisco to Los Angeles because they are connected by a highway) and the order of events occurring at one geographic entity relative to another geographic entity (e.g., Beijing may be linked to Athens because the Olympics were held in Beijing after Athens).
- the system may also change the appearance of the entity based on indirect relationships.
- the webpage may provide the user with the option 1620 of indicating how many levels of indirect relationships will be shown when an entity is selected.
- one entity e.g., CA
- all of the entities to which it is directly related may change appearance (e.g., OR, NV and AZ are densely stippled).
- the system may then recursively determine whether any of the related entities have their own related entities and change the appearance of these as well (e.g., WA, ID, UT, CO and NM receive stippling of medium density).
- a user-defined limit e.g., the number set forth in textbox 1620
- other defined limit e.g., the appearance of all entities have changed
- appearances of the individual entities illustrate at a glance how closely one entity is related to the selected entity (e.g., the density of the stippling of FIG. 16 is proportional to the distance of one entity to another in view of the relationship).
- a user could answer questions such as “what are the fewest number of states I would need to cross to walk from California to Montana?”, “which land-connected countries are farthest removed from each other?”, or “out of all possible pairs of countries in Africa, how many pairs share a border?”).
- FIG. 17 illustrates entity data 1750 and relationship data 1760 that defines an entity's membership within a larger entity.
- entity data 1750 may be contained in but not occupy the entire area of another region such as a county 1751 - 52 within a larger state, or a city 1753 contained within a county 1751 .
- the relationship data 1760 may also define whether one entity (e.g., the “parent”) may be considered to contain another entity (e.g., the “child”).
- a user may select a particular city 1711 and request to see the region in which it is contained.
- the system may change the appearance of the city's county 1712 as shown on map 1702 .
- the user may issue a similar request for the parent of newly-highlighted county 1712 , in which case the system may query the relationship data 1760 , and retrieve and display the county's state as shown in map 1703 .
- the appearance of the county 1713 may reflect its relationship as both a parent (horizontal lines) and child (vertical lines) of another geographic entity.
- some aspects of the system allow users to dynamically interact with the individual regions of a map beyond panning, zooming and memorizing. This may be particularly appealing and helpful to children.
- the system permits users to exchange entity data, relationship data and action data.
- user 1812 may provide a set of entities 1820 (e.g., states) to user 1811 .
- the entity data 1820 may comprise an XML file of entities that was emailed from user 1812 to user 1811 from one node of the network to another.
- User 1811 may create and transmit relationship data 1831 (e.g., neighboring states) for the same entities to user 1812 .
- User 1811 may also modify and transmit the entities 1820 as a new set of entities 1821 , or simply transmit the entities unmodified, to user 1813 .
- User 1811 may also transmit a different relationship 1832 (e.g., next largest state) and data defining actions (e.g., an XML file defining colors to use or a computer code module) to a third user 1813 .
- the user 1813 may return a different set of actions 1842 (e.g., an XML file identifying animation instead of colors) to user 1811 based on the same entities 1821 and relationship 1832 received from user 1811 .
- the information may be exchanged in connection with a service maintained by server 110 .
- users 1811 - 13 may each have accounts with the operator of server 110 and access these accounts using a browser from client devices 170 - 72 via different nodes of the network.
- the users may also grant one another permission to use the various entities, relationships and actions they have created (e.g., as a layer to the services offered via Google Maps or Google Earth).
- Some or all of this information may rely on API made available by the server, such as Google Chart API.
- some aspects of the system provide users with the ability to collaborate on new sets of entities, relationships and actions individually and collectively. By allowing the users to mix, match and customize various configurations of the three elements, the system permits a nearly endless variety of permutations.
- functions described above as being performed by the server may be performed by the client device, and vice versa.
- many of the foregoing functions may be performed by a client device that stores the entity, relationship and action data in its internal memory along with instructions for processing the data.
- a server may perform many of the processing functions and simply provide the user with a webpage containing hyperlinks, e.g., the client device may receive a map with hyperlinked names of countries, and clicking on a hyperlinked country causes the server to calculate the related country and send a new webpage that highlights the related country.
- the client device and server perform and share different functions.
- the server may provide data identifying the desired action by sending information that identifies one characteristic to be displayed differently (e.g., sending a background color to use when an entity is identified as being related) or an entire new image of the related entity (e.g., sending an entire new webpage containing a highlighted version of the related entity).
- the server may provide all of the entity data, relationship data and action data as JavaScript in an HTML webpage delivered to the client device.
