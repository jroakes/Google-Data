Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to techniques for analyzing data. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods for assigning ranks to data items in a collection of data items, such as a database of documents, the world wide web, or any other collection of data items which can be compared by a person.
- a collection of data items such as a database of documents, the world wide web, or any other collection of data items which can be compared by a person.
- Pairwise comparisons and preference orderings provide a better candidate for aggregation, but still present some difficulties: users differ in opinion (some prefer item A while others prefer item B); users are inconsistent (a user might prefer A to B, and B to C, while preferring C to A); and user preferences are relatively difficult and expensive to obtain, which limits the set of data points from which to derive the ranking.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that produces a preference ranking for a set of items based on preferences expressed by users.
- the system collects preferences from users between pairs of items in the set of items to be ranked.
- the system uses the collected preferences to compute an adjacency matrix for the set of items, wherein each element in the adjacency matrix represents preferences between a corresponding pair of items associated with the element.
- the system uses the adjacency matrix to compute the preference ranking for the set of items.
- collecting the preferences from the users involves randomly selecting pairs of items from the set of items to compare, and then collecting preferences from the users for the selected pairs of items.
- items can be selected in other ways.
- one embodiment of the present invention uses a progressive-refinement technique, which selects items more evenly across the items to be ranked.
- a preference of a user between a first item and a second item can specify that the user: (1) prefers the first item over the second item; (2) prefers the second item over the first item; or (3) has no preference between the first item and the second item.
- using the adjacency matrix to compute the preference ranking for the set of items involves computing a dominant eigenvector for the adjacency matrix.
- computing the dominant eigenvector involves using an iterative process to compute the dominant eigenvector, wherein the iterative process uses a damping factor.
- the system uses the computed preference ranking to evaluate search results which comprise items from the set of items.
- evaluating the search results involves: evaluating a single search result; or evaluating a page containing an ordered list of search results to be presented to a user.
- the system uses the computed preference ranking to produce a ranking for a set of search results, and then presents the ranking to a user.
- receiving the set of items involves receiving a set of search results from a search engine.
- the set of items can include, but is not limited to: web pages, documents, images, products, advertisements, video clips, or audio clips.
- preference ranking technique has advantages over standard sorting algorithms, (such as binary insertion sort or mergesort), which can also be used to produce a sorted order from pairwise comparisons.
- standard sorting algorithms such as binary insertion sort or mergesort
- a major difference is that conventional sorting algorithms are much more sensitive to noise (they have unbounded error) and only produce an ordering, rather than a ranking. That is, preference rank outputs floating-point numbers which may not be evenly spaced, whereas sorting techniques output ordinals, and the additional precision inherent in the floating-point numbers helps to distinguish quality more effectively.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the searching and ranking process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 illustrates exemplary pages with user preferences in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 graphically illustrates the process of generating a preference ranking in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of generating a preference ranking in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a computer-readable storage device which may be any device that can store code and/or data for use by a computer system. This includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), or any device capable of storing data usable by a computer system.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that measures the quality of search results based on a series of pairwise comparisons between search results by users. More specifically, the system starts with a set of items (e.g., search results), and randomly selects pairs of items to compare. Next, for each selected pair of items, the system asks users which item they prefer. Note that the more pairs the system asks users to compare, the more accurate the resulting ranking will be.
- a set of items e.g., search results
- pairwise comparisons can be applied to arbitrary items, such as news articles, advertisements, images and search results. Moreover, such comparisons can be used to compare quality between different types of items, for example comparing news articles against images. Hence, when computing metrics using this pairwise comparison information, we can consider results of all types and can filter the results as desired. This allows the system to evaluate all types of results inclusively.
- One embodiment of the present invention uses a Markov process to generate a preference ranking.
- This Markov process is similar to the Markov process used in PageRank technique described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, entitled “Method for Node Ranking in a Linked Database,” and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,799,176, entitled “Method for Scoring Documents in a Linked Database” both by inventor Lawrence Page. (Both of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference to disclose the details of this PageRank technique.)
- the PageRank technique assigns a value to a page based on the number of links to that page, the number of links to those pages, and so on recursively.
- the present invention replaces these “links” with “user preferences.” For example, a “vote” for page A by page B is created if a user says page A is better than page B. Intuitively, better pages will obtain more votes, and will thus attain a higher rank.
- one embodiment of the present invention takes as input an adjacency matrix A, for which each element a ij defines a user preference between the page p i and the page p j .
- each array element a ij is defined as the number of links from page p i to p j divided by the total number of outgoing links from p i .
- the value of a ij is zero when the relative merit of p i to p j is unknown. This is advantageous because it allows the system to extrapolate relative merit based on related comparisons, and because a non-zero value would introduce noise into the graph, and would consequently dilute the available information. Moreover, the value from p i to p j should ideally never be greater than 1/n because each pair-wise comparison should have equal weighting.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the searching and ranking process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- This process starts by crawling or otherwise searching through websites on web 102 to select a set of items, such as web pages, to be stored in indexed form in a data center 104 . (These items are represented as dots in FIG. 1 .)
- the process extracts a relevant set of items 106 from the data center. This can involve, for example, using a search engine to search through items stored in data center 104 to select a relevant set of items.
- the system ranks items in relevant set 106 based on user preferences (which are indicated by the dashed line in FIG. 1 ) to produce a ranking 107 of items in the relevant set.
- the system presents the ranked results to a user 110 through a client system 108 .
- the system can use the ranking 107 to rank search results before they are presented to a user.
- the system can use ranking 107 to evaluate the quality of a single search result or a page containing an ordered list of search results.
- FIG. 3 graphically illustrates the process of generating a preference ranking
- FIG. 4 presents a corresponding flow chart in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system first receives a set of items 302 (step 402 ).
- the system computes all possible pairs of items (step 404 ), and then randomly selects a percentage of the pairs (step 406 ).
- the selected pairs if items are then presented to users 304 (step 408 ).
- a rater is presented with a search query along with two associated search results which are presented side-by-side.
- the system then asks the rater to select from several options: e.g., left better than right, about the same, and right better than left.
- the system receives preferences (selections) from the users and uses the preferences to populate a rating matrix 306 (step 410 ).
- populating element r ij involves storing three values, W/L/T, in r ij .
- W indicates the number of times item i “wins” over item j, which means that a user prefers item i over item j.
- L indicates the number of times item i “loses” to item j, which means that a user prefers item j over item i.
- T represents the number of times that item i “ties” with item j, which means that a user indicates a lack of preference between item i and item j.
- rating matrix 306 needs to be populated because the lower-diagonal portion is a mirror image of the upper-diagonal portion. Furthermore, the diagonal elements of rating matrix 306 are zero, because an element does not need to be compared against itself.
- rating matrix 306 is used to compute an adjacency matrix 308 (step 412 ).
- each row and each column of this adjacency matrix are normalized to sum up to one. Also note that both the upper-diagonal portion and the lower-diagonal portion of the adjacency matrix are populated as well as the diagonal elements. If only a small number of ratings are known, the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix tend to be set to one, which means that the adjacency matrix approximates the identity matrix.
- the system determines a preference ranking for the set of items by computing a dominant eigenvector for adjacency matrix 308 . This can involve using any known technique for computing such an eigenvector.
- One embodiment of the present invention uses a technique which is similar to the technique disclosed in the Wikipedia page “http:/en/wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank” to compute this dominant eigenvector. For example, suppose there exist n items i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i n and a corresponding n ⁇ n adjacency matrix A has been generated for the items. In this case, the system computes a dominant eigenvector R which can be represented as follows,
- R [ PR ⁇ ( i 1 ) PR ⁇ ( i 2 ) ... PR ⁇ ( i n ) ] wherein PR(i i ) represents the “preference rank” of the item i i .
- the adjacency matrix A can be represented as
- each element au defines a user preference between the item i i and the item i j .
- the eigenvector R can be determined by solving the following equation,
- R [ ( 1 - d ) / n ( 1 - d ) / n ... ( 1 - d ) / n ] + d ⁇ [ a 11 a 12 ... a 1 ⁇ n a 12 a 22 ... a n ⁇ ⁇ 1 a n ⁇ ⁇ n ] ⁇ R
- d is a “damping factor,” which for example can be 0.85. Note that the elements of the eigenvector R can be normalized to sum up to one.
- the dominant eigenvector R contains values that define a preference ranking for the items i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i n .
- this preference ranking can be used to rank search results before they are presented to a user, or alternatively to evaluate the quality of a single search result or a page containing an ordered list of search results.
- the present invention is described in the context of ranking web pages, it is not limited to web pages. In general, the present invention can be applied to many different ranking domains, such as images, documents, products, advertisements, video clips, audio clips and any other items that users can compare.
- the above-described preference ranking technique can be varied in a number of ways. For example, a different adjacency matrix definition can be used (e.g., inserting additional noise, or inferred comparisons); a different mechanism for selecting pairs of items to compare can be used (instead of random selection); and a different mechanism for presenting pairs of items to users can be used (e.g., instead of side-by-side and explicitly asking which item is preferred, inferring user preference using a more subtle technique like click-tracking).
- a different adjacency matrix definition can be used (e.g., inserting additional noise, or inferred comparisons)
- a different mechanism for selecting pairs of items to compare can be used (instead of random selection)
- a different mechanism for presenting pairs of items to users can be used (e.g., instead of side-by-side and explicitly asking which item is preferred, inferring user preference using a more subtle technique like click-tracking).
- the users can enter scores in a seven-point scale ranging from “much better than” to “much worse than.” However, this may require per-rater normalization, because raters may have differing thresholds for what constitutes a “slight” or “significant” preference. Additionally, the degree of preference can also be observed by asking multiple raters about their preferences and then looking at the distribution of their answers (for example, 4 out of 5 raters might prefer an option).
- One embodiment of the present invention provides additional logic that facilitates ranking a set of items “incrementally.” This incremental ranking process reuses results from previous comparisons to rank new items. By reusing the results from previous comparisons, this incremental ranking process can potentially save a significant amount of computational time.

a ij=1−sum(a ik for all 0≦k<n and k≠i), where i=j.
aij=0, if the rating between item i and item j is unknown;

a ij=1−sum(a ik for all 0≦k<n and k≠i), where i=j.
Note that the elements of each row and each column of this adjacency matrix are normalized to sum up to one. Also note that both the upper-diagonal portion and the lower-diagonal portion of the adjacency matrix are populated as well as the diagonal elements. If only a small number of ratings are known, the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix tend to be set to one, which means that the adjacency matrix approximates the identity matrix.
wherein PR(ii) represents the “preference rank” of the item ii. Similarly, the adjacency matrix A can be represented as
wherein each element au defines a user preference between the item ii and the item ij.
wherein d is a “damping factor,” which for example can be 0.85. Note that the elements of the eigenvector R can be normalized to sum up to one.
