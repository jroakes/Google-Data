FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method according to aspects of the disclosure. - The present disclosure provides for efficiently identifying content to be played at an establishment. Examples of such content may include televised content, such as sporting events, award shows, performances, national events or ceremonies, etc. Other examples may include broadcast audio events, such as podcasts, music performances, etc., or any other type of content. For example, the establishments within a geographical area may provide information indicating what specific content will be played. The information may be provided, for example, by a dedicated communication link, through a business profile updated by an authorized representative of the establishment, through automated calls, etc. A business listing for the establishment may be updated based on the information, such that search results for where the content will be played can include the establishment. By way of example, if a multi-game or multi-event sporting contest, such as the Olympics, World Cup, etc., is occurring, the user can search for and readily identify which local establishments will be playing specific events or games of the contest at the establishment. For example, the user can identify which local bar will display a specific Olympic event or World Cup match between two teams.
- The content that will be played may be indicated in a business profile for the establishment, such that it is searchable and easily accessible to a user. For example, the business profile may include a list, schedule, or any other indication of the content to be played. Verified merchants globally would be able to add such information to their business profiles to publicize that they are streaming a sports match/game/tournament. Such information may be searchable, such that a user can easily find establishments playing content that the user wants to see or hear. For example, the user may ask “Where do I watch the match today?” In response, search results may be returned identifying establishments where specific sports matches are being played. The results may be provided in, for example, a list, map, audibly via an assistant or the like, or in any other format. The results may be filtered based on any of a variety of parameters, such as geographic region, other attributes of the establishment, explicit or implicit user preferences, etc.

- The
devices network 120 and capable of directly and indirectly communicating with other nodes ofnetwork 120. Although three (3) computing devices are depicted inFIG. 1A , it should be appreciated that a typical system can include one or more computing devices, with each computing device being at a different node ofnetwork 120. Thenetwork 120 and intervening nodes described herein can be interconnected using various protocols and systems, such that the network can be part of the Internet, World Wide Web, specific intranets, wide area networks, or local networks. Thenetwork 120 can utilize standard communications protocols, such as WiFi or Bluetooth, that are proprietary to one or more companies. Although certain advantages are obtained when information is transmitted or received as noted above, other aspects of the subject matter described herein are not limited to any particular manner of transmission. - In one example,
system 100 may include one or more server computing devices having a plurality of computing devices, e.g., a load balanced server farm, that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting the data to and from other computing devices. For instance, one or moreserver computing devices 130 may be a web server that is capable of communicating with the one or moreclient computing devices network 120. In addition,server computing device 130 may usenetwork 120 to transmit and present information to a user of one of theother computing devices Server computing device 130 may include one or more processors, memory, instructions, and data. These components operate in the same or similar fashion as those described above with respect tocomputing devices - As shown in
FIG. 1B , eachdevice respective user Devices network 120. - Although the client computing devices may each comprise a full-sized personal computing device, they may alternatively comprise mobile computing devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the Internet. By way of example only,
devices server computing device 130 and/orstorage system 140 vianetwork 120. The information may be, for example an indication of one or more events or programs that are scheduled to be played at the establishment or is currently playing at the establishment. -
Storage system 140 may store various types of information. For instance, thestorage system 140 may store data or information related to POIs for retrieval in response to a search for content to be played at the POI. As used herein, POIs may include any location, establishment, or destination, that a user can visit, such as a bar, restaurant, theater, park, etc. The POI information may include, for example, contact information, hours of operation, ratings, etc. associated with the POI. - According to some examples, the POI information may further include content information for one or more events or programs that are scheduled to be played at the POI, such as televised sporting events. The content information may be received via a communication channel over
network 120 between the POI,storage system 140, and/orserver computing device 130. According to some examples, the content information may be received in response to a POI updating their POI profile to include an indication of what is or will be broadcast. - In some examples, the content information may be received via a communication channel over
network 120 between the output device at the POI and theserver computing device 130 and/orstorage system 140. For example, the output device may be a client computing device, such as a TV, display, etc. that is capable of obtaining and/or transmitting information vianetwork 120. The output device may transmit an indication regarding the content being played, such as the channel the output device is tuned. Based on the indication, thestorage system 140 and/orserver computing device 130 may store an indication of what content is being played and updated the POI profile automatically. - According to some examples, the POI information may be associated with a POI profile, shown in
FIG. 2 . The POI profiles may be updated by the POI and stored bystorage system 140. As shown in thePOI profile 150, the content information may be determined based on thecontent provider information 152 in thePOI profile 150. Thecontent provider information 152 may be an indication of the cable provider and/or streaming provider used by the POI. Based on the cable provider and/or streaming provider, the system may be able to determine what channels the POI has access to and use that information to determine what content the POI is capable of broadcasting. As shown, the POI may input text into atext box 155 indicating their service provider and/or streaming provider. While atext box 155 is shown to allow the POI to provide information regarding their content provider, some user interfaces may include buttons, drop downs, check boxes, etc. that can be selected by the POI. - According to some examples, the content information may be determined based on content attributes. The content attributes may be, in some examples, Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes may be attributes related to the content that is or is intended to be broadcasted. According to some examples, the attributes may be attributes that can be “true” or “false.” For example, the attribute may be “World Cup” and the POI either is/intends to broadcast the World Cup or is not/does not intend to broadcast the World Cup. In such an example, a response that the POI is/intends to may correspond to “true” while a response that the POI is not/does not intend to may correspond to “false.”
- The POI may, in some examples, answer content attributes 154 via their
POI profile 150. For example, a POI may provide a yes or no answer to whether they will be broadcasting certain events, programs, leagues, etc. during a given period of time. For example, a POI may answer acontent attribute 154 querying whether the POI will be broadcasting certain league games for a period of time, such as a season or tournament. In one example, based on an answer to afirst content attribute 154, such as whether the POI will be broadcasting league games, a subsequent content attribute may appear, such as whether the POI will be broadcasting league games for the full season. In some examples, the subsequent content attribute may query whether the POI will be broadcasting a specific game, or event, such as a tournament. - As shown, the POI may toggle 156 between yes and no when answering content attributes 154. While a
toggle 156 is shown to indicate whether the POI will be broadcasting certain content, some user interfaces may include buttons that can be selected by the POI. The buttons may include an option for “yes” and another for “no.” In some examples, there may be a drop-down menu providing options for the POI to select. Additionally or alternatively, there may be check boxes that may allow the POI to select certain content, times during the day they will be broadcasting that type of content, etc. Therefore, while atoggle 156 is shown, atoggle 156 is just one option for the POI to indicate whether they are broadcasting certain content. - In some examples, the response to content attributes may be determined automatically, without the POI interacting with the content attributes. For example, the response to content attributes may be determined based on the cable or streaming package associated with the POI. The responses to the content attributes may be determined and used after the POI provides authorization for the system to access or receive information related to the POI's cable or streaming package. Any use of the POI's cable and streaming information is authorized by the POI. For example, the POI may provide authorization to an application for generating the POI profile and identifying content information by setting certain permissions for the application. The authorization may be for the application or system to access one or more databases or sub-databases in the memory of the output devices. In some examples, the authorization may be for the application or system to access a streaming device or cable box associated with the output devices.
-
FIG. 3 illustrates an example method of updating content indications for POIs. The content indications may be information related to what content a POI is broadcasting or intends to broadcast. For example, the system may receive the content attributes from thePOIs 202, identify POIs broadcastingcertain content 204, confirm broadcasting with the POI, determine if there are any conflicts regarding thecontent information 208, and update thecontent information 210 to be displayed in response to a search result. - Receiving content attributes 202 may include, for example, receiving information from
storage system 140,server computing device 130, and/or a client computing device of the POI. The content attributes 202 may provide an indication of what content, type of content, period of time, etc. a POI will broadcast. For example, a POI may have answered one or more content attribute questions in a POI profile to provide an indication of what the POI will be broadcasting. - The content attributes of the POIs may be used to identify one or more POIs that are or intend to broadcast
certain content 204. For example, the content attributes of the POIs may be used to identify POIs that are or intend to broadcast the world cup, award shows, concert specials, etc. According to some examples, the identifyingPOIs broadcasting content 204 may include identifying POIs that are capable of broadcasting the certain content. For example, the system may, after confirming authorization from the POI, receive information related to the POI's cable or streaming provider. Based on the cable or streaming provided, the system may determine whether the POI has access to the requisite cable or streaming channel to broadcast the certain content. - According to some examples, the system may confirm that the POI is or intends to broadcast the
certain content 206. For example, the system may transmit a message to the POI via the POI profile to confirm whether the POI is or intends to broadcast the World Cup, or any other specific content. In some examples, the system may automatically call, text, e-mail, or otherwise contact the POI based on the contact information provided in the POI profile and/or publicly available information related to the POI. The messages may ask the POI to confirm whether the POI is or intend to broadcast certain type of content, e.g., the World Cup, a specific showing of the type of content, e.g., a specific game of the World Cup, etc. The POI may choose to answer as many or as few questions regarding the content they are or intend to broadcast. - The system may determine whether there is a
conflict 208. The conflict may be a conflict between the received content attributes 202, information in the POI profile, confirmation information provided by thePOI 206, etc. For example, a given POI may indicate via a content attribute that they intend to broadcast the World Cup but, when seeking confirmation regarding the broadcasting the World Cup, the system may have received a response that the POI will not be broadcasting the World Cup on a given day in place of other content. In such an example, the content attribute indication, e.g., yes to broadcasting the World Cup, is in conflict with the confirmation information, e.g., no to broadcasting the World Cup. - In examples where there is a conflict, the system may resolve the
conflict 212. Resolving the conflict may include, for example, identifying the most recent information related to the content that is or is intended to be broadcast at the POI. In some examples, this may be the confirmation information provided by thePOI 206. In another example, the POI may not answer the confirmation message such that the most recent information is thecontent attribute 202 provided by the POI in the POI profile. According to some examples, the conflict may be resolved using a hierarchy, weighted system, sliding scale, direct comparison, etc. to resolve the conflict between information related to the content to be broadcasted at a POI. For example, a response to the confirmation message may be weighted greater than the content attribute, or vice versa. Once conflicts are resolved or if there are no conflicts, the POI content indication may be updated 210. Updating the POI content indication may include updating the information related to what content the POI is or intends to broadcast. According to some examples, if there is no conflict, the POI content indication may be confirmed, in addition to or instead of being updated. - The POI content indication may be provided in response to a search query. For example, a user may submit a search query seeking to find a POI that will be broadcasting the World Cup. The system may identify relevant POIs in response to the search query based on the POI content indications. In response to the search query, the system may provide the identified POIs for output to the user. The output may include, in some examples, POI information, including the content indications.
- The
POI profile 150 may include additional inputs to allow a given POI to add or update information related to the POI. For example, thePOI profile 150 may include inputs to allow the POI to provide contact information, such as the POI name, address, phone number, website, social media, etc. In some examples, thePOI profile 150 may include inputs to allow the POI to upload content, such as images, videos, etc. related to the POI. Information and content provided by the POI in thePOI profile 150 may be provide in response to a search query for one or more POIs. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example display providing acontent indication 131 of what will be played at an establishment. In this example, graphic 100 includes animage section 110, asummary information section 121, and acontent indication section 131. The graphic 100 may be displayed, for example on a client device, in response to a request for information related to Business A. The request for information may include, for example, an address, business name, general geographical area, type of business, etc. For example, a user may have submitted a search for a restaurant, and selected a search result corresponding to Restaurant B. -
Image section 110 may include an image relevant to the place. For example, for Restaurant B the image may be of the inside or outside of the restaurant, etc. -
Summary information section 121 may include a variety of information describing the place. By way of example only, for Restaurant B such information includes arating 121, aprice category 122, adistance 123 from a particular location (e.g., the user's location), acategorization 124 of the type of food served, and apersonal score 125 indicating how well the place matches the user's preferences. Thesummary section 121 may also include one ormore links 126, facilitating actions by the user in connection with the place. For example, thelinks 126 may enable the user to call the place, get directions to the place, visit a website of the place, reserve a table at the place, save the place to one or more personal lists, etc. The foregoing are merely examples, and it should be understood that thesummary information section 121 may include any of a number of other types of information. For example, thesummary information section 121 may also include text, such as a listing of the operating hours of the Restaurant B. -
Content indication section 131 may include an identification of content that will be played at the place. The indication may be, for example, a schedule, list, or any other format. The content may be, for example, sports games or matches, or any other televised or broadcast event, such as a news program, podcast, etc. - According to some examples,
content indication section 131 may be a subsection that can be selected from a variety of options, such as overview information, posts, reviews, photos, etc. While a number of example sections are described above in connection withFIG. 4 , and thecontent indication 131 is displayed as a schedule for a particular tournament, the World Cup, it should be understood that these are merely examples. Thecontent indication 130 may be provided for display in any of a number of ways, such as text, pictorial diagrams, charts, graphs, etc. As described in further detail herein, thecontent indication 131 may also include a link to further information related to the content being played. For example, the further information may include a description of the teams playing, player information, statistics, standings, channel that is broadcasting the game, etc. - The
content indication 131 may be based on aPOI profile 150 created by the establishment. The POI profile may include images to be output inimage section 110, information to be output insummary information section 120, and content information to be output incontent indication section 131. The establishment may update their POI profile to indicate what content is going to be broadcasted and/or what content is currently being broadcasted at that establishment. In some examples, the POI profile and/orcontent indication section 131 may be updated automatically based on information provided by the output devices at the establishment. -
FIG. 5 illustrates one example of a type of further information that may be displayed upon user interaction with thecontent indication section 131. In this example, the further information includesbusyness information 141 for the place. Thebusyness information 141 corresponds to a selection made by the user interaction with thecontent indication section 131. For example, the user may select the 7 pm game of Team C vs. Team D, such as by clicking, tapping, hovering, providing speech commands, etc. In response, thebusyness information 141 corresponding to the selection, in this example 7 pm, is displayed.Such busyness information 141 may allow the user to gauge how crowded the place is likely to be during the game they want to watch. In this regard, the additional information allows the user to assess how comfortable they would be watching the selected game at the place. -
FIG. 6 illustrates an example of providing content information for a plurality of search results. A user enters asearch 308, in this example “Soccer.” According to some examples, the user may identify a particular geographic region to search. According to other examples, if the user has provided her location, either explicitly or by authorizing location sharing on her client device, map 315 may automatically depict a region around the user's location. Themap 315 may also include a depiction of geographical objects at the particular geographic location surrounding the user 305. For example, the geographic objects may include roads, buildings, landmarks, statues, street signs, etc. The objects may be depicted in, for example, a roadgraph, aerial imagery, street level imagery, or the like. - Places responsive to the user's search, such as places showing televised soccer games within a predetermined geographical range of the user's location, are identified. The search results may also be represented on the
map 315, such as by marker points. - As shown, the search results may also be listed below the
map 315, and the listing may includecontent information content information - According to some examples,
predefined filters 350 may be provided. The user may interact with any of thepredefined filters 350, including multiple selections, to narrow down the search and displayed results. In this example, thepredefined filters 350 include “Local Teams,” “Specials,” “Live,” “P League,” and “Families.” The “Local Teams” filter may restrict the search results to indicate only places that are playing content associated with local teams, such as games for teams associated with the geographic region displayed in themap 315. The “Specials” filter may narrow the results to only establishments providing some type of food, drink, or other special. According to some examples, if this filter is applied, additional information describing the type of special may be displayed in the search results along with the business information and content information. The “Live” filter may narrow the search results to only sporting events that are being broadcast live, as opposed to replays of older broadcasts. The “P League” filter may narrow the search results to a particular league, team, club, or the like. For example, the filter may suggest a particular league, team, club, etc. based on popularity for the geographic region or based on any other criteria. The “Families” filter may limit the search results to only those place that are appropriate to bring families. While a number of example filters 350 are illustrated inFIG. 6 , it should be understood that these are merely examples, and that any of a variety of filters may be displayed, and additional or fewer filters may be displayed. In some examples, the filters may be determined based on thesearch 308 entered in the search field. -
FIG. 7 illustrates anexample interface 500 for searching and displaying content to be played at establishments within a particular geographic region.Interface 500 includes ageographic search field 502 and amap portion 552. Thegeographic search field 502 may be capable of accepting input indicating a geographic region. Examples of such input may include, without limitation, a town, city, zip code, particular POI, or instruction to use a current location of a user device, such as “near me.” When such input is entered into thesearch field 502, themap portion 552 may display the geographic region corresponding to the input. For example, if the city of “Springfield” is entered into thesearch field 502 as shown inFIG. 7 , a map of Springfield may be displayed in themap portion 552. Such map may take any of a variety of forms, such as a traditional two-dimensional roadway depiction map, a bird's eye view map, satellite view, street-level view, three-dimensional view, etc. - In the example shown, the
screenshot 500 includes a plurality ofrequest buttons request button 504, when selected, may cause a prompt to appear seeking input of a starting point such that driving, walking, public transportation, or other directions to the geographic region can be generated from the starting point. “What's playing”request button 510, when selected, may cause an indication of places playing particular content within the geographic region to surface on themap portion 552. According to some examples, particular timeframes for the content may be received as input from a user, and the search results are filtered such that only places with content playing within the particular timeframes are indicated in themap portion 552. For example, the user may indicate that the search is for sporting event be played “now,” “today,” “tonight,” “tomorrow,” “next month,” or any other timeframe. In response, the search results may depict the content being played within the specified timeframe. - According to some examples, the search request may be filtered, such as to provide places playing only particular types of content specified in a request from the user. In the example shown, a pre-populated menu may be displayed offering options for selection. Such options may include, for example, content type and sub-type. For example, the pre-populated menu can be a hierarchical drop-down menu as shown in
FIG. 7 with amain menu 512 and one ormore sub-menus 514. In this example, themain menu 512 includes a variety of content types, such as different sports. It should be understood that these are merely examples and other types of content may be included in the menu. - When a type is selected from the
main menu 512, such as selection of “soccer,” asub-menu 514 may be displayed providing a variety of sub-types that correspond to the selected type. For example, for the main type of soccer, the sub-types insub-menu 514 may include specific teams. According to other examples, the sub-types may include particular leagues or any other category. According to some examples, even further refinement is possible. While the pre-populated menu in this example is a hierarchical drop-down list, it should be understood that any of a variety of other menu formats are possible. For example, the menu may include a collection of icons, text bubbles, etc. - Results for the search may be displayed in the
map portion 552. The results may be indicated in any of a variety of forms. In the example ofFIG. 7 , the results are indicated aspins 530 withcorresponding information boxes information boxes map portion 552 may be updated to display fewer results when the sub-type of “Team A” is selected. - The
information boxes information boxes information boxes - According to some examples, in response to user interaction with one of the
information boxes - The information boxes illustrated in
FIG. 7 are just one example of how details can be displayed for a particular place and the content being played at the place. In other examples, information can be output in any of a variety of other formats. -
FIG. 8 illustrates another example of a search tool for content to be played at businesses or other nearby establishments, and how search requests can be entered using the tool. In this example, rather than a pre-populated menu, a free-text search field 606 is provided. Such free-text search field 606 may accept search queries having varying level of details. For example, thefield 606 can accept a general request such as “all” live sporting events being played at local establishments. In other examples, such as the one illustrated, thefield 606 can accept more specific request, such as for establishments playing match featuring Team XYZ. In response, businesses within the geographic region are displayed that are showing Team XYZ on their televisions. - Information used for surfacing the events, such as the match featuring Team XYZ of
FIG. 8 , may be collected from owners of the establishments or authorized representatives. For example, an owner or employee of the bar/restaurant showing Team XYZ may create an entry in a profile, map database, or other data structure listing the content they intend to play at particular times, such that it can be included in search results. When creating the entry, the owner or representative's identity may be verified, such that only owners or authorized representatives can publish information regarding the content to be played at the establishment. According to other examples, members of the public may be authorized to create such entries and/or provide updated information. According to some examples, information supplied by the general public may be accepted as suggestions that must be confirmed by the owner or an authorized representative. - According to some examples, the content to be played at a particular establishment may be automatically provided. For example, if the establishment subscribes to a particular channel or broadcast, content information for the establishment may indicate whatever is being played on that particular channel or broadcast. According to another example, if the establishment always plays games for a specific team, the content information may be automatically updated to include games for the specific team.
-
FIG. 9A illustrates an example of providing search results. A user enters asearch 908, in this example “world cup.” The system may determine the intent of the search. For example, the system may determine that the World Cup is going to start in two weeks. In response to thesearch 908, the system may identify the intent to be preparations for the World Cup. The search results may, in such an example, pertain relevant information for preparing for the start of the World Cup. In some examples, such as the one shown inFIG. 9A , the system may determine that the World Cup is currently being played. In such an example, the system may determine the intent ofsearch 908 to be information about the games being played at or around the time of the search. For example, in response to the search “world cup,” the system may provide information regarding the matches that have recently been completed, such as the match between Team A and Team F, the match currently being played between Team B and Team X, and the next match to be played betweenTeam 2 andTeam 6. - According to some examples, included with the search results may be a number of inputs related to the search results. For example, a user can narrow or filter the search results to focus on an
overview 910 of the World Cup, a list ofmatches 912 to be played, table, player, stats, etc. In response to receiving an input corresponding to the selection ofmatches 912, the system may provide anoutput 914, such as a list, of matches that have or will be played. Aninput 916, e.g., “watch near me,” may be provided with the results. The “watch near me”input input 918. The system may search for establishments that intend to broadcast the match betweenTeam 2 andTeam 6. According to some examples, the system may search for establishments in a predetermined geographic area near the user. -
FIG. 9B illustrates an example of providing search results in response to receiving an input corresponding to the selection of “watch near me.” As shown, thesearch 920 may update from “world cup” to “WatchTeam 2 v.Team 6 near me” in response to receiving a selection ofinput 918. Places response to the updatedsearch 920, such asplaces showing Team 2 v.Team 6, within a predetermined geographical range of the user's location, are identified. The search results may be represented on amap 922, such as by mark points. As shown, the search results may also be listed below themap 922, and the listing may includecontent information content information Team 2 andTeam 6. -
FIG. 10 illustrates an example method of displaying temporal events in association with geographic locations. While the operations are described in a particular order, it should be understood that operations may be performed in a different order or simultaneously. Moreover, operations may be added or omitted. - In
block 710, a request is received for content being presented or to be presented at establishments within a particular geographic region. For example, the request may specify a particular town, street, city, state, country, postal code, coordinates, landmark, or any other information that may be used to identify a geographic region. The content may include, for example, televised sporting events or any other events broadcast over television, radio, or other channels. The events may be live in-person, live streamed or televised, time delayed, previously recorded and replayed, etc. For example, the events may include sports games, performances such as music, theatre, dancing, or any other type of event. The request can be general, such as for “basketball,” or it can be more specific, such as for a specific team playing at a particular time. - In
block 720, establishments are identified having locations within the geographic region and business profiles indicating content matching the request. For examples, establishments can each update their associated business profiles to identify particular tournaments, matches, games, or other events that the establishment will play for its customers to watch or listen. In other examples, the business profiles can be updated automatically. The search request can be compared with the information in the business profiles to identify a match. - According to some examples, identifying the establishments includes receiving content attributes from the establishments. The content attributes may be an indication of whether the establishment is or intends to broadcast a certain type of content or a specific broadcast of the type of content. For example, the content attribute may be an indication that the establishment intends to broadcast college basketball. A specific broadcast of the type of content may be a specific college basketball game, such as two teams playing against each other at a given time. The content attributes may be received from POI profile information. According to some examples, the content attributes may be received in response to questions transmitted to the establishments.
- The content attributes may be compared with the request for content. For example, if the request for content is for “music awards shows,” the system may compare the content attributes of the establishments with “music awards shows” to determine which establishments have indicated that they are or intend to present content related to music award shows. The establishments whose content attributes indicate that they intend to present content related to music awards shows may be the identified establishments.
- According to some examples, a confirmation message may be transmitted to the establishments. The confirmation message may be based on the content attributes and/or the request for content. The response to the confirmation message may be a confirmation or denial that the establishment is or intends to present a type of content or a specific broadcast of the type of content. For example, the content attributes of an establishment may indicate that they intend to present content related to football and, more specifically, football games played be a specific team, such as Team W. A confirmation message may be transmitted to the establishment to confirm or deny the content attribute. For example, the confirmation message may ask the establishment to confirm they intend to present football games played by Team W. The confirmation may be sent by, for example, email, text, facsimile, phone, or through any other type of communication channel. The establishment may provide a response, such as a yes or a no. In some examples, the confirmation message may be sent to a user having a location corresponding to the location of the establishment. For example, a patron of a bar may volunteer to answer questions about what media content is being broadcast at the bar while the patron is present. When a user searches for establishments broadcasting a particular event, if the bar is returned as a result the user may submit a request for verification. The request for verification may be sent to the patron located at the bar, who may in turn provide a response based on what the patron observes, the response indicating whether or not the particular event is being broadcast.
- The response of the confirmation message may be compared to the content attributes to determine if there is a conflict. A conflict may be, for example, if the content attribute indicates that the establishment intends to present content related to Team W but the confirmation messages indicates that the establishment is not going to present content related to Team W. In such an example, the conflict may be resolved based on which of the content attribute or confirmation message was most recently received. In some examples, the conflict may be resolved by using a hierarchy, weighted system, sliding scale, direct comparison, etc. Once the conflict is resolved, the content information for the establishment may be updated. In examples where there is not a conflict, the content information may be updated and/or confirmed with the content attribute and/or confirmation message.
- In
block 730, search results may be provided for display indicating the identified establishments and the content matching the request. For example, if the request is for a particular basketball team, the search results may indicate each establishment playing the game for that basketball team. According to examples, other information may also be provided, such as other events being played by the establishment, venue information related to the establishment, etc. The search results may be displayed in any of a variety of formats, such as on a map, in a list, etc. - According to some examples, the business profiles for respective establishments can be automatically updated to remove a listing of the event when the event is over. For example, if the business profile lists that the establishment will present
games game 1 whengame 1 is over, and then to remove the listing forgame 4 whengame 4 is over, etc. - Providing for searching and displaying of establishments playing particular content as described above is beneficial in that it provides pertinent information to users in a computationally efficient manner. In particular, rather than requiring a user to search for locations, and then visit websites for each location to determine what games are being played at a particular time, the user can search for all content that will be played at establishments in a particular area with one search command. In this manner, the user is automatically shown those events that are occurring in the relevant time frame as part of the search results, providing a dynamic and relevant search. By reducing the number of sites needed to visit for such information, computing resources such as bandwidth, power, and other network resources are conserved. Moreover, the system and method provided herein provide for applying specific filters that may be implicit or explicitly set by the user. By filtering the results prior to display, and thereby reducing the number of less pertinent results displayed, additional computing resources are conserved as only the filtered results need be rendered and displayed on a user device.
- Unless otherwise stated, the foregoing alternative examples are not mutually exclusive, but may be implemented in various combinations to achieve unique advantages. As these and other variations and combinations of the features discussed above can be utilized without departing from the subject matter defined by the claims, the foregoing description of the embodiments should be taken by way of illustration rather than by way of limitation of the subject matter defined by the claims. In addition, the provision of the examples described herein, as well as clauses phrased as “such as,” “including” and the like, should not be interpreted as limiting the subject matter of the claims to the specific examples; rather, the examples are intended to illustrate only one of many possible embodiments. Further, the same reference numbers in different drawings can identify the same or similar elements.
