Entity fact access control
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of data system 130.In some embodiments, integrated system 132 receives multiple resources 115,
Each resource 115 has the accesses control list specified to one or more members of enterprise to the access rights of resource 115.
Each resource includes description can be identified as 210a, the data and/or information of 210b ... 210N entity 210 in fig. 2.
Entity 210 is related to the relation between enterprise and entity.The entity 210 of enterprise can be such as people (or member), position, item
Any other information in mesh, department, sales information, performance evaluation or ERM 115.More generally, in some embodiment party
In formula, entity is that each has different and independent presence, and can be related to by text fragments, such as term or phrase
And and for example can the theme based on the language that context is distinguished from each other, concept or things.Thus, entity can be with thing
The physics or concept of real definition and attribute are realized.
In addition, integrated system 132 exports the entity fact 220 from the entity 210 of resource 115, the entity fact 220 can be identified
For the entity fact 220a, 220b ... the 220N in Fig. 2.Each entity fact 220 all describes at least one spy of entity 210
Sign, wherein these features describe the corresponding relation between entity 210.For example, the resource 115 (for example, file) of enterprise is recognizable
Title and post in enterprise management level, wherein " Jane Doe " positions in enterprise management level can be " Vice-President
of Sales”.In present exemplary, " Jane Doe " and " Vice-President of Sales " are entity, and can be

In addition, integrated system 132 determines 230a, the 230b that can be identified as in Fig. 2 ... 230N entity is true to be accessed
Control list 230.The true visit of entity is determined to each entity fact 220 of the accesses control list determination from each resource 115
Ask control list 230.In some embodiments, the accesses control list of resource as derived from resource each entity fact after
Hold.For example, resource 115a1 can be the document of the payroll information with member of enterprise.Resource 115a1 may include individually row (instruction
Jane Doe salary) in " Jane Doe " and " $ 50,000 " as entity 210b as entity 210a.Due to salary
Information is personal and sensitive information, so resource 115a1 accesses control list can only include Director of Human Resources, such as
“Mary”.Resource 115b1 can be the intranet pages that the salary amount of money of member is decomposed by percentage, and may include conduct
Entity 211a " Jane Doe " and " Top 5% " (instruction Jane Doe income percentage) as entity 211b.The letter
The accesses control list of breath can provide the access to all members (or member group bigger than resource 115a1) of enterprise.Then
Can determine that the entity fact, and in this example, can be from resource 115a1 and 115b1 entity 210a, 210b, 211a and
Derived " Jane Doe " and " salaries of $ 50,000 ", and as entity fact 220b's as entity fact 220a of 211b
" Jane Doe " and " Top 5% ".
Then entity fact accesses control list 230 can be determined based on the resource that the corresponding entity fact is derived from.For example,
Entity fact 220a entity fact accesses control list 230a will only include Mary, because being derived from entity fact 220a's
Resource 115a1 includes the Mary in accesses control list.Entity fact 220b entity fact accesses control list 230b will be wrapped
Whole members of enterprise are included, because resource 115b1 includes the enterprise whole member in accesses control list.Based on this example,
Mary is by with the access right to entity fact 220a and entity fact 220b, because she is included in resource 115a1 and 115b1
In both accesses control lists；However, other members, such as representative of sales ＆ marketing " Alvin " is by without the access right to 220a,
Because he is not a part for basic resource 115a1 accesses control list, and he is by with the visit to entity fact 220b
The power of asking because based on true 220b associated accesses control lists of derived file therefrom, he has to resource 115b1
Access rights.
The information for being sent to and being obtained by integrated system 132 is stored in data storage 134.Data storage 134
Storage for example describes entity 210, the data of the entity fact 220 and corresponding entity fact accesses control list 230, wherein each
The all its corresponding entity fact accesses control list 230 of the entity fact 220 is associated.Then, the index data of index 136 is deposited
Information in storage 134.Then, the member of enterprise uses search engine 138, for example to search for data storage 134, so as to access enterprise
The entity fact 220 of the resource 115 of industry.According to corresponding entity fact accesses control list 230, each member of enterprise has
There are the access rights of the data to description entity 210 and the entity fact 220.
Search engine 138 can be realized using any appropriate search procedure.For example, search engine 138 can use letter
Breath retrieval (IR) scoring method, authoritative scoring method, or one or more of the combination of correlation and authorization Algorithm.
Fig. 3 is to be provided based on the corresponding entity fact accesses control list 230 obtained from the basic resources 115 of enterprise to reality
The flow chart of the instantiation procedure 300 of the access rights of the body fact 220.For example, process 300 can be implemented by data system 130.
In some embodiments, the operation of instantiation procedure 300 can be implemented as being stored in non-transient computer-readable media
Instruction, wherein these instructions cause data handling system to perform the operation of instantiation procedure 300.
The resource 115 (302) of enterprise is received, each resource has the resource specified to one or more members of enterprise
Access rights corresponding accesses control list, and resource include description be related between the entity 210 of enterprise and entity 210
The data of relation.Each information resources 112 of enterprise information system 110 include resource 115, and can lead on network 102
Cross API 120 and resource 115 is supplied to data system 130.Each resource 115, which includes instruction, allows which member of enterprise to visit
The accesses control list of special resource is asked and/or changed, and the access of each resource 115 is received together with each respective resources
Control list information.Each resource 115 includes the entity 210 as the information for being related to enterprise.For example, identification enterprise management level
Name and the ERM 115a1 of position (wherein " Jane Doe " can position be " Vice- in enterprise management level
President of Sales ") it may include " Jane Doe " and " Vice- as entity 210b as entity 210a
President of Sales”。
