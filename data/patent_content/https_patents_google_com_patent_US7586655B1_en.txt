Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to scanning bound documents. More specifically, systems and methods for acquiring and using three-dimensional imaging data to improve the process of scanning bound documents are disclosed.
- Bound documents include not only books, but also periodicals, manuscripts, pamphlets, brochures, newspapers, manuals, and any other document having a bound edge.
- Many institutions, such as the Library of Congress, universities, bookstores, and private enterprises have vast collections of bound documents. By converting these documents into electronic form, such institutions can reduce the cost of storage, facilitate remote access, enable simultaneous access by multiple users, facilitate search and retrieval of information, and/or protect information in rare or out-of-print works from loss or destruction.
- the recorded image can be manipulated or otherwise processed.
- Digitally recorded bound documents can be reformatted, supplemented with additional information, compressed, and/or processed with OCR (optical character recognition) software, and indexed to facilitate electronic search.
- OCR optical character recognition
- a traditional flat-bed platen scanner scans bound documents in a face-down position.
- a flat-bed scanner typically requires the application of force to the spine or binding region of the bound documents to insure that they come within the scanner's depth of focus. Such force can damage the spine region of the document.
- using the flat-bed platen can be tedious and time-consuming, as the bound documents typically must be lifted and repositioned after each page is scanned. Further, image quality is often poor due to loss of focus, uneven illumination, and distortion caused by page curvature in the vicinity of the binding.
- An alternative to the traditional flat-bed platen scanner is a platen-less scanner that captures image data from a bound document in a face-up position.
- Such scanners typically do not require application of additional stress to the binding region of a bound document, since the document is scanned in its natural, face-up position.
- Some such scanners make use of automatic page turning apparatuses.
- optics and software have been developed for compensating for the image-distortion resulting from the inherently curved surfaces typical of open, edge-bound books that are not subjected to potentially damaging flattening pressure.
- the curvature of a document's pages may be detected using a curvature detector, with a linear light source for defining a brightness distribution. The detected curves of the page can then be used to approximately rectify image signals received from the document scanner.
- a problem with such techniques is that obstructions may appear between the document and the camera or other device that is used to obtain an image of the document. This can reduce the effectiveness and/or throughput of large scanning jobs, since the inaccurate and/or ineffective scanning of one or more pages can undermine the reliability of information search and retrieval based on the results of the scanning process, and renders the scanned version of the document an ineffective and incomplete tool for archival purposes.
- systems and methods are needed for facilitating the scanning of bound documents in a manner that minimizes document wear-and-tear, and yet is relatively efficient and/or error-free.
- a document scanning system includes at least one camera for capturing an image of documents such as books, periodicals, and the like, and at least a second camera for gathering data regarding the first camera's field of view.
- Signal processing logic analyzes the data gathered by the second camera, and uses it to determine whether the imaging camera's view was obstructed. If it is determined that the imaging camera's view was obstructed, then remedial action can be taken, such as removing the obstruction, recapturing the image, and/or flagging the image for further processing.
- the second camera may include a laser range finder, a scanning laser range finder, an ultrasonic range finder, a device that utilizes auto-focus range finding technology, a binocular camera array, and/or a trinocular camera array.
- a method for scanning bound documents is provided.
- An array of one or more cameras is used to capture an image of a document.
- a second array of cameras or other devices are also used to collect data regarding the document and region between the document surface and the first camera array. These data are then processed to determine whether any obstructions or other error conditions might have interfered with the first camera array's attempt to capture an image of the document. If any such obstructions or error conditions are detected, remedial action can be taken.
- the process of detecting the presence of obstructions or error conditions includes comparing the data collected by the second array of cameras to an idealized data model of a hypothetical document and the region between the hypothetical document and the first camera array. Differences between the actual data collected by the second array and the idealized model are analyzed to determine whether they indicate the presence of obstructions or other error conditions.
- a method for scanning a bound document is provided.
- the document is positioned on a cradle located beneath an array of one or more cameras.
- the array of cameras is used to capture an image of the bound document.
- a second array of one or more cameras is used to capture an image of the bound document and the region between the surface of the bound document and the first camera array.
- the image captured by the second camera array is then compared to data representing a hypothetical, bound document and the region between the surface of the hypothetical, bound document and the first camera array. Differences between the captured data and the data model can then be analyzed to detect the presence of obstructions or other error-causing conditions, such as warped pages, an incorrectly positioned document, or the like.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary image-capture system.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary image-capture system that acquires and uses three-dimensional shape information for error detection.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a method for acquiring and using three-dimensional imaging data to improve the process of scanning bound documents.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram on another exemplary image-capture system.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary image-capture system that uses range-finding technology to detect obstructions.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a system for acquiring and using three-dimensional imaging data to improve the process of scanning bound documents.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary system 20 for scanning bound documents.
- a document such as a book 26 is placed on a cradle 28 (such as a table top, or mechanical device specially adapted for holding books and other documents), and opened to facing pages 30 , 32 which a system operator wishes to convert into electronic form.
- One or more cameras 22 , 24 such as high resolution cameras, take digital pictures of pages 30 , 32 , and these pictures are then processed using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to produce an editable and/or searchable version of the document's text.
- OCR optical character recognition
- a problem with a scanning process such as that illustrated in FIG. 1 is that camera(s) 22 , 24 may be inadvertently blocked when taking a picture of a given page, thus resulting in a failure to obtain an accurate and/or complete image of the page. If such an obstructed picture goes undetected, or unremedied, it can lead to error, data loss, and/or customer dissatisfaction when the incompletely and/or inaccurately scanned text is later used as a search tool or as a backup of the original, or if it is marketed to consumers as an accurate and complete copy of the original.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary image-capture system that acquires and uses three-dimensional shape information to automatically detect and optionally correct obstructions and/or other problems with the images obtained by camera(s) 22 , 24 .
- one or more additional cameras 40 a , 40 b , 40 c , 42 may be employed to obtain three-dimensional (or quasi-three-dimensional) spatial data that can be used to detect obstructions in the field of vision of camera(s) 22 , 24 .
- the three-dimensional data gathered by cameras 40 , 42 may undergo relatively sophisticated signal processing to obtain additional information about the nature of any obstructions, or relatively simple signal processing could be used to make a yes/no decision as to whether any obstructions were present.
- the signal from camera 42 might simply detect obstructions in camera 42 's line of sight to target 44 , without undergoing further signal processing.
- a camera 42 may be a laser beam or ultrasound device.
- one or more cameras 42 may be operable to capture an edge view of the document, which can be compared to the edge view of a nominal, idealized document using signal processing techniques, thereby enabling detection of unusual or undesirable profiles.
- the imaging data for a page can be flagged for later remediation, and/or the human or machine supervisor of the scanning process can be alerted to the error so that the page can be rescanned.
- the imaging data collected by systems such as that shown in FIG. 2 can also (or alternatively) be used to detect other errors or special conditions during the imaging process.
- the imaging data collected by cameras 40 , 42 can be used to determine whether the document, and/or page, is positioned correctly relative to the image plane(s) of the camera(s) 22 , 24 ; whether the page contains any special features (such as pop-up text) requiring special attention; whether the end of the document has been reached (e.g., by detecting that the document is shut); and/or the like.
- FIG. 2 is provided for purposes of illustration, and that numerous modifications could be made to the system shown in FIG. 2 without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 shows one set of cameras 40 , 42 being used for purposes of detecting obstructions to the field of view of another set of cameras 22 , 24 , it will be appreciated that in other embodiments some or all of these cameras may perform both roles (i.e., obtaining imaging data and assisting in the detection of obstructions or other special conditions).
- FIG. 2 shows two cameras being used for imaging, and four cameras being used to gather three-dimensional data, it should be appreciated that any suitable number of cameras can be used for the image collection and/or three-dimensional data gathering.
- a single camera could be employed to image the document, and a single camera could be used to detect obstructions.
- the greater the number of cameras used to collect the three-dimensional data the richer the information regarding obstructions and other issues that will be obtainable.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a process for using three-dimensional imaging data to detect and optionally correct errors and/or special conditions in a document imaging process.
- imaging data that is used for detecting errors and special conditions will often be referred to as “three-dimensional” data, this data need not be three-dimensional in a literal sense.
- data from a single camera or other data collection source could comprise the “three-dimensional” data that is used.
- a document is scanned by positioning it under the imaging camera(s) at step 300 .
- An image of the document is then captured, as is three-dimensional imaging data regarding the space surrounding the document at step 302 .
- the three-dimensional data is then sent to a signal processor for processing at step 304 . If the signal processing detects an obstruction and/or other special condition (i.e., a “Yes” exit from decision block 306 ), then the imaging data for that page is flagged for further processing and/or corrected at step 308 .
- the image data for that particular page could be recaptured, or reprocessed using special signal processing techniques, or simply flagged for manual proofreading.
- Certain automated remedial measures can be employed at step 308 such as by using software to modify the captured image data and/or by physically correcting the source of the problem.
- An advantage of the process shown in FIG. 3 is that potential errors are detected as they occur, thereby allowing immediate remediation.
- a human or machine operator could be alerted at step 308 to simply recapture the image for the particular page, thereby obviating the need to later return to that page to capture a better image (if the error is detected at all).
- the spatial data processing may also alert the operator of the need to reposition the document and/or the imaging cameras, thereby preventing the collection of an entire document's worth of useless data due to a careless initial placement of the document under the imaging cameras.
- some or all of the errors or special conditions detected at step 306 could be processed at a later time.
- the scanning system may return to that page at a later time so that it can apply specialized image capture techniques (e.g., additional, or repositioned, cameras).
- specialized image capture techniques e.g., additional, or repositioned, cameras.
- any of a wide variety of techniques can be used to collect the three-dimensional data used to detect obstructions.
- One such technique makes use of a set of one or more cameras or lasers oriented in one or more planes parallel to the face of the document.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of one such arrangement.
- detection devices such as cameras or lasers 42 . . . 42 z are operable to detect obstructions to their field of view.
- the document scanning system can obtain detailed information about the nature and location of any obstruction to the face of document 26 .
- multiple matrices of detection devices can be stacked vertically in relation to the page surface, and/or the detection devices in a single matrix can be distributed at different heights, thereby enabling detection of obstructions anywhere between the page surface and the image capturing cameras.
- scanning lasers could be used instead of, or in addition to, a static array of lasers such as that shown in FIG. 4 .
- other mechanisms could be used to gather three-dimensional information.
- incomplete three-dimensional information obtained by, e.g., one or more ultrasonic, laser, and/or auto-focus range finding devices can be combined with a model of an idealized document (e.g., book) to determine whether potential obstructions are present between the document's surface and the imaging camera(s).
- the scanning system can determine whether the distance to the closest object detected by the range finding device(s) is less than the distance to the hypothesized surface of a properly positioned model book.
- the detection of an object within the predefined range could indicate a potential error condition that might comprise the effectiveness of the imaging process.
- Such a technique need not involve a high degree of signal processing—simply examining the output of the range finder could suffice—yet can be quite effective in detecting a wide-range of obstructions or other error conditions, such as an operator's hand, a page that has not settled into its proper position, an oversized document, a wrinkled or distorted page, and the like.
- FIG. 5 An example of such an arrangement is shown in FIG. 5 .
- a model of an idealized book 70 is used by the document scanning system's signal processing logic to interpret the data obtained by scanning range-finding laser 80 .
- Laser 80 preferably collects its data at approximately the same time as imaging camera 82 captures the image of an actual document 72 .
- a potential error condition may be detected, for example, if the distance detected by the range-finding laser 80 at a particular point is less than the distance from the laser to the outline of the idealized book 70 at that point.
- the operator's hand 78 blocks laser beam 60 from reaching the document 72 .
- the system detects this obstruction by comparing the length of ray 60 to the distance between laser 80 and the idealized book 70 at that angle.
- any of a variety of techniques could be used to gather the spatial data used to detect error conditions during the imaging process, non-limiting examples of which include, stereo, trinocular, and other multi-camera arrangements; scanning laser range finders; simple laser range finders; ultrasonic range finders; auto-focus range determination technology; sparse point maps; and/or the like.
- FIG. 6 shows a detailed block diagram of an illustrative document scanning system.
- scanning system 600 may include a processor 602 , system memory 604 , one or more cameras 610 for capturing document images, one or more devices 612 for collecting three-dimensional spatial information, a mechanism 614 (e.g., a flash, array of lamps, etc.) for controlling the lighting of the document surface, an apparatus 616 for turning document pages automatically, and a bus 618 for connecting the aforementioned elements.

- DSP digital signal processing
- the functionality shown in FIG. 6 could be distributed amongst multiple systems (e.g., image data could be sent to a remote location for application of OCR, indexing, and storage).
- FIG. 6 is provided for purposes of illustration and not limitation.
