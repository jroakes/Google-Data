Abstract
Allowing adaptation to property of communication system order is determined, for example, in the Current standards that not clear and definite power adjustment can be used, it can indicate that the order 2 in the case of the transmission of order 1 is transmitted under the feedback model of support, for example, due to big dynamic range of signals, or due to flooding the signal received by UE from another BS antenna port by the UE signals received from base station (BS) antenna port, user equipment (UE) is restricted to report the channel of order 1.By using antenna port Power Control one by one at service UE BS, communication system allows UE to realize that order 2 is transmitted in this case.In one embodiment, BS controls order to determine by signaling transmission power or power excursion relevant parameter at UE, determines and feeds back for sum of ranks configured transmission.
Description
Technical field
The present invention relates generally to wireless communication system, more particularly to such as geographical separate antenna or spaced antenna have
Order adjustment in OFDM (OFDM) communication system of multiple transmission point.
Background technology
By especially improving cell edge UE performance, coordinate multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception is proposed as meeting 3GPP
What (third generation Partnership Program) LTE senior (LTE-A) was required is expected to technology.In CoMP operation, multiple transmission/receiving point cooperation
Launch to one or more user equipmenies (UE) or received from one or more user equipmenies (UE), to improve performance, especially
Be for those in case of a downlink, if they are uncooperative, will be seen from significantly dry from some transfer points
The UE disturbed.From the perspective of downlink, referred to as transfer point (TP) is typicallyed represent (is referred to as the eNodeB in LTE by base station
Or eNB) in scheduler control radio unit.Base station can control single TP, in this case, TP and base station or
ENB is identical.In this case, CoMP operation refers to the situation for having cooperation between eNB.In another network infrastructure
In, base station or eNB can control multiple transmission point (TP), and it is commonly known as radio unit or satellite head end.In this feelings
Under condition, naturally-occurring is easier to realize by the cooperation between TP, because they are controlled by the hub scheduler in eNB.
Generally, CoMP technologies refer to that the coordination mechanism of wide scope, including interference are avoided.A kind of such technology is joint
The technology of transport-type, wherein, it is used together the antenna from two or more TP in being transmitted to UE multiple antennas (MIMO).
More generally, it may be considered that the deployment of spaced antenna type, wherein can come from the day being geographically distributed to the transmission of terminal
Line.Obviously, the difference with traditional MIMO operation is, antenna is not necessarily put altogether.
In some network designs, TP can be put altogether, in this case, connect them to single eNB very feasible.
One example is known three sectors/cells deployment, wherein single eNB has 3 coverages, referred to as sector or cell.One
In a little other deployments, TP can be geographically separated, in this case, and they can be by the eNB that separates or by single eNB
Control.In the former case, TP is generally under the control of separation scheduler, and separation scheduler can be assisted in the way of equity
Make.The different types of eNB may with different transimission powers constitutes so-called heterogeneous network.Geography is being controlled by single eNB
In the case of the TP of upper separation, commonly referred to as the TP of remote radio unit (RRU) or long distance wireless head end (RRH) is via optical fiber
It is connected to single eNB, and hub scheduler control/coordination whole TP.
Each TP, either puts or geographical separation, can form the logic district of its own altogether, or multiple TP can
To form single logic district.For user equipment (UE) angle, cell be defined as UE receive from it data and to
It launches the logic entity of data, in other words, " service " UE.Service UE cell is referred to as " serving cell ".Covered by logic entity
The geographic area of lid is sometimes referred to as cell, such as the UE for referring to cell edge, to describe to be positioned over edges of regions
During UE.Cell generally has related cell identifier (cell ID).Cell ID is generally used for specifying unique for cell
Pilot signal (also referred to as reference signal), and to being transmitted into " attachment " in the UE of the cell (namely by the cell serves)
Data are scrambled.
In conventional non-CoMP multiple antennas (MIMO) operation, as UE serving cell single TP based on the chain to UE
The quality that connects adjusts configured transmission.In this so-called " the link adjustment " that is generally used in Modern wireless communication, UE is needed
The channel quality of the traditionally hypothesis data transfer from single subdistrict is estimated for non-CoMP operation.Channel quality is generally represented
For the modulation that can be received by UE and compilation scheme (MCS), its error probability is no more than specific threshold.UE can also feedback space
Some recommendations of configured transmission, such as transmit order instruction (RI), pre-coding matrix index (PMI) etc..In CoMP operation, come
The link condition for adapting to be seen by UE is also required to from the transmission of multiple points.
We will describe configuration and their making in a communications system of various reference signals (or pilot signal) now
With.UE relies on the pilot signal (also referred to as reference signal (RS)) sent from serving cell, for channel estimation and for reporting
Accuse back eNB channel quality measurement.Generally, entered using the specific sequence pair reference signals of cell ID of the special services cell
Row scrambling.In order to estimate channel and carry out channel quality measurement, eNB, which must have, enables UE to estimate channel and also measure
The mechanism of interference.Realize by the General Mechanism of UE channel estimation be allow eNB inherently sounding channel each transmitting day
Line pilot signal transmitted.Pilot signal is the waveform or sequence that both transmitter and receiver are both known about.In OFDMA system,
Pilot signal is generally corresponding with the pilot frequency sequence that time-frequency resources key element (RE) collection in time/frequency grid closes, its
Middle element of resource is the subcarrier in OFMD transmission.Then UE will be calculated by entering row interpolation and noise suppression using pilot signal
Channel estimation at each sub-carrier positions, and measurement channel quality.In addition for the purpose of coherent demodulation, also needed at UE
Pilot signal is wanted to construct " effective " channel.The efficient channel corresponding with UE one or more data flows or layer is connecing for UE
The channel for precoding/beam forming that device is effectively seen is received, applied to the data modulated signal at receiver.
In the version 8 and 9 of 3GPP LTE standards, the shared or specific reference signal of cell (CRS) (also, in version
In 10, channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS), (the CSI-RS ports in version 10) corresponding with the set of CRS ports)
Sent from eNB, and the whole UE that be used in the cell of eNB services.CRS ports can be with the physical antenna set at eNB
Or it is corresponding by the virtual-antenna set of the eNB whole UE observables serviced.These RS can be used for channel estimation, and channel is estimated
Count for channel quality and/or for space feedback measurement.UE can calculate and report the recommendation PMI from predefined code book,
And association RI and CQI (channel quality information, or indicate) feedbacks be provided, for by the aggregate transfer rate (or total CQI) at UE
Maximize.
Design LTE system and set up test case mainly by such implicit assumption：The day represented by CRS/CSI-RS
Line end mouthful is put altogether.In these cases, transmitting eNB is also assumed to equally divide power between different antenna ports.
In addition, because antenna port is assumed to put altogether, it is desirable to the almost phase of the mean receiving power in UE from each port
Together.Therefore, code book and CSI feedback mode are defined based on these implicit behaviors.But, in CoMP communication system, in order to
The RRU/RRH (such as two immediate RRU/RRH) and corresponding antenna port that UE is transmitted and selected may have difference
Path loss.That is, the signal from each RRU/RRH antenna ports can be propagated on entirely different path
And/or UE can be compared to another more closely close to a RRU/RRH antenna port, result is that UE can be compared to another
The antenna port of individual selection sees much bigger power from the antenna port of a selection.In small cell or indoor deployment
In the case of such case it is especially true, wherein UE may be very close to one of antenna.In this case, UE channel square
Battle array possible condition is not enough, there is an overriding singular value, and order 1 can be reported as preferred rank by UE.But, if from two
The SNR (signal to noise ratio) of individual antenna port is big, then service network will expect that UE supports the order 2 under high SNR.Due to passing through UE's
Undesirable order adjustment, this problem will significantly reduce gain, because may to be lowered about 50% so much for peak rate.
Therefore, when can by multiple geographically discrete transfer points or antenna port to service UE when, it is necessary to correctly
Determine sum of ranks PMI.

Having stated pilot signal particularly CSI reference signals (CSI-RS) may in the communication system 100 according to various embodiments of the invention
In the OFDMA PRB pairs 540 of use and the exemplary distribution in subframe 530.Here by term " pilot signal " and " reference

Which element of resource (RE) distribute to CSI reference signals (CSI-RS).CSI reference signal configurations are used to represent to can be used for launching
The resource collection (RE in ofdm system) of the CSI-RS set corresponding with the group of one or more transmitting antennas.It is based on
The version 10 of LTE specification describes exemplary operation.In the form of current version 10 of 3GPP LTE specifications, for given number
Transmitting (BS) antenna port of (or group), limits multiple CSI reference signal configurations, and BS can select one of them effective
Configuration.As it is used herein, the reference to transmit antenna port is to represent BS days for transmission signal on the uplink
Line end mouthful.For example, and Referring now to Figure 5, describing exemplary CSI by the packet of two emitting antennas port with reference to letter
Number configuration.Each port is re-used to [0,1] by time domain CDM (code division multiplexing).It is this to [0,1] correspond to it is simple
Two antenna ports (such as " 0 " and " 1 ") of two corresponding reference elements (521) are shared in CDM codes [1,1] and [1, -1].Such as
Find out in Figure 5, at UE, potential 20 CSI reference signal configurations can be configured (respectively with a pair of sign (0,1)
Resource element is usually represented, for example, the measurement being used for 521) any one on two antenna ports at UE.PRB pair 540
Also include the non-CSI-RS pilot signals being distributed in the control area 531 of PRB pair and/or user data area 532.For example,
The shade RE of PRB pair 540 is preserved for other reference symbols, that is, distributes to other reference symbols, or shares ginseng
Examine signal (CRS), or DRS (Dedicated Reference Signal) (DRS).These other reference signals can occur, but not necessarily pass through
UE in LTE-A communication systems is used for channel estimation or interferometry.
CSI-RS configuration natures described in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 to having 2 respectively, the BS of 4 or 8 transmit antenna ports has
Effect.For example, the exemplary CSI-RS configurations of packet of Fig. 6 descriptions with 4 transmit antenna ports.That is, in figure 6,
Two CDM RE are configured (by the config set redefined to (0,1) and (2,3) (not necessarily adjacent to each other) by single CSI-RS
Share in 4 transmit antenna ports) it is mapped, and corresponding to 4 antenna ports.By another example, Fig. 7 descriptions have 8
The exemplary CSI-RS configurations of the packet of individual transmit antenna port.That is, in the figure 7,4 CDM RE to (0,1), (2,
3), (4,5) and (6,7) (not necessarily adjacent to each other) is mapped by the single CSI-RS configurations corresponding with 8 antenna ports.
As shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, when to set up CSI-RS reference signals with 2, the 4 and 8 corresponding UE of antenna port,
One in 20,10 and 5 available configurations can be used respectively.Generally, conveyed by the signaling of higher with it is specific
BS or specific transmission point or multiple BS or the information of the corresponding one or more CSI-RS configurations of multiple transmission point.Such as
Shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the CSI-RS corresponding with antenna port is distributed into the resource element in user data area 532
(RE) it is right, more specifically, distribute to a RE in associated with OFDM symbol 506-507,510-511 and 513-514
It is right.In addition as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, an antenna can be corresponding with 20 CSI reference signal configurations possible 20
Launch CSI-RS in any one of individual RE pairs.Generally, in being transmitted in single subdistrict, only up to 4 CSI-RS RE couple, therefore
8 RE are needed altogether to support maximum to be up to maximum 8 transmitting antennas.
CoMP or joint MIMO operation in, it is as briefly described above, be connected to one or more BS one or more TP and
Corresponding antenna port can be cooperated to be transmitted into UE.In joint transmission (JT), federated service UE transmit antenna port set
(being typically the TP or RRU associated with identical Central Base Station Controllers or BS) can combine transmitting data and reference symbol
(RS), such as CSI-RS, it is intended that for UE.Currently, 3GPP LTE standards are equal between different antenna ports there is provided BS
Ground transmission power, that is to say, that each such antenna port is launched with identical transmission power level to UE.But, BS can
To set up CSI-RS so that by CSI-RS configure conveying corresponding antenna port can with the antenna that is geographically separated or point
Cloth antenna is corresponding.
Based on the RS received, such as CSI-RS, UE determines channel status, that is to say, that performs CSI and calculates.For
2X2MIMO examples, the signal model used by UE in CSI calculating is as follows,
Y=HVs+n
Wherein, Y is the signal received, that is to say, that yiIt is i-th in UE (here using two reception (UE) antennas)
The signal that individual antenna is received, H is on 2 BS reference signal antenna ports, in UE (also referred to as UE, or reception, day
Line end mouthful) the 2X2 channel matrixes that are measured by 2 (that is, wherein i=1,2) reception antennas of place, that is to say, that hijIt is i-th
Channel between individual UE (reception) antennas and j-th of BS (transmitting) antenna port, V is the precoder square applied to this transmission
Battle array, s is sign matrix, that is to say, that siIt is i-th of transmitting symbol at BS, and n is with variances sigma2AWGN, also
It is to say, niIt is the signal y received in i-th of UE antennaiThe noise included.In this model, symbol s is implicitly assumed that1
And s2It is the equal power that series is normalized from unit power, and for convenience's sake, actual transmissions work(is caught in itself in H
Rate and channel effect.
Above-mentioned equation can equally be write as
Wherein, ρjIt is " transmission power " for the signal launched on j-th of BS (transmitting) antenna port.The latter equation is caught
Expression is for the power in each transmit antenna portChannel dependent equivalent equation (being equal to previous equation) (work as
Under preceding standard convention, unification (unity) is assumed).It is unified to represent by equally distributing to each day as reference
The BS transmittings of the transmission power of line.
Now, for UE, it is assumed that the separation of BS antennas and position and corresponding antenna port are so that average channel increases
Benefit is distinguished as 10dB between BS antennas (being in this example 2).Then above-mentioned signal model can be rewritten as
Wherein, | | H (:,1)||2It is the letter for the signal launched via BS (transmitting) antenna 1 (and corresponding antenna port)
Road gain, and | | H (:,2)||2It is the channel for the signal launched via BS (transmitting) antenna 2 (and corresponding antenna port)
Gain.Approximately it is because it is assumed that factor ρ2h12v21,ρ2h22v21,ρ2h12v22And ρ2h22v22It is relatively small and can ignore.Due to UE
Receive and damage and limited precision/bit width or receiver dynamic range, it is this approximately can be intrinsic in UE receivers
Ground occurs.In other words, descending factors can be compared with other noise items (such as quantizing noise) in receiver.
This is substantially the equation of the channel of order 1, that is to say, that as long as considering UE (reception device) processing accuracy.Pass through
Floating point precision simultaneously uses ideal receiver, can obtain order 2；But, due to big dynamic range of signals and the reception of association
Device is damaged, and channel is approximately order 1.Obviously, in this case, UE (reception device) can recommend order 1 to transmit.
But, if it is further assumed that, in the signal that two UE antennas are received from two BS antennas, SNR
(signal to noise ratio) is high, that is to say, that
So in this case, due to the limitation of channel and in the UE equal transmission powers made it is assumed that order is limited
1 is made as, independent of SNR (signal to noise ratio).It is noted that this be substantially due to self-interference from the transmission to UE and by UE from
The signal that one of BS antenna ports are received floods the signal received by UE from other BS antenna ports.
However, when indicating that order 1 is transmitted in this case, for the angle of capacity, the transmission of order 2 is probably desired
(and being possible), because meeting the power constraint at transmitter.For the determination of allowing adaptation to property order and in this case
Order 2 transmit and (wherein support UE Current standards to be restricted to report order 1 channel), communication system 100 is by for UE's
BS uses antenna port Power Control one by one, it is allowed to which UE realizes that order 2 is transmitted.A kind of mode is by suitably logical with signal to UE
Know transmission power or power excursion relevant parameter, determined and feedback for the UE sum of ranks configured transmissions for being used for recommending.
Referring now to Fig. 8, shown logical flow chart 800 is illustrated according to various embodiments of the invention, passes through communication system
The method of 100 order adjustment.When such as BS110-113 and 200 UE from service BS to such as UE101-103 launch (804),
And UE closes reception known reference signal (RS), such as during pilot signal, logic in two or more transmit antenna port collection
Flow 800 starts (802).In addition, BS launches (806) to UE, and UE is received for two or more antenna port sets
The configuration of first power excursion is indicated, that is to say, that what the first power excursion for two or more antenna port sets was configured
Indicate.Power excursion configuration used herein represents the power corresponding with each antenna port of two or more antenna ports
Offset collection.The configuration of this first power excursion indicates that one or more candidate powers of multiple possible power excursions can be used
Offset to represent, wherein each candidate power offset applications are in one or more antenna ends of two or more antenna port sets
Mouthful.For example, in such embodiment of the present invention, BS can be explicitly indicated the configuration of the first power excursion.In addition, can be by
The configuration of first power excursion is explicitly indicated as suitable for the first transmission rank, and for example (but the first transmission rank can also be exactly order 2
Order 1), or the configuration unrelated with order can be indicated as.
Indicated based on the RS received and the configuration of the first power excursion, UE determines that (808) are applied to pass for the first of UE
The first set configured transmission of defeated order.In addition, being configured based on the RS received and the second power excursion, UE determines that (810) are applicable
In the second set configured transmission of the second transmission rank for UE, for example, order 1 (still, if the first transmission rank is order 2, then
Second transmission rank can also be exactly order 2；Those skilled in the art will appreciate, here to the first transmission rank and the second transmission rank
The reference of each can be any transmission rank, as long as they are different transmission ranks).Similar to the configuration of the first power excursion,
Second power excursion can be configured to associated with one or more candidate powers skew of multiple power capabilities skew, wherein each
Candidate power offset applications are in one or more antenna ports of two or more antenna port sets.For example, first set is passed
Defeated parameter and second set configured transmission can include one or more pre-coding matrix ropes for being applied to correspondence transmission rank respectively
Draw (PMI) and CQI.The configuration of second power excursion can be fixed predetermined power offset configuration, may not be.In the present invention
One embodiment in, BS can also via downlink signaling to UE indicate the second power excursion configuration.Downlink signaling
It can be the signaling of higher level, such as MAC (media access control) or RRC (radio resource control) signaling, or can be
Signaling based on dynamic PDCCH (physical downlink control channel).In an alternative embodiment of the invention, UE can be determined voluntarily
Second power excursion is configured.
Then, UE is conveyed (812) to BS, and BS is received from UE, is passed with first set configured transmission and second set
The associated channel information of one or more of defeated parameter.In one embodiment of the invention, in transport channel information,
UE can select a preferred transmission rank of conduct in the first transmission rank and the second transmission rank, and convey preferred transmission rank to BS
Indicate, and suitable for the configured transmission of preferred transmission rank, that is, preferred configured transmission.In another embodiment of the present invention
In, the PMI that preferably configured transmission includes, that is, preferred PMI can based on instruction or determination be used for associate transmission
The power excursion configuration of order.For example, it is preferable to which PMI can be selected from code book or the subset selected from code book, at least the one of UE is maintained at
In individual storage arrangement, and wherein preferred PMI is based on the power excursion configuration for preferred transmission rank for indicating or determining
Selection.Then logic flow 800 terminates (814).
In one embodiment, UE may be configured to report first during with very first time example or multiple examples to BS
The corresponding preferred configured transmission of power excursion (for example, relative to reference antenna port), such as CQI and/or preferred PMI and
Order, and the preferred configured transmission that the second power excursion during with the second time example or multiple examples is corresponding, such as CQI
And/or preferably PMI and order.For example, by higher level signaling, can by including the first power excursion and the second power excursion can
The power excursion set of energy is signaled to UE, and is stored in UE at least one storage arrangement 304, or can be pre-
Determine and be maintained in UE at least one storage arrangement 304.Possible power excursion set may include that 0dB is (inclined without power
The situation of shifting), and it is possible to the difference in path loss that can be between antenna port is corresponding, and power excursion is quantified
(for example, being quantified as hithermost 1dB).In another embodiment, for example, UE can be according to possible power excursion set come really
Fixed appropriate power excursion, and report determination/selection power excursion (or instruction of the power excursion of determination/selection) and
Configured transmission (for example, CQI, PMI) and (for example, by the throughput-maximized of UE) is best suitable under current channel condition
In UE order.In addition, based on the RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) reported recently, can determine that path is damaged for antenna port
Lose.
For example, in the explanation of the principle of the invention, it is considered to the signal model of modification, wherein via the first BS (transmitting) day
Line end mouthful is transmitted to the transmission power of UE signal by BS with being transmitted to UE by BS via the 2nd BS (transmitting) antenna port
Signal transmission power between have 10dB power excursion.In other words, BS applications 10dB transmission power offsets to compensate letter
Difference in road propagation loss, that is to say, that in path loss, that is to say, that due to launching from the 2nd BS antenna ports
Signal channel gain compensation in, that is to say, that BS antenna ports 2 are than from the first BS antenna ports (i.e. BS antenna ports
1) with the small 10dB of the channel gain of the signal of equal-wattage horizontal emission.That is, BS regulations are launched via BS antenna ports 1
Signal transmission power ρ1For the transmission power ρ compared to the signal that UE is transmitted to from BS antenna ports 22Small 10dB, compensation warp
The signal that UE is transmitted to by BS antenna ports 2 experienced compared to the big 10dB of signal that UE is transmitted to via BS antenna ports 1
Path loss.Under equation form, by this transmission power adjustment, the channel between BS and UE can be expressed as
Obviously, this is the channel of order 2 (it is assumed that channel is not degenerated) between BS and UE, because the ratio of the power received
It is equal, that is to say, that
In other words, by actually reducing the transmitting work(on one in transmit antenna port (such as BS antenna ports 1)
Rate, can obtain higher capacity.More generally, this power excursion is not necessarily exactly equal to the channel increasing from antenna port
Imbalance in benefit, but can contribute to improve system speed any value (or, in this example, support order 2 pass
It is defeated).
Under the 3GPP LTE standards that there is currently, UE is not necessarily reduced using this power in their operations.In order to prop up
This other antenna port, or TP are held, transmission power is adjusted in each of the multiple antenna port/TP launched to identical UE
Section, other antenna port/TP relative to multiple antenna port/TP, by multiple antenna port/TP one or more places
Using the transmission power of reduction, the flexibility that communication system 100 allows UE and has selection more high-transmission order (surpasses for example, order 2 is transmitted
Cross order 1 to transmit).More particularly, communication system 100 allows UE to be passed on to service BS for one or more antenna port/TP's
The instruction of power excursion, so as to allow UE to select higher transmission rank, and instructs BS different in different antenna ports/TP applications
Transmission power.
Referring now to Fig. 9, shown logical flow chart 900 is illustrated according to various other embodiments of the invention, passes through communication
The method of the order adjustment of system 100.When such as UE101-103 UE is received from such as BS110-113 and 200 service BS
(904) known reference signal corresponding with two or more transmit antenna port set (RS), such as during pilot signal, logic
Flow 900 starts (902).Based on the RS received, UE determines the configuration of (906) first power excursions and suitable for for UE's
First transmission rank (for example, order 1) and the first set configured transmission of the first power excursion configuration.In addition, based on the RS received
And configured for the second power excursion of two or more antenna port sets, UE determines that (908) are applied to for UE
The second set configured transmission of two transmission ranks (for example, order 2).For example, first set configured transmission and second set configured transmission
The one or more PMI and CQI for being applied to correspondence transmission rank can be included respectively.
First power excursion is configured and the second power excursion configure can respectively with one of multiple possible power excursions or
Multiple candidate power skews are associated, wherein each candidate power offset applications are in one of two or more antenna port sets
Or multiple antenna ports.In addition, the configuration of the second power excursion can include the predetermined work(of the fixation associated with the second transmission rank
Rate deviant, can not also include.In an embodiment of the invention, BS can via downlink signaling to UE indicate the second work(
Rate offset configuration.Downlink signaling can be the signaling of higher, such as MAC or RRC signaling, or can be based on dynamic
PDCCH signaling.In an alternative embodiment of the invention, UE can voluntarily determine the configuration of the second power excursion and/or the second power
Offset configuration can be the default power offset configuration kept in UE at least one storage arrangement 304 by UE, latter
In the case of, default power offset configuration can correspond to identical on each antenna port of two or more antenna port sets
Power excursion.
Then, UE is conveyed (910) to BS, and BS is received from UE, is transmitted with first set configured transmission and second set
The associated channel information of one or more of parameter.In addition, UE can convey the letter of (912) first power excursions configuration
Breath, that is, configuration parameter.Then, logic flow 900 terminates (914).When conveying configured transmission set, UE can select the
A preferred transmission rank of conduct in one transmission rank and the second transmission rank, and convey the set of transmission parameters suitable for preferred transmission rank
Close.In addition, being discussed more fully below, the configured transmission set conveyed from UE to BS may include PMI and power excursion index, also
It is to say, the multiple power kept at least one storage arrangement 304,404 by each BS and UE kinds individually compiled are inclined
The index of the list of shifting, or, the configured transmission set conveyed from UE to BS, which may include to be combined, is compiled as single joint compiling
Pre-coding matrix index PMI and power excursion index, for preferred transmission rank.
Referring to Figure 10, shown logical flow chart 1000 is illustrated according to another embodiment of the present invention, passes through communication system
The method of the order adjustment of system 100.When such as BS110-113 and 200 service BS is indicated to such as UE101-103 UE
(1004), that is, transmitting is indicated, and UE is received from BS and indicated, i.e. the antenna port for being configured for the measurement by UE
During the first power excursion configuration of set, logic flow 1000 starts (1002).In an embodiment of the invention, it is by UE's
The antenna port set for measuring and configuring can be two or more the CSI-RS ports configured for information feedback；
But, can be in order to UE for the antenna port set that is configured from UE measurement in other embodiments of the invention
Any antenna port for transmitting and configuring.The configuration of first power excursion corresponds to the skew of one or more candidate powers, wherein often
Individual candidate power offset applications are in one or more antenna ports of antenna port set, for example, in the every of antenna port set
Relative transmission power is used on individual antenna port, and wherein, the configuration of the first power excursion is applied to the first transmission rank, such as order
1.Preferably, antenna port set include for from UE information feedback (one in such as RI, PMI and CQI or
It is multiple) and the CSI-RS ports of configuration.
In addition, BS is configured based on the first power excursion configuration for antenna port set and the second power excursion, such as
By the feedback from UE, (1006) such as one or more of RI, PMI and CQI channel information is obtained.Then, logic flow
Journey 1000 terminates (1008).The configuration of second power excursion corresponds to the skew of one or more candidate powers, wherein each candidate's work(
Rate offset applications are in one or more antenna ports of antenna port set, for example, in each antenna end of antenna port set
Relative transmission power is used on mouth, and wherein, the configuration of the second power excursion is applied to the second transmission rank, such as order 2.Second work(
Rate offset configuration can indicate from BS to UE, can also not.For example, in one embodiment of the invention, BS can be under
Line link signaling indicates the configuration of the second power excursion to UE.Downlink signaling can be the signaling of higher, such as MAC or
RRC signaling, or can be the signaling based on dynamic PDCCH.In another embodiment of the invention, UE can voluntarily determine second
Power excursion is configured.
Referring now to Figure 11 there is provided logical flow chart 1100 illustrate according to various embodiments of the invention, configuration day
The method performed during line end mouthful certain power skew by the BS of communication system 100.It is any as such as BS110-113 and 200
The BS of one is associated with BS each antenna port, measures any one being serviced UE of (1104) from such as UE101-103
During the uplink signal received, logical flow chart 1100 starts (1102).In another embodiment of the invention, BS can be with
Alternative additionally from UE receives (1106) uplink signal, including by UE from the report of the intensity of the BS signals received
Accuse, RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) reports of the signal intensity received such as measured in one or more UE antenna ports
Accuse.Based on the uplink signal (multiple signals) received, (BS antenna ports are specific for the configuration of BS configuration (1108) power excursions
Power excursion), such as each transmission rank for one or more transmission ranks, such as order 1 and/or order 2, then logic flow
Journey 1100 terminates (1110).BS, which can configure multiple power excursions, is used for specific order.
It is noted that in this example, power excursion configuration is preferably specific or special rank, because if by identical
The order 1 (as order 2) that configuration (having less power on one in antenna port) is used in above example is then right
Capacity is reduced in order 1, this is not desired result.
More generally, or other purposes are passed through BS and configured using the power excursion of rank correlation.For example, can make
The balance of speed and power is realized with the power excursion configuration of rank correlation.More specifically, BS may tend to launch in order 2,
But only when the increase of transmission power is no more than some value.In this case, BS can draw the information from UE feedbacks, wherein
UE feeds back the CQI/PMI information of the different sets for each sum of ranks correspondence power excursion configuration (can be configured by BS).
In discussion herein, the power excursion of antenna or power excursion handling capacity are joined to antenna port and one by one
Examine.It is to be understood, however, that the concept of power excursion used herein can easily be generalized to the group of antenna port.For example, working as shape
Subsets into whole configuration ports of antenna port group geographically may be put altogether, and more likely equally sharing power
When, the power excursion of antenna port may be applicable.
Referring now to Figure 12 there is provided logical flow chart 1200 illustrate according to another embodiment of the present invention, provide use
The method performed when the feedback for the power excursion configuration that order is adjusted by the UE of communication system 100.In this case, BS can be with
Feedback of the clear request to the preferred transmission rank of multiple transmission ranks.When such as UE101-103 any one UE is from such as
When BS110-113 and 200 any one BS receptions (1204) preferably transmit order instruction, logical flow chart 1200 starts
(1202).Then for the preferred transmission rank indicated by the preferred transmission order instruction by reception, UE determines that (1206) pass through this
Order assumes the maximized PMI of data transfer rate (pre-coding matrix index), CQI (channel quality information or designator) and power is inclined
Move configuration.Then, UE is to service BS conveyings (1208), for the PMI/CQI/APO (antennas with being determined by UE for the transmission rank
Port power offset configuration) the corresponding multiple transmission ranks of information preferred transmission rank, then logic flow 1200 terminate
(1210)。
In one embodiment of the invention, power excursion configuration may include the relative work(represented on each antenna port
Rate is offset, it is, relative to the peak power of each antenna port.In those embodiments of the invention, UE can be drawn
Conclusion, certain power skew (causes to normalize total transmission signal power<1, therefore transmitting is less than possible maximum transmission power about
Beam) it is enough to realize the MCS (modulation and compilation scheme) of recommendation, and can be that antenna port power is inclined one by one for the recommendation of each order
Move.
In other embodiments of the invention, communication system 100 can be using the PMI code books extended, wherein the PMI extended
Code book is to be extended to the PMI code books including power excursion.In current code book, the precoder from code book can be expressed as
Wherein entry v11,v12,v21And v22It is same order (permanent mould).For example for two (2) transmitting (BS) antenna ends
The extension code book of mouth can be presented below as, and wherein at least is for some entry ρ1≠ρ2,
In one suchembodiment, the PMI code books of extension can be designed to pre-coding matrix index (PMI) value
vijAnd power excursion ρiIt is separately encoded.As an example, for four (4) transmitting (BS) antenna ports, using existing four
Individual transmitting (BS) antenna port code book, wherein each PMI value is associated with four (4) bit modes, represents that code-book entry surpasses
Go out the scope of 16 possible code-book entries, then add the bit mode associated with power offset values in 4 PMI bits
Each collection close.If supporting four power levels, each transmit antenna port one, and each skew uses two
(2) bit, then need eight (8) bits altogether, is indicated from UE to service BS for each of two emitting antennas port
The deviant of port.Whether coding can also altogether be put depending on some transmit antenna ports.For from two (2) transfer points
(TP) joint transmission, for example, two RRH, each RRH have two (2) transmit antenna ports, each two port may only be needed
Want a skew.
In another such embodiment, by combined coding PMI value and power excursion, expansion can be more effectively designed
PMI code books are opened up, each entry wherein in code book is the value corresponding with the PMI value and power excursion of combined coding.By expanding
Coded system is opened up, BS can be used only codebook subset and limit to limit the selection of power excursion, while also allowing some at UE
Freely.Codebook subset limitation is currently supported to indicate in LTE specification, this enables BS to be limited to PIM report only referring to
Determine the subset (both can use in UE and BS) of available PMI entries in code book, this enables BS to control to a certain extent
PMI report.
In other embodiments of the invention, UE can switch between the first report configuration and the second report configuration, the
I.e. a report configuration UE reports PMI and CQI but the current feedback pattern without power excursion, in the second report configuration
UE recommend power excursion, that is, UE report also include recommend power excursion PMI/CQI/RI configuration feedback model (or
Person's extension code book includes the feedback model of power excursion).Although latter mode is more universal, it, which has, more additionally opens
Pin, and some UE may be suitable only for.
In above-mentioned more typically property embodiment, in such as UE101-103 UE use with such as BS110-113 and
The method of 200 BS communications, this method includes receiving the pilot signal corresponding with two or more antenna ports by UE, by UE
And based on pilot signal, it is determined that the configuration of the first power excursion and first set for two or more antenna port sets are passed
Defeated parameter, the default power offset configuration by UE and based on pilot signal and for two or more antenna port sets, really
Determine second set configured transmission, and conveyed and one in first set configured transmission and second set configured transmission from UE to BS
Individual or multiple associated information.
In one suchembodiment, UE can independently switch (so as to be provided to BS between the two report configurations
Two kinds of report), and report that this is cut using the report configuration designator of the order report configuration mode used by UE
Change.In the communication system 100, such as UE101-103 UE can refer to such as BS110-113 and 200 service BS reports
Show UE using which type of report configuration report configuration designator (its be referred to as precoding type designator or
PTI).For example, following form (form 1) is the exemplary of two report configurations (it is, Report Type) can using
Illustrate, that is, the first Report Type or configuration (report 1) and the second Report Type or configuration (report 2).UE can be selected independently
UE is selected by the Report Type of use or configuration, then by conveying report configuration designator to BS, the report of selection is indicated to BS
Type/configuration is accused, wherein this report configuration designator can be conveyed together with report, can also individually be conveyed.
Table 1
More generally, BS can indicate to be applied to both or each code book of the report of two individual multiplex by UE
Two values of subset limitation.
In another embodiment of the invention, it is not to use report configuration designator, UE can be together with order instruction (RI) one
Rise to BS and report power excursion (APO), wherein APO and RI are jointly encoded.This method is applied to power excursion and PMI not
Joint compiling, but separately encoded situation.This can be regarded as to the APO parts of two kinds of building forms, wherein pre-coding matrix
Sent infrequently, and the reality corresponding with traditional pre-coding matrix (pre-coding matrix namely with permanent mould entry)
PMI can continually be sent.For example, following table (table 2) illustrates showing for when two (2) antennas combined coding
Example, wherein UE reports order instruction (RI) (it is, order 1 or order 2) and APO (being encoded in following example [XY]) to BS.
Table 2：The antenna power of each antenna port offsets the coding of (APO), altogether 2 antenna ports
For example, being transmitted for the order 1 for being related to two BS antennas, APO [00] corresponds to uses identical on each antenna
Transmission power, APO [- 30] corresponds to the transmission power used on the first antenna and compares the transmitting work(used on the second antenna
Rate small 3dB, APO [0-3] correspond to the transmission power used on the second antenna and compare the transmitting work(used on the first antenna
Small 3dB of rate, etc..Then, UE can be encoded in above example and table 2 using rank correlation, and it is every that this allows to represent bit
The optimization of individual order.But, in more generally example, APO can be appointed as to referring to the antenna one by one of specific antenna port
Relative power offset, wherein relative power offset can be coded separately respectively.For example, for above-mentioned table 2, feed back in UE [-
30] in the case of, UE can only feed back the relative power offset of -3dB for first antenna port, and [0-3] is fed back in UE
In the case of, UE can only feed back the relative power offset of -3dB for the second antenna port.Alternatively, power excursion can
So that there is+3dB UE power excursions feedback (corresponding to the second antenna port) relative to first antenna port to indicate [- 30] ,-
3dB UE power excursions feed back to indicate [0-3].
Hypothesis UE discussed above can accurately measure the channel in downlink reference signal (RS), but UE determine by
The damage expected in demodulation, so relatively low order can only be supported, actually only allows UE to recognize the channel of order 1.In pilot signal
On when there is measurement error, especially for big individual signal dynamic range, when there is stronger channel, for UE
Weaker channel can not possibly be detected.Therefore, in this case, UE can only reliably recommend the transmission compared with low-rank, no matter
It feeds back the flexibility that additional power offset is used in hypothesis/precoding.Therefore, if UE has measurement error, then propose
Some schemes may not apply to.A kind of mode is to improve the reliability measured in UE, hence for the measurement observed at UE
Pilot tone dynamic range for be sane.
Some additional changes potentially contribute to solve this problem.Referring now to Figure 13 A and Figure 13 B, show that CSI-RS schemes
Case, wherein, in the adjacent OFDM symbol in the time, two CSI-RS ports quilts for two (2) transmit antenna ports
CDMization.As shown in figures 13 a and 13b, 4 CDM with CSI-RS ports are shown to eight corresponding (8) CSI-RS,
R1-R8, wherein, in time-frequency figure, CSI-RS is distributed in RE centerings.Signal is as Doppler effect caused by timing jitter and oozes
Leakage is such damage or other damage it could mean that with the second antenna port (with stronger antenna port share CDM to)
Corresponding weaker signal is not their locations accurately assessed, and UE obtains the channel estimation impaired on the height of secondary signal.
The order of UE report mistakes, or even wrong PMI can so be caused.
In one embodiment of the invention, BS can solve this problem by pre-compensating for unbalanced power, also
It is to say, reduces the power on one in CSI-RS ports, avoids damaging other CSI-RS ports.Note, in such case
Under, BS must indicate this UE particular offsets being applied on CSI-RS ports to UE so that UE is compensated in its feedback measurement
The skew (this can be indicated as a part for CSI-RS configurations).If for example, the initial normalized power on each port
It is [P1] for the power of [11], and the skew on CSI-RS ports, then UE may assume that the letter on an antenna port
Number can with it is elevated up to 1/P.In addition, for reference offset, BS can be offset using the antenna port one by one of rank correlation, as above
In the noted earlier of this programme, and similar feedback method can be used.
More generally, BS can use some Power Controls to pilot signal, to improve the measurement at UE devices.In addition,
BS can (can be partly applied to any work(in pilot tone by the implicit or clearly request measurement corresponding with skew
The function of rate control), or the part for allowing UE that APO is reported as to feedback report, to compensate this Power Control, both
Method has been described in above.
In another embodiment of the invention, by reconfiguring CSI-RS antenna ports, that is to say, that remap
CSI-RS ports so that the CSI-RS port corresponding with the antenna port being geographically separated can be assigned as so that they not
In CDM pairs of identical or identical OFDM symbol, BS can solve to be damaged demodulation performance caused by reference signal difference
The problem of.This may require the additional CSI-RS configurations of addition, or make it that CSI-RS configurations/mapping is flexible.Latter embodiment
Can be with expanded so that the antenna port being geographically separated can be mapped to non-conterminous CSI-RS ports (that is, not
By the CDM multiplexings on identical RE), and the antenna port only put altogether is mapped to CDM pairs.New by definition/additional
CSI-RS configuration or definition promote instruction of remapping, it is possible to achieve this point.Realize this one kind for promoting mapping
Method be can with CSI-RS reference signal configurations (length can be 2,4 or 8), multiple antenna ports (less equal than indicate
CSI-RS configurations in total port number) and each antenna port into the mapping function of the CSI-RS each positions configured
One be signaled to UE.
