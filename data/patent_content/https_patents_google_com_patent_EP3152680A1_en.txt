Definitions
- categorization of songs in the music space is limited to genres. For example, if a user wants to listen to rock or hip-hop, it can be relatively easy to find music in a specific genre. But in some cases a user may wish to define a different category of music, such as music appropriate for play while the user is at the gym, driving, or reading a book. Categories such as “gym music”, “reading music” and “driving music” may overlap with multiple genres, and songs in these categories can be difficult to tag on a song-by-song basis in an automatic way.
- a method may include receiving an indication of playback of a first song, by a first user, in a media application operating on a first device. It may be determined that a first content item is active on the first device during playback of the first song. An association may be stored of the first content item with the first song. Next, an indication may be received that the first content item is active on the first device. As a result, a second song associated with the first content item, based on the association of the first content item with the first song, may be recommended to the first user.
- a method may include determining that a first content item is active on a first device during playback of a first song, by a first user, in a media application operating on the first device. An association of the first content item with the first song may be stored. Next, an indication may be received that the first content item is active on a second device associated with a second user. As a result, a recommendation may be provided to the second user of a second song based on the association of the first content item with the first song, and the first song and the second song may have a common attribute.
- An implementation of the disclosed subject matter provides a system including a processor configured to receive an indication of playback of a first song, by a first user, in a media application operating on a first device. It may be determined that a first content items is active on the first device during playback of the first song. An associated may be stored of the first content item with the first song. Next, an indication that a first content item is active on the first device may be received. As a result, a recommendation may be provided to the first user of a second song associated with the first content item based on the association of the first content item with the first song.
- An implementation of the disclosed subject matter provides a system which includes means for receiving an indication of playback of a first song, by a first user, in a media application operating on a first device.
- the system may also include means for determining that a first content item is active on the first device during playback of the first song and means for storing an association of the first content item with the first song.
- the system may include means for receiving an indication that the first content item is active on the first device; and means for recommending, to the first user, a second song associated with the first content item based on the association of the first content item with the first song.
- Implementations of the disclosed subject matter provide techniques for improved music recommendations for a user based on content item (e.g., an application or website) usage data associated with the user.
- content item e.g., an application or website
- the present disclosure provides a technique for recommending music to a user based on one or more content items that are currently operating on the user's device.
- the disclosed system may store associations of song playback with content item usage and aggregate this data from multiple users. As a result, this data may be used to provide music recommendations to a user based on the specific content item that is currently active on the user's device.
- FIG. 1 shows an example process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows an example process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 3 shows an example information flow according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.

- Categorization of music in the music space is limited to genres. For example, if a user wants to listen to rock or hip-hop, it can be relatively easy to find music in those specific genres. But in some cases, a user may wish to listen to music that is tailored to the specific content item (e.g., an application, a website, and the like) operating on the user's device. For example, a user may want to listen to "gym" music while at the gym and using a fitness application. As another example, a user may want to listen to "driving" music while using a map or navigation application or a user may want to listen to music while reading a book using an e- reader application.
- the specific content item e.g., an application, a website, and the like
- Categories such as “gym music”, “reading music” and “driving music” may overlap with multiple genres of music, and songs in each of these categories can be difficult to tag on a song-by-song basis in an automatic way. Furthermore, recommending songs, perhaps from different genres, to a user of a particular content item can enhance the user's experience while using content items on his device.
- a media application operating on a user's device is typically connected to a media application provider which may provide songs and recommendations of songs to the user.
- a media application provider may provide song recommendations based on a user's actions within a media application. For example, if a user plays a song A, a media service provider may recommend another song B having similar attributes to song A based on the user's action (i.e., playing song A) in the media application.
- a user may listen to or prefer particular songs or a genre of songs while using certain applications (other than the media application) operating on the user's device.
- a content item may be an application, a website, a program, or any other similar content that may be active on a device.
- a content item such as a website may be active on a device if it is open in a browser on the device.
- a content item such as an application may be active on a device if is operating on the device.
- a content item may be active on a device if it is determined that the user of the device is interacting with the content item.
- a user may receive song recommendations that are more closely tailored to his current environment and activities and may result in an improved user experience. For example, Paul may prefer hip hop music and he may also use fitness applications, and it may be advantageous to recommend hip hop songs to Paul while a fitness application is active on his device.
- a media application provider may recommend hip hop songs to Paul that are listened to by other users of fitness applications.
- Tim may always listen to classical songs while using an e-reader application Bookbug.
- a media application provider may recommend classical songs to Tim when he activates a different e-reader application such as LibraryGeek on his device since LibraryGeek is in the same application category, i.e., e-reader application, as Bookbug.
- Sara may often play the puzzle gaming application 1983.
- a media application provider may recommend to Sara the most popular songs that are listened to by other users while playing the 1983 application or while playing other puzzle gaming applications.
- a song to which the user is listening may be associated with one or more content items that the user is currently interacting with on the device.
- This data may be stored at a user's device or at remote device (e.g., a cloud-based database) and may be provided to a central server (which may or may not be a separate entity from a media application provider) where song playback and content item usage information may be aggregated and received from multiple users.
- a song may be associated with the specific content item name and/or the category of content item that was active on the user's device during playback of the song.
- This association of a song with a content item and/or content item category can then be used to cluster songs together based on categorical content item usage and used to recommend songs to a user while the content item or another content item in the same category is active on the user's device.
- storing an association (e.g. tagging) of a song with a content item may include storing a history of all songs played on a device, song metadata (e.g., title, artist, album), and all of the foreground and background content items active on the device during playback of each song.
- song metadata e.g., title, artist, album
- all of the foreground and background content items active on the device during playback of each song may include storing a history of all songs played on a device, song metadata (e.g., title, artist, album), and all of the foreground and background content items active on the device during playback of each song.
- song metadata e.g., title, artist, album
- the user may activate a news reader application for the duration of the song.
- a listening history stream may be provided to a media application provider and may include an association of the song Heart with the news reader application and may include, for example, the song metadata, a timestamp in the song at which the news reader application was activated, the name of the application, and the category of application (e.g., news reader). Associations of songs and content items received from multiple devices may be stored, for example, in a table. This table may be pivotable on song, artist, genre, content item category, name of content item, etc. As a result, data in this table may sorted, filtered, and/or viewed in a way that allows for selection of a song to recommend to a user based on a content item that is active on a user's device and/or a user's music preference.
- this table could be used to generate a list of all songs played while the New4you application was active on multiple user devices and these songs may be sorted by play count.
- this table could be used to view which genre of music is over-represented in a specific content item category such as news reader applications versus all other applications or content item categories.
- associations of songs and content items may be subsequently used by a media application provider to recommend songs to the user and/or other users, for example, while the particular news reader application or another news reader application is active on a user's device.
- FIG. 1 shows an example process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- a media application and/or a media application provider may receive an indication of playback of a first song, by a first user, in a media application operating on a device, at 101.

- a coordinating application which may or may not be a component of the media application
- an association of the content item with the first song may be stored, at 103.
- the coordinating application may determine that the media application is operating on the device and may store and track a history of all songs played during the time period that a media application is operating on the device.
- the coordinating application may also store the foreground and background content items that are active on the device during the duration of the song along with a timestamp within the song of usage of each content item. For example, a user may be listening to the song Heart by Darkside and at a timestamp location of 01 :23 within the song, the user may launch and activate the application newsforme for the duration of the song. As a result, for example, the coordinating application may store the song metadata, the 01 :23 timestamp, the name of the application, "newsforme," and the content item category of news reader.
- song metadata e.g., title, artist, album, etc.
- the coordinating application may also store the foreground and background content items that are active on the device during the duration of the song along with a timestamp within the song of usage of each content item. For example, a user may be listening to the song Heart by Darkside and at a timestamp location of 01 :23 within the song, the user may launch and activate the application newsforme for the duration of
- storing an association of a content item with a song may include an identification of the song, an identification of an artist associated with the song, a genre associated with the song, an identification of the content item, and a content item category associated with the content item.
- the association of a content item with a song may be provided to a media application provider.
- Associations of content items with songs may be received from multiple devices on which a media application is operating. Associations of content items with songs may be stored in any format that may be used to indicate a relationship between a content item and a song. For example, a table, a hash table, a database, a song may be tagged to indicate that it is related to a content item, a content item may be tagged to indicated that it is related to a song, songs related to a particular content item may be categorized as such, content items related to a particular song may be categorized as such, and the like. As an example, a media application provider may receive and aggregate song and content item associations, and may store this information in a table.
- This table may be pivotable on song, artist, genre, content item category, name of content item, and any other data included in a stored association.
- data in this table may sorted, filtered, and/or viewed to allow for identification of a song to recommend to a user based on a content item that is active on a user's device and/or a user's music preference.
