The equation 2 and the compound of the equation 3 for the operation for describing driver for describing the operation of display describe.
Wherein transmission-type optical modulator sub-pixel 1136 and reflective light modulators sub-pixel 1138 are substantially different for design
There is practical (for example, cost) benefit in the display 1702 (for example, Figure 11,1100) that ground makes a response input voltage.For example,
As discussed, from the point of view of actually manufacturing viewpoint, the wall 1008 with variable thickness shown in Fig. 10 is on the contrary, it is intended to using scheming
The wall 1108 of substantially constant thickness shown in 11.However, as discussed above, under the situation of Figure 11, transmitted light
It is substantially different with the optical path length of reflected light, and this leads to reflective sub-pixel 1138 and transmissive sub-pixel 1136

They have different designs, as under the situation of Figure 14 and embodiment shown in figure 15.
Therefore, equation 2 is for transmission-type optical modulator sub-pixel 1136,1204,1304,1404,1504,1714 and reflection
It is different for type optical modulator sub-pixel 1138,1202,1302,1402,1502,1716.However, two kinds of sub- picture
