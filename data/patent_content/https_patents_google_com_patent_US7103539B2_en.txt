Definitions
- This invention relates in general to systems that reduce or remove perceptual distortion in distorted speech signals and, more specifically, to speech signals that have been reconstructed from a coded bit stream and that contain distortion resulting from the encoding-decoding process.
- the power spectrum of the reconstructed signal equals the power spectrum of the original signal minus the mean squared error.
- the signal reconstruction has lower energy than the original signal.
- the decrease in the power spectrum is proportionally strongest in regions of low energy. In other words, the energy of the spectral valleys decreases proportionally more than that of spectral peaks, thus emphasizing the spectral shape.
- the analysis and synthesis models are generally identical.
- the results of source coding theory for Gaussian signals motivate an emphasis of the spectrum of the reconstructed signal by means of a post-filter.
- the spectral structure of the signal is generally described by a set of signal-model parameters, and by filtering the output signal of the coder with an appropriate post-filter derived from the parameters, the spectral structure of the reconstructed signal can be emphasized.
- this emphasis can be performed separately for the spectral fine structure and for the spectral envelope.
- the emphasis of the output speech signal spectrum must be combined with an appropriate adjustment of the encoding.
- the perceptual weighting that is generally present in the encoder part of state-of-the-art speech coders must be adjusted to account for the post-filter.
- the combination of a modified encoder and a decoder with added post-filter approximates a coding structure that is optimal for Gaussian signals.
- State-of-the-art coded-speech enhancement systems can generally be traced back to the work of Ramamoorthy and Jayant (V. Ramamoorthy and N. S. Jayant, “Enhancement of ⁇ ADPCM ⁇ Speech by Adap-tive Postfiltering”, AT&T Bell Labs. Tech. J., 1465–1475, 1984), who introduced an adaptive post-filter structure for the enhancement of coded speech.
- this fine-structure post-filter is generally located prior to the autoregressive (AR) filter used to reconstruct the speech spectral envelope. Since the post-filter associated with the spectral fine structure has an implicit delay, the location of this post-filter results in a mismatch between the time location of the spectral envelope and the spectral fine structure. This problem can be mitigated with a solution described in publications by Kleijn (W. B. Kleijn, “Improved Pitch-period Prediction”, Proc.
- Post-filters have also been used in association with the well-known sinusoidal coders and waveform-interpolation coders. In these coders, the post-filtering is generally associated only with the spectral envelope. This is natural, since these coders have a particular structure that generally results in little perceived distortion being the result of noise signals located in the local spectral valleys. Instead, most of the perceived distortion results from distortion located in the global spectral valleys. Descriptions of these post-filtering methods can be found in R. J. McAulay and T. F. Quatieri, “Sinusoidal Coding”, in Speech Coding and Synthesis, W. B. Kleijn and K. K.

- the present invention pertains to speech-enhancement systems that have as input a distorted speech signal and as output an enhanced speech signal.
- the input to the speech enhancement system is the output of an encoder-decoder system.
- Speech signals are often subjected to distortion.
- Distortion in speech can be the result of, for example, additive environmental noise, nonlinear distortion in an electrical amplification system, and/or an encoding and decoding process.
- the distortion can be characterized by a difference signal resulting from subtracting the undistorted signal from the distorted signal.
- the difference signal we refer to the corrupting signal.
- any speech enhancement system is to reduce the subjective (perceptual) and/or objective (as evaluated by a mathematical formula) distortion in speech.
- An important class of distorted signals is the class of distorted signals that are produced from the output of a speech encoder-decoder system such as those used in voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) systems.
- VOIP voice over Internet protocol
- Such signals are referred to as coded speech signals or coded speech and serve as the distorted input signal to the speech enhancement system.
- the distortion in coded speech signals is generally speech signal dependent.
- the corrupting signal may have a higher energy in time intervals where the undistorted speech signal has higher energy.
- speech-signal-dependent corrupting signals are referred to as speech-correlated noise signals.
- speech-correlated noise signals are better perceptually masked during loud speech signal segments than during quieter speech signal segments, the corrupting signal present during sustained so-called voiced sounds (i.e., sounds with a significant nearly-periodic signal component, where that near-periodicity is produced by a characteristic oscillation of the vocal cords) is often an important contribution or the main contribution to the overall perceived distortion in the reconstructed speech signal.
- spectral fine structure which describes the relationship between spectral features nearby in frequency and the spectral envelope, which describes the relation between spectral features that are further apart in frequency.
- the spectral fine structure is related to local spectral features
- the spectral envelope is related to global spectral features.
- the global spectral features generally carry most of the linguistic information in speech. Local spectral features are what distinguishes regular speech from whispered speech, which is characterized by having no voiced speech. For voiced speech, the spectral fine structure contains harmonically spaced peaks (this harmonic structure corresponds to a nearly periodic time-domain structure).
- audible distortion in coded voiced speech is typically related to the spectral fine structure.
- This audible distortion is generally the result of the corrupting signal within the spectral valleys between harmonics, and often more so within the global spectral valleys, i.e., valleys of the spectral envelope. This type of distortion is often perceived similarly to an added white-noise signal.
- Reduction of the signal energy within the local spectral valleys can be an effective method of reducing the audible distortion in coded speech.
- modification of the spectral envelope so as to emphasize global spectral valleys and global spectral peaks, can be used to reduce the perceived distortion in coded speech.
- Conventional adaptive post-filter techniques developed for the enhancement of coded speech signals can be used to obtain reduction of the signal energy within the local spectral valleys for coded speech.
- Conventional adaptive post-filter techniques can also be used to emphasize the spectral envelope of coded speech.
- the adaptive post-filter is generally adapted on the basis of parameters that are used in the decoder.
- a noise-like and/or buzzy character remains.
- the remaining perceived distortion can be reduced further through modification of the spectral envelope so as to reduce the energy of the global spectral valleys that likely contain local spectral valleys that cause audible distortion.
- This action generally results in a less natural speech sound resulting from the distortion of the spectral envelope.
- This enhancement involves a trade-off between a noise-like or buzzy character of the reconstructed speech signal and the decrease in naturalness due to distortion of the spectral envelope.
- an enhancement signal that is the subtraction of the distorted input signal from the enhanced output signal.
- the relative power of the enhancement signal will vary strongly as a function of time. In certain time intervals the enhancement signal may have (too) much energy, and in others it may have (too) little.
- the enhancement operation settings usually form a heuristic compromise between such time regions. This is a result from the enhancement system operation being based on the input signal only, other than the signal power conservation that is used in many systems. In this sense, the operation of the enhancement system can be said to be open-loop. Other than the energy normalization, no feedback exists to ensure the enhancement system achieves its objectives.
- the speech-enhancement unit In addition to a first constraint that makes sure the short-term signal power is retained upon enhancement, we introduce a second constraint to the speech-enhancement unit.
- the second constraint is that the enhancement signal (defined as a difference signal resulting from subtracting the distorted signal from the enhanced signal) is constrained to have a power that is less than or equal to a certain fraction of the power of the distorted speech signal.
- the second constraint prevents the common artifacts resulting from “over-enhancement” during some time intervals.
- the second constraint does not noticeably affect the effectiveness of the enhancement in sustained voiced regions environments, where enhancement of speech signals corrupted by speech-correlated noise is typically most needed.
- the second constraint is applied to an enhancement procedure that increases the periodicity of the speech signal.
- a speech enhancement unit increases the periodicity of speech and includes the second constraint.
- the speech enhancement unit includes two basic steps, each performed for each time sample of the signal.
- the first part of the first step includes defining a pitch period as a function of time around the time sample based on a correlation measure.
- the second part of the first step includes sampling the distorted input signal using sampling intervals of precisely one pitch period, to obtain a pitch-period-synchronous sequence.
- We create such a pitch-period-synchronous sequence for each sample of the distorted input signal (the sample of the distorted speech signal is also a sample of the corresponding pitch-period-synchronous sequence).
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequences are limited to a finite length.
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence is selected to have a length of five samples.
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence is determined simultaneously for a set of consecutive samples of the distorted input signal.
- a set of consecutive samples we refer to such a set of consecutive samples as a sample-sequence.
- Our simultaneous determination of pitch-period-synchronous sequences results in a pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences.
- the sample-sequences for one embodiment are chosen to have a length of 5 ms.
- the second step of our enhancement operator includes re-estimating each sample based on the corresponding pitch-period-synchronous sequence, the first signal-power constraint and the second constraint operating on the enhancement signal.
- the sequence of re-estimated samples forms the enhanced speech signal.
- the enhanced speech signal is more periodic than the distorted speech signal, when the signal is voiced (and the pitch-period-synchronous sequence corresponds to a nearly periodic sampling of the distorted signal).
- the re-estimation is also performed simultaneously for a sample-sequence, rather than for each sample individually for this embodiment.
- the speech enhancement system does not change the distorted signal significantly. However, whenever the distorted speech signal is nearly periodic, the speech enhancement system effectively removes or reduces the audible distortion. It is also noted that the second constraint not only results in a reduction of artifacts, but that it also results in an insensitivity to lack of robustness of determination of pitch-period-synchronous sequences.
- an embodiment of an enhancement system 100 is shown in block diagram form that demonstrates a speech-enhancement method for processing a distorted speech input signal corrupted by speech-correlated noise.
- the distorted input signal is the output of a speech encoding-decoding system, such as those used for VOIP communication.
- An undistorted speech signal 1001 is encoded by encoder 101 to render a first bit stream 1002 .
- the first bit stream 1002 is conveyed through a channel 102 , which can be a communication network or a storage device.
- the channel 102 could be the Internet.
- the channel 102 renders a second bit stream 1003 , which can be identical to the first bit stream 1002 or could be missing packets or otherwise modified.
- the decoder 103 takes the second bit stream 1003 as an input and renders a reconstructed speech signal 1004 as an output.
- a corrupting signal may be introduced. This corrupting signal is equal to the difference between the reconstructed speech signal 1004 and the undistorted speech signal 1001 .
- the reconstructed speech signal 1004 or distorted speech signal is the input for the enhancer 104 , which produces an enhanced speech signal 1005 as an output.
- the enhanced speech signal 1005 In comparison to the reconstructed speech signal 1004 , the enhanced speech signal 1005 more closely approximates the undistorted speech signal 1001 according to perceptually-based measures.
- FIG. 2 a block diagram of an embodiment of the enhancer 104 is shown.
- This embodiment 104 performs pitch-period track estimation, determination of pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences, and constrained re-estimation of the speech signal.
- the reconstructed or distorted speech signal 1004 forms the input for the pitch-period estimator 201 and a pitch-period period track 2001 forms the output.
- a blocker 202 selects each subsequent block of L samples of the distorted speech signal 1004 to render as an output the current sample-sequence 2002 having L samples.
- the pitch-period-synchronous-sequence determiner 203 produces a sequence of N sample-sequences 2003 where each of the N sample-sequence has L samples.
- the sequence of N sample-sequences 2003 is based on the current sample sequence 2002 , pitch-period period track 2001 and the distorted input signal 1004 .
- the sequence of N sample-sequences 2003 are synchronous with the pitch-period.
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 forms the input to re-estimator 204 .
- Re-estimator 204 provides a re-estimated sample-sequence of L samples for every current sample-sequence 2002 that is produced by the blocker 202 .
- a concatenator 205 concatenates the re-estimated sample-sequences 2004 into the enhanced signal 1005 .
- the first step described for the present embodiment of the enhancer 104 is the estimation of the pitch-period period at regular intervals (i.e., estimation of a pitch-period period track 2001 ).
- any state-of-the-art pitch-period period estimator can be used.
- the sequence of pitch-period period estimates forms a so-called pitch-period period track 2001 .
- n are selected to be within the set of candidate pitch-period periods G, which contains the integers from 20 to 147 for one embodiment.
- G contains the integers from 20 to 147 for one embodiment.
- Smoothed correlations, sr i (n), are created by zero-phase low-pass filtering (using a seven-tap Hann window in one embodiment) the autocorrelation sequences r i (n).
- An overall correlation function, R i (n), corresponding to the pitch-period period at block i (containing samples ⁇ Mi+1, . . . , M(i+1) ⁇ ) is obtained by a weighted addition of smoothed and un-smoothed correlation functions.
- Other weightings, that include additional correlation functions, can also be used.
- the pitch-period period corresponding to segment i is the value n opt for the candidate pitch-period period n that maximizes R i (n):
- n opt arg ⁇ ⁇ max n ⁇ G ⁇ ⁇ R i ⁇ ( n ) , where G is the set of candidate pitch-period periods.
- a second step described for the present embodiment of the enhancer 104 is the determination of a pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 .
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 includes N sample-sequences, each sample-sequence having L samples.
- a pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 is determined for each consecutive block of L samples. L is set to 40 samples for an 8000 Hz sampling rate and N is set to 5 in one embodiment.
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 is determined recursively, both forward- and backward-in-time.
- FIG. 3 a block diagram of an embodiment of a pitch-synchronous-sequence determiner 203 is shown in block diagram form. This figure provides an overview of the determination of the pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 .
- the distorted speech signal 1004 first enters the poly-phase signals computer 301 .
- a set of Q poly-phase signals 3001 forms the output of the poly-phase signals computer 301 .
- a recursive pitch-period-synchronous sequence determination is performed by the sequence determiner 203 .
- the reference sample-sequence selector 303 chooses a current reference sample-sequence 3003 .
- this current reference sample-sequence 3003 is the current sample-sequence 2002 that is the output from blocker 202 .
- the previously-selected sample-sequence 2002 becomes the next reference sample sequence 3003 .
- the reference selector 303 also keeps track of the delay of the last selected sample-sequence 2002 and provides the accumulated delay 3002 to candidate selector 302 .
- the candidate-selector 302 has the poly-phase signals 3001 as inputs. It selects and outputs a plurality of candidate sample-sequences 3004 that are candidates for being the next sample-sequence 3006 .

- the sequence selector 304 chooses from the candidate sample-sequences 3004 the sample-sequence 3006 that is most similar to the reference sample-sequence 3003 and provides this sample-sequence 3006 to both a pitch-period-synchronous sequence concatenator 305 and to a reference sample-sequence selector 303 .
- the sequence selector 304 also provides a delay 3007 of the selected sample-sequence 3006 with respect to the current reference sample sequence 300 to the reference sample-sequence selector 303 .
- the pitch-period-synchronous sequence concatenator 305 provides a pitch-period-synchronous sequence of sample-sequences 2003 as output. That output 2003 is fed to the re-estimator 204 .
- the current reference sample-sequence 3003 is initially defined as the current block of L samples in the reference sample-sequence selector 303 . Each subsequent reference sample-sequence 3003 is found recursively in the following steps.
- a poly-phase signal computer 301 first up-samples a signal segment 1004 that includes the current sample-sequence 3003 by a factor, Q, where Q is set to 8 for a sampling rate of 8000 Hz in one embodiment.
- Q is set to 8 for a sampling rate of 8000 Hz in one embodiment.
- the up-sampling is done with a windowed sinc function in this embodiment.
- the poly-phase signal computer 301 determines Q poly-phase sample-sequences 3001 corresponding to that region including the current block.
- Each of the Q poly-phase sample-sequences 3001 has the same sampling rate as the original signal 1004 , but is offset by a fractional sampling interval.

- the forward-in-time part of the pitch-period-synchronous sequence process is determined in a manner analogous to the backward-in-time part of the pitch-period-synchronous sequence.
- the number of sample-sequences forward-in-time can be reduced and the number of sample-sequences backward-in-time can be increased in various embodiments.

For this embodiment, the weighting is set based on perceptual criteria. In the present embodiment, a modified Hanning weighting is used for the coefficients αm:

where β is a constant such that 0≦β<<1. In one embodiment, the value selected for β is in the range between 0.03 and 0.3, with a larger value resulting generally in stronger enhancement of the signal periodicity. Those skilled in the art appreciate that clearly non-periodic signals cannot generally be converted into nearly periodic signals. The purpose of the second constraint is to prevent production of an
where omitted terms are not dependent on d and where λ2=0 if the second constraint is satisfied. Let us first consider the case where λ2≠0, for example. The first step towards obtaining the solution of the constrained optimization problem is to differentiate towards d and set the resulting expression equal to zero,
We can then express the difference vector, d, as

This solution for the constrained optimization problem is valid for the case where the second constraint, which is an inequality constraint, can be considered to be an equality constraint. In this case, we can obtain the optimally modified current sample-sequence by first computing A and B and then computing {tilde over (x)}=Ay+(B+1)x0 for this embodiment.
In other words, in the case where the inequality constraint (the second constraint) is not activated, {tilde over (x)}0 is simply y, scaled to the correct energy in this embodiment.
