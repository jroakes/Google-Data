In the following description, accompanying drawing is carried out to reference, accompanying drawing forms its part, and shows several embodiment of the present invention by illustrated mode.Should be understood that in the situation that not deviating from scope of the present invention, can utilize other embodiment and can make structural change.
audio frequency-visual information is transcribed and is stored
Fig. 1 describes to be used to the transmission of audio frequency and/or video information and/or the figure of the exemplary embodiment of compile-decoding of the video of storage and retrieval (encoding and decoding) system 100.Coding/decoding system 100 comprises: coded system 104, and coded system 104 is accepted audio frequency-vision (AV) information 102 and is processed AV information 102 to generate (compression) AV information 106 of coding; And decode system 112, decode system 112 is processed encoded AV information 106 to produce the AV information 114 of recovering.Because Code And Decode process is not loss-free, so the AV information 114 through recovering is not identical with initial AV information 102, but adopt the wisdom of cataloged procedure and parameter to select, the AV information 114 through recovering and the difference between undressed AV information 102 are acceptable for human perception.
Encoded AV information 106 typically as by transcribing (transmission and receive) or storage/retrieval system 108 performed in decoding with before presenting, be transmitted or store and retrieve.It may be effective transcribing loss, but storage/retrieval loss is minimum or non-existent typically, therefore, offer the AV information 110 through transcribing of decode system 112 typically identical or substantially identical with encoded AV information 106 with encoded AV information 106.
Fig. 2 A is that encoded AV information 106 is sent to another location and the figure of an embodiment of the coding/decoding system 200A that receives in another position therein.Span line 230 converts input AV information 102 to be suitable for the signal of transmission and by transmission channel 212, the signal through conversion to be sent to receiver section 232 to.Receiver section 232 receives the signal transmitting, and converts received signal to AV information 114 through recovering for presenting.As mentioned above, due to compiling and transmission loss and mistake, the AV information 114 through recovering can have than the lower quality of AV information 102 that is provided for span line 230.Yet error correction system can be included to reduce or eliminate such mistake.For example, encoded AV information 106 can be by adding the coded forward error correction (FEC) of redundant information, and such redundant information can be used to identification and eliminate the mistake in receiver section 230.
Span line 102 comprises that one or more source encoders 202 encode with a plurality of sources to AV information 102.Source encoder 202 mainly encodes to produce encoded AV information 106 for the object of compression to AV information 102, and can comprise for example processor and the relational storage of storing instruction, described instruction realizes such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4AVC/H.264, HEVC or the similarly encoding and decoding of encoding and decoding, as described further below.

source code/decoding
As mentioned above, encoder 202 adopts compression algorithm to generate size than the less bit stream of the original video sequence in AV information 102 and/or file.Such compression is by reducing room and time redundancy in the original series possibility that becomes.
Prior art encoder 202 comprises and the video compression standard (VCEG) developed between (MPEG) with ISO " Motion Picture Experts Group " by " video compiling expert group " at ITU those of (" advanced video compiling ") compatibility H.264/MPEG-4AVC, particularly form is publication " Advanced Video Coding for Generic Audiovisual Services " (in March, 2005), and it is incorporated in herein thus by reference.
H.264/MPEG-4AVC HEVC " compiling of high efficiency video " (being sometimes called as H.265) is expected replacement.HEVC has introduced general new compilation tool and the entity as defined compilation entity in H.264/AVC, as described further below.CS39543/CS39549/CS39892
Fig. 3 is the block diagram of an embodiment of diagram source encoder 202.Source encoder 202 is accepted AV information 102 and uses 302 pairs of AV information 102 of sampler to sample to produce each to have the consecutive digital images of a plurality of pixels or the sequence of picture 303.Picture can comprise frame or field, and wherein frame is the complete image of catching during known interval, and field is the set of odd number or the even-line interlace line of part image.
Sampler 302 produces the sequence of pictures 303 of uncompressed.Each digital picture can both represent by one or more tolerance with a plurality of coefficients, and described coefficient represents about jointly comprising the information of the pixel of this picture.The value of pixel can be corresponding to brightness or out of Memory.For example, in the situation that several components (R-G-B component or brightness-chromatic component) are associated with each pixel, each in these components can be located in separately reason.
Image can be divided into " section ", and described " section " can comprise a part for picture or can comprise whole picture.In standard H.264, these sections are divided into the compilation entity that is called macro block (the usually piece of 16 pixel * 16 pixels of size), and each macro block can and then be divided into the data block 102 of different size, for example 4 * 4,4 * 8,8 * 4,8 * 8,8 * 16,16 * 8.The concept of HEVC expansion and vague generalization compilation entity surmounts the concept of macro block.
hEVE compilation entity: CTU, CU, PU and TU
As other video compiling standard, HEVC is block-based blending space and time prediction compilation scheme.Yet HEVC introduces the new compilation entity that H.264/AVC standard does not comprise.These compilation entity comprise (1) compiling tree piece (CTU), compilation unit (CU), predicting unit (PU) and converter unit (TU) and are further described below.
Fig. 4 is the figure describing such as the picture 400 of the AV information 102 of one in the picture in sequence of pictures 303.Picture 400 is divided into the non-overlapped square block that is called (one or more) compiling tree unit or CTU402 on space.Unlike basic compilation unit wherein, be 16x16 pixel macro block H.264 compile standard with previous video, CTU402 is the basic compilation unit of HEVC, and can be the same large with 128x128 pixel.As shown in Figure 4, CTU402 is typically interior referenced at picture 400 to be similar to the order of gradual scanning.
Each CTU402 can and then be divided into iteratively by " quaternary tree " that be further described below decomposes described less variable-sized compilation unit.Compilation unit is the district forming in the image of coding parameter like application class and transmission in bit stream 314.
Fig. 5 illustrates the figure becoming such as the exemplary partitions of the CTU402 of the compilation unit of compilation unit 502A and 502B (being alternatively called as hereinafter (one or more) compilation unit 502).Single CTU402 can be divided into four CU502 such as CU502A, 1/4th of each size that is CTU402.Each CU502A dividing like this can both be become by Further Division four less CU502B of 1/4th sizes of initial CU502A.
Become CU502A and become " quaternary tree " data parameters (for example sign or bit) that the division of the CTU402 of less CU502B is encoded in output bit flow 314 together with encoded data by the expense as being called grammer and describe.
Fig. 6 is the figure of the expression of the representative quaternary tree 600 cut apart for the CTU402 shown in Fig. 5 of diagram and data parameters.Quaternary tree 600 is included in the first node 602A at a hierarchical level place and at a plurality of nodes (hereinafter, quaternary tree can be called " node " 602 with being replaced) of the Section Point 602B at lower hierarchical level place.Each node 602 place quaternary tree, if node 602 is further divided into child node, have distributed " division sign " or bit " 1 ", otherwise have distributed bit " 0 ".
For example, the quaternary tree 600 that in Fig. 5, illustrated CTU402 subregion can present in Fig. 6 represents, described quaternary tree 600 comprises the division sign " 1 " (indication exists 4 additional nodes at lower hierarchical level place) being associated with node 602A at CU502 level place, top.Illustrated quaternary tree 600 comprises that the division sign " 1 " being associated with node 602B at middle CU502 level place is to indicate this CU to be also dividing in four other CU502 at the next one (bottom) CU level place equally.Source encoder 202 can limit minimum and maximum CU502 size, thereby changes the degree of depth of the maximum possible of CU502 division.
Encoder 202 generates the AV information 106 of coding with the form of bit stream 314, described bit stream 314 comprises the first and the second portion that comprises the expense that is called as syntactic element having for the coded data of CU502.Encoded data comprise the data corresponding with encoded CU502 (as described further below coded residual and their associated motion vectors, fallout predictor or related residual).Second portion comprises the syntactic element that can represent not directly corresponding to the coding parameter of the encoded data of piece.For example, syntactic element can comprise indication, quaternary tree 600 or the out of Memory of pattern compiler in the address of CU502 in image and sign, quantization parameter, selected interframe/frame.
CU502 is corresponding to basic compiling element and comprise two relevant subelements: predicting unit (PU) and converter unit (TU), it both has the full-size of the size of the CU502 that equals corresponding.
Fig. 7 is the figure that illustrates the subregion of the CU502 that becomes one or more PU702.PU702 is corresponding to the CU502 of cutting apart and be used to carry out predicted pixel values for type in picture or between picture.PU702 is the expansion of cutting apart H.264/AVC for estimation, and defines for each CU502 that is not further subdivided into other CU (" division sign "=0).Each leaf 604 place quaternary tree 600, last (bottom stage) CU502 of 2Nx2N can occupy in four possible patterns of PU: 2Nx2N (702A), 2NxN (702B), Nx2N (702C) and NxN (702D), as shown in Figure 7.
CU502 can be predicted compiling on space or on the time.If compile CU502 under " in frame " pattern, each PU702 of CU502 can both have its spatial prediction direction and image information as being further described below.And under " in frame " pattern, the PU702 of CU502 can depend on another CU502, because it can use the space neighbours in another CU.If compile CU502 under " interframe " formula, each PU702 of CU502 can both have its (one or more) motion vector reference picture associated with (one or more) as being further described below.
Fig. 8 illustrates the figure that is divided into the CU502 of four PU702 and associated converter unit (TU) 802 set.TU802 is used to represent by DCT (discrete cosine transform) by the elementary cell of spatial up-conversion.The size of each piece conversion TU802 in CU502 and position by below further illustrated " residual error " quaternary tree (RQT) describe.
Fig. 9 is the figure illustrating for the RQT900 of the TU802 of the CU502 in the example of Fig. 8.Note, in " 1 " at the first node 902A place of RQT900, indicate and have Si Ge branch, and indicate indicated node further to there is Si Ge branch in " 1 " at the secondary Section Point 902B place of adjacent lower layer.The data of describing RQT900 are compiled equally and are transmitted in bit stream 314 as expense.
The compiling parameter of video sequence can be stored in the special-purpose NAL unit that is called parameter set.Can adopt the parameter set NAL unit of two types.The first parameter set type is called as sequence parameter set (SPS), and comprises NAL unit, and this NAL unit is included in constant parameter during whole video sequence.Typically, SPS processes size and other parameter of compiling configuration file, frame of video.The parameter set of Second Type is called as image parameters collection (PPS), and the different value that compiling can be from an image to another image modification.
spatial prediction and time prediction
Being used for one of the technology of compression bit stream 314 is storages of abandoning pixel value itself, and alternatively, by the process that can repeat at decoder 220 places, carry out poor (being called as residual error) between pixel value that predicted pixel values and storage or transmission predict and actual pixel value.As long as the pixel value of identical prediction can be provided according to provided information decoder 220, just can be by residual error and the Zhi Xiang Calais that predicts being recovered to actual picture value.Identical technology also can be used to compress other data.
Back, with reference to figure 3, each PU702 of just processed CU502 is provided for predictor module 307.Information (infra-frame prediction in the approaching PU702 of predictor module 307 based in same number of frames, it is carried out by spatial predictors 324) and in time the information (inter prediction, it is carried out by time prediction device 330) of the PU702 in approaching frame predict the value of PU702.Yet time prediction is not perhaps always based on juxtaposed PU, because juxtaposed PU is defined by being positioned at reference/non-reference frame place with the x identical with current PU702 and y coordinate.These technology are utilized the room and time dependence between PU702.
Therefore the unit of coding can be classified into and comprise two types: the unit of upper prediction of (1) non-time and the unit of prediction on (2) time.(for example, infra-frame prediction) predicted with the present frame that is included in the adjacent or approaching PU702 in frame in the unit of upper prediction of non-time, and generates by spatial predictors 324.On time, the unit of prediction for example, is predicted from a time picture (P-frame), or at least two reference picture above and/or below (being B-frame) are predicted from the time.
spatial prediction
Figure 10 is the figure of the spatial prediction of diagram PU702.Picture i can comprise other PU1-4 approaching on PU702 and space, comprises approaching PU702N.Spatial predictors 324 is predicted current block (for example piece C of Figure 10) by means of the PU702 of other encoded piece of the pixel of use present image " in frame ".
Spatial predictors 324 location is suitable for the approaching PU (for example the PU1 of Figure 10,2,3 or 4) of space compiling and determines the angle prediction direction of the PU that this is approaching.In HEVC, can consider 35 directions, so each PU can have one in 35 directions that are associated with it, comprise level, vertical, 45 degree diagonal, 135 degree diagonal, DC etc.The spatial prediction direction of PU is indicated with grammer.
Back with reference to the spatial predictors 324 of figure 3, the approaching PU of this location is used to use element 305 that residual error PU704 (e) is calculated as to poor between approaching PU702N and the pixel of current PU702.Result is the PU element 1006 of infra-frame prediction that comprises the residual error PU1004 of prediction direction 1002 and infra-frame prediction.Prediction direction 1002 can infer that direction compiles by the spatial dependence of PU approaching from space and picture, thereby makes it possible to reduce the compiler rate of intra prediction direction pattern.
time prediction
Figure 11 is the figure of diagram time prediction.Time prediction is considered from upper contiguous picture of time or the information of frame (such as previous picture, picture i-1).
Usually, time prediction comprises: single prediction (P type), and it is by reference to predicting PU702 from a reference zone of a picture only; And many predictions (Type B), it predicts PU by reference to two reference zones from one or two reference picture.Reference picture is the image that has been compiled and has then rebuild in the video sequence of (by decoding).
In time prediction device 330 in these reference zones or several (for P type are one or for Type B for several), the region of pixel in approaching frame on recognition time, makes them can be used as the fallout predictor of this current PU702.In the situation that having used several regional prediction device (Type B), they can mergedly generate a single prediction.Reference zone 1102 is identified by motion vector (MV) 1104 in reference frame, the current PU702 in described motion vector (MV) 1104 definition present frames (picture i) and the displacement between the reference zone 1102 (refIdx) in reference frame (picture i-1).PU in B picture can have nearly two MV.MV and refIdx both can be included in the grammer of HEVC bit stream.
Refer again to Fig. 3, the difference between the pixel value between reference zone 1102 and current PU702 can by as by the selected element 305 of switch 306, calculated.This poor residual error that is called as the PU1106 of inter prediction.In the latter stage of time or inter prediction process, current PU1106 is comprised of a motion vector MV1104 and residual error 1106.
Yet, as mentioned above, for a kind of technology of packed data, will come for data generation forecast value by the means that can be repeated by decoder 220, thereby poor (residual error) between the predicted value of calculated data and actual value and transmit this residual error for decoding.As long as decoder 220 can produce predicted value, residual values just can be used to determine actual value.
This technology can by generate MV1104 prediction, calculate poor (residual error) between actual MV1104 and MV1104 through predicting and in bit stream 314, transmit MV residual error be applied in time prediction in MV1104 used.As long as decoder 220 can produce the MV1104 through prediction, just can calculate actual MV1104 according to residual error.HEVC is used spatial coherence mobile between approaching PU702 for the MV of each PU702 calculating prediction.
Figure 12 is shown in the figure that uses motion vector predictor (MVP) in HEVC.Motion vector predictor V
1, V
2and V
3take from and be located near the piece (C) that will encode or contiguous a plurality of 1,2 and 3 MV1104.Because these vectors refer to the motion vector of piece contiguous on the space in same time frame and can be used to predict the motion vector of the piece that will encode, so these vectors are called as spatial movement fallout predictor.
Figure 12 illustrates temporal motion vector fallout predictor V equally
t, it is the motion vector of the piece C ' (being for example positioned at the piece of the picture i-1 at the locus place identical with the piece being just compiled (the piece C of image i)) of the common location in the picture (by decoding order) of the early decoding of sequence.
Spatial motion vectors fallout predictor V

1), be positioned at piece (V above
3) and from being located at (a V in the piece of respective corners of the piece that will encode
2) obtain three spatial motion vectors fallout predictors.This MV fallout predictor selection technology is called as senior motion-vector prediction (AMVP).
Therefore, obtained and there is spatial predictors (V for example
1, V
2and V
3) and (one or more) time prediction device V
ta plurality of (typically five) MV fallout predictor (MVP) candidate.In order to be reduced in the expense that sends motion vector predictor in bit stream with signal, the data of the motion vector that the set of motion vector predictor can be used for copying by elimination reduce (for example, can from candidate, eliminate the MV with the value identical with other MV).
Encoder 202 can be selected " best " motion vector predictor in the middle of candidate, and by motion vector predictor residual computations, be poor between selected motion vector predictor and actual motion vector, and in bit stream 314, transmit this motion vector predictor residual error.In order to carry out this operation, must for decoder 220, use (but it does not transmit in bit stream 314) below by the actual motion vector of storage.Signaling bit or sign are included in stipulates in bit stream 314 which MV residual error calculates according to normalized motion vector predictor, and by decoder, is used for recovering this motion vector after a while.Further these bits or sign are described below.
Back, with reference to figure 3, then the residual error 1004 of infra-frame prediction and the residual error 1106 of inter prediction that from space, (in frame) or time (interframe) forecasting process obtain are transformed into converter unit described above (TU) 802 by conversion module 308.TU802 can be used about Fig. 9 RQT described above and decompose and be further divided into less TU.In HEVC, usually using 2 or 3 grades of transform sizes that decompose and approve is from 32 * 32,16 * 16,8 * 8 and 4 * 4.As mentioned above, conversion obtains according to discrete cosine transform (DCT) or discrete sine transform (DST).
Then the coefficient of residual error conversion is quantized device 310 and quantizes.Quantification plays a very important role in data compression.In HEVC, quantize to convert high accuracy conversion coefficient to a limited number of probable value.Although quantize a large amount of compression of license, quantizing is to damage operation, and can not recover the loss by quantizing.
Then coefficient through the residual error of quantization transform compiles by means of entropy compiler 312, and then as the part of the useful data of the image of compiling AV information, is inserted in compression bit stream 310.Compiling syntactic element can also compile to improve compile efficiency by the dependence between syntactic element.HEVC provides context adaptive binary arithmetic compiling (CABAC).Can also use other form or entropy or algorithm compiling.
In order to calculate fallout predictor used above, encoder 202 uses and comprises that 315 couples of encoded PU702 of " decoding " loop of element 316,318,320,322,328 decode.This decoding loop 315 is rebuild PU and image from the residual error through quantization transform.
Conversion residual error coefficient E through quantizing is provided for quantizer 316, described in go the inverse operation of the operation of quantizer 316 application quantizers 310 to remove quantization transform coefficient PU (E ') 708 with what produce residual error.Then data 708 through going to quantize are provided for inverse converter 318, and described inverse converter 318 application are generated the reconstruction residual error coefficient of PU (e ') 710 by conversion module 308 applied conversion contrary.
Then the reconstructed coefficients of residual error PU710 is added to the coefficient of correspondence that is selected from the PU (x ') 702 ' of the correspondence prediction of the PU1004 of infra-frame prediction and the PU1106 of inter prediction by selector 306.For example, if rebuild residual error from " in frame " compilation process of spatial predictors 324, " in frame " fallout predictor (x ') is added so that the reconstruction PU corresponding with original PU702 that recovers for example, to revise by the loss of (in this case quantization operation) generation by converting (x ") 712 with this residual error.If residual error 710 is from " interframe " compilation process of time prediction device 330, by the merged residual error that is then added to this decoding in current motion vector region pointed (these regions belong to the reference picture being stored in the reference buffer 328 of present image sheet institute reference).By this way, the loss that original PU702 is produced by quantization operation is revised.
With regard to encoder 202, use and motion-vector prediction technology like image prediction technology type described above, motion vector can be stored for using in follow-up in time frame by motion vector buffer 329.As described further below, sign can be arranged and be shifted the frame that should be used to compile at least subsequently to the motion vector of the frame of current decoding with pointer rather than be used the content that replaces MV buffer 329 for the MV of present frame with grammer.
Loop filter 322 is applied to reconstruction signal (x ") 712 so that the severe reducing by obtained residual error quantizes the effect creating, and to improves signal quality.Loop filter 322 for example can comprise for edge smoothing between PU is used to minimize the variance of original image and linear filter (SSD) with the de-blocking filter of the high-frequency decay that visually makes to be created by compilation process with after the PU for image all decoded.Linear filtering process is being performed and is using on basis is frame by frame wanting filtered pixel several pixels around, and also uses the spatial dependence between the pixel of frame.Linear filter coefficient can be compiled and transmit in a head of bit stream typically is picture or section head.
Image (be also called as and rebuild image) through filtering is then stored as the reference picture from reference picture buffers 328, so that follow-up " interframe " prediction occurs between the compression period of the successive image of current video sequence in permission.
entropy compiling
Each coefficient the conversion coefficient through quantizing of the converter unit (TU) 802 being obtained from converter 308 and quantizer 310 by compiling by the performed compiling of compiler 312 is carried out.Typically with a plurality of, can for each conversion coefficient or coefficient sets, carry out such compiling with one in scan pattern.
Figure 13 is that diagram is for the figure of the exemplary scan pattern of the compiling of the quantization parameter of non-square (4x6) TU802.These scan patterns comprise horizontal sweep pattern 1302A (scanning angle θ=0 degree), in a zigzag, pattern of diagonal lines 1302B and 1302D (scanning angle θ=45 and 135 degree) and vertical scanning 1302C (scanning angle=270 degree).Can carry out in any direction wavefront scanning (information that wherein encoder 312 uses from the previous row of TU802 makes to realize the parallel processing that can allow than simply piecing better compression realization together).
Illustrated scan pattern starts at the TU802 of the upper right quarter of each TU802 coefficient place and finishes at the right lower quadrant coefficient place of TU802.Yet, scan pattern can start at right lower quadrant coefficient 24 places and finish at upper left quarter coefficient 1 place, or thus, can follow the pattern from penetralia coefficient positions to outermost layer coefficient positions, thereby follow clockwise (for example, 10,11,14,15,19,18,17,13,9,5,6,7,8,12,16,20,24,23,22,21,1,2,3,4) or pattern or inwardly follow the pattern of outermost layer coefficient positions counterclockwise.In addition, scan pattern needs not to be continuous (such as 10,15,14,11 etc.).As will be described further below, once last effectively (non-zero) coefficient positions is known, on the rightabout of the scan pattern of the first coefficient that just can be in getting back to scan pattern, coefficient is decoded.
Figure 14 A is the figure of example T U802 coefficient Figure 140 2.Note, many coefficients are zero coefficient (for example their value are zero).For each TU802 and in the position of each scanning, bit can be assigned with or be arranged to indicate whether corresponding coefficient is zero, thereby produces the effective Figure 145 2 being associated with each TU802.
Figure 14 B is the figure that exemplary effective Figure 145 2 of the illustrated TU802 coefficient of Figure 14 A is shown.Logical one indication and logical zero indication (but can use different mappings) for zero coefficient for nonzero coefficient.
Turn back to the example of Figure 14 A, if scan pattern is horizontal sweep pattern 1302A, the last non-zero coefficient of TU802 is coefficient 1404.Also can in Figure 14 B, see this, because the effective figure element being associated with coefficient 1404 is logical one and is the last element in horizontal sweep pattern 1202A.
No matter use which scanning technique or pattern, except those the coefficient of the last compiling of TU802 along scan pattern, must scan the coefficient of all quantifications.Yet, because current, defined HEVC, so likely, unless exist for identifying and skip the reliable means of the remainder of the coefficient after the last non-zero coefficient of scan pattern, otherwise all will be scanned in the coefficient of TU802.Ideally, for identifying the means of last non-zero coefficient, should find the balance between the size of the bit stream 314 that minimization and result obtain.
As described above with reference to illustrated encoder 312 in figure 3, HEVC realizes the context-adaptive compiling such as context adaptive binary arithmetic compiling (CABAC).CABAC is the entropy coding of probability of use model a kind of form that binary character is encoded.The symbol of non-binary values (such as converter unit coefficient or motion vector) before arithmetic compiling by binaryzation or convert binary code to.For each bit of binaryzation symbol (or " storehouse (bin) "), repeat each stage.
Context model is for the probabilistic model of one or more of binaryzation symbol.The statistics that can depend on the data symbol of nearest compiling is chosen this model from a plurality of available model.Context model is stored as the probability in each storehouse of " 1 " or " 0 ".Then arithmetic compiler encodes to each storehouse according to selected probabilistic model.
Context variable is that the equation in the storehouse by comprising nearest decoding is for the variable of the adaptive binary arithmetic decoding process defined in storehouse.Cabac_init_flag is given for the method for determining initial table used in initialization procedure for context variable.The value of cabac_init_flag is in the scope of 0 to 1 (including).When cabac_init_flag does not exist, it is pushed off out is 0.
The initialization of context variable is performed as follows.For each context variable, two variable pStateIdx (Probability State index) and valMPS (value of most probable symbol) are initialised.From table clause initValue, according to following pseudo-code process, obtained two 4 bit variable (slopeIdx and intersecIdx):
slopeIdx＝initValue>>4
intersecIdx＝initValue&15
It is as follows that slope m and intersection point n derive from index:
m＝slopeIdx*5–45
n＝(intersecIdx<<3)-16
The last coefficient of efficiency of TU802 in scan pattern can be identified by variable last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y.
Figure 15 A presents for determine the table of initializing variable m and n according to last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y variable.For 16x16TU802, the scope of variable last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y is from 0 to 15.Coefficient for the first half (0-7) of position range is used based on contextual model and is decoded as indication.Six contexts are used to brightness (Luma) 16x16TU.That is to say, ctxIdx6-11 is for the picture of compiling in I type frame, and ctxIdx37-42 is for the picture of P type interframe compiling, and ctxIdx68-73 is for the picture of Type B interframe compiling.Figure 15 B presents the table illustrating for the ctxIdx skew of different CU502 types.
For 32x32TU802, last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y from 0 to 31 change.The first half (scope 0-15) of position are with decoding based on context model shown in Figure 15 A.Seven contexts are used to Luma32x32TU.That is to say, ctxIdx12-18 is for the picture of compiling in I type frame, and ctxIdx43-49 is for the picture of P type interframe compiling, and ctxIdx74-80 is for the picture of Type B interframe compiling.In addition, for the last_significant_coeff_x of rectangle TU802 (32x8,8x32,16x4 and 4x16) or the possible range of last_significant_coeff_y, be the most peaked value of long dimension for TU802.Therefore, usually, the scope of last_significant_coeff_x or last_significant_coeff_y may be from 0-31 for max (M, N) is wherein greater than any MxN TU of 16.
Whole in scanning TU802 coefficient even have value be zero those make the additional calculating of encoder 312 execution, and make the additional calculating of encoder 312 execution and in bit stream 314, send the necessary more bits of ratio decoder process.Further make problem worse, it may be higher having in the non-square TU802 situation of only introducing in HEVC with scanning row, column or cornerwise probability of zero coefficient.
In addition, because last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y (0-31) on a large scale, last coefficient positions compiling needs a large amount of bits to compile two numbers from 0-31, and needs a large amount of context and storehouses to support a plurality of TU802 sizes shown in Figure 15 A.
last coefficient compiling and decoding
A kind of technology reducing for the necessary bit stream 314 of compiling of TU802 coefficient through quantizing and the size in storehouse is with bitstream syntax, sign to be encoded, and when the specific part of the TU802 coefficient of described sign indication in a part for scan pattern has at least one nonzero coefficient.Usually, this technology depends on that scan pattern is that scanning row, column or diagonal are introduced sign (for diagonal, may be that only specific dimensions will have this sign).If scanning row, column or diagonal only have zero coefficient, sign is set to 0; Otherwise, be set to 1.The sign of this introducing is used than the bit of directly the last coefficient of efficiency of converter unit being encoded still less, maintains suitable performance simultaneously.In order further to reduce the expense of flag bit, if set the number of sign, can there is full zero coefficient by them, for the residue row or column in scan pattern, any sign is not set and reduces.Last row or column can further reduce flag bit expense, because can be inferred from the sign for last row or column.These features have been described in greater detail below.
Figure 16 A presents for carrying out the figure of the exemplary techniques of the last coefficient technique of compiling that can be used in HEVC coder/decoder system 202.Whether in frame 1602, having carried out about being arranged in whole in the coefficient of a part of the TU802 in the part of scan pattern is all zero determine.If at least one in the coefficient of this part of the TU802 in this part of scan pattern is non-zero, frame 1604 is set to the first value with the sign that this part of TU802 is associated.If in the coefficient of this part of the TU802 in this part of scan pattern is all zero, frame 1606 is set to the second value with the sign that this part of TU802 is associated.Frame 1608 determines whether to consider whole in sweep test.If not, process to transmit and get back to frame 1602 for considering the next part of the TU802 coefficient in the next part of scan pattern.If all considered in sweep test, for the finishing dealing with of the instant last coefficient processing of the TU in considering, and can start for processing or other task of next TU.Frame 1610 is the optional other embodiment that further discussed below.
Figure 17 is the figure of the operation of pictorial image 16A.For simple object, Figure 17 discloses the embodiment that uses illustrated horizontal sweep pattern 1302A in Figure 13.In this scan pattern 1302A, the first of the TU802 coefficient on the 1702A of first of scan pattern (for example those in the first row) comprises at least one nonzero coefficient, that is, and and the zero of sweep test 1702A and the 5th coefficient.Therefore, frame 1604 is set to logical one with the first sign 1706A that the first of TU802 coefficient on the 1702A of first at scan pattern is associated.
Frame 1608 determines that residue has more sweep test (for example scan pattern part 1702B-1702H) in scan pattern, so process to be routed, get back to frame 1602, it determines in the part of the TU802 conversion coefficient of next scan pattern part 1702B whether have at least one nonzero coefficient again.In illustrated example, the second portion 1702 of scan pattern 1302A comprises at least one nonzero coefficient (the second coefficient) equally, therefore, frame 1604 arrange be associated with the second portion 1702B of conversion coefficient on second portion at scan pattern 1302A second indicate 1706B.
Again, frame 1608 determines that residue has more sweep test 1702C-1702H in scan pattern 1302A, so process the third part 1702C of the coefficient that is routed to frame 1602 and TU802, is examined.In this case, in the coefficient of the third part of the TU on the third part 1702C of scan pattern 1302A is all zero, so frame 1606 the 3rd sign 1706C is set to zero, this part of beacon scanning pattern 1302A comprises being all zero TU802 coefficient.
Till this process is repeated until being all examined in the coefficient of TU802, and sign has been set up or has not yet arranged to indicate associated sweep test 1702A-1702H (with a part for TU802 coefficient) whether to have any nonzero value.In illustrated embodiment, because sign 1706A, 1706V, 1706D and 1706F have value one, so knowing at least one in these sweep test coefficients (in this case, OK), people there is nonzero value.Remaining sign has value zero those sweep test coefficients of indication and all has value zero.
Although being used for the scan pattern 1302A of this example for the simple object of illustrative is the pattern of lining by line scan, but identical technology can be used to any scan pattern, comprise any that scan by column in 1302C, diagonal scan pattern 1302B and 1302D, wavefront scanning or even annular or discontinuous scan pattern.All needed is the value that sign or other skill are set to the associated zero/non-zero status partly of the TU802 coefficient of indication in the associated part of scan pattern 1302.
For example, for example, in the entropy compiling that each independent coefficient is examined to determine (, after the frame 1602 or frame 1606 at Figure 16 A) after whether it has nonzero value, after whole sweep test (row, column or diagonal) has been examined to determine whether there is any nonzero coefficient or (after the operation shown in Figure 16 A all completes) can carry out TU802 coefficient itself after whole TU802 has been scanned to determine whether there is any nonzero coefficient.The last sweep test 1702F that comprises nonzero value by indication, example above allows encoder to abandon having the decoding of the TU802 coefficient of null value, thereby saves bit in bit stream 314 and to the encoded TU802 coefficient needed association process of decoding.In one embodiment, sign 1706 described above can be called as last_TU_scan_portion sign, and they are sent with grammer and are associated with TU802.
For example, by being similar to simple number or two numbers (last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y) of Cartesian coordinate, come the last non-zero coefficient in beacon scanning pattern can also cause bit stream 314 and process and save.Yet, adopt especially the possible larger TU that becomes (it can be the same with 32x32 large) under HEVC, wasted a large amount of bits.Technology above allows the processing of zero coefficient to be lowered, and is substantially reduced in bit stream 314 number for the needed bit of last coefficient signaling simultaneously.
Although reduce the number of the null value TU802 coefficient will being encoded above, it still may cause the null value TU802 coefficient of some numbers to be encoded, for example, latter two coefficient in row 1702F.Can be further for example, by being that the additional sign being only associated with last sweep test (, last_scan_portion_position sign) of the last coefficient 1704 in the decline of scan pattern is arranged to have nonzero value and is reduced this number by indication particular factor.
In addition, although example is above used as sign the indicating device that has nonzero coefficient in sweep test, any similar skill can be used to such signaling.For example, can make index of reference or other value.
Can be as the dotted line frame 1610 by Figure 16 A indicated, the number of the needed bit of last sweep test be indicated in further reduction.Frame 1610 determines whether whole in the coefficient of remainder of TU802 are all zero.If not (still having nonzero coefficient in the remainder of TU802 and sweep test), as previously, frame 1612 allows to process and is routed to frame 1604 to consider next sweep test.Yet, if be all zero in the coefficient of the remainder of TU802, stop the compiling of the TU802 in considering.
Back, with reference to the example presenting in Figure 17, the processing of sweep test 1702A-1702E is carried out as before, and sign 1706A-1706E is set up as indicated in example.Yet, after sign 1706E is set up, processes and be routed to frame 1608, its more parts that define scan pattern will be considered, thereby and process to be routed and get back to frame 1602.Frame 1602 is determined and in scan pattern part 1702F, is had at least one nonzero coefficient (in fact, exist two).Next, process and be passed to frame 1610, whether the whole coefficient (for example, the coefficient in sweep test 1702G and 1702H) in the remainder of its consideration TU802 equals zero.In the example shown in Figure 17, in the remainder of TU802, all there is zero coefficient, so frame 1610 is routed to link A by processing, this finishes the last coefficient processing for the TU802 in considering.The last coefficient flags collection being associated with TU that result obtains belongs to the last coefficient flags collection 1708 of the sign that present eliminating is associated with sweep test 1702G and 1702H.This saves three bits of the information of using in baseline embodiment in addition.Note, this technology is abandoned simply adding any afterbody zero flag such as sign 1706G and 1706H to last coefficient flags collection when in the end two sweep test 1702G and 1702H have full zero coefficient equally and is saved an additional bit.This is possible, and the information of passing on because of the sign 1706E that the serves as reasons fact that is the last sign in the set of last coefficient flags is enough to infer that the capable or part of the next one of scanning is the decline with non-zero TU coefficient.
Figure 16 B is the figure that illustrates the decoding of the encoded bit stream 314 that uses last coefficient compiling.In frame 1652, read and the whole signs that are associated 1706 that are arranged in the coefficient of first of the TU802 in the first of scan pattern.If sign 1706 has the first value, the first that is arranged in the TU802 coefficient in the first of scan pattern is decoded, as shown in frame 1654.If sign 1706 has the second value, skip the compiling of the first of the TU802 coefficient in the first that is arranged in scan pattern, as shown in frame 1656.Frame 1662 checks to determine in TU802, whether have any more sweep test 1702.If there is additional sweep test 1702, process to be routed and get back to frame 1652, yet if there is no additional sweep test, stop processing for the decoding of the TU802 in considering.
For example, back with reference to Figure 17, there is nonzero coefficient in sign 1706A indication in the 1702A of first of scan pattern.Therefore, process and be routed to frame 1654, and the first of TU coefficient (those in scan line part 1702) is decoded.For scan pattern part, 1702B completes this process, because sign 1706 is also set to one, indication exists zero coefficient values in the TU802 coefficient of the second scan pattern part 1702B.All coefficients in sign 1706C beacon scanning pattern part 1702C have the second value, and skip the decoding of the associated coefficient of the TU802 in sweep test 1702C.For remaining sign 1706D-1706H, repeat this process.
Dotted line frame 1658 and 1662 is with reference to the decoding of using the optional embodiment introducing in the frame 1610 of Figure 16 A.Frame 1658 determines whether read sign is the last residue sign of attribute set 1708.If reading sign 1706 is not the last residue sign of attribute set, processes and be routed to frame 1662 and continue as previously described.If be the last residue sign of attribute set but read sign, the part of the TU802 coefficient being associated with the part 1702 of closelying follow the scan pattern after indicating with this residue the current sweep test 102 being associated is decoded, and skip the compiling of the residual coefficient of TU802, as shown in frame 1664.
For example, refer again to Figure 17, the last residue sign of attribute set 1708 is sign 1708E, its value of having zero.Because this is the last residue sign of attribute set 1708, so 1664 pairs of frames are decoded immediately following the coefficient of the part of the part (it comprises the coefficient in scan pattern part 1702F) being associated with last residue sign 1706E TU802 afterwards, and skip the decoding of the residual coefficient (comprising the coefficient in sweep test 1702G and 1702H) in just decoded TU802.
In presented example, the setting of the compiling of TU802 coefficient and decoding and sign 1706 or 1708 is performed immediately following after the scan pattern 1302A making progress the party.As shown in Figure 16 B, the decoding of coefficient can be carried out in identical direction, or can in the direction contrary with scan pattern, compile.
For example, with reference to Figure 17, the decoding of encoded TU802 coefficient can be by starting to carry out from sweep test 1702H (last sweep test).Sign 1706H and 1706G beacon scanning part 1702H and 1702G have complete zero TU802 coefficient, so can skip the decoding of the coefficient in these scan pattern parts (if they are completely in bit stream 314).Sign 1706F beacon scanning pattern part 1702F comprises some nonzero coefficients, so the coefficient of this part of TU802 can be decoded.Then can continue for the remainder of TU802 coefficient this process.Or, can before frame 1652, insert logic, described logic determines to have the last sign (for example 1706F) that the first value is associated with scan pattern, and starts simply the decoding of the coefficient of the sweep test that for example, is associated with this sign (1706F) and the residue sweep test (for example 1702E-1702A) of TU802 before this sweep test.
Similarly, in the alternate embodiment shown in the dotted line frame of Figure 16 A and 16B, the last scan pattern part 1702 that the last sign 1708E indication of attribute set 1708 has non-zero TU802 coefficient is immediately following the sweep test after the sweep test being associated with last sign 1708, or scan pattern part 1702F.Therefore the decoding of TU coefficient can start and finish with scan pattern part 1702A by the TU802 coefficient from scan pattern part 1702F.
The diagram that is used for describing has above been used the illustrated pattern of lining by line scan in the 1302A such as Figure 13.Yet, attention, the enough diagonal scan patterns of energy and any scan pattern are carried out this technology itself, as long as suitable sign is associated with the part of this scan pattern.What note equally is, can force at rule for diagonal scan pattern (or other scan pattern that wherein number of the coefficient in scan pattern changes to part from part), wherein the sign of zero/non-zero status in beacon scanning part is only just used when sweep test has the coefficient of minimal number.
position encoded and the decoding of last coefficient sets
The another kind of technology reducing for the necessary bit stream 314 of compiling of TU802 coefficient through quantizing and the size in storehouse is with bitstream syntax, sign to be encoded, and when specific part or the group of the TU802 coefficient of described sign indication in a part for scan pattern have at least one nonzero coefficient.
Figure 18 A is the figure with the 16x16TU802 of a plurality of coefficients 1802, and Figure 18 B is effective figure that illustrated TU802 generates from Figure 18 A.Effectively Figure 182 0 has " 1 " in having each coefficient positions of nonzero value.
TU802 shown in Figure 18 A can use with the similar diagonal scan pattern 1824 of scan pattern of 1302A by coefficient scan and encode, as shown in Figure 18 C.Note, last non-zero coefficient 1822 is located in the 12nd position and the 10th position in y direction in x direction.Because remaining coefficient is zero, so they do not need to be coded by entropy, they do not need to be decoded by decoder 258 yet.By these coefficients not being encoded, bit stream 324 is correspondingly reduced and can be reduced in encoder 240 and the decoder needed processing in 258 places.This functional in order to realize, the last non-zero coefficient 1822 of the TU802 in scan pattern 1824 is used the variable that is called as last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y in Cartesian coordinate, to use the grammer being associated with TU802 to be indicated.These values are delivered to forward decoder in bit stream 314.In the example shown in Figure 18 C, last_significant_coeff_x=12 and last_significant_coeff_y=10.
Can also be on the rightabout shown in Figure 18 C but the same paths starting along the last coefficient from scanning pattern 1824 is carried out scan pattern 1824.This license is more promptly and by considering that less coefficient determines the position of last coefficient of efficiency 1822.
Problem is because TU802 can be the same with 32x32 large, so the compiling of last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y variable needs a large amount of bits.In order to provide similarly functional when the less bit of needs, can adopt two-stage effectively to scheme, it will be greater than specific dimensions, and (for example, TU802 16x16) is divided into the non-overlapped part that is called sub-block of same size (for example 4x4).
Figure 18 D is the figure that illustrates the TU802 that is divided into 16 non-overlapped sub-block 1822A-1822P, and each sub-block 1822 has identical 4x4 dimension and each comprises 16 coefficients.The TU802 of the cutting apart license that result obtains comprises zero level (L0) effectively figure and the effectively definition of multistage effective schema compiler of figure of one-level (L1) for TU802.
It is nonzero coefficient that L0 effectively schemes which coefficient of indication in TU802.If coefficient is nonzero coefficient, the significant_coeff_flag being associated with this coefficient is set to the first value, such as " 1 ".Otherwise the significant_coeff_flag being associated with this coefficient is set to the second value, such as " 0 ".Figure 18 B is the figure illustrating for exemplary L 0 effective Figure 183 0 of the illustrated TU802 of Figure 18 A.
L1 effectively schemes which the 4x4 sub-block of indication in TU802 comprises at least one nonzero coefficient.For example, if 4x4 sub-block (, sub-block 1832A) has at least one nonzero coefficient, the significant_coeffgroup_flag being associated with this sub-block is set to the first value such as " 1 ".For example, otherwise (, sub-block 1832P) significant_coeffgroup_flag is set to the second value such as " 0 ".
Figure 18 E is the figure of L1 effective Figure 184 0 corresponding with the TU802 through cutting apart of Figure 18 D.Note, in Figure 18 D the dotted line sub-block of illustrated TU802 (sub-block 1832D, 1832H and 1832M-1832P) each there is full zero coefficient, and this significant_coeffgroup_flag being associated by the relevant portion with having effective Figure 184 0 of L1 of value " 0 " reflects.Same note, remaining sub-block have at least one nonzero coefficient and therefore sub-block 1832A-1832C, 1832E-1832G and 1832I-1832L each there is the associated significant_coeffgroup_flag with value " 1 ".
And note, for example, if it is similar (that sub-block 1842A-1842P is used with the scan pattern of the 1302A shown in Figure 18 E, diagonally with by sub-block ground) diagonal sub-block scan pattern 1832 scan, sub-block 1832L has therein the last sub-block of nonzero coefficient in the sub-block scan pattern of TU802.This sub-block 1832L is called as last effectively sub-block 1832.
Can calculate and the last effectively position of sub-block 1832L of compiling in bit stream 314.In one embodiment, is expressing with variable last_significant_subblock_coeff_x and last_significant_subblock_coeff_y aspect the horizontal level from upper left quarter sub-block 1832A and upright position last effectively sub-block 1832L position.In the effective figure of exemplary L 1 and scan pattern of Figure 18 E, (last_significant_subblock_coeff_x, last_significant_subblock_coeff_y) is (3,2).Sub-block rather than coefficient for 16x16TU802 coefficient of utilization come definition position that stored range of variables is reduced to 0-15 from 0-3, and along sub-block scan pattern 1834 only to the last effectively sub-block 1832L generate L1 and effectively scheme to permit further saving.
Can for example, in other side (, in the first sub-block from scan pattern 1832A on the number of the sub-block 1832 of sub-block scanning pattern 1834), express the last effectively position of sub-block 1832L.
Figure 19 presents for carrying out the figure of the exemplary techniques of the last sub-block technique of compiling that can be used in HEVC coder/decoder system 202.In frame 1902, determined along sub-block and processed the last sub-block 1832L (for example, last effectively sub-block) that scan pattern 1834 has at least one non-zero TU coefficient.In frame 1904, the determined last effectively position of sub-block 1832L is encoded.As mentioned above, the position of the sub-block 1832L of last efficient coding can be encoded as last_significant_subblock_coeff_x and last_significant_subblock_coeff_y value, or encodes by other grammer.
Next turn to frame 1908, for each sub-block having in sub-block is processed scan pattern before the last effectively sub-block of at least one nonzero coefficient, the first value is encoded.For example, in Figure 18 E, last effectively sub-block 1832 is sub-block 1832L, and for example, in the sub-block (, sub-block 1832A-1832O) above in scan pattern 1834 each is examined to determine which in those sub-blocks comprises non-zero TU802 coefficient.Sub-block (for example sub-block 1832A-1832C, 1832E-1832G and the 1832I-1832K) coding with non-zero TU802 coefficient has the first value (in illustrated example, " 1 ").Note, for the last effectively value of sub-block 1832L, can also be encoded as " 1 " but needn't be like this, because this sub-block has nonzero coefficient by definition.
Figure 18 F is that diagram is used the L1 of the modification that example above generates effectively to scheme the figure of (or sub-block is effectively schemed).Note, because sub-block 1832P is immediately following after the last effectively sub-block 1832L in sub-block scanning pattern 1834, so knowing this sub-block 1832P, people there is no nonzero coefficient, and can skip there the compiling for " 1 " or " 0 " of this piece, thereby saving can be used to the bit that this information is encoded.And, note, for last effectively sub-block 1832L, do not compile the first value (" 1 "), because it comprises that the fact of nonzero coefficient has been known.In the embodiment for replacing, optionally, can to the first value, encode for this sub-block.
The coefficient 1802 of the last effectively sub-block 1832L of 1912 pairs of frames and have the first encoded radio (" 1 ") along sub-block scan pattern 1834 in the end effectively the coefficient of the sub-block 1832 before sub-block 1832L encode.
In the example shown in Figure 18 F, the last effectively coefficient of sub-block 1832L is encoded and is encoded equally along sub-block 1832A-1832C, the 1832E-1832G of sub-block scanning pattern 1834 and the coefficient of 1832I-1832K and 1832M-1832O.Can skip sub-blocks 1832D, 1832H, the coding (as shown in frame 1914) of 1832M-1832O because they are known as, do not comprise nonzero coefficient (because they not with the first encoded radio " 1 " but be associated with the second encoder (" 0 ") on the contrary).Can also skip the coding of piece 1832P, because it is immediately following after the last effectively sub-block 1832L in sub-block scan pattern, and therefore knownly not there is any nonzero coefficient.
Can for example, by the order of sub-block scan pattern 1834 (the first sub-block 1832A from scan pattern is to last effectively sub-block 1832L), realize above, or can realize with anti-order (from last effectively sub-block 1832L and proceed to the first sub-block 1832A sub-block scan pattern 1834).
Figure 20 presents diagram to be had indication it comprises the figure of coefficient of candidate subchunk of the first encoded radio of nonzero coefficient.Such sub-block 1832 is sub-block 1832A, and it is illustrated in the figure.The coefficient 1802 of each sub-block is followed coefficient scanning pattern 2002 and is scanned and encodes.In Figure 20, illustrated coefficient scanning pattern 2002 is followed and the similar scan pattern of sub-block scan pattern 1834, but situation needn't be like this, because coefficient scanning pattern 2002 can be different from sub-block scan pattern 1834.In addition, although illustrated coefficient scanning pattern 2002 is indicated as and is scanned to right lower quadrant coefficient 1802P from the most left top coefficient 1802A in Figure 20, situation needn't be like this, because direction can be put upside down.
Can as shown in Figure 18 G, carry out the compiling of coefficient itself.In this embodiment, generated the effective Figure 182 0 for the coefficient of the sub-block (in illustrated situation, sub-block 1832A) in considering, thereby for whole TU820, produced the corresponding part of effective Figure 182 0 (being illustrated as project 1820A).Difference between the part of coefficient 1832A and effective Figure 182 0A is obtained and as the coefficient 1850A through compiling.For example, the first row of the first sub-block 1832A has value (5,2,0,1).Effective Figure 182 0 (1,1,0,1) value that can deduct these correspondences from TU820 is with generation value (4,1 ,-, 0), and can further compile the value that these results obtain.This allows identical information to be transferred when using less bit.Note, the zero valued coefficients of sub-block 1832A is not encoded in this process, but nonzero coefficient is compiled.
Note, a part that can be used as cataloged procedure for effective Figure 182 0 of TU802 is generated.Yet, use technology above, can be only for last effectively sub-block 1832L and in sub-block scan pattern 1834 sub-block prior to it generate effective Figure 182 0.
Aforementioned techniques can be only applied to surpass the TU802 of specific dimensions or dimension (for example, 16x16,16x4,4x16,32x32,32x8 and 8x32).For broad sense MxN TU802, with the effective figure of two-stage rather than last coefficient of efficiency position, compile last sub-block position:
1.
reduce the scope of last active position: if 16x16TU802 is divided into 4x4 sub-block, and the scope for the last position compiling of last effectively sub-block value is reduced to the 0-3 for 16xN or Nx16TU802 from the 0-15 for last coefficient of efficiency value.Similarly, for the scope of the position of the last compiling of 32xN or Nx32TU802, from 0-31, be reduced to 0-7, wherein N is equal to or less than another dimension.
2.
reduce for compiling the context table size of grammer of the position of last compiling: not for 6 brightness contexts of 16x16 with for each type (I, P, B) 7 brightness contexts of 32x32, but a contextual only half-size scale or even need for the compiling of last sub-block position now than a contextual half-size scale is less.And, likely, for the context of 4x4 and 8x8TU802, can be used to compile the sub-block position of the last compiling of 16x16 and 32x32TU802.In this case, can remove 16x16 and 32x32 context completely.Finally, for wherein M ≠ N and max (M, N), being more than or equal to 16 MxN TU802, may be also possible at the identical beneficial effect aspect context reduction.
Return to Figure 19, dotted line frame 1906 and 1910 indications except discussed those the operation that can be carried out alternatively.For example, in embodiment above, for have nonzero coefficient in scan pattern 1834 in the end effectively 1832 pairs of the first values of each sub-block " 1 " before sub-block 1832L encode.Therefore any sub-block of the first value of coding is not known as and does not comprise the coefficient with nonzero value, and therefore needn't compile this true information of describing.Yet, in one embodiment, can for have nonzero coefficient (or full zero coefficient) in the end effectively 1832 pairs of the second values of each sub-block (such as " 0 ") before sub-block 1832L do not encode.In this embodiment, can skip the coefficient of the sub-block with the second value.
Figure 19 refers to wherein last another optional embodiment that effectively encoded equally in the position of the last non-zero coefficient 1822 of sub-block 1832L equally, as shown in frame 1906.
Although saved many bits according to the compiling of last effectively sub-block rather than last coefficient of efficiency, it can cause following the tracks of many bits of the last coefficient of efficiency with the null value that will be compiled equally.For example, in Figure 18 E, last effectively sub-block is sub-block 1832L.If being all compiled in the coefficient in this sub-block 1832L (and subsequently decoding), many coefficients (for example, immediately following last non-zero coefficient 1822 zero coefficient afterwards) below will be by Code And Decode unnecessarily.
Figure 21 is the last effectively figure of sub-block 1832L of TU802.Coefficient 1822 is effective last coefficients of efficiency on the coefficient scanning pattern 2002 of sub-block 1832L in the end, and therefore, is complete zero and does not need to be compiled in coefficient scanning pattern immediately following the coefficient after this coefficient 1822.Therefore the coding that, can skip these coefficients is processed and bit to save.This can realize by the last effectively last coefficient of efficiency 1822 of sub-block 1832L is defined as to last coefficient along coefficient scanning pattern 2002 in having the last sub-block 1832L of nonzero value, thereby is encoded in the determined last effectively position of the last coefficient of efficiency of sub-block.In one embodiment, last effectively sub-block coefficient value can be enough be expressed away from the coefficient elements displacement of the upper left quarter coefficient of last effectively sub-block 1832L.In Figure 21 in illustrated example, for example, last effectively sub-block coefficient positions can be described to last_significant_subblock_last_significant_coeff_x=0 and last_significant_subblock_last_significant_coeff_y=1.This last effectively coding of the TU802 coefficient of sub-block 1832L can stop, and the coding of zero coefficient is below skipped.
Turn back to Figure 19, can realize in many ways the process of determining the last sub-block with at least one nonzero coefficient along sub-block pattern Processing.In one embodiment, this realizes by the last_significant_coeff_x and the last_significant_coeff_y value that can the prior operation from encoder 312 obtain.These last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y value can be used to calculate last effectively sub-block 1832L position.For example, last coefficient of efficiency 1822 positions of TU802 can be in Cartesian coordinate by dividing the coordinate of last coefficient of efficiency 1822 for each coordinate direction by associated sub-block dimension and abandoning remainder and be associated with last effectively sub-block 1832L.In the example shown in Figure 18 D, for example, last coefficient of efficiency value is that (12,10) and sub-block dimension are 4x4.In this case, last effectively sub-block can be confirmed as (int[12/4], int[10/4])=(3,2), wherein int[*] function returns to the integer being produced by operation.For example, if last effectively sub-block is otherwise defined (number of the sub-block from the first sub-block in sub-block scan pattern), still can shines upon last sub-block from last coefficient of efficiency position, but may need more complicated algorithm more.
If last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_coeff_y value are not useable for being mapped to the last effectively position of sub-block position, they can be simply by with array scanning pattern 1824 maybe by be used in identical sub-block scan pattern 1834 in decoder and coefficient scanning pattern 2002 come scan fraction to the last nonzero coefficient found till and determined.This can start by the last coefficient place of the TU802 in scan pattern 1824 and scanning until nonzero coefficient is found or start and scan whole TU802 advantageously to carry out by the first coefficient place at TU802.
Can put into practice in other embodiments technology described above.For example, be not determine last effectively sub-block and only in the end effectively those sub-blocks before sub-block compile the first value, but can put into practice this technology by the coefficient of scanning TU802 and the last sub-block that compiles the first value (and only compiling the second value for all sub-blocks with null value alternatively) and last effectively sub-block is appointed as to first value in sub-block scan pattern with compiling for all sub-blocks with nonzero value.This technology is useful at the effective figure of complete L1 level be available in the situation that, because can easily find out last effectively sub-block from the effective figure of complete L1.
Figure 22 is diagram for to using the figure of the exemplary techniques that TU802 coefficient that last coefficient sets position technique above described above has been encoded decodes.As mentioned above, cataloged procedure creates and for example comprises, for the last effectively bit stream 314 of the grammer (last_significant_subblock_coeff_x and last_significant_subblock_coeff_y) of sub-block.2202 pairs of conducts of frame have the last effectively position of sub-block 1832L of the last sub-block of at least one nonzero coefficient and decode along sub-block processing scan pattern 1834.Depend on how last effectively sub-block is encoded, (for example, as last_significant_subblock_coeff_x and last_significant_subblock_coeff_y, the number of the sub-block in scan pattern from the first sub-block, or use line index as described above or column index), this may need to use and with grammer transmission, is illustrated that the information of different scan patterns calculates last effectively sub-block position.
Frame 2206 for have at least one nonzero coefficient along sub-block process scan pattern in the end 1832 pairs of the first values of each sub-block (for example " 1 ") before sub-block 1832L decode.This can be for example by the whole circulations in the sub-block 1832 through before sub-block 1832L in the end and to decoding to realize with each significant_coeff_group being associated sign in sub-block.This identification has in the end effective sub-block 1832L all sub-blocks 1832 before of nonzero coefficient.This can along in the end effectively sub-block 1832L place start and the first sub-block 1832A place in scan pattern finishes or from the first sub-block 1832A in scan pattern and the sub-block scan pattern of in the end effective sub-block 1832L end carry out.
Last effectively sub-block 1832L and to have the coefficient of sub-block of the first encoded radio (for example " 1 ") then decoded, as shown in frame 2210.Again, this can follow sub-block scan pattern 1834 in either direction, and can in either direction, in coefficient scanning pattern 2002, carry out the scanning of the coefficient in each sub-block 1832.As shown in frame 2212, can skip in the decoding not having with the coefficient in the sub-block 1832 of the significant_coeff_group sign of the first value, because knowing the coefficient in these sub-blocks, people all there is null value.In addition, do not need to carry out the decoding of for example, coefficient in the sub-block (sub-block 1832P) of closelying follow last effectively sub-block 1832L in sub-block scan pattern 1834, because people know such sub-block, do not comprise nonzero coefficient.
Do not have the first value as described earlier, can inferring any sub-block 1832 of associated significant_coeff_group sign of (" 1 ") can be presumed to be has full zero coefficient.Yet in the embodiment described in Figure 19, frame 1910 is encoded to the second value for each sub-block before sub-block is processed in scan pattern sub-block in the end with full zero coefficient.Therefore, the state of such sub-block 1832 is indicated clearly and is described by the significant_coeff_group with the second value (" 0 ").In this case, the decoding having with the coefficient of any sub-block 1832 of the associated significant_coeff_group sign of the second value is skipped, and makes those sub-blocks 1832 that are only associated with the significant_coeff_group sign with the first value to make their coefficient decoded.This is illustrated in the frame 2208 of Figure 22.
And as described in the frame 1906 of Figure 19, last coefficient of efficiency in the end effectively the position in sub-block 1832L can encode with last_significant_subblock_last_significant_coeff_x and last_significant_subblock_last_significant_coeff_y variable.If such information is encoded in bit stream 314, to decode and make the last effectively position of the last coefficient of efficiency of sub-block be known to 2204 pairs of these information of frame.The decoding of the last effectively coefficient of sub-block 1832L can (for example coefficient 1822) be located to start in this position, and along coefficient scanning path 2002, proceed in the opposite direction last effectively the first coefficient of sub-block 1832L, or can start at the first coefficient place and in the end coefficient of efficiency 1822 places finish.Note, from the last coefficient of efficiency of whole TU802 array being compiled and encoding that this is to improve, because be described in the value of the last coefficient of efficiency in 4x4 sub-block, will only need to be compiled in the value between 0-3 rather than 0-16 or 0-32.
