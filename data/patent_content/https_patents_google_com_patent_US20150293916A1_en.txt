- Finding desirable media content can be difficult for a user.
- a user may search for “action movies” or browse movies in the “action” category.
- search results presented in response to the query or within the “action” category may be a large set of movies that satisfy the search query or are in the “action” category.
- Some services may also provide a set of filters that allow the user to refine search results or filter the display of content such as by price, date, rating, etc.; however, these types of filters are typically static and are not relevant to the search results or the particular content being displayed. In addition, these filters may not be customized to the user who performed the search or is browsing for content.
- the present disclosure provides a technique for creating one or more filters for a set of content items based on one or more common attributes identified in the set of content items and a user history associated with a user. For example, multiple content items in a set, such as a set of movies, may be associated with a common attribute, such as a particular actor.
- a user history associated with a user may indicate that the user has previously watched movies including the same actor.
- a filter may be created allowing the user to filter the set of content items based on the particular actor, thereby only displaying those content items with which the particular actor is associated. Accordingly, one or more filters may be created which are contextual to the set of content items and also personally relevant to a user.
- created filters may vary from user to user depending upon the particular set of content items being displayed and the user history associated with each user.
- a common attribute identified among multiple content items may be any feature, quality, characteristic, identifier, entity, and the like, associated with one or more content items among multiple content items.
- display of the created filters may be integrated within the display of the set of content items, and may appear in the same visual format as each of the content items, such that while a user navigates or scrolls through the set of content items, the created filter(s) may appear in-line with the content items.
- a user may search for “adventure movies” and the system may identify a set of movies, e.g., 50 movies that satisfy the search query.
- a content service may be any service, such as, for example, a website or an application, that a user may use to search for, browse, identify, activate (e.g., play, view, display, etc.), and/or receive content from a content provider.
- the system may identify one or more common attributes associated with the movies, and may determine that the actor Brad Pitt is associated with 6 of these movies.
- the system may obtain a user history associated with the user, and based on the user history, the system may determine that the user has purchased one or more movies associated with the actor Brad Pitt.
- a filter for “movies with Brad Pitt” may be created and presented to the user along with the set of 50 movies. If the user selects the created filter “movies with Brad Pitt”, only the 6 movies that include Brad Pitt may be displayed to the user.
- statically displaying a set of standard filters only those filters which are contextual to the displayed content items and a user history may be created and displayed. For example, if none of the movies in a set of movies is a horror movie, a filter for horror movies may not be created and/or displayed.
- a user may search for “cooking application”.
- the system may identify a set of 26 applications that satisfy the search query “cooking application.”
- the system may determine that 8 of the applications are particularly popular in a geographic area associated with the user.
- a filter may be created such as “popular in your area”. By selecting this filter, only the 8 applications that are popular in the user's geographic area would be displayed.
- the present disclosure includes displaying a user interface that includes a set of content items and a created filter.
- the created filter may be displayed in the same visual format as one of the content items.
- the created filter may be embedded among the displayed content items so that as the user scrolls through the content items, the one or more created filters may appear in-line among the content items.

Abstract
Description
- Finding desirable media content (e.g., movies, books, applications, videos, music, videos, search results, etc.) can be difficult for a user. For instance, within a media service, a user may search for “action movies” or browse movies in the “action” category. Typically, search results presented in response to the query or within the “action” category may be a large set of movies that satisfy the search query or are in the category. Some services may also provide a set of filters that allow the user to refine search results or filter the display of content such as by price, date, rating, etc.; however, these types of filters are typically static and are not relevant to the search results or the particular content being displayed.

FIG. 4 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - Finding desirable media content (e.g., movies, books, applications, music, videos, search results, etc.) can be difficult for a user. For instance, within a media service, a user may search for “action movies” or browse movies in the “action” category. Typically, search results presented in response to the query or within the “action” category may be a large set of movies that satisfy the search query or are in the “action” category. Some services may also provide a set of filters that allow the user to refine search results or filter the display of content such as by price, date, rating, etc.; however, these types of filters are typically static and are not relevant to the search results or the particular content being displayed. In addition, these filters may not be customized to the user who performed the search or is browsing for content.
- The present disclosure provides a technique for creating one or more filters for a set of content items based on one or more common attributes identified in the set of content items and a user history associated with a user. For example, multiple content items in a set, such as a set of movies, may be associated with a common attribute, such as a particular actor. In addition, a user history associated with a user may indicate that the user has previously watched movies including the same actor. As a result, a filter may be created allowing the user to filter the set of content items based on the particular actor, thereby only displaying those content items with which the particular actor is associated. Accordingly, one or more filters may be created which are contextual to the set of content items and also personally relevant to a user. In particular, created filters may vary from user to user depending upon the particular set of content items being displayed and the user history associated with each user. A common attribute identified among multiple content items may be any feature, quality, characteristic, identifier, entity, and the like, associated with one or more content items among multiple content items. Additionally, display of the created filters may be integrated within the display of the set of content items, and may appear in the same visual format as each of the content items, such that while a user navigates or scrolls through the set of content items, the created filter(s) may appear in-line with the content items.
- As an example, while using a content service, a user may search for “adventure movies” and the system may identify a set of movies, e.g., 50 movies that satisfy the search query. A content service may be any service, such as, for example, a website or an application, that a user may use to search for, browse, identify, activate (e.g., play, view, display, etc.), and/or receive content from a content provider. Based on the set of 50 movies, the system may identify one or more common attributes associated with the movies, and may determine that the actor Brad Pitt is associated with 6 of these movies. In addition, the system may obtain a user history associated with the user, and based on the user history, the system may determine that the user has purchased one or more movies associated with the actor Brad Pitt. As a result, a filter for “movies with Brad Pitt” may be created and presented to the user along with the set of 50 movies. If the user selects the created filter “movies with Brad Pitt”, only the 6 movies that include Brad Pitt may be displayed to the user. Instead of statically displaying a set of standard filters only those filters which are contextual to the displayed content items and a user history may be created and displayed. For example, if none of the movies in a set of movies is a horror movie, a filter for horror movies may not be created and/or displayed.
- As another example, while using a content service, a user may search for “cooking application”. The system may identify a set of 26 applications that satisfy the search query “cooking application.” Among the set of 26 applications, the system may determine that 8 of the applications are particularly popular in a geographic area associated with the user. As a result, a filter may be created such as “popular in your area”. By selecting this filter, only the 8 applications that are popular in the user's geographic area would be displayed.
- In addition to creating a filter based on a common attribute and a user history, the present disclosure includes displaying a user interface that includes a set of content items and a created filter. In particular, the created filter may be displayed in the same visual format as one of the content items. Rather than always displaying the created filter at the same location in a user interface, the created filter may be embedded among the displayed content items so that as the user scrolls through the content items, the one or more created filters may appear in-line among the content items. As a result, exploring and browsing content items may be more immersive and enjoyable for a user and filtering content items may require less interaction and navigation by the user of the user interface.
-
FIG. 1 shows an example process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. As shown multiple content item identifiers may be obtained, at 101. A content item identifier may identify a content item and may be in any suitable format for identifying a content item. A content item may be of a content-type such as a media item, a movie, a book, a song, an album, a magazine, a show, a video, an application, a product, a website, and the like. A content item identifier may be, for example, an image, a graphic, an icon, a link, an action item, a clip, text, and the like. In most cases, a content identifier could be any visual depiction that is easily identifiable to a user as identifying a content item. As an example, a content item identifier that identifies a content item such as a song may be an image associated with the song, the album cover associated with the song, album artwork associated with the song, an image of the artist of the song, an option to play an audio clip of the song, and the like. As another example, a content item identifier that identifies a content item such as a game may be an icon associated with the game, a link to purchase the game, an action item associated with the game such as an option to add the game to the user's cart or wish list, and the like. An action item may also include an option to activate a content item such as play or view the media item. - Multiple content items may be identified by multiple content item identifiers. In some cases, the content items identified may be based on a search query received from a user. In other cases, each of the multiple content items may be associated with the same category of content. A category of content may be any category in which content may be categorized such as new releases, recently purchased content, recently previewed content, recommended content, a library of content, a list of content (e.g., a playlist), an album, an artist, a radio station, a genre, an actor, a type of content (e.g., movies, books, songs, albums, magazines, shows, videos, applications, products, websites, etc.) and the like. In some cases, the multiple content item identifiers may identify content items in more than one category of content and of more than one content-type.
- Referring back to
FIG. 1 , at 102, one or more common attributes associated with each of multiple content items may be identified, and each content item may be identified by one content item identifier. In some cases, the number of content items associated with a particular common attribute may be less than the number of content item identifiers being displayed in a user interface. For example, 10 content item identifiers identifying 10 content items may be displayed in a user interface, such as 10 movies. Among the 10 movies, only 4 movies may be associated with the specific common attribute of Brad Pitt as an actor. In this case, the number of movies associated with the common attribute of Brad Pitt, i.e., 4, is less than the number of content item identifiers, i.e., 10, being displayed in the user interface. An attribute of a content item may be any quality, characteristic, entity, and the like that may be associated with a content item. For example, attributes associated with the song Blanket may be an artist, an album, a price of the song or the album associated with song, the genre associated with the song, a release date of the song, a rating of the song, a producer of the song, an award associated with the song, a geographic region in which the song is popular, a social media characteristic of the song, and the like. In general, a content item may be associated with any number of attributes. One or more common attributes associated with multiple content items may be identified by determining that the multiple content items are associated with the same attribute(s). As in the example above, each of the 10 movies may be associated with multiple attributes. A common attribute of Brad Pitt as an actor may be associated with 4 of the movies, a common attribute of the release date of 2013 may be associated with 2 of the movies, and a common attribute of receiving an Oscar award may be associated with 3 of the movies, etc. - Following identification of one or more common attributes associated with multiple content items, a filter may be created based on an attribute from among the one or more common attributes and a user history, at 103. In addition, for example, a second filter may be created based on a second attribute from among the one or more common attributes and the user history. A user history associated with a user may be based on one or multiple sources of user history associated with a user. A source of user history for a user may be any source of information regarding a user's previous activity. Examples of sources of user history associated with a user may be a content library of the user, content preferences of the user, a content viewing history of the user, a content listening history of the user from a content service provider, a purchase history of the user from one or more retailers, a webpage viewing history of the user, a conversion history of the user based on previously presented purchasable content, a purchasable content viewing history of the user, an ad selection history of the user, a social media activity of the user, and the like. As an example, a user's content library may include a particular song that the user may have previously purchased. Accordingly, this information may be included in a user history associated with the user such that a filter may be created for content items associated with the same artist. User history for a user may be collected from multiple different sources, such as from a content provider, an online retailer, an internet search provider, a video sharing site, a website, a social network, and the like. Alternatively or in addition, various techniques may be used to identify a user history associated with a user from various sources of user history such that a filter may be created based on a common attribute identified among multiple content items and a user history.
- In general, because filters are created based on a common attribute identified among content items and a user history, the number of filters that may be created for a set of multiple content items may be infinite. For example, a user may be browsing content items such as applications. One or more filters may be created based on one or more common attributes identified among the applications and the user's history. Examples of filters that may be created when browsing applications may include filter types such as suitable for kids, cooking applications, games for playing in a short period of time, games for playing over a long period of time, popular applications in your area, popular applications in NY, etc. In addition, the filters created may be unique to each content browsing session since the content items displayed during each browsing session may be different according to the category of content that is being browsed or the particular search query received from a user. Additionally, the created filters may be different for each user since the user's history is taken into account when creating the filter. This technique may result in creation of one or more filters that are contextual to multiple content items being displayed in an interface and personal to a user according to the user's history, which may increase a user's ability to identify desirable content.
- Returning to
FIG. 1 , a user interface may be displayed that includes the created filter and the multiple content item identifiers, at 104. In particular, the filter may be displayed among the multiple content item identifiers and may have the same visual format as one of the content item identifiers. In cases in which more than one filter is created, the user interface may further include the additional filter(s), the additional filter(s) may be displayed among the multiple content item identifiers and may have the same visual format as one of the content item identifiers. Rather than presenting content items and created filters in a static list format to a user, a user interface may display a created filter in-line with multiple content item identifiers such that the created filter appears to be integrated among the multiple content item identifiers. As an example, a user interface as described herein may be a scrollable interface that may display multiple content item identifiers and created filters and which may be navigable by a user by scrolling up and/or down, such as by using a touch screen device. According to an implementation, a scrollable user interface may display a first filter prior to second filter such that the first filter may be displayed before the second filter as a user scrolls through the interface from top to bottom. By embedding filters among multiple content item identifiers and displaying content item identifiers and created filters in the same visual format, exploring multiple content items may be more enjoyable for a user and may feel more immersive by not requiring as much interaction by a user, as the user may not have to repeatedly navigate to the static location of a set of standard filters. - In addition, the user interface as described herein may be more aesthetically pleasing to a user since the content item identifiers and created filters may be displayed in the same visual format. The visual format of each of a content item identifier and a created filter may be any format suitable for display in a portion and/or section of a user interface. For example, a visual format may be a defined visual area, region and/or shape that may include any one or a combination of a content item identifier, a created filter, an image, text, a label, information associated with a created filter, and the like.

FIG. 2 shows an example user interface arrangement according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. A user may perform a search for adventure movies and the results of the search may be included in the user interface shown inFIG. 2 . As shown, auser interface 200 may include multiplecontent item identifiers content item identifier content item identifier 201 may identify a content item, i.e., the movie Party Chick,content item identifier 202 may identify a content item, i.e., the movie The Lion Queen,content item identifier 203 may identify a content item, i.e., the movie Dreams,content item identifier 204 may identify a content item, i.e., the movie Touchdown, and so on such that each of the othercontent item identifiers content item identifiers content item identifiers filter 212 may be created based on the identified common attribute of Brad Pitt and the user history indicating the user's preference for movies associated with Brad Pitt. Theuser interface 200 may be displayed and may include thefilter 212 for Brad Pitt and thecontent item identifiers filter 212 for Brad Pitt may be displayed in the same visual format as one of the content item identifiers. In particular, theuser interface 200 may display the createdfilter 212 in-line with the multiplecontent item identifiers filter 212 appears to be integrated among multiple content item identifiers. Although not shown,filter 212 may also include an image, e.g., an image of Brad Pitt, text, a label, information associated with a created filter, and the like. - Multiple filters may be created for a set of content items. For example, a second common attribute of Uma Thurman may be associated with multiple content items, such as the movies Party Chick and Dreams, identified by the
content item identifiers filter 213 may be created based on the identified common attribute of Uma Thurman and the user history indicating the user's past sharing of a movie associated with Uma Thurman. As shown, theuser interface 200 may also include thefilter 213 for Uma Thurman, which may also be displayed in the same visual format as one of the content item identifiers. According to an implementation, both of thefilters filters content item identifiers - Although
filter 212 is displayed in a position abovefilter 213 in theuser interface 200, in some cases, placement of each of thefilters content item identifiers user interface 200. According to an implementation, a first filter may be displayed either above a second filter or to the left of the second filter and horizontally aligned with the second filter. For example, filter 212 may be displayed at any location in-line with thecontent item identifiers filter 213. As another example, filter 212 may be displayed to the left offilter 213, for instance at the location where thecontent item identifier 202 is displayed, in which case,content item identifier 202 may be displayed at a different location in theuser interface 200. - In some cases in which multiple filters are created and displayed in a user interface, display of each of the filters relative to the other filters may be prioritized according to various techniques. According to an implementation, a first and second filter may be displayed among the multiple content item identifiers according to priorities assigned to each of the first and second filters. In some cases, a created filter may not be displayed in a static location but rather can change positions based on the importance of the filter to the content items and/or to the other created filters. As an example, among the content items displayed in
FIG. 2 , multiple filters may be created according to the techniques described herein. These created filters may include Brad Pitt, Uma Thurman, Christopher Nolan, and Steven Spielberg. In some cases, the importance of a filter may be defined by the type of filter. For example, a filter for an actor associated with a content item may be prioritized over a filter for a director associated with a content item. In this case, the created filters for Brad Pitt and Uma Thurman may be prioritized over the created filters for Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg. As such, the created filters for Brad Pitt and Uma Thurman may be displayed before (e.g., above or to the left of) the created filters for Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg. As another example, display of created filters may be prioritized based on the number of content items associated with the created filter and/or based on the popularity of the created filter in a category of content items. For example, among the content items displayed inuser interface 200, the common attribute of Brad Pitt may be associated with 3 content items and Uma Thurman may be associated with 2 content items. As a result, since the number of content items associated with Brad Pitt is greater than the number of content items associated with Uma Thurman, a filter created for Brad Pitt may be prioritized relative to the filter created for Uma Thurman. As another example, if within the “Adventure Movies” category of content items movies directed by Christopher Nolan are more popular than movies directed by Steven Spielberg, the filter created for Christopher Nolan may be prioritized relative to the filter created for Steven Spielberg. As yet another example, within the movies category of content items, a filter for an actor may be a more popular filter type than a filter for director of a movie, as such, a created filter for an actor may be prioritized relative to a filter for a director of a movie. Prioritization of created filters may be based on a user setting, a default setting, a system setting, and the like. - One or more filters displayed in a user interface may be selected at any time while the user interface is being displayed. According to an implementation, an indication may be received of a selection of a filter, and as a result, a second user interface may be displayed. The second user interface may include a first portion of the multiple content item identifiers identifying a first portion of the multiple content items associated with an attribute and the user history. Referring back to
FIG. 2 , an indication of a selection of theBrad Pitt filter 212 may be received and the content items may be filtered accordingly. As a result, a second user interface (not shown) may be displayed which includes only thecontent item identifiers content item identifiers - Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures.
