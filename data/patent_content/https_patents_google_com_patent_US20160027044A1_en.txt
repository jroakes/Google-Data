Definitions
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results.
- Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- the method can include receiving, by a server device, a plurality of snapshots associated with use of a computing device by a user, each snapshot from the plurality of snapshots being based on content presented to the user on the computing device.
- the method can further include evaluating the plurality of snapshots, including, for each respective snapshot: identifying a respective set of entities indicated by the respective snapshot, and storing, to a memory, indications of the respective set of entities and a respective timestamp indicating a respective time that the respective snapshot was captured, wherein the respective set of entities and respective timestamp are associated in the memory.
- the method can further include determining, based on a first snapshot from the plurality of snapshots, a first time to present one or more information cards to the user.
- the method can further include, at the first time, locating in memory entities having a time stamp that corresponds to the first time.
- the method can further include generating an information card based on the one or more of the located entities.
- the method can further include providing, for presentation to the user, the generated information card.

- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- Snapshots can be captured and evaluated on an ongoing basis based on content that is presented to one or more users on their respective user devices.
- Content may be presented to a user in, for example, a browser, an application (e.g., a mobile app), a web site, an advertisement, a social network page, or other digital content environments.
- Each snapshot may include at least a portion of one or more of a calendar entry, a map, an email message, a social network page entry, a web page element, an image, or some other content.
- Evaluating a particular snapshot can include identifying associated entities, (e.g., persons, places (e.g., specific locations, addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, or other specific geographic locations), things (such as phone numbers), subjects, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), or other identifiable entities.
- a timestamp associated with receipt of a snapshot can also be stored in association with the snapshot and/or entities upon which the snapshot is based.
- Target presentation times can be determined, based on, for example a timestamp associated with receipt of the snapshot, and/or based on times of one or more events identified using the snapshot.
- one or more information cards that identify one or more of the entities can be provided (e.g., for presentation to the user).
- Each information card can also indicate, for example, a context that the user can use to understand the rationale for the display of the given information card.
- At least one call to action can also be included in the information card, to, for example, allow the user to perform an action associated with an entity (such as dialing a phone number, obtaining driving directions, or receiving additional information).
- An information card can serve as a prompt of sorts (e.g., for the user to remember a concept and/or some other piece(s) of information), or the information card can serve as a reminder of an upcoming event.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized to where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Users can be automatically presented with an information card that is relevant to an event or a subject associated with content that they have received.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110 , stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102 , generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these.
- a data store of entities 131 can include a list of entities that can be used to identify entities in snapshots of content presented to users. Entities can include, for example, phone numbers, locations (e.g., addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, specific geographic locations), subjects (e.g., related to topics), names of people, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), email addresses, organization names, products, movies, music, or other subjects that can be represented, e.g., in a knowledge graph or other information representation.
- a data store of entities 131 can include, for example, plural entries, one for each snapshot evaluated.
- a snapshot can be evaluated after capture and one or more top ranked or most significant entities that are included or referenced in a snapshot can be stored as a group (e.g., an entry in the data store of entities 131 ).
- a data store of timestamps 132 can include timestamps associated with times that respective snapshots were captured.
- the timestamps can be associated with the entities that are identified from the respective snapshots.
- a data store of events 133 can include information associated with events that have been identified from a respective snapshot.
- information for an event can include one or more of a date, a start time, an end time, a duration, names of participants, an associated location, associated phone numbers and/or other contact information (e.g., email addresses), an event type (e.g., meeting, birthday, lunch date), and a description or context (e.g., that was obtained from the respective snapshot).
- a data store of target presentation times 134 can include one or more times that are established, by the content management system 110 , for the presentation of a respective information card.
- a target presentation time established for a lunch date may include a time that is one hour before the lunch date (e.g., as a reminder to leave or prepare for the lunch date) and a designated time on the day or night before the lunch date to inform the user of the next day's lunch date.
- Some or all of the data stores discussed can be combined in a single data store, such as a data store that includes a combination of identified entities, events, timestamps and target presentation times, all being associated with a single snapshot.
- the content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102 ).
- a snapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate snapshots of content presented to a user on a device. For each snapshot, for example, the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify entities and/or events included in the snapshot and store the identified entities/events along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured or presentation time.
- An information card engine 122 can perform functions associated with gathering information for use in information cards, generating the information cards, and determining times for presenting the information cards. For example, after the received snapshots are evaluated, the information card engine 122 can determine content for inclusion in an information card and a time to present one or more information cards to the user, including determining a target time for the presentation. Selection of content and timing of presentation is discussed in greater detail below.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can, for example, access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- other information such as information obtained from one or more snapshots, can be used to respond to the received request.
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of a system 200 for presenting information cards 201 based on entities associated with snapshots 202 of content presented to users.
- snapshots 202 can be captured over time from content 204 a, 204 b that is presented to a user 206 on a user device 106 a.
- the content 204 a, 204 b can be all or a portion of content (e.g., only content in active windows) in a display area associated with a user device.
- the content 204 a, 204 b may be presented in one or more of a browser, an application, a web site, an advertisement, a social network page, or some other user interface or application.
- the content 204 a, 204 b can include one or more of a calendar entry, a map, an email message, a social network page entry, a web page element, an image, or some other content or element.
- the snapshots 202 of the content 204 a, 204 b can be evaluated, for example, to identify associated entities 131 , such as phone numbers, locations (e.g., addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, specific geographic locations), subjects, names of people, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), or other identifiable entities.
- Timestamps 132 associated with the received snapshots 202 can be used with the identified entities 131 , for example, to identify target presentation times 133 of information cards 201 associated with the entities 131 . At times corresponding to the target presentation times 133 , for example, the content management system 110 can provide information cards 201 for presentation to the user 206 .
- one or more events can be identified based on the entities included in a snapshot (e.g., a calendar entry identifying a person, place and phone number).
- a first time e.g., in the future
- the event can be stored (e.g., in the repository of events 133 ) along with the first time.
- a second time that is before the event can be determined, such as a time by which the user 206 needs to be notified to leave in order to arrive at the event on time.
- the second time can be a time to perform an action relative to the event before the event is to occur, such as ordering flowers for an anniversary or sending a card for a birthday.
- Determining a time to present an information card can include determining that a current time (e.g., the present time) is equal to the second time (e.g., an hour before the lunch date).
- the information card can be presented for the event at the second time.
- the following example stages can be used for providing information cards.
- the content management system 110 can receive the snapshots 202 , e.g., a plurality of snapshots that are associated with a use of the user device 106 a by a user 206 .
- the received snapshots 202 can include snapshots of content 204 a, 204 b presented to the user 206 on the user device 106 a.
- the snapshots 202 can include snapshots taken from an email message (e.g., content 204 a ) or from an image (e.g., content 204 b ), and/or from other content presented to the user 206 .
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate the received snapshots 202 . For example, for each snapshot, the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify entities 131 included in a snapshot 202 .
- the entities that are identified for the snapshot 202 obtained from the content 204 a can include Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's cell phone number.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the identified entities (or a subset thereof, such as most prominent entities) along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured. In some implementations, as part of the determining entities process, a determination can be made whether any determined entities are related to each other, such as related to a common event.
- timestamps can be stored in the data store of timestamps 132 , e.g., for later use in generating and presenting information cards 201 related to the snapshots 202 .
- one or more entities may be associated with an event. That is, an entity may be a person, and the event may relate to a meeting with the person (as indicated by the content included in an email message that is shown in the snapshot being evaluated).
- a calendar item can be set up in the user's calendar and optionally in calendars of other users associated with the event (e.g., including users who are not necessarily event attendees).
- events that are identified can include events for which the user is not to attend, but from which the user may still benefit by received an information card (e.g., a coupon expiration for an on-line sale). Events are discussed in more detail below.
- Evaluation of the snapshot 202 associated with the content 204 a can determine that a lunch date event exists between the user 206 (e.g., Bob) and Carol.
- Other information identified from the snapshot 202 can include time, location information, and a phone number.
- entities that are identified can include Bob, Carol, the restaurant (e.g., J's), and Carol's phone number.
- a context can be determined associated with the snapshot and/or event.
- Context information can be determined, stored and later accessed, for example, to provide a user with information as to why a particular information card was presented.
- other information can be included in a context, such as identification of the app or other source from which the snapshot was extracted, the way that the information was evaluated, or a context associated with a screen shot.
- the context information can be in the form of a snippet of text from which the entity or event was extracted.
- the snippet on which the context is based can be formatted to highlight the relevant pieces of information.
- the information card engine 122 can determine a time to present one or more information cards to the user including determining a target time.
- target times can be stored in the data store of target presentation times 134 .
- the information card engine 122 can determine a reminder time for Bob that is one hour before the scheduled noon lunch date.
- multiple times to present information cards can be determined, e.g., to include a reminder, to be sent the night before, that Bob has a lunch date with Carol the following day.
- target times can be determined using various factors, such as a mode of transportation, a distance, a location and/or other factors.
- target times can include one or more times since the concept was originally presented to the user, e.g., in the form of content from which a respective snapshot was obtained.
- the information card engine 122 can identify entities from the stored entities 131 based on a comparison of the target time with timestamps associated with a respective entity of the stored entities. For example, for the lunch date that is scheduled for Carol and Bob, the information card engine 122 can identify information to be used in an information card that is associated with the pending lunch date. For example, Carol's phone number can be an entity that can be identified for the generation of the information card, e.g., for a reminder to Bob that is sent at a target time one hour before the lunch date and that also includes Carol's cell phone number.
- the information card engine 122 can generate the information card 201 based on the one or more identified entities 131 .
- information card 201 can include information associated with the lunch date and Carol's cell phone number.
- the information card 201 can be stored, e.g., at the content management system 110 , for use in multiple subsequent presentations of the same information card.
- the content management system 110 can provide, for presentation to the user, the information card 201 .
- the information card 201 may be provided to the user device 106 a for presentation on a screen 208 c, which may be the same or different screen as screens 208 a, 208 b from which the snapshots 202 were obtained from plural user sessions 210 for the user 206 .
- the screens 208 a , 208 b, 208 c can be screens that are presented on multiple ones of user devices 106 a that are associated with the user 206 .
- the time at which the information card is presented can be a time since the concept associated with the information card was originally presented to the user, e.g., in the form of content from which a respective snapshot was obtained.
- the information card can be provided to jog the user's memory.
- the time at which the information card is presented can also be a time relative to an event (e.g., the lunch date) that is associated with the information card.
- some information cards 201 may be applicable to more than one user.
- the content management system 110 can provide information cards 201 to all parties associated with an event, such as to both Bob and Carol with regard to their pending lunch date.
- the user when snapshots are evaluated in anticipation of potentially providing information cards to the user, the user can optionally receive a notification (e.g., along the lines of “You may be receiving information cards based on X . . . ”).
- users can have an option to change when and how information cards are to be presented, either individually by groups (or by types of information cards), or globally.
- users can be presented with controls for specifying the type of information that can be used for information cards, such as checkbox controls along the lines of “Don't use information from my email to generate information cards.”
- users can control the times that information cards are to be presented, e.g., times of day or times for specific snapshots.
- users can be provided with transparency controls for any particular information card, e.g., to learn how or why an information card was prepared and presented.
- FIG. 2B shows an example information card 220 a associated with a phone number entity.
- the information card 220 a can be presented an hour before Bob and Carol's pending lunch date.
- the information card 220 a can include, for example, a notification caption 222 a (e.g., “Dialer . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is a type that is associated with a phone number, e.g., Carol's cell phone number.
- a context 224 a can identify the context associated with the information card.
- the context 224 a can include (or be determined from) part of the snapshot 202 , including a snippet of Bob's email message received from Carol that contains information (e.g., location, phone number, date 226 a ) associated with the pending lunch date.
- the information card 220 a can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 a, such as a control, displayed with the information card on Bob's smart phone, for dialing Carol's cell phone number).
- Other calls-to-action 228 a are possible in this example, such as a call-to-action to display a map to the restaurant.
- FIG. 2C shows an example information card 220 b associated with a location entity.
- the information card 220 b can include, for example, a notification caption 222 b (e.g., “Location . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is associated with a location, e.g., Paris, France.
- the information card 220 b can be generated, for example, from a snapshot 202 associated with the user browsing online information associated with Paris, such as online travel or vacation information.
- a context 224 b can identify the context associated with the information card.
- the context 224 b can include (or be determined from) part of the snapshot 202 , including a map that may be included in a snapshot or identified from information in the snapshot.
- the information card 220 b can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 b, such as a control, displayed on Bob's smart phone, for obtaining driving directions to or within Paris.
- a time associated with the presentation of the information card 220 b can be determined based on a present time and the user's current location (e.g., arriving at an airport in Paris).
- FIG. 2D shows an example information card 220 c associated with an informational entity.
- the information card 220 c can include, for example, a notification caption 222 c (e.g., “Answer . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is associated with a subject, e.g., the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
- a notification caption 222 c e.g., “Answer . . . ”
- the NYSE can also be a location.
- “Answer” types of information cards can apply, for example, to informational entities, e.g., from a snippet, a biography, a quote (e.g., a stock quote displayed on the user's screen), or other informational content.
- the information card 220 c can be generated, for example, from a snapshot associated with the user browsing online information associated with the NYSE or information from other sources.
- a context 224 c can identify the context associated with the information card.
- the context 224 c can include (or be determined from) part of the snapshot, including a snippet of text about the NYSE that the user may have been presented as content from a web site.
- the information card 220 c can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 c, such as a control, displayed on Bob's smart phone, for obtaining more information about the NYSE.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing information cards based on snapshots extracted from content presented to a user. For example, coincidence can include simultaneous, near simultaneous or recent presentation of the sensory content item to a user.

- the change of context e.g., change of levels or reaching a milestone
- the plurality of snapshots are evaluated ( 304 ).
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate the received snapshots 202 .
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify, for each snapshot, entities 131 included in a snapshot 202 .
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the identified entities along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured.
- receiving the snapshots associated with use of the device by the user can include receiving a hash that represents the content included in a respective snapshot, and evaluating the received snapshots includes using, in the evaluating, the hash instead of original content.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate hash information associated with the content provided. The information can include, for example, text that corresponds to the content (e.g., “your credit card ending *1437”), or metadata associated with the content that describes what is contained in the content (e.g., “your address plus ZIP”).
- evaluating the received snapshots can further include identifying one or more events based on the entities included in a snapshot, determining a first time that is in the future when the event is to occur, storing the event along with the first time, determining a second time that is before the event, and determining the time to present can include determining that a current time is equal to the second time and presenting an information card includes presenting an information card for the event at the second time.
- evaluating the snapshot 202 can indicate the existence of a lunch date event between Bob and Carol. The time/place of the lunch date and Carol's cell phone number can also be determined from the snapshot 202 . The content management system 110 can use this information to identify the lunch date and to generate one or more information cards at predetermined times before the lunch date is to occur.
- identifying entities included in the snapshot can further include identifying a natural language description of an event in the text.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify text in the content 204 a that describes the event (e.g., a lunch date) or indicates the entities associated with the event (e.g., Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's phone number).
- the event can be an activity of interest to the user that is to occur in the future.
- the event that is identified by the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can be the lunch date that Bob has with Carol, which is of interest to Bob.
- a respective set of entities indicated by the respective snapshot is identified ( 306 ).
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify entities 131 included in the snapshot 202 obtained from the content 204 a.
- the entities that are identified for the snapshot 202 can include Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's cell phone number.
- Indications of the respective set of entities and a respective timestamp indicating a respective time that the respective snapshot was captured are stored to a memory ( 308 ).
- the respective set of entities and respective timestamp are associated in the memory.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the most prominent identified entities along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured.
- the timestamps can be stored, for example, in the data store of timestamps 132 for later use in generating and presenting information cards 201 related to the snapshots 202 and associated entities.
- a first time to present one or more information cards to the user is determined ( 310 ).
- the information card engine 122 can determine a time to present one or more information cards to the user including determining a target time. For example, for Bob's pending lunch date with Carol, the information card engine 122 can determine a reminder time for Bob that is one hour before the scheduled noon lunch date. In some implementations, multiple times to present information cards can be determined, e.g., to include a reminder, to be sent the night before, that Bob has a lunch date with Carol the following day.
- the target time can be relative to the timestamp associated with the snapshot 202 , such as to show the user the information card 220 c at a later time.
- target times can be calculated closer to the start time of an event, or can be re-calculated based on a current location of the user who is to receive the information card (e.g., Bob may need 90 minutes to drive to the lunch date, based on Bob's current location).
- the target time can be a time in the past
- the information card can provide a reminder for an event or entity surfaced to the user in the past.
- the information card 220 c can be based, not on an event, but on a past presentation of content related to the NYSE.
- determining the time to present one or more information cards can include determining one or more predetermined times in the past and, for each time, determining one or more information cards for presentation to the user.
- the information card engine 122 can determine multiple times to present the information card 220 c, and the times can be based on when the user was first presented with content associated with the NYSE on which the information card 220 c is based.
- the predetermined times can be varied depending on a current context of the user. For example, based on the current actions of the user 206 , e.g., being in the middle of an app or casually surfing the Internet, the information card engine 122 can delay or accelerate the generation of the data card (e.g., based on the user's current location).
- information cards can be surfaced when requested by the user, such as when opening an application or tool that displays and/or manages information cards, and/or by requesting that all or particular information cards be presented. Other signals for surfacing information cards can be used.
- entities having a time stamp that corresponds to the first time are located in memory ( 312 ).
- the information card engine 122 can identify entities for use in generating an information card from the stored entities 131 based on a comparison of the target time with timestamps associated with a respective entity of the stored entities. For example, for the lunch date that is scheduled for Carol and Bob, the information card engine 122 can identify information to be used in an information card that is associated with the pending lunch date. For example, Carol's phone number can be an entity that is identified for the generation of the information card that includes a reminder to Bob. The information card can be sent at a target time one hour before the lunch date and can include Carol's cell phone number.
- identifying entities can further include recognizing text in the snapshot, and parsing the text to identify entities.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can recognize that the snapshot 202 includes text.
- the snapshot evaluation engine 121 can extract the text in various ways, such as by using optical character recognition (OCR) or other character recognition techniques, by extracting text from Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) or other code used for generating the content (e.g., content 204 a or 204 b ), or by other techniques.
- OCR optical character recognition
- HTML Hyper-Text Markup Language
- recognizing text in a snapshot can include using natural language processing techniques, e.g., that use a grammar associated with words or phrases in the text, or sources of snapshots (e.g., based on email formats, calendar entry formats, or other formats).
- other visual recognition techniques can be applied to the snapshots, e.g., object recognition, landmark recognition, and/or other ways to detect entities from images.
- An information card is generated based on the one or more of the located entities ( 314 ).
- the information card engine 122 can generate the information card 201 including the one or more identified entities 131 (e.g., an information card that includes Carol's cell phone number).
- the generated information card is provided for presentation to the user ( 316 ). For example, once the information card 201 is generated, the information card 201 may be presented multiple times, for example, on the screen 208 c of the user device 106 a.
- storing the identified entities can include storing contextual information associated with an identified entity, and presenting the information card can further include presenting the contextual information along with information about the identified entity on the information card.
- the snapshot 202 is evaluated by the snapshot evaluation engine 121 , information can also be determined and stored for context information that a context associated with a respective snapshot that includes the entities (e.g., identifies the email message and the pending lunch date).
- the information card 201 can include the context 224 a (e.g., identifying the lunch date email or associated information).
- Other example contexts are shown in contexts 224 b and 224 c.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. Snapshots associated with use of a computing device by a user are received. Each snapshot is based on content presented to the user. The snapshots are evaluated. For each respective snapshot, a respective set of entities indicated by the respective snapshot is identified. Indications of the respective set of entities and a respective timestamp indicating a respective time that the respective snapshot was captured are associated and stored. Based on a first snapshot of the snapshots, a first time to present one or more information cards to the user is determined. At the first time, entities having a time stamp that corresponds to the first time are located. An information card is generated based on the located entities. The generated information card is provided for presentation to the user.
Description
- This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 14/135,080, filed on Dec. 19, 2013, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method can include receiving, by a server device, a plurality of snapshots associated with use of a computing device by a user, each snapshot from the plurality of snapshots being based on content presented to the user on the computing device. The method can further include evaluating the plurality of snapshots, including, for each respective snapshot: identifying a respective set of entities indicated by the respective snapshot, and storing, to a memory, indications of the respective set of entities and a respective timestamp indicating a respective time that the respective snapshot was captured, wherein the respective set of entities and respective timestamp are associated in the memory. The method can further include determining, based on a first snapshot from the plurality of snapshots, a first time to present one or more information cards to the user. The method can further include, at the first time, locating in memory entities having a time stamp that corresponds to the first time. The method can further include generating an information card based on the one or more of the located entities. The method can further include providing, for presentation to the user, the generated information card.

- Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for providing an information card or other form of notification determined based on one or more evaluated snapshots of content presented to a user. Snapshots, can be captured and evaluated on an ongoing basis based on content that is presented to one or more users on their respective user devices. Content may be presented to a user in, for example, a browser, an application (e.g., a mobile app), a web site, an advertisement, a social network page, or other digital content environments. Each snapshot may include at least a portion of one or more of a calendar entry, a map, an email message, a social network page entry, a web page element, an image, or some other content. Evaluating a particular snapshot can include identifying associated entities, (e.g., persons, places (e.g., specific locations, addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, or other specific geographic locations), things (such as phone numbers), subjects, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), or other identifiable entities. A timestamp associated with receipt of a snapshot can also be stored in association with the snapshot and/or entities upon which the snapshot is based. Target presentation times can be determined, based on, for example a timestamp associated with receipt of the snapshot, and/or based on times of one or more events identified using the snapshot. At times corresponding to the target presentation times, one or more information cards that identify one or more of the entities can be provided (e.g., for presentation to the user). Each information card can also indicate, for example, a context that the user can use to understand the rationale for the display of the given information card. At least one call to action can also be included in the information card, to, for example, allow the user to perform an action associated with an entity (such as dialing a phone number, obtaining driving directions, or receiving additional information). An information card can serve as a prompt of sorts (e.g., for the user to remember a concept and/or some other piece(s) of information), or the information card can serve as a reminder of an upcoming event.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use information including personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized to where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Users can be automatically presented with an information card that is relevant to an event or a subject associated with content that they have received.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,content sponsors 108 andpublishers 109. - The
environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by thecontent management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using thenetwork 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. A data store ofentities 131, for example, can include a list of entities that can be used to identify entities in snapshots of content presented to users. Entities can include, for example, phone numbers, locations (e.g., addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, specific geographic locations), subjects (e.g., related to topics), names of people, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), email addresses, organization names, products, movies, music, or other subjects that can be represented, e.g., in a knowledge graph or other information representation. - A data store of
entities 131 can include, for example, plural entries, one for each snapshot evaluated. A snapshot can be evaluated after capture and one or more top ranked or most significant entities that are included or referenced in a snapshot can be stored as a group (e.g., an entry in the data store of entities 131). - A data store of
timestamps 132, for example, can include timestamps associated with times that respective snapshots were captured. The timestamps can be associated with the entities that are identified from the respective snapshots. - A data store of
events 133, for example, can include information associated with events that have been identified from a respective snapshot. For example, information for an event can include one or more of a date, a start time, an end time, a duration, names of participants, an associated location, associated phone numbers and/or other contact information (e.g., email addresses), an event type (e.g., meeting, birthday, lunch date), and a description or context (e.g., that was obtained from the respective snapshot). - A data store of
target presentation times 134, for example, can include one or more times that are established, by thecontent management system 110, for the presentation of a respective information card. For example, a target presentation time established for a lunch date may include a time that is one hour before the lunch date (e.g., as a reminder to leave or prepare for the lunch date) and a designated time on the day or night before the lunch date to inform the user of the next day's lunch date. Some or all of the data stores discussed can be combined in a single data store, such as a data store that includes a combination of identified entities, events, timestamps and target presentation times, all being associated with a single snapshot. - The
content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102). Asnapshot evaluation engine 121, for example, can evaluate snapshots of content presented to a user on a device. For each snapshot, for example, thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify entities and/or events included in the snapshot and store the identified entities/events along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured or presentation time. - An
information card engine 122, for example, can perform functions associated with gathering information for use in information cards, generating the information cards, and determining times for presenting the information cards. For example, after the received snapshots are evaluated, theinformation card engine 122 can determine content for inclusion in an information card and a time to present one or more information cards to the user, including determining a target time for the presentation. Selection of content and timing of presentation is discussed in greater detail below. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In addition, when no search is performed or no keywords are available (e.g., because the user is not browsing a webpage), other information, such as information obtained from one or more snapshots, can be used to respond to the received request. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.

FIG. 2A is a block diagram of a system 200 for presentinginformation cards 201 based on entities associated withsnapshots 202 of content presented to users. For example,snapshots 202 can be captured over time fromcontent content content content snapshots 202 of the content 204 a, 204 b can be evaluated, for example, to identify associatedentities 131, such as phone numbers, locations (e.g., addresses, cities, states, countries, room numbers, buildings, specific geographic locations), subjects, names of people, scheduled events (e.g., lunch dates, birthdays, meetings), or other identifiable entities.Timestamps 132 associated with the receivedsnapshots 202 can be used with the identifiedentities 131, for example, to identifytarget presentation times 133 ofinformation cards 201 associated with theentities 131. At times corresponding to thetarget presentation times 133, for example, thecontent management system 110 can provideinformation cards 201 for presentation to the user 206. - In some implementations, one or more events (e.g., a lunch date) can be identified based on the entities included in a snapshot (e.g., a calendar entry identifying a person, place and phone number). A first time (e.g., in the future) can be determined as to when the event is to occur (e.g., the lunch date meeting time), and the event can be stored (e.g., in the repository of events 133) along with the first time. A second time that is before the event can be determined, such as a time by which the user 206 needs to be notified to leave in order to arrive at the event on time. Generally, the second time can be a time to perform an action relative to the event before the event is to occur, such as ordering flowers for an anniversary or sending a card for a birthday. Determining a time to present an information card (e.g., associated with the lunch date) can include determining that a current time (e.g., the present time) is equal to the second time (e.g., an hour before the lunch date). The information card can be presented for the event at the second time. In some implementations, the following example stages can be used for providing information cards.
- At stage 1, for example, the
content management system 110 can receive thesnapshots 202, e.g., a plurality of snapshots that are associated with a use of the user device 106 a by a user 206. For example, the receivedsnapshots 202 can include snapshots ofcontent snapshots 202, for example, can include snapshots taken from an email message (e.g.,content 204 a) or from an image (e.g.,content 204 b), and/or from other content presented to the user 206. - At
stage 2, for example, thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate the receivedsnapshots 202. For example, for each snapshot, thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can identifyentities 131 included in asnapshot 202. The entities that are identified for thesnapshot 202 obtained from thecontent 204 a, for example, can include Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's cell phone number. Thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the identified entities (or a subset thereof, such as most prominent entities) along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured. In some implementations, as part of the determining entities process, a determination can be made whether any determined entities are related to each other, such as related to a common event. Relatedness can be based on proximity (e.g., the entities appear in close proximity to each other) or some other relationship in the snapshot. In some implementations, timestamps can be stored in the data store oftimestamps 132, e.g., for later use in generating and presentinginformation cards 201 related to thesnapshots 202. In some implementations, one or more entities may be associated with an event. That is, an entity may be a person, and the event may relate to a meeting with the person (as indicated by the content included in an email message that is shown in the snapshot being evaluated). When an event is identified by thesnapshot evaluation engine 121, a calendar item can be set up in the user's calendar and optionally in calendars of other users associated with the event (e.g., including users who are not necessarily event attendees). In some implementations, events that are identified can include events for which the user is not to attend, but from which the user may still benefit by received an information card (e.g., a coupon expiration for an on-line sale). Events are discussed in more detail below. - Evaluation of the
snapshot 202 associated with the content 204 a, for example, can determine that a lunch date event exists between the user 206 (e.g., Bob) and Carol. Other information identified from thesnapshot 202 can include time, location information, and a phone number. In this example, entities that are identified can include Bob, Carol, the restaurant (e.g., J's), and Carol's phone number. As part of the snapshot evaluation, a context can be determined associated with the snapshot and/or event. For example, based on the entities of Bob, Carol, the restaurant and Carol's phone number, a context of “lunch date at noon on date X with Carol at J's.” Context information can be determined, stored and later accessed, for example, to provide a user with information as to why a particular information card was presented. In some implementations, other information can be included in a context, such as identification of the app or other source from which the snapshot was extracted, the way that the information was evaluated, or a context associated with a screen shot. In some implementations, the context information can be in the form of a snippet of text from which the entity or event was extracted. In some implementations, when the context information is subsequently presented, for example, the snippet on which the context is based can be formatted to highlight the relevant pieces of information. - At stage 3, for example, after one or more of the received snapshots are evaluated, the
information card engine 122 can determine a time to present one or more information cards to the user including determining a target time. In some implementations, target times can be stored in the data store of target presentation times 134. For example, for Bob's pending lunch date with Carol, theinformation card engine 122 can determine a reminder time for Bob that is one hour before the scheduled noon lunch date. In some implementations, multiple times to present information cards can be determined, e.g., to include a reminder, to be sent the night before, that Bob has a lunch date with Carol the following day. In some implementations, target times can be determined using various factors, such as a mode of transportation, a distance, a location and/or other factors. For information cards that serve as prompts to the user, for example, target times can include one or more times since the concept was originally presented to the user, e.g., in the form of content from which a respective snapshot was obtained. - At stage 4, for example, the
information card engine 122 can identify entities from the storedentities 131 based on a comparison of the target time with timestamps associated with a respective entity of the stored entities. For example, for the lunch date that is scheduled for Carol and Bob, theinformation card engine 122 can identify information to be used in an information card that is associated with the pending lunch date. For example, Carol's phone number can be an entity that can be identified for the generation of the information card, e.g., for a reminder to Bob that is sent at a target time one hour before the lunch date and that also includes Carol's cell phone number. - At
stage 5, for example, theinformation card engine 122 can generate theinformation card 201 based on the one or moreidentified entities 131. For example,information card 201 can include information associated with the lunch date and Carol's cell phone number. In some implementations, theinformation card 201 can be stored, e.g., at thecontent management system 110, for use in multiple subsequent presentations of the same information card. - At
stage 6, for example, thecontent management system 110 can provide, for presentation to the user, theinformation card 201. For example, theinformation card 201 may be provided to the user device 106 a for presentation on ascreen 208 c, which may be the same or different screen as screens 208 a, 208 b from which thesnapshots 202 were obtained from plural user sessions 210 for the user 206. In some implementations, thescreens 208 a, 208 b, 208 c can be screens that are presented on multiple ones of user devices 106 a that are associated with the user 206. The time at which the information card is presented, for example, can be a time since the concept associated with the information card was originally presented to the user, e.g., in the form of content from which a respective snapshot was obtained. In this example, the information card can be provided to jog the user's memory. The time at which the information card is presented, for example, can also be a time relative to an event (e.g., the lunch date) that is associated with the information card. - In some implementations, some
information cards 201 may be applicable to more than one user. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provideinformation cards 201 to all parties associated with an event, such as to both Bob and Carol with regard to their pending lunch date. - In some implementations, when snapshots are evaluated in anticipation of potentially providing information cards to the user, the user can optionally receive a notification (e.g., along the lines of “You may be receiving information cards based on X . . . ”). In some implementations, users can have an option to change when and how information cards are to be presented, either individually by groups (or by types of information cards), or globally. In some implementations, users can be presented with controls for specifying the type of information that can be used for information cards, such as checkbox controls along the lines of “Don't use information from my email to generate information cards.” In some implementations, users can control the times that information cards are to be presented, e.g., times of day or times for specific snapshots. In some implementations, users can be provided with transparency controls for any particular information card, e.g., to learn how or why an information card was prepared and presented.

FIG. 2B shows anexample information card 220 a associated with a phone number entity. For example, continuing the example described above with respect toFIG. 2A , theinformation card 220 a can be presented an hour before Bob and Carol's pending lunch date. Theinformation card 220 a can include, for example, anotification caption 222 a (e.g., “Dialer . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is a type that is associated with a phone number, e.g., Carol's cell phone number. Acontext 224 a, for example, can identify the context associated with the information card. In this example, thecontext 224 a can include (or be determined from) part of thesnapshot 202, including a snippet of Bob's email message received from Carol that contains information (e.g., location, phone number,date 226 a) associated with the pending lunch date. Theinformation card 220 a can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 a, such as a control, displayed with the information card on Bob's smart phone, for dialing Carol's cell phone number). Other calls-to-action 228 a are possible in this example, such as a call-to-action to display a map to the restaurant. -
FIG. 2C shows anexample information card 220 b associated with a location entity. Theinformation card 220 b can include, for example, anotification caption 222 b (e.g., “Location . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is associated with a location, e.g., Paris, France. Theinformation card 220 b can be generated, for example, from asnapshot 202 associated with the user browsing online information associated with Paris, such as online travel or vacation information. Acontext 224 b, for example, can identify the context associated with the information card. In this example, thecontext 224 b can include (or be determined from) part of thesnapshot 202, including a map that may be included in a snapshot or identified from information in the snapshot. Theinformation card 220 b can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 b, such as a control, displayed on Bob's smart phone, for obtaining driving directions to or within Paris. A time associated with the presentation of theinformation card 220 b can be determined based on a present time and the user's current location (e.g., arriving at an airport in Paris). -
FIG. 2D shows anexample information card 220 c associated with an informational entity. Theinformation card 220 c can include, for example, anotification caption 222 c (e.g., “Answer . . . ”) that notifies the user that the information card is associated with a subject, e.g., the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In this example, the NYSE can also be a location. “Answer” types of information cards can apply, for example, to informational entities, e.g., from a snippet, a biography, a quote (e.g., a stock quote displayed on the user's screen), or other informational content. Theinformation card 220 c can be generated, for example, from a snapshot associated with the user browsing online information associated with the NYSE or information from other sources. Acontext 224 c, for example, can identify the context associated with the information card. In this example, thecontext 224 c can include (or be determined from) part of the snapshot, including a snippet of text about the NYSE that the user may have been presented as content from a web site. Theinformation card 220 c can also include, for example, a call-to-action 228 c, such as a control, displayed on Bob's smart phone, for obtaining more information about the NYSE. -
FIG. 3A is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing information cards based on snapshots extracted from content presented to a user. For example, coincidence can include simultaneous, near simultaneous or recent presentation of the sensory content item to a user. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can perform stages of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2C are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. - A plurality of snapshots associated with use of a computing device by a user is received by a server device (302). Each snapshot from the plurality of snapshots is based on content presented to the user on the computing device. For example, a server device, such as the
content management system 110, can receivesnapshots 202 associated with use of the user device 106 a, includingsnapshots 202 ofcontent - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include obtaining the plurality of snapshots by the device. For example, the user device 106 a can take thesnapshots 202 and provide them to thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, thesnapshots 202 can be obtained by thecontent management system 110 from the content that thecontent management system 110 provides to the user device 106 a. - In some implementations, the snapshots associated with the use of the device by the user can include audio presented to, or experienced by, the user. For example,
snapshots 202 can include recordings that have been provided to the user device 106 a. In this example, the obtaining thesnapshots 202 can also include using voice recognition or other recognition techniques to obtain a textual translation or identification (e.g., title) of the audio that is presented. In some implementations, obtaining thesnapshot 202 can include obtaining an audio fingerprint (e.g., of a particular song) for use in identifying the audio. - In some implementations, snapshots associated with the use of the device by the user can include content that is not associated with a browser. As an example,
snapshots 202 can be obtained from non-browser sources such as applications, web sites, social network sites, advertisements, and/or other sources. - In some implementations, obtaining the plurality of snapshots by the device can occur periodically or based on an environmental event. For example,
snapshots 202 can be obtained periodically, such as at N-second or M-minute intervals, orsnapshots 202 can be obtained whenever certain triggers occur, e.g., including user actions or other triggers. In some implementations, the environmental event can be triggered by the device (e.g., the user device 106 a), by an application (e.g., when the user starts the app or performs a triggering action), by a service (e.g., map application, calendar, or email) communicating with the device, by the operating system associated with the device, or based on a change of context, change of scene, or change of use of the device by the user. For example, anew snapshot 202 can occur when it is determined that a threshold percentage of the screen on the user device 106 a has changed. - In some implementations, the environmental event can be a change in context of an application that is executing on the device, wherein a time used for detecting the change of context includes at least one of a substantially current time and a previous time. For example, the environmental event can be triggered by the user 206 moving from one level of an application or game to another level, or by reaching a milestone associated with the application or game. The change of context (e.g., change of levels or reaching a milestone) can be determined, e.g., by comparing contexts at a previous time and the current time.
- The plurality of snapshots are evaluated (304). The
snapshot evaluation engine 121, for example, can evaluate the receivedsnapshots 202. For example, thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify, for each snapshot,entities 131 included in asnapshot 202. Thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the identified entities along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured. - In some implementations, receiving the snapshots associated with use of the device by the user can include receiving a hash that represents the content included in a respective snapshot, and evaluating the received snapshots includes using, in the evaluating, the hash instead of original content. For example, instead of (or in addition to) evaluating the
snapshot 202, thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can evaluate hash information associated with the content provided. The information can include, for example, text that corresponds to the content (e.g., “your credit card ending *1437”), or metadata associated with the content that describes what is contained in the content (e.g., “your address plus ZIP”). - In some implementations, evaluating the received snapshots can further include identifying one or more events based on the entities included in a snapshot, determining a first time that is in the future when the event is to occur, storing the event along with the first time, determining a second time that is before the event, and determining the time to present can include determining that a current time is equal to the second time and presenting an information card includes presenting an information card for the event at the second time. For example, as described above with respect to
FIG. 2A , evaluating thesnapshot 202 can indicate the existence of a lunch date event between Bob and Carol. The time/place of the lunch date and Carol's cell phone number can also be determined from thesnapshot 202. Thecontent management system 110 can use this information to identify the lunch date and to generate one or more information cards at predetermined times before the lunch date is to occur. - In some implementations, identifying entities included in the snapshot can further include identifying a natural language description of an event in the text. For example, the
snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identify text in thecontent 204 a that describes the event (e.g., a lunch date) or indicates the entities associated with the event (e.g., Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's phone number). - In some implementations, the event can be an activity of interest to the user that is to occur in the future. As an example, the event that is identified by the
snapshot evaluation engine 121 can be the lunch date that Bob has with Carol, which is of interest to Bob. - For each respective snapshot, a respective set of entities indicated by the respective snapshot is identified (306). For example, the
snapshot evaluation engine 121 can identifyentities 131 included in thesnapshot 202 obtained from thecontent 204 a. The entities that are identified for thesnapshot 202, for example, can include Bob, Carol, J's restaurant, and Carol's cell phone number. - Indications of the respective set of entities and a respective timestamp indicating a respective time that the respective snapshot was captured are stored to a memory (308). The respective set of entities and respective timestamp are associated in the memory. As an example, the
snapshot evaluation engine 121 can store the most prominent identified entities along with a timestamp associated with a time that a respective snapshot was captured. The timestamps can be stored, for example, in the data store oftimestamps 132 for later use in generating and presentinginformation cards 201 related to thesnapshots 202 and associated entities. - Based on a first snapshot from the plurality of snapshots, a first time to present one or more information cards to the user is determined (310). For example, the
information card engine 122 can determine a time to present one or more information cards to the user including determining a target time. For example, for Bob's pending lunch date with Carol, theinformation card engine 122 can determine a reminder time for Bob that is one hour before the scheduled noon lunch date. In some implementations, multiple times to present information cards can be determined, e.g., to include a reminder, to be sent the night before, that Bob has a lunch date with Carol the following day. For non-event snapshots that have been processed, such as asnapshot 202 obtained associated with the NYSE, the target time can be relative to the timestamp associated with thesnapshot 202, such as to show the user theinformation card 220 c at a later time. In some implementations, target times can be calculated closer to the start time of an event, or can be re-calculated based on a current location of the user who is to receive the information card (e.g., Bob may need 90 minutes to drive to the lunch date, based on Bob's current location). - In some implementations, the target time can be a time in the past, and the information card can provide a reminder for an event or entity surfaced to the user in the past. For example, the
information card 220 c can be based, not on an event, but on a past presentation of content related to the NYSE. - In some implementations, determining the time to present one or more information cards can include determining one or more predetermined times in the past and, for each time, determining one or more information cards for presentation to the user. For example, the
information card engine 122 can determine multiple times to present theinformation card 220 c, and the times can be based on when the user was first presented with content associated with the NYSE on which theinformation card 220 c is based. - In some implementations, the predetermined times can be varied depending on a current context of the user. For example, based on the current actions of the user 206, e.g., being in the middle of an app or casually surfing the Internet, the
information card engine 122 can delay or accelerate the generation of the data card (e.g., based on the user's current location). In some implementations, information cards can be surfaced when requested by the user, such as when opening an application or tool that displays and/or manages information cards, and/or by requesting that all or particular information cards be presented. Other signals for surfacing information cards can be used. - At the first time, entities having a time stamp that corresponds to the first time are located in memory (312). For example, the
information card engine 122 can identify entities for use in generating an information card from the storedentities 131 based on a comparison of the target time with timestamps associated with a respective entity of the stored entities. For example, for the lunch date that is scheduled for Carol and Bob, theinformation card engine 122 can identify information to be used in an information card that is associated with the pending lunch date. For example, Carol's phone number can be an entity that is identified for the generation of the information card that includes a reminder to Bob. The information card can be sent at a target time one hour before the lunch date and can include Carol's cell phone number. - In some implementations, identifying entities can further include recognizing text in the snapshot, and parsing the text to identify entities. For example, the
snapshot evaluation engine 121 can recognize that thesnapshot 202 includes text. Thesnapshot evaluation engine 121 can extract the text in various ways, such as by using optical character recognition (OCR) or other character recognition techniques, by extracting text from Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) or other code used for generating the content (e.g.,content - An information card is generated based on the one or more of the located entities (314). For example, the
information card engine 122 can generate theinformation card 201 including the one or more identified entities 131 (e.g., an information card that includes Carol's cell phone number). - The generated information card is provided for presentation to the user (316). For example, once the
