- FIG. 1 is an example system 100 for cloud-based computing.
- Cloud-based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided, to some extent, between client and server devices.
- a “cloud” may refer to a service or a group of services accessible over a network (e.g., Internet) by client and server devices, for example.
- any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power, applications, and files.
- cloud computing enables a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Users can store and access personal files such as music, pictures, videos, and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium.
- a cloud-based application may store copies of data and/or executable program logic at remote server devices, while allowing client devices to download at least some of this data and program logic as needed for execution at the client devices.
- downloaded data and program logic can be tailored to capabilities of specific client devices (e.g., a personal computer, tablet, or mobile phone, or robot) accessing the cloud based application.
- client devices e.g., a personal computer, tablet, or mobile phone, or robot
- dividing application execution and storage between the client and server devices allows more processing to be performed by the server devices taking advantage of server devices processing power and capability, for example.
- Cloud-based computing can also refer to distributed computing architectures in which data and program logic for a cloud-based application are shared between one or more client devices and/or server devices on a near real-time basis. Parts of this data and program logic may be dynamically delivered, as needed or otherwise, to various clients accessing the cloud-based application. Details of the architecture may be transparent to users of client devices. Thus, a PC user or robot client device accessing a cloud-based application may not be aware that the PC or robot downloads program logic and/or data from the server devices, or that the PC or robot offloads processing or storage functions to the server devices, for example.
- the cloud 102 may represent a networked computer architecture, and in one example, the cloud service 104 represents a queue for handling requests from client devices.
