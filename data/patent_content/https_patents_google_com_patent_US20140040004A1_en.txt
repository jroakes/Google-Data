Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to online shopping queries, and more particularly to a method for identifying a deal associated with the search results of a shopping query.
- the retail market has seen significant growth in online shopping since the advent of the Internet. On the Internet, users may search for, locate, and purchase nearly everything that can be purchased at a physical marketplace.
- Online shopping websites often use shopping search engines to allow a user to search for a specific product or group of products.
- the online shopping system employing the search engines stores information regarding products and characteristics of each product.
- a search engine or the online shopping system may store a database of products that contains product descriptions, product user ratings, merchants offering the products, product identifications, such as a model number, and other product characteristics.
- An online shopping system may additionally store offers for the product, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, or other offers.
- the offer details may be provided to the search engine by offer providers, such as the marketing system for the product, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others.
- An online shopping system can use a search engine to perform a web search to gather current offers and product information from product websites, retailers, and other shopping websites.
- a deal is generally described as an offer for a product that has a price that is substantially less than the accustomed price. Users may experience difficulties while attempting to determine if an offer is a deal or not. For example, an offer that states that a product is 20% off of the listed price may seem to be a deal to many users. However, the user may not be aware that the offer provider is offering 20% off of an artificially inflated price and not 20% off of the accustomed price that has been offered frequently or by other offer providers.
- Certain shopping websites have begun to offer historical pricing information for a user to review.
- the charts and graphs that may present the historical graph rely upon the user for interpretation.
- the user may not be positioned to make a proper interpretation of the data.
- the data may not be presented in a format that is scaled for a proper determination of a deal. For example, the time frame of the chart may be too large or small to make a proper determination of a deal.
- Certain shopping websites make predictions, based on the historical pricing, about whether the product price will decrease or increase in the future. The prediction does not tell the user if the current offer of a product is a deal. The prediction only tells the user if the shopping site believes the price will go up or down. The user may desire to know if the current offer is a deal and may not be interested in future price variations.
- Users may desire an automated method of determining if an offer is a deal without the need to examine price charts and historical pricing data.
- the user may additionally desire to be notified of deals that might be of interest to them.
- An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method to identify a deal in an online shopping query.
- the method comprises associating offers received for a product with the product in a database; associating a time of receipt for each of the offers; receiving a current offer for the product; identifying the offers for the product in the database that are within a configured time period of the current offer; comparing the offers for the product in the database with the current offer for the product based on a set of parameters; identifying the current offer as a deal in response to a determination that the current offer satisfies all parameters compared to the offers for the product in the database. Numerous sets of parameters may be used to determine if an offer is a deal.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product that is installed on a server located in a search engine system to identify a deal in an online shopping query.
- the computer program product includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein.
- the computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for associating offers received for a product with the product in a database; associating a time of receipt for each of the offers; receiving a current offer for the product; identifying the offers for the product in the database that are within a configured time period of the current offer; comparing the offers for the product in the database with the current offer for the product based on a set of parameters; identifying the current offer as a deal in response to a determination that the current offer satisfies all parameters compared to the offers for the product in the database. Numerous sets of parameters may be used to determine if an offer is a deal.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying a deal in an online shopping query, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for identifying a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for an online shopping system to identify a particular offer for a product as a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for an online shopping system to identify a particular offer for a product as a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- the exemplary embodiments provide an online shopping system that employs a search engine.
- the online shopping system may employ a user interface to allow a user to enter keywords or phrases into the search engine.
- the keywords may be a single word relating to the product for which the user would like to shop, two or more related words, or a phrase relating to the product.
- any combination of one or more keywords or phrases will be referred to simply as “keywords”.
- the term “product(s)” should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products, as well as services.
- the user may also enter product model numbers or other identifiers to search for a specific product.
- the online shopping system maintains a database or other catalog of products.
- the online shopping system can receive offers from online offer providers or other product marketers.
- the offer providers may be marketing systems for a product, product manufacturers, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others.
- the offer providers may transmit offers and other product information to the search engine system.
- the search engine of the online shopping system can traverse the Internet and gather deals, coupons, promotions, and other offers from the websites of offer providers and other suitable locations and store the products and offers in the database.
- the search engine can conduct a web search over the Internet and gather offers and product details at the time of the query entry.
- the search engine can extract offers from the search results.
- the online shopping system can utilize a deal application operating on the web server of the online shopping system to analyze each offer for a product.
- the deal application additionally gathers the price history of the product over a predetermined period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other time period.
- the deal application can compare the current offers for the products to the price history of the product and determine if any of the current offers are a deal.
- An offer may be a deal if the product is being offered for a price that is a predetermined amount less than the accustomed price.
- the search engine system can use various analysis techniques for assessing the accustomed price for the product.
- the accustomed price is generally considered to be the price that a user would expect to pay for a product.
- the accustomed price may alternatively be considered what users may commonly consider a fair price.
- the accustomed price may alternatively be what the market considers a product to be worth.
- Various methods and techniques may be employed by the online shopping system to determine if the current offer is a deal.
- the online shopping system operators, users, or others can vary the parameters of the methods and techniques to better match the user's perception of a deal. Following are two examples of methods that may be employed to identify a deal.
- the search engine can identify the prices for which the product has been offered over a period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other suitable time period.
- the search engine can determine the minimum price over that time period.
- the deal application can additionally require that the most recent occurrence of the minimum price of the time period occurred within a configured time in the past, such as within the last 15 days, 30 days, or any other suitable time period.
- the deal application can compare the current offer to the minimum price and determine if the minimum price in the price history exceeds the current offer by a configured percentage, such as 10%, 20% or any other suitable percentage.
- the current offer may be a deal.
- the time periods and the configured percentages may be varied by a user or the online shopping system to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of a user or a group of users.
- the method may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal.
- the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than $50, $100, or any other suitable dollar value lower than the determined minimum price regardless of the percentage difference.
- the deal application can identify the prices for which the product has been offered over a period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other suitable time period.
- the search engine can determine the average price of the product over that time period.
- the deal application can compare the current offer to the average price and determine if the average price exceeds the current offer by a configured percentage, such as 10%, 20% or any other suitable percentage. In an example, if the average price of the last 90 days is more than 10% greater than the current offer, then the current offer is identified as a deal.
- the time periods and the configured percentages may be varied by a user or the online shopping system to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of a user or a group of users.
- the method may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal.
- the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than $50, $100, or any other suitable dollar value lower than the calculated average price.
- the deal application designates the current offer as a deal or not a deal.
- the deal application can assign a total score to an offer based on whether the offer is a deal or not.
- the deal application can give a ranking of a deal from 1 to 10 or give a letter grade to a deal based on the comparison of the current offer to the price history.
- the score may be based on the magnitude of the deal or on the confidence of the method that the current offer is a deal.
- the ranking can alternatively be a thumbs up or thumbs down or any other scale or scoring system.
- the website can display the results of the search and the status of each offer as a deal or not a deal.
- the results can be displayed to the user to assist the user in selecting the best offer for a product.
- a current offer can have a symbol or badge attached to the offer denoting a deal.
- the online shopping system can provide a list of all current deals to a user based on the history of the user. That is, the online shopping system can access items from the user history such as purchasing history, keyword searches, links clicked, ads converted, websites accessed, or any other usable data from the user history.
- the online shopping system can determine if a deal may be related to the user history and provide the deal to the user.
- the online shopping system may provide the deal to the user in an email, text, advertisement, or any other suitable manner.
- the online shopping system may additionally or alternatively present the deals associated with the history of a user to the user as a display on the online shopping system website.
- the website of the online shopping system can employ a section of the display to list current deals in which a user may be interested when the user opens the online shopping system website.
- the online shopping system can offer all current deals in a separate database or webpage for access by the user.
- the website can present a “deals only” section that allows a user to perform a shopping search of only products that are currently considered to be deals by the deal application.
- the online shopping system can present a current offer that is determined to be a deal to the user in any other suitable fashion.

- the database may be maintained on the online shopping system 150 if the search engine 156 is not a function of the online shopping system 150 . That is, if the online shopping system 150 employs a search engine 156 that operates on a different server or on another system, the online shopping system 150 may maintain the database. The online shopping system 150 may employ the search engine 156 or other service to update or service the database.
- the search engine 156 on the online shopping system 150 receives a search query from a user 101 , as discussed previously with reference to block 215 of FIG. 2 .
- the user 101 enters the search query into the user interface provided by the search engine 156 or the online shopping system 150 .
- the search engine 156 can access the products and the related offers stored in the database that most closely match the search query.
- the search engine 156 can alternatively or additionally perform a search of the Internet for offers and merchants at the time of the search query.
- the deal application 155 on the online shopping system 150 produces a historic price trend for one or more of the products identified by the search engine 156 .
- the deal application 155 can gather the historic prices from data stored on the database, gathered by the search engine 156 at the time of the query, stored by the web server 151 in a separate database, or any other suitable location.
- the deal application 155 can be configured to vary the features of the prices and products as needed. For example, the deal application 155 can be configured to gather the prices for a certain time period, for only a specific product, for a group of products, for a certain merchant or group of merchants, or for any other configured characteristic.
- the deal application 155 can determine if the most recent occurrence of the minimum price occurred more than a configured amount of time prior to the current deal. For example, if the time period is 90 days, the deal application 155 can review the prices of the product for one or more merchants over the 90 days and determine the lowest price for which the product has been offered. If the deal application 155 has access to the final purchase price, then that information may additionally or alternatively be utilized. Any other time period may be configured to conform to the expectations of the user 101 or other operator. For example, a user 101 or other operator may only desire to compare the current offer to prices from the last 30 days. A shorter time period may be more useful for a product that has a price that changes rapidly.
- a user 101 or other operator may desire to compare the current offer to prices from the previous year. A longer time period may be more useful for a product that has a price that seldom changes. Any other suitable time period may be configured to conform the Method 220 a to meet the expectations of the user 101 or other operator.
- the user 101 or other operator can configure the maximum amount of time prior to the current offer for the most recent occurrence of the minimum price to ensure that the price has not been artificially inflated in preparation for the current offer.
- the deal application 155 can determine if the most recent occurrence of the minimum price occurred more than 30 days prior to the search request. Any other amount of time prior to the current deal can be configured such as 1 day, 15 days, 100 days, or any other suitable amount of time.
- the method 220 a follows the “YES” branch of block 330 to block 335 . If the most recent occurrence of the minimum price is outside of the configured amount of time prior to the current deal, then the method 220 a follows the “NO” branch of block 330 to block 340 .

Abstract
A shopping system can employ a computer-implemented method to determine whether an offer is a deal. The method comprises associating offers received for a product with the product in a database; associating a time for each of the offers noting when each particular offer was effective; receiving a current offer for the product; identifying the offers for the product in the database that are within a configured time period of the current offer; comparing the offers for the product in the database with the current offer for the product based on a set of parameters; identifying the current offer as a deal in response to a determination that the current offer satisfies all parameters compared to the offers for the product in the database. Various sets of parameters may be used to determine if the current offer is a deal with respect to previous offers.
Description
- The present disclosure relates to online shopping queries, and more particularly to a method for identifying a deal associated with the search results of a shopping query.
- The retail market has seen significant growth in online shopping since the advent of the Internet. On the Internet, users may search for, locate, and purchase nearly everything that can be purchased at a physical marketplace.
- Online shopping websites often use shopping search engines to allow a user to search for a specific product or group of products. The online shopping system employing the search engines stores information regarding products and characteristics of each product. For example, a search engine or the online shopping system may store a database of products that contains product descriptions, product user ratings, merchants offering the products, product identifications, such as a model number, and other product characteristics.
- An online shopping system may additionally store offers for the product, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, or other offers. The offer details may be provided to the search engine by offer providers, such as the marketing system for the product, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others. An online shopping system can use a search engine to perform a web search to gather current offers and product information from product websites, retailers, and other shopping websites.
- When a user receives product offers, the user desires to know if an offer is a deal. A deal is generally described as an offer for a product that has a price that is substantially less than the accustomed price. Users may experience difficulties while attempting to determine if an offer is a deal or not. For example, an offer that states that a product is 20% off of the listed price may seem to be a deal to many users. However, the user may not be aware that the offer provider is offering 20% off of an artificially inflated price and not 20% off of the accustomed price that has been offered frequently or by other offer providers.
- Certain shopping websites have begun to offer historical pricing information for a user to review. The charts and graphs that may present the historical graph rely upon the user for interpretation. The user may not be positioned to make a proper interpretation of the data. Additionally, the data may not be presented in a format that is scaled for a proper determination of a deal. For example, the time frame of the chart may be too large or small to make a proper determination of a deal.
- Certain shopping websites make predictions, based on the historical pricing, about whether the product price will decrease or increase in the future. The prediction does not tell the user if the current offer of a product is a deal. The prediction only tells the user if the shopping site believes the price will go up or down. The user may desire to know if the current offer is a deal and may not be interested in future price variations.
- Users may desire an automated method of determining if an offer is a deal without the need to examine price charts and historical pricing data. The user may additionally desire to be notified of deals that might be of interest to them.
- An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method to identify a deal in an online shopping query. The method comprises associating offers received for a product with the product in a database; associating a time of receipt for each of the offers; receiving a current offer for the product; identifying the offers for the product in the database that are within a configured time period of the current offer; comparing the offers for the product in the database with the current offer for the product based on a set of parameters; identifying the current offer as a deal in response to a determination that the current offer satisfies all parameters compared to the offers for the product in the database. Numerous sets of parameters may be used to determine if an offer is a deal.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product that is installed on a server located in a search engine system to identify a deal in an online shopping query. The computer program product includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for associating offers received for a product with the product in a database; associating a time of receipt for each of the offers; receiving a current offer for the product; identifying the offers for the product in the database that are within a configured time period of the current offer; comparing the offers for the product in the database with the current offer for the product based on a set of parameters; identifying the current offer as a deal in response to a determination that the current offer satisfies all parameters compared to the offers for the product in the database. Numerous sets of parameters may be used to determine if an offer is a deal.
- These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated exemplary embodiments, which include the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently presented.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying a deal in an online shopping query, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for identifying a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for an online shopping system to identify a particular offer for a product as a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. -
FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for an online shopping system to identify a particular offer for a product as a deal, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. - The exemplary embodiments provide an online shopping system that employs a search engine. The online shopping system may employ a user interface to allow a user to enter keywords or phrases into the search engine. The keywords may be a single word relating to the product for which the user would like to shop, two or more related words, or a phrase relating to the product. As used throughout the specification, any combination of one or more keywords or phrases will be referred to simply as “keywords”. As used throughout the specification, the term “product(s)” should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products, as well as services. The user may also enter product model numbers or other identifiers to search for a specific product.
- The online shopping system maintains a database or other catalog of products. The online shopping system can receive offers from online offer providers or other product marketers. The offer providers may be marketing systems for a product, product manufacturers, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others. The offer providers may transmit offers and other product information to the search engine system.
- Additionally or alternatively, the search engine of the online shopping system can traverse the Internet and gather deals, coupons, promotions, and other offers from the websites of offer providers and other suitable locations and store the products and offers in the database.
- Additionally or alternatively, the search engine can conduct a web search over the Internet and gather offers and product details at the time of the query entry. The search engine can extract offers from the search results.
- The online shopping system can utilize a deal application operating on the web server of the online shopping system to analyze each offer for a product. The deal application additionally gathers the price history of the product over a predetermined period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other time period. The deal application can compare the current offers for the products to the price history of the product and determine if any of the current offers are a deal.
- An offer may be a deal if the product is being offered for a price that is a predetermined amount less than the accustomed price. The search engine system can use various analysis techniques for assessing the accustomed price for the product. The accustomed price is generally considered to be the price that a user would expect to pay for a product. The accustomed price may alternatively be considered what users may commonly consider a fair price. The accustomed price may alternatively be what the market considers a product to be worth.
- Various methods and techniques may be employed by the online shopping system to determine if the current offer is a deal. Within the various methods, the online shopping system operators, users, or others can vary the parameters of the methods and techniques to better match the user's perception of a deal. Following are two examples of methods that may be employed to identify a deal.
- In one example of a method to identify a deal based on the price history, the search engine can identify the prices for which the product has been offered over a period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other suitable time period. The search engine can determine the minimum price over that time period. The deal application can additionally require that the most recent occurrence of the minimum price of the time period occurred within a configured time in the past, such as within the last 15 days, 30 days, or any other suitable time period. The deal application can compare the current offer to the minimum price and determine if the minimum price in the price history exceeds the current offer by a configured percentage, such as 10%, 20% or any other suitable percentage. In an example, if a the minimum price of the last 90 days is more than 10% greater than the current offer, and the latest occurrence of the minimum price occurred in the last 30 days, then the current offer may be a deal. The time periods and the configured percentages may be varied by a user or the online shopping system to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of a user or a group of users. Alternatively, the method may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal. For example, the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than $50, $100, or any other suitable dollar value lower than the determined minimum price regardless of the percentage difference.
- In another example of a method to identify a deal based on the price history, the deal application can identify the prices for which the product has been offered over a period of time, such as 90 days, 120 days, or any other suitable time period. The search engine can determine the average price of the product over that time period. The deal application can compare the current offer to the average price and determine if the average price exceeds the current offer by a configured percentage, such as 10%, 20% or any other suitable percentage. In an example, if the average price of the last 90 days is more than 10% greater than the current offer, then the current offer is identified as a deal. The time periods and the configured percentages may be varied by a user or the online shopping system to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of a user or a group of users. Alternatively, the method may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal. For example, the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than $50, $100, or any other suitable dollar value lower than the calculated average price.
- Other methods of comparing the current offer to the price history of the product may be employed to identify a deal.
- In the exemplary embodiment, the deal application designates the current offer as a deal or not a deal. In an alternate embodiment, the deal application can assign a total score to an offer based on whether the offer is a deal or not. For example, the deal application can give a ranking of a deal from 1 to 10 or give a letter grade to a deal based on the comparison of the current offer to the price history. The score may be based on the magnitude of the deal or on the confidence of the method that the current offer is a deal. The ranking can alternatively be a thumbs up or thumbs down or any other scale or scoring system.
- The website can display the results of the search and the status of each offer as a deal or not a deal. The results can be displayed to the user to assist the user in selecting the best offer for a product. A current offer can have a symbol or badge attached to the offer denoting a deal.
- In an alternative embodiment, the online shopping system can provide a list of all current deals to a user based on the history of the user. That is, the online shopping system can access items from the user history such as purchasing history, keyword searches, links clicked, ads converted, websites accessed, or any other usable data from the user history. The online shopping system can determine if a deal may be related to the user history and provide the deal to the user. The online shopping system may provide the deal to the user in an email, text, advertisement, or any other suitable manner. The online shopping system may additionally or alternatively present the deals associated with the history of a user to the user as a display on the online shopping system website. For example, the website of the online shopping system can employ a section of the display to list current deals in which a user may be interested when the user opens the online shopping system website.
- In an alternate embodiment, the online shopping system can offer all current deals in a separate database or webpage for access by the user. For example, the website can present a “deals only” section that allows a user to perform a shopping search of only products that are currently considered to be deals by the deal application.
- The online shopping system can present a current offer that is determined to be a deal to the user in any other suitable fashion.
- The functionality of the exemplary embodiments will be explained in more detail in the following description, read in conjunction with the figures illustrating the program flow.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in detail.

online shopping system 155 to determine if the current offer is a deal. Within the various methods, the online shopping system operators,users 101, or others can vary the parameters of the methods and techniques to better match the user's perception of a deal. -
FIG. 3 andFIG. 4 depict two exemplary methods, 220 a and 220 b, for anonline shopping system 150 to identify whether a particular offer is a deal.Methods deal application 155 might employ, but are presented as just two examples of how thedeal application 155 could be configured to identify whether a particular offer is a deal. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart depicting amethod 220 a for anonline shopping system 150 to identify whether a particular offer is a deal for a product in an online shopping query, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. - In
block 305, thesearch engine 156 of theonline shopping system 150 receives or gathers offers and product details fromoffer providers 140. Thesearch engine 156 can receive offers fromonline offer providers 140. Theoffer provider 140 may be a marketing system for a product, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others. Theoffer providers 140 may transmit offers and other product information to thesearch engine 156. - Additionally or alternatively, the
search engine 156 can traverse the Internet and gather deals, coupons, promotions, and other offers from the websites ofoffer providers 140 and other suitable locations and store the products and offers in the database. - Additionally or alternatively, the
search engine 156 can conduct a web search over the Internet and gather offers and product details at the time of the query entry. Thesearch engine 156 can extract offers from the search results. - The
offer provider 140 may transmit offers and other product information to thesearch engine 156 via a message over thenetwork 105, email, text, or any other suitable connection. - In
block 310, thesearch engine 156 maintains a database or other catalog of products. Thesearch engine 156 analyzes each offer for a product. Some offers may include a sale price, a rebate, a coupon, free or discounted installation, free or discounted warranties, “buy one get one free” offers, included accessories, or other types of offers. - Additionally or alternatively, the database may be maintained on the
online shopping system 150 if thesearch engine 156 is not a function of theonline shopping system 150. That is, if theonline shopping system 150 employs asearch engine 156 that operates on a different server or on another system, theonline shopping system 150 may maintain the database. Theonline shopping system 150 may employ thesearch engine 156 or other service to update or service the database. - In
block 315, thesearch engine 156 on theonline shopping system 150 receives a search query from auser 101, as discussed previously with reference to block 215 ofFIG. 2 . Theuser 101 enters the search query into the user interface provided by thesearch engine 156 or theonline shopping system 150. - In
block 320, thesearch engine 156 can access the products and the related offers stored in the database that most closely match the search query. Thesearch engine 156 can alternatively or additionally perform a search of the Internet for offers and merchants at the time of the search query. - In
block 325, thedeal application 155 on theonline shopping system 150 produces a historic price trend for one or more of the products identified by thesearch engine 156. Thedeal application 155 can gather the historic prices from data stored on the database, gathered by thesearch engine 156 at the time of the query, stored by theweb server 151 in a separate database, or any other suitable location. Thedeal application 155 can be configured to vary the features of the prices and products as needed. For example, thedeal application 155 can be configured to gather the prices for a certain time period, for only a specific product, for a group of products, for a certain merchant or group of merchants, or for any other configured characteristic. - In
block 330 thedeal application 155 can determine if the most recent occurrence of the minimum price occurred more than a configured amount of time prior to the current deal. For example, if the time period is 90 days, thedeal application 155 can review the prices of the product for one or more merchants over the 90 days and determine the lowest price for which the product has been offered. If thedeal application 155 has access to the final purchase price, then that information may additionally or alternatively be utilized. Any other time period may be configured to conform to the expectations of theuser 101 or other operator. For example, auser 101 or other operator may only desire to compare the current offer to prices from the last 30 days. A shorter time period may be more useful for a product that has a price that changes rapidly. In another example, auser 101 or other operator may desire to compare the current offer to prices from the previous year. A longer time period may be more useful for a product that has a price that seldom changes. Any other suitable time period may be configured to conform theMethod 220 a to meet the expectations of theuser 101 or other operator. - The
user 101 or other operator can configure the maximum amount of time prior to the current offer for the most recent occurrence of the minimum price to ensure that the price has not been artificially inflated in preparation for the current offer. For example, thedeal application 155 can determine if the most recent occurrence of the minimum price occurred more than 30 days prior to the search request. Any other amount of time prior to the current deal can be configured such as 1 day, 15 days, 100 days, or any other suitable amount of time. - If the most recent occurrence of the minimum price is within the configured amount of time prior to the current deal, then the
method 220 a follows the “YES” branch ofblock 330 to block 335. If the most recent occurrence of the minimum price is outside of the configured amount of time prior to the current deal, then themethod 220 a follows the “NO” branch ofblock 330 to block 340. - In
block 335, thedeal application 155 can compare the current offer of the product to the minimum price that meets all of the time requirements. Thedeal application 155 can determine if the minimum price is more than a configured amount greater than the current offer. For example, thedeal application 155 may be configured to determine if the minimum price is more than 10% greater than the current offer. In other examples, thedeal application 155 may be configured to determine if the minimum price is more than 5%, 20%, 50% or any other suitable amount greater than the current offer. - In another example, the
method 220 a may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal. For example, the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than a threshold dollar value less than the determined minimum price. Any suitable threshold amount may be configured, such as $50, $100, $1000, or any other dollar value. - In another example, the threshold may be equal to the determined minimum price. That is, the current offer may be a deal if the current price is any dollar value or percentage less than the determined minimum price.
- If the minimum price is more than a configured amount greater than the current offer, then the
method 220 a follows the “YES” branch ofblock 335 to block 345. If the minimum price is less than a configured amount greater than the current offer, then themethod 220 a follows the “NO” branch ofblock 335 to block 340. - The time periods and the configured percentages and threshold values may be varied by a
user 101 or theonline shopping system 150 to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of auser 101 or a group of users. - Following the “NO” branches of
block 335 and block 330 to block 340, thedeal application 155 identifies the current offer as not being a deal. Thedeal application 155 may inform theonline shopping system 150 of the deal status of the current offer, label or otherwise denote the deal status of the offer in the database, take any other suitable action, or take no action at all. - Following the “YES” branch of
block 335 to block 345, thedeal application 155 identifies the current offer as a deal. Thedeal application 155 may inform theonline shopping system 150 of the deal status of the current offer, label or otherwise denote the deal status of the offer in the database, or take any other suitable action to identify the deal status of the current offer as a deal. - From
block 340 and block 345 themethod 220 a returns to block 225 ofFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart depicting amethod 220 b for anonline shopping system 150 to identify whether a particular offer is a deal for a product in an online shopping query, in accordance with certain alternative exemplary embodiments. -
Blocks 305 to 325 ofmethod 220 b are substantially the same asblocks 305 to 325 ofmethod 220 a described previously with reference toFIG. 3 . - In
block 430, thedeal application 155 of theonline shopping system 150 can identify the average price of the product over the specified time period. For example, if the time period is 90 days, thedeal application 155 can review the prices of the product for one or more merchants over the 90 days prior to the current offer and determine the average price for which the product has been offered. Any other amount of time prior to the current deal can be configured such as 1 day, 15 days, 100 days, or any other suitable amount of time. If thedeal application 155 has access to the final purchase price for the product, then that information may additionally or alternatively be utilized. - In
block 435, thedeal application 155 can compare the current offer of the product to the average price over the configured time period. Thedeal application 155 can determine if the average price is more than a configured amount greater than the current offer. For example, thedeal application 155 may be configured to determine if the average price is more than 10% greater than the current offer. In other examples, thedeal application 155 may be configured to determine if the average price is more than 5%, 20%, 50% or any other suitable amount greater than the current offer. - In another example, the
method 220 b may use a threshold value instead of a percentage to identify a deal. For example, the current offer may be determined to be a deal if the current offer is more than a threshold dollar value less than the average price. Any suitable threshold amount may be configured, such as $50, $100, $1000, or any other dollar value. - In another example, the threshold may be equal to the average price. That is, the current offer may be a deal if the current price is any dollar value or percentage less than the average price.
- If the average price is more than a configured amount greater than the current offer then the
method 220 b follows the “YES” branch ofblock 435 to block 345. If the average price is less than a configured amount greater than the current offer then themethod 220 b follows the “NO” branch ofblock 435 to block 340. - The time periods and the configured percentages may be varied by a
user 101 or theonline shopping system 150 to achieve a certain goal or meet the requirements of auser 101 or a group of users. -
Block 340 and block 345 ofmethod 220 b are substantially the same asblock 340 and block 345, respectively, ofmethod 220 a described previously with reference toFIG. 3 . - From
block 340 and block 345 themethod 220 b returns to block 225 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to block 225 of
FIG. 2 , after receiving the identity of offers that are deals associated with the shopping query, thedeal application 155 provides the deals to theuser 101. Thewebsite 153 can display the results of the search and the status of each offer as a deal or not a deal. The results can be displayed to theuser 101 to assist theuser 101 in selecting the best offer for a product. A current offer can have a symbol or badge attached to the offer denoting a deal. - The
website 153 can display the methodology used to determine the deal or other explanation of the designation of a deal. Thewebsite 153 can display the historic price to which the current offer is being compared. For example, inmethod 220 a, thewebsite 153 can display the minimum price to which the current offer is compared. Inmethod 220 b, thewebsite 153 can display the average price to which the current offer is compared. Thewebsite 153 can additionally show the current offer along with the minimum or average price in any format, such as a numerical display, graphical display, or other display. - The
website 153 may present features of the method or the calculation process to theuser 101. For example, thewebsite 153 may present a graphical display of the price of the product during the time period of the method along with the price of the current offer. Any other feature of the method may be displayed to allow theuser 101 to better understand the method and the quality of the deal. - The
website 153 can additionally or alternatively display the configured thresholds and time frames used to identify a particular offer as a deal. For example, thewebsite 153 might display the percentage by which the current offer must beat a minimum or average price to be identified as a deal. Thewebsite 153 might display the time frame used to identify the minimum price or average price of the historic prices. Additionally or alternatively, thewebsite 153 may provide an interactive display that allows theuser 101 to alter or configure the factors used to identify a deal, such as the time period or the percentage by which the current offer must beat a minimum or average price to be identified as a deal. - In an alternative embodiment, the
online shopping system 150 can provide a list of all current deals to auser 101 based on the history of theuser 101. That is, theonline shopping system 150 can access items from the user's history, such as purchasing history, keyword searches, links clicked, ads converted, websites accessed, or any other usable data from the user history. Theonline shopping system 150 can determine, using the exemplary embodiments described inFIGS. 3 and 4 , if a deal is related to the user history and can provide the deal to theuser 101. Theonline shopping system 150 may provide the deal to theuser 101 in an email, text, advertisement, application, or any other suitable manner. Theonline shopping system 150 may present the deals associated with the history of auser 101 to theuser 101 as a display on the onlineshopping system website 153. For example, thewebsite 153 of theonline shopping system 150 can employ a section of the display to list current deals in which auser 101 may be interested when theuser 101 opens the onlineshopping system website 153. - In addition to the history of the
