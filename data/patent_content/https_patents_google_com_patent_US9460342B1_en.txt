- system 102 may enable a camera device (e.g., smart phone, etc.) of the subject user to automatically upload images to system 102 as the camera device captures photos.
- a camera device e.g., smart phone, etc.
- system 102 generates a 3-dimensional composition of the subject user based on the images.
- System 102 may then use all of the images in which the subject user is tagged and/or recognized, for instance by a facial recognition algorithm, (which could include hundreds of images) to build or stitch a 3-dimensional composite of the subject user using the amalgamated set of images.
- images may include full shots of the subject user, partial shots from waist and above, head shots (e.g., neck and above), peripheral shots (e.g., back and/or side), etc.
- system 102 may combine or stitch together matching points in the images in order to create a 3d object of the subject user. In some implementations, system 102 may extract information such as metadata from tags in the images.
- system 102 may select which images to use for the 3-dimensional composition based on timestamps associated with each image. For example, system 102 may select the most recent images in order to generate one 3-dimensional composition that more closely matches the subject user's current size and shape.
- system 102 determines one or more initial body measurements based on the 3-dimensional composition and based on one or more known reference dimensions.
- the one or more known reference dimensions are based on one or more objects in the images.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example image 300 of a subject user and associated measurements, which may be used to implement the implementations described herein.
- FIG. 3 shows a subject user U 1 standing next to a soda can 302 , which is sitting on top of a table 302 .
- one or more objects in a given image may have known dimensions.
- Such objects may include any variety of objects such as soda cans, wine bottles, cars, etc., even another person with associated known dimensions or measurements, where system 102 may determine the dimensions of each object.

- system 102 may modify one or more body measurements of the subject user based on various factors such as age, geographic location, time of year.
- the one or more modifying criteria includes historical body measurement criteria.
- system 102 may determine from collected images that the subject user tends to fluctuate in size over the year and such fluctuations may follow seasonal cycles. For example, the subject user may be bigger in the winter and thinner in the summer (e.g., from more physical activity, etc.). In another example, system 102 may determine that the subject user has been getting thinner or getting bigger over time based on images of the subject user.
- system 102 may adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.
- system 102 may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns.

- System 102 may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and/or trends for the subject user and make recommendations accordingly.
- the one or more modifying criteria includes age criteria.
- System 102 may determine overall trends in body measurements based on age. For example, men and women may tend to gain weight and get bigger as they get older, and the particular age that one's body measurements change will depend on the particular individual.
- System 102 may determine age information associated with the subject user from a social network system. For example, the subject user may have stored his or her birthday in the social network. Based on the time stamp of each image, system 102 may determine the age of the subject user.
- system 102 may determine if and when a new trend in body measurements occurs with the subject user based on collected images of the subject user. System 102 may also correlate the pattern change with the age of the subject user. For example, system 102 may determine that a particular male subject user has gotten bigger around the waist over a several-year period, and that the subject user is 40. The correlation of the age with the historical pattern may trigger system 102 to adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.
- system 102 may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns. As such, system 102 may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and/or trends for the subject user, and may make recommendations accordingly.
- the one or more modifying criteria includes geographic location criteria.
- System 102 may determine overall trends in body measurements based on geographic data. For example, body measurements of people certain countries and/or climates may tend to follow a general pattern.
- System 102 may determine geographic information associated with the subject user from a social network system. For example, the subject user may have stored the geographic location where he or she resides in the social network. Based on the geographic location information, system 102 may determine the country, climate, etc.
- system 102 may determine if and when a new trend in body measurements occurs with the subject user based on collected images of the subject user. System 102 may also correlate the pattern change with the geographic location of the subject user. The correlation of the age with the geographic location may trigger system 102 to adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.
- system 102 may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns. As such, system 102 may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and/or trends for the subject user and make recommendations accordingly. Also, geographic data and time of year may be considered together to yield appropriate seasonal attire, especially when combined with the age and gender of the subject user.
- system 102 may be used as an application programming interface (API).
- API application programming interface
- the subject user may be browsing through sweaters on a particular online clothing retailer and may use a widget to log in to their social network account associated with system 102 .
- this may initiate an application associated with a social network to determine the body measurements, thereby enabling the subject user to automatically get sized for clothing.
- the resulting body measurements may be used to provide tailored sizing information (e.g., clothing shape and sizes) for users and e-commerce retailers such as clothing and apparel retailers.
- system 102 provides one or more recommendations for articles of clothing based on the one or more body measurements.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 displaying images of a subject user and associated clothing recommendations, which may be used to implement the implementations described herein.

- images 402 , 404 , 406 , and 408 show subject user U 1 in respective shirts 412 , 414 , and 416 , and a hat 418 .
- system 102 may also provide one or more recommendations for articles of clothing based on the one or more body measurements and clothing preferences of the subject user.
- system 102 enables the subject user to provide clothing preferences to system 102 .
- Clothing preferences may include color, style, liked brands, etc. Clothing preferences may also include fit. For example, some people may prefer looser fitting clothes. Some people may prefer tighter fitting closes.
- System 102 may by default recommend a particular size for the subject user, yet determine that the subject user prefers a particular fit (e.g., looser, tighter, etc.). As such, system 102 may recommend a particular clothing item and multiple sizes (e.g., a well fit size, and a loose/tight size depending on the preference).
- System 102 may enable and/or prompt the subject user to manually input his or her clothing preferences.
- System 102 may provide a series of prompts and/or entry fields to guide the subject user in providing his or her clothing preferences. For example, system 102 may show the subject user a particular article of clothing and ask the subject user if he or she likes or dislikes the clothing item.
- system may provide scale rating selection (e.g., 1-5 stars) for each clothing item. System may then ascertain preferences from the collected data.
- the clothing preferences may be based on historical data associated subject user input of clothing preferences.
- the subject user's preferences e.g., taste
- system 102 may continually adjust the clothing preferences over time. Implementations eliminate or minimize sizing issues by dynamically and intelligently determining the subject users body measurements.
- system 102 may determine clothing preferences and sizes based on past purchase and/or returns. For example, system 102 may store and analyze information associated with what the subject user has bought or returned in terms of styles and sizes. If the subject user exchanged a clothing item, system 102 may determine the new size, whether it went up or down, etc.
- system 102 may store style and size information based on brand. For example, some brands may favor particular colors, color combinations, cuts, etc. Some brands may run large, some small, etc. System 102 may recommend clothing items accordingly, based on brand styles and sizing.
- system 102 may utilize the one or more body measurements for proactive advertising. For example, system 102 may display or recommend particular clothing items from particular retailers and/or brands in a portion of a social network page. Such advertising may advertise clothes with no need for the subject user to visit a particular retailer or brand website.
- system 102 may provide advertising to users using similar principles described herein in association with recommendations. For example, system 102 may provide advertising based on body measurements that have been modified based on historical body measurement criteria, age criteria, geographic location criteria, etc.
- system 102 may show clothes on a graphic depiction of the subject user, where the clothes selected for advertising may be based on what the subject user has viewed and/or purchased in the past.
- the clothes may also be clothes that the subject user has never seen, but that are similar in style to clothes that the subject user has viewed and/or purchased in the past.
- the selection of clothes advertised may be based on the preferences determined for the subject user as described herein.
- system 102 may show clothes on a model who looks like or has similar features to the subject user. Such images may make it easier for the subject user to visualize himself or herself wearing such clothes.
- Implementations may apply to video games, where system 102 generates a 3-dimensional composition based on images, modifies images based on modifying criteria described herein. System 102 may then recommend and/or enable the subject user to select clothing and other apparel for video game avatars. Implementations my also apply to a portion of a subject user's body. For example, a head shot of the subject user may be useful for showing the subject user depicted in glasses, hats, or other head gear.
- system 102 is described as performing the steps as described in the implementations herein, any suitable component or combination of components of system 102 or any suitable processor or processors associated with system 102 may perform the steps described.
- system 102 may utilize a variety of recognition algorithms to recognize faces, landmarks, objects, etc. in images. Such recognition algorithms may be integral to system 102 . System 102 may also access recognition algorithms provided by software that is external to system 102 and that system 102 accesses.
- system 102 enables users of the social network system to specify and/or consent to the use of personal information, which may include system 102 using their faces in images or using their identity information in recognizing people identified in images.
- system 102 may provide users with multiple selections directed to specifying and/or consenting to the use of personal information.
- selections with regard to specifying and/or consenting may be associated with individual images, all images, individual photo albums, all photo albums, etc.
- the selections may be implemented in a variety of ways.
- system 102 may cause buttons or check boxes to be displayed next to various selections.
- system 102 enables users of the social network to specify and/or consent to the use of using their images for facial recognition in general. Example implementations for recognizing faces and other objects are described in more detail below.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- system 102 obtains reference images of users of the social network system, where each reference image includes an image of a face that is associated with a known user.
- the user is known, in that system 102 has the user's identity information such as the user's name and other profile information.
- a reference image may be, for example, a profile image that the user has uploaded.
- a reference image may be based on a composite of a group of reference images.
- system 102 may compare the face (e.g., image of the face) and match the face to reference images of users of the social network system.
- face e.g., image of the face
- image of the face are used interchangeably.
- recognition of one face is described in some of the example implementations described herein. These implementations may also apply to each face of multiple faces to be recognized.
- system 102 may search reference images in order to identify any one or more reference images that are similar to the face in the image.
- system 102 may extract features from the image of the face in an image for analysis, and then compare those features to those of one or more reference images.
- system 102 may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of facial features such as eyes, nose, cheekbones, mouth, jaw, etc.
- system 102 may use data gathered from the analysis to match the face in the image to one more reference images with matching or similar features.
- system 102 may normalize multiple reference images, and compress face data from those images into a composite representation having information (e.g., facial feature data), and then compare the face in the image to the composite representation for facial recognition.
- the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with the same user. As such, there would be a high probability that the person associated with the face in the image is the same person associated with the reference images.
- the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with different users. As such, there would be a moderately high yet decreased probability that the person in the image matches any given person associated with the reference images.
- system 102 may use various types of facial recognition algorithms to narrow the possibilities, ideally down to one best candidate.
- system 102 may use geometric facial recognition algorithms, which are based on feature discrimination.
- System 102 may also use photometric algorithms, which are based on a statistical approach that distills a facial feature into values for comparison.
- a combination of the geometric and photometric approaches could also be used when comparing the face in the image to one or more references.
- system 102 may use facial recognition algorithms that use one or more of principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, elastic bunch graph matching, hidden Markov models, and dynamic link matching. It will be appreciated that system 102 may use other known or later developed facial recognition algorithms, techniques, and/or systems.
- system 102 may generate an output indicating a likelihood (or probability) that the face in the image matches a given reference image.
- the output may be represented as a metric (or numerical value) such as a percentage associated with the confidence that the face in the image matches a given reference image. For example, a value of 1.0 may represent 100% confidence of a match. This could occur, for example, when compared images are identical or nearly identical. The value could be lower, for example 0.5 when there is a 50% chance of a match. Other types of outputs are possible.
- the output may be a confidence score for matching.
- Implementations described herein provide various benefits. For example, implementations eliminate or minimize sizing issues, and enables users to purchase clothing without needing to try on the clothes on before buying. Implementations greatly simplify clothes sizing.
