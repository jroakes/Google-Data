Definitions
- This specification relates to assisting participation in a social network.
- a social network is a social structure that represents individuals (or groups of individuals) as nodes and the relationships between those individuals as links between the nodes.
- a social network can be implemented as a member network that is available on the Internet, such as FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, MYSPACE, and TWITTER.
- Member networks generally allow members to create a “profile” of information to represent themselves in the social network. Member networks also allow members to interact socially with other members, e.g., by exchanging messages and publishing content that is associated with their profile.
- a symmetric social network In a symmetric social network, related members necessarily share the same relationship with one another. Examples of such symmetric social networks include FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, and MYSPACE, where two or more members establish bi-directionally equivalent “friend” or other relationships generally using an invitation/response protocol that effectively requires the consent of both members to the relationship. Such bi-directionally equivalent relationships provide the same social interaction possibilities to the related members.
- a first member's relationship to a second member is not necessarily the same as the second member's relationship to the first member. Since the character of the social interaction between members in a member network can be defined in accordance with the nature of the relationship between those members, a first member in an asymmetric social network may interact with a second member in ways that differ from the social interaction provided for the second member to interact with the first member.
- An example of such an asymmetric social network is TWITTER, where a first member may be a follower of a second member without the second member necessarily being a follower of the first. Indeed, in many asymmetric social networks, a second member need not even know a first member's identity even though the first member has a relationship to the second member.
- a post is a user submission that is re-transmitted to the group of people who are associated with the author.
- a method is performed by a system of one or more data processing devices.
- the method includes receiving, at the system, a historical record of message exchange between an individual and members in a member network, the system determining, for each of the members, whether the individual is likely to want to be related to the respective member, each determination considering the number and transactional characteristics of the message exchange between the individual and the respective member in the historical record, and the system outputting the determinations that the individual is likely to want to be related to at least two of the respective members.
- the method can also include receiving, at the system from the individual, a request to register as a new member in the member network.
- Determining whether the individual is likely to want to be related to the members can include comparing a probability that each of the respective members is a member to whom the individual is likely to want to be related with a threshold.
- the method can also include outputting identifiers of the members to whom the individual is likely to want to be related to a display screen for confirmation by the individual.
- a computer storage medium is encoded with a computer program.
- the program includes instructions that when executed by one or more data processing devices cause the one or more data processing devices to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving, from an individual, a request to register as a new member in an asymmetric social network, responding to the request by displaying a user interface to the individual, the user interface including information characterizing two or more members in the asymmetric social network to whom the individual is likely to want to be related as a follower, confirming establishment of the follower relationships with the two or more members with the individual, and adding the individual to the asymmetric social network.
- the addition includes establishing the individual as a follower of the two or more members.
- Implementations of this second aspect and the first and third aspects can include one or more of the following features.
- Confirming the follower relationships can include implicitly confirming the follower relationships by the individual's failure to request that the follower relationships be changed.
- the user interface can include a preview of a profile of the individual in the asymmetric social network and an interactive widget programmed to change the profile in response to user interaction.
- the user interface can include an identifier of the individual and an image associated with the individual in the preview.
- the user interface can include information characterizing members in the asymmetric social network who follow the individual.
- the user interface can include an interactive widget programmed to end the following of at least one of the two or more members in the asymmetric social network in response to user interaction.
- the individual can be added to the asymmetric social network in response to user interaction with a widget that confirms the establishment of the follower relationships.
- Adding the individual to the asymmetric social network can also include responding to the user interaction with the widget that confirms the establishment of the follower relationships by displaying a second user interface.
- the second user interface can include a text box programmed to receive user input authoring a post to the asymmetric social network.
- a system can include a first database that stores a collection of member information that characterizes members in an asymmetric social network, a second database that stores a collection of historical records of transactional characteristics of exchanges of messages, wherein at least some of the members in the asymmetric social network are recipients or senders of the exchanged messages, and an asymmetric social network server comprising one or more data processing devices programmed to implement the asymmetric social network.
- the asymmetric social network server is programmed to access the historical records of the transactional characteristics in the first database and identify members in the asymmetric social network with whom new relationships are likely to be established based on the historical records of the transactional characteristics.
- the asymmetric social network server can include a registration request receiver.
- the registration request receiver can trigger the identification of members in the asymmetric social network with whom new relationships are likely to be established in response to a request to register in the asymmetric social network.
- the system of claim 16 can include machine-readable instructions for generating a user interface.
- the user interface can include information characterizing two or more members in the asymmetric social network to whom an individual is likely to want to be related as a follower. The two or more members can be identified based on a number and the transactional characteristics of the messages exchanged between the individual and the two or more members in the collection of historical records.
- the two or more members can be identified based on the timing of the messages sent from the individual to each of the two or more members.
- the system can include a client data processing device displaying a user interface for interacting with a message system.
- the user interface can include an interactive element programmed to trigger, in response to user interaction, a request to the asymmetric social network to register as a new member in the asymmetric social network.

- Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a system 100 of electronic devices that exchange information and provide social interaction.
- System 100 includes a handheld, mobile device 105 that is associated with a first user.
- Mobile device 105 is a digital data processing device that includes one or more wireless or wired data communication components. The user of mobile device 105 can use the data communication components to interact socially with other individuals using a social network, as described further below.
- mobile device 105 includes two wireless data communication components, namely, a mobile phone transceiver and a WiFi transceiver.
- the mobile phone transceiver is able to exchange messages 110 with a phone base station 115 .
- the WiFi transceiver is able to exchange messages 120 with a WiFi access point 125 .
- Phone base station 115 and WiFi access point 125 are connected for data communication with one or more data communication networks 140 via data links 145 , 150 and can exchange information with a server 155 .
- Mobile device 105 and server 155 can thus exchange information relevant to the social interaction over a social network.
- server 155 can receive information characterizing the contents of a post that the first user wishes to transmit via a social network.
- Server 155 will generally also be able to transmit such a post to the first user's followers on the social network, as described further below.
- One or more additional digital data processing devices 160 which are associated with one or more other users, are also connected for data communication with data communication networks 140 and can exchange information with a social network server 155 .
- Data processing devices 160 can be connected to data communication networks 140 by wired or wireless data links, as the case may be.
- Data processing devices 160 and social network server 155 can thus also exchange information relevant to the social interaction over the social network, as described further below.
- Data processing devices 160 can be, e.g., mobile, handheld data processing devices or larger data processing devices, such desktop or laptop computers.
- Social network server 155 is a collection of one or more digital data processing devices that perform data processing activities in accordance with the logic of machine-readable instructions. Among the data processing activities performed by social network server 155 are activities that implement a social network. In some implementations, the social network is an asymmetric social network. In addition to social network activities, social network server 155 can in some implementations perform data processing activities that implement other functionality. For example, social network server 155 can perform data processing activities that implement one or more of a search engine that searches a collection of electronic documents available on the Internet, an electronic mail or chat message server, a photosharing network, and other platforms that support interaction between users.
- a search engine that searches a collection of electronic documents available on the Internet
- an electronic mail or chat message server a photosharing network
- other platforms that support interaction between users.
- social network server 155 can have access to data that would not otherwise be available to a stand-alone social network server.
- social network server 155 may have access to, e.g., an index of the content of electronic documents available on the Internet, screenshots of some portion of those documents, electronic mail or chat data, identification tags on photos on a photosharing network, and the like, as described further below.
- mobile device 105 can also include a display screen 165 and one or more input devices 170 .
- display screen 165 can act as both an input and an output.
- display screen 165 can be a touch screen that both displays graphical elements on a screen and detects the presence and location of interaction with the screen.
- Input devices 170 can include one or more, e.g., key, pad, trackball, or other component that receives mechanical, audio, or other input from a user.
- mobile device 105 can include additional components such as a GPS unit, accelerometers, a digital camera, audio jacks, and the like.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an implementation of a collection of activities 200 in an asymmetric social network. Activities 200 occur in the context of a single level asymmetric social network in which a first member can become a follower of a second member without the second member necessarily becoming a follower of the first member.
- a first user “Apple” authors a post 205 using a data processing device (e.g., mobile device 105 or data processing devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- the data processing device can also receive input from the first user that triggers “posting” of post 205 .
- Post 205 is accordingly transmitted at 210 to social network server 155 , which receives the transmission, identifies the transmission as a posting by the first user, and identifies members who are related to the first member as followers in the network. Social network server 155 then relays content from post 205 to those followers at 215 . These followers can receive and review the transmitted content at one or more data processing devices (e.g., devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- data processing devices e.g., devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )
- One of the followers may chose to reply to the content from post 205 and author a reply post 220 using a data processing device (e.g., one of devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- This data processing device can also receive input from the second user that triggers posting of reply post 220 .
- Reply post 220 is accordingly transmitted at 225 to asymmetric social network server 155 , which receives the transmission, identifies the transmission as a reply posting by the second user, and identifies members who are related to the second member as followers in the network.
- Social network server 155 also identifies the author of the post that is being replied to, namely, first user “Apple.” Social network server 155 then relays content from reply post 220 to both the followers of second user “Orange” at 230 and to the author of post 205 at 235 .
- the followers of second user “Orange” can receive and review the transmitted content from reply post 220 at one or more data processing devices (e.g., devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- the author of post 205 i.e., first user “Apple” can receive and review the transmitted content from reply post 220 at one or more data processing devices (e.g., mobile device 105 ( FIG. 1 )).
- posts tends to preferentially flow in the direction indicated by arrow 240 , i.e., from an author to that author's followers.
- this directionality namely, the transmission of content from reply post 220 to the author of post 205 at 235 .
- the preferred directionality is in the direction indicated by arrow 240 .
- FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an implementation of a collection of activities 300 in an asymmetric social network.
- Activities 300 occur in the context of a multiple level asymmetric social network in which a first member can become either a “public follower” or a “selected follower” of a second member without the second member necessarily becoming a follower of the first member.
- a public follower is a member of the asymmetric social network who receives a proper subset of the posts (i.e., the public posts) authored by the followed member.
- a selected follower is a member of the asymmetric social network who generally receives all of the posts (i.e., both public and private posts) authored by the followed member.
- a selected follower relationship between two members is established by an invitation/response protocol that effectively requires the consent of both members to the selected follower relationship.
- first user “Apple” authors a post 305 using a data processing device (e.g., mobile device 105 or data processing devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- a data processing device e.g., mobile device 105 or data processing devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )
- first user “Apple” indicates whether post 305 is a public or a private post, e.g., by interacting with an interactive element such as a widget that designates the post as a public or private post.
- Post 305 includes information characterizing the indication.
- post 305 is accordingly transmitted at 315 to social network server 155 , which receives the transmission, identifies the transmission as a posting by the first user, and determines whether post 305 is to be posted publicly or privately.
- server 155 identifies both public and selected followers of first user “Apple” and relays content from post 305 to those followers at 320 and at 325 .
- Server 155 also relays content from a post 305 that is to be posted publicly to the public profile of first user “Apple” at 330 .
- a profile is a representation of an individual or a group of individuals on a member network.
- a profile generally includes details such as a name, a hometown, interests, pictures, and other information characterizing an individual or a group of individuals.
- a profile is public if other network members (or even the general public) do not require the consent of the represented individual or group in order to access the profile.
- server 155 In response to determining that post 305 is to be posted privately, server 155 identifies selected followers of first user “Apple” and relays content from post 305 to those followers at 320 . Private posts 305 are not relayed to public followers of first user “Apple” or to the public profile of first user “Apple.” In either case, the followers to whom post 305 is relayed can receive and review the transmitted content at one or more data processing devices (e.g., devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )).
- data processing devices e.g., devices 160 ( FIG. 1 )
- Activities 300 can also be used in posting a reply post (not shown).
- the author of a reply post can indicate whether a reply post is to be publicly or privately posted.
- a reply to a private post may be forbidden or delete information identifying the author of the replied to post.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an implementation of a social network server system 400 .
- Social network system 400 includes social network server 155 and databases 405 , 410 , 415 .
- Each database 405 , 410 , 415 is a collection of information that is organized to be retrievable by server 155 .
- Databases 405 , 410 , 415 are stored on one or more data storage devices and can be organized in accordance with any of a number of different data models.
- Databases 405 , 410 , 415 are accessible over one or more data links by social network server 155 in the course of implementing social network.
- the implemented social network can be an asymmetric social network.
- Database 405 is a collection of member information that characterizes members in the asymmetric social network.
- the member information stored in database 405 can include member profiles and characterizations of the relationships between members.
- the member information in database 405 can characterize which members follow which other members, the nature of any such following (e.g., public or selected), and how and when certain members came to follow other members.
- Database 410 is a collection of historical records of the exchange of chat messages between individuals. At least some of the individuals are members in the asymmetric member network.
- the information in database 410 can include information characterizing the senders and intended recipients of chat messages, information characterizing how often chat messages are sent (i.e., the frequency of chat interactions), information characterizing how often chat messages are read, and information characterizing how often chat messages are replied to or forwarded.
- Database 410 will generally not include the content of the chat messages themselves.
- the chat messages can be private in that access to the chat communication is—absent a breach of security—restricted to the sender and one or more recipients.
- Database 415 is a collection of historical records of the exchange of electronic mail messages between individuals. At least some of the individuals are members in the asymmetric member network.
- the information in database 410 can include information characterizing the senders and intended recipients of electronic mail messages, information characterizing how often electronic mail messages are sent (i.e., the frequency of electronic mail interactions), information characterizing how often electronic mail messages are read, and information characterizing how often electronic mail messages are replied to or forwarded.
- Database 415 will generally not include the content of the electronic mail messages themselves.
- the electronic mail messages can be private in that access to the electronic mail is—absent a breach of security—restricted to the sender and one or more recipients.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a process 500 for assisting participation in a social network.
- Process 500 can be performed by a device that includes one or more data processing devices that perform operations by executing one or more sets of machine-readable instructions to implement a social network.
- process 500 can be performed by server 155 in the context of one or both of systems 100 , 400 ( FIGS. 1, 4 ).
- Process 500 can be performed in isolation or in conjunction with other digital data processing operations.
- process 500 can be performed in conjunction with one or both of processes 1300 , 1900 ( FIGS. 13, 19 ).
- the device performing process 500 receives a historical record of the exchange of messages by an individual at block 505 .
- the messages can be incoming messages, outgoing messages, or both.
- the messages can be chat messages, electronic mail messages, or both.
- the individual can be a person who is in the midst of joining a social network or a person who is already a member of a social network.
- the historical record can identify the recipients of the individual's outgoing messages.
- the historical record can also include information characterizing the transactional characteristics of the messages as well, such as when the messages were sent or received and whether the individual, when receiving incoming messages from others, opened, replied to, and/or forwarded the incoming messages.
- the received historical record will generally not include the content of the messages themselves, i.e., the text of the body of the messages.
- the messages can be chat message records received from database 410 , electronic mail message record received from database 415 , or both.
- the historical record can be received by the device performing process 500 with the consent of the individual.
- the individual's consent can be explicit or implicit.
- the device performing process 500 can be part of a server system that implements an electronic mail server, a chat message server, or both, as well as a social network.
- An individual's participation in the social network can be embedded within the electronic mail or chat message functionality provided by the device.
- access to the social network can be provided to an individual after the individual has logged into an electronic mail or chat message server. The individual can thus access electronic mail or chat messages at the same time that the individual participates in the social network. This allows the individual to implicitly understand that those messages are available to the social network and consent to that availability.
- the device performing process 500 identifies a member in the member network to whom the individual is likely to want to be related at block 510 .
- the member is identified from amongst the senders and the recipients of the messages characterized in the historical record. The identification can be based on a calculation of the probability that the individual is likely to want to be related to a particular member. The calculation can consider, e.g., the number of messages that the individual has exchanged with the member and the transactional characteristics of those exchanges. As described further below, the transactional characteristics of the messages can include the time when the messages were sent or received, how often the messages were read, and whether the messages were replied to or forwarded.
- the calculation can embody the correlation between the number and transactional characteristics of other users' message exchanges and the members that those other member have selected to be related to in the member network, as described further below.
- the calculation will generally not identify every sender or recipient of an individual's messages who is also a member in the member network as a member to whom the individual is likely to want to be related. Rather, the calculation will generally classify some sender or recipient members as members to whom the individual is likely to want to be related and exclude other sender or recipient members from this classification.
- the device performing process 500 outputs an identification of the member to whom the individual is likely to want to be related at block 515 .
- the identification can include information characterizing the member's participation in the social network, such as the location of the member's profile, information drawn from the profile (such as a photo or avatar), or both.
- the identification can be output to a display screen for review by the individual, to a component of a social network server, or to both.
- the identification of the member can be used by a component of a social network server to automatically suggest or subscribe the individual to a relationship with the member.
- the relationship can be as a follower in an asymmetric social network, as described further below.
- FIG. 6 is a schematic representation of a device 600 for identifying a member in the member network to whom the individual is likely to want to be related.
- Device 600 can be implemented in hardware, by a data processing device that performs operations in accordance with a set of machine-readable instructions, or in a combination thereof
- Device 600 can be used in isolation or in conjunction with other devices.
- device 600 can be a component of server 155 in the context of one or both of systems 100 , 400 ( FIGS. 1, 4 ).
- Device 600 can perform operations in isolation or as part of a larger set of activities.
- device 600 can participate in the identification of a member in a member network to whom an individual is likely to want to be related at block 510 of process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Device 600 includes a pair of multipliers 605 , 610 , a summer 615 , and a comparator 620 .
- Multiplier 605 is a hardware or software component that is configured to multiply the number of messages 625 exchanged between an individual “A” and a member “B” in the member network (i.e., “Nmessage_AB”) by a weight 630 .
- Weight 630 embodies correspondence between the number of messages that have been exchanged between an individual and a member and the probability that the individual would chose to be related to the member in the member network. In some implementations, weight 630 can be derived from statistical analysis of the behavior of other members in the member network.
- weight 630 can be a correlation coefficient that embodies the correlation between the number of messages exchanged between other members on the member network and the existence of relationships between those members.
- Multipliers 605 outputs a value 635 characterizing the probability that the individual would chose to be related to the member in the member network that is attributable to the number of messages 625 exchanged between the individual and the member.
- Multiplier 610 is a hardware or software component that is configured to multiply a parameter 640 that characterizes the timing of the messages exchanged between an individual “A” and a member “B” and a weight 645 .
- Parameter 640 changes as the time since messages were sent to embody the principle that an individual “A” who exchanged messages with a member “B” more recently would be more likely to choose to be related to member “B” that an individual “A” who exchanged messages with a member “B” less recently.
- this principle is embodied in a parameter 640 that is based on the sum of a collection of values, each of which is associated with an individual message and each of which decays over time.
- an exponentially decaying value (exp( ⁇ t i / 1 ) is calculated, wherein t i is the time since the message “i” was sent and “ 1 ” is a rate constant that embodies the rate of decrease in probability that the individual would chose to be related to that member in the member network.
- the exponentially decaying values of all “N” messages exchanged by the individual and the member are then summed.
- parameter 640 is also normalized by the number of messages “N” (as shown) and parameter 1040 is an average of the decayed time since the messages were sent.
- Weight 645 embodies correspondence between parameter 640 and the probability that the individual would chose to be related to the member in the member network.
- weight 645 can be derived from statistical analysis of the behavior of other members in the member network.
- weight 645 can be a correlation coefficient that embodies the correlation between such normalized sums and the existence of relationships between those other members.
- Multiplier 610 outputs a value 650 characterizing the probability that the individual would chose to be related to the member in the member network that is attributable to the timing of the messages exchanged between the individual and the member.
- Summer 615 receives values 635 , 650 and sums them to generate a composite value 655 that characterizes the probability that the individual would chose to be related to the member in the member network.
- Composite value 655 embodies both the number of messages 625 exchanged between an individual “A” and a member “B” and the timing of those messages.
- Comparator 620 receives composite value 655 and compares it with a threshold value 660 .
- Threshold value 660 is a threshold for composite value 655 beyond which the member “B” will be identified as a member to whom the individual “A” is likely to want to be related in the member network.
- Threshold value 660 can be stored as digital data in a data storage device or embodied, e.g., as an analog voltage or current. Comparator 620 outputs a result 665 of the comparison.
- an identification of member “B” can be output at step 515 ( FIG. 5 ) in response to result 665 indicating that composite value 655 is beyond threshold value 660 .
- the identification of member “B” can be used, e.g., to suggest or subscribe individual “A” as a follower of member “B” in an asymmetric social network.
- FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of a device 700 for identifying a member in the member network to whom the individual is likely to want to be related.
- Device 700 can be implemented in hardware, by a data processing device that performs operations in accordance with a set of machine-readable instructions, or in a combination thereof.
- Device 700 can be used in isolation or in conjunction with other devices.
- device 700 can be a component of server 155 in the context of one or both of systems 100 , 400 ( FIGS. 1, 4 ).
- Device 700 can perform operations in isolation or as part of a larger set of activities.
- device 700 can participate in the identification of a member in a member network to whom an individual is likely to want to be related at block 510 of process 500 ( FIG.
- Device 700 includes a pair of multipliers 605 , 710 , a summer 715 , and a comparator 720 .
- Multiplier 710 is a hardware or software component that is configured to multiply a parameter 740 that characterizes the reading—by individual “A”—of messages sent by member “B” and a weight 745 .
