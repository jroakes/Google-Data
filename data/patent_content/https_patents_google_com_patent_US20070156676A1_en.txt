The third party server 200 then sends an indication of the determined media files 235 to the media player 100 to be played.
- the sent indication may be an identifying reference enabling the third party player 100 to locally access and play the selected media file.
- the sent indication may be the content of the media file 235 for play by the media player 100 . In this way the third party server 200 and media player 100 work cooperatively to perform the groupwise media selection and playing functions for users who are physically local to the media player 100 .
- the personal information for a particular user may be sent as an electronic message from that user's personal information device 110 to the third party server 200 for processing.
- the third party server maintains a datastore of personal information 230 associated with each of the portable information devices 110 A,B,C (and/or its user.)
- the third party server 200 identifies the corresponding user of each portable information device based on a unique user ID 295 that is conveyed electronically and/or other unique communications handshake that is performed when the portable information devices 110 A,B,C wirelessly connect either to the server 200 or the network 285 E coupled to the server 200 .
- each personal information device 110 A,B,C may be determined by each device's MAC number or other unique identifier for example, a digital certificate or serial number.
- the users establish accounts with the third party server 200 and are assigned a unique ID 295 .
- the unique ID 295 may be the user's phone number or other communication address.
- the third party server 200 may perform some or all of the processing necessary to determine a composite of the user taste preferences and predict which of a plurality of media files, stored in datastore locally 235 or a datastore 35 coupled to the media player 100 , would likely be appreciated by a majority or significant portion of the users who are then currently local to that particular media player.
- the media player 100 and/or third party server 200 are also configured to cease using the personal information associated with particular personal information devices 110 A,B,C (and/or particular users) when it is determined that the user is no longer within proximity of the media player 100 and/or after more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since a message was received affirmatively indicating that the user is within proximity of the media player.
- a user's personal information is ceased from being used in a groupwise media selection process for a particular media player 100 when the locative information no longer indicates that the user is within proximity of that media player and/or more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since it was affirmatively determined that the user is within proximity of that media player 100 .
- SMS message 290 indicating that the user's personal information should be used in the groupwise media selection for a particular media player
- that user's personal information is ceased from being used in the groupwise media selection process for that media player 100 when either a message is received explicitly indicating that the user's personal information should no longer be used in the groupwise media selection for a particular media player and/or more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since the initial message was received.
- the certain amount of time is one hour.
- a user may enter an establishment, send a message to the third party server 200 as described previously, and have his or her personal information used in the groupwise media selection process for that establishment for a period of one hour following the transmission of the message.
- a hybrid exemplary embodiment may be employed in which the media player 100 interrogates a plurality of personal information devices 110 that are within certain proximity, accesses a unique ID value 295 associated with each user (or each personal information device), and transmits the unique ID values 295 to the third party server.
- the third party server 200 then accesses personal information for each user by referencing data store 230 with the unique ID values 295 .
- the third party server 200 then performs, alone or in combination with the media player 100 , a groupwise media selection process using a representation of the personal information for each of the plurality of users.
- the media player then plays the selected song to the users who are within listening proximity.
- the media player 100 executes a groupwise selection program 305 to automatically select and play a media file from a plurality of available media files that are stored in datastore 235 .
- the selected media file is intelligently selected such that it is likely to be favored by a plurality of users who are currently within listening (and/or viewing) proximity of the media player 100 .
- the media player 100 receives data 30 representing one or more individual user's media taste preferences 330 , for example over a wireless connection 85 A from one or more personal information devices 110 A,B,C in communications with the transceiver 65 .
- the processor 5 directs the incoming individual user's media taste preferences into the memory 10 for processing by a Groupwise selection program 305 .
- the Groupwise selection program 305 determines from the received data 30 each of the user's media taste preferences 330 with respect to one or more characteristics 335 associated with the media files stored in the datastore 235 .
- the characteristics 335 include genre, artist, album, composition, and time period of release.
- the received data 30 may also include media exposure history 340 .
- the media exposure history 340 includes a log of chronological exposure information 335 which includes, for example, the time of last play, frequency of play, and/or number of plays over a previous time interval and the last play occurrence of one or more media files.
- Each of the characteristics 335 and/or the chronological information 355 may be separated provided with ratings 345 .
- a user may provide a rating 345 using a standard scale of 1-10 which is used to determine a user's preference for a particular media file, particular media genre, particular media album, particular media artist, and/or particular time period of media release.
- ranking values may also or alternatively be used.
- An exemplary data file 30 may have formats such as provided in Tables 1, 2 and 2 below.
- the exemplary data file formats are indicative of a database, however, a flat file format would work as well.
- Table 1 provides a high level data arrangement where a user enters his or her preferences for predetermined genre categories. This arrangement allows a relatively rapid determination of individual media taste preferences to arrive at a composite media taste preference.
- unrated characteristics are automatically assigned a nominal value, for example a neutral value of 5 on a scale of 0 to 10.
- Table 2 provides a more detailed data arrangement where each user enters his or her preferences for an actually experienced media file. This arrangement allows a more accurate assessment of individual media taste preferences to arrive at a composite media taste preference. A data format of this type is particularly useful when all users have experienced the same media files and provided ratings thereto. TABLE 3 Exemplary User Ratings Based on Chronology Interval No. Times Freq.
- Table 3 provides detailed chronological data obtained for each media file experienced by the users of Table 2.
- the data includes the number of times a media file was experienced, how often a particular media file was experienced over the course of a month, an average interval of experiencing the particular media file and the last date in which the particular media file was experienced.
- the chronological data chosen in this exemplary Table 3 are arbitrarily chosen.
- the date information is shown in a Julian date format.
- a composite of the individual media taste preferences can be determined using simple weighting of the various results. For example, using the highest media taste preference information from Table 1 would provide composite media taste preferences of 6.3 for Rock, 5.3 for jazz, 2.7 for Rap, 4.7 for Blues, 5.0 for Country. As such Rock would be favored for selection over all other categories.
- a playlist could be generated which included 6 Rock media files, 5 jazz media files, 3 Rap media files, 5 Blues media files and 5 Country media files.
- the determined weighting factors 375 may then be used to select one or more media files from the datastore.
- only media files associated with genres that have a composite media taste preference values exceeding a certain threshold are selected. For example, if a composite media taste threshold value of 5.0 was used, only Rock and jazz media files would be selected for the group of users represented by the example data.
- the proportion of Rock selections versus jazz selections may be controlled such that it approximately reflects the relative composite rating values.
- the more specific media taste preference information from Table 2 could be used to determine the most favorable artist based on the numeric ratings provided by each of the users.
- the most favorable artist appears to be The Beastie Boys 7.3, followed by the Eagles 6.7 and Heart 5.7.
- the most favorable album would be the Eagles greatest hits 7.0 followed by License to Ill 6.0 and Hearts greatest hits 5.3.
- selecting the most favorable composition Hotel California 9.0 followed by Fight for Your Right 7.7 and Magic Man 5.7.
- the chronology information could be used to vary the above determined weighting factors by reducing or increasing the weighting factors 375 based on whether a media file has been experienced within a certain time period, recently and/or frequency. Additional information regarding performing intelligent selection of media based upon user preference data and/or user exposure history data is provided in the instant inventor's co-pending U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 11/285,534 and entitled “System, Method and Computer Program Product for Rejecting or Deferring the Playing Of A Media File Retrieved By An Automated Process,” filed Nov. 23, 2005 and Ser. No. 11/267,079 filed Nov. 03, 2005, and entitled “System, Method, and Computer Program Product for Automatically Selecting, Suggesting, and Playing Music Media Files,” which have been incorporated herein by reference.
- additional criteria may be incorporated into the media file selection process.
- ambient factors may be used to further refine the media file selections. Information regarding inclusion of ambient factors is provided in the instant inventor's aforementioned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/267,079, filed Nov. 03, 2005.
- one or more media files are retrieved from the datastore 235 using the composite data.
- the selected media file(s) 335 are operatively stored in the memory 10 and played by a media player program 300 .
- the media player program 300 outputs the playing media file 335 to the audio processing subsystem 80 .
- the audio processing subsystem 80 then outputs the playing media file 335 in a human cognizable form to the loudspeakers 95 A,B.
- both audio and video outputs may be provided to the users (not shown.)
- multiple media files are selected at once, they may be arranged in a playlist format that indicates which files are to be played as well as the order in which they are to be played.
- the media files are selected sequentially; a next media file being selected immediately before a previous media file completes play.
- This arrangement enables close time proximity between the selection of a media file and the play of a media file, which is advantageous because it helps ensure that the plurality of users whose personal information is used by the groupwise media selection process is current at the time of selection. This helps account for new users who have joined the plurality (by coming within proximity of the media player) and/or old users who have left the plurality (by leaving proximity of the media player or by timing out), during the time period since the last media selection was made.
- a media file is selected from a plurality of media files using a weighted randomization process that employs the media taste preference data 330 and/or media exposure history data 340 of a plurality of users currently within listening proximity of the media player 100 .
- the media taste preference data 330 for each of the plurality of users may be considered by the random selection process by the groupwise selection program 305 . For example, if the media taste preference data 330 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users are favorable toward a particular media file (i.e.
- the media taste preference data 330 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users have indicates are not partial a particular media file (i.e. have indicated that they dislike the particular media file, dislike the particular genre of media file to which it belongs, and/or dislike the particular artist associated with the media file) that media file may be negatively weighted within the random selection process such that it is statistically less likely to be selected at random. In this way the random selection process is more likely to select media files that the members of the group of users are favorable.
- Partiality towards a particular media file, a particular genre of media file, a particular album or collection of media files, a particular time period of release of media files, and/or a particular media artist 325 may be represented within the media taste preference data 330 of each user in a plurality of ways.
- subjective rating data 345 may be stored within the media taste preference data 330 , the subjective rating data 345 indicating a degree of partiality for particular media files, media genres, media albums, and/or media artists, on a scale for example from 0 to 10. For example, a 10 rating indicates that the user strongly likes the particular media file, media genre, media album, or media artist 325 to which the rating is associated, while a rating of 0 indicates that the user strongly dislikes the particular media file, media genre, media album, or media artist 325 to which the rating is associated. Rating between 0 and 10 thereby indicate the degree of partiality between the two extremes, rating values at or near 5 indicating a neutral partiality.
- the media taste preference data 330 is stored within a personal information device 110 for each user, the media taste preference data 330 including values indicating the user's partiality toward particular media files, media genres, media albums or collections, and/or media artists 325 .
- the above described algorithms may be configured such that the random selection routines accesses the media taste preference data 330 from each of the plurality of users in the group of users and employs the media taste preference data 330 of each of the plurality of users in the determination of the weighting factor 375 determined for each of the plurality of media files 235 .
- the media taste preference data 330 for each of a plurality of users may be considered in the determination of the weighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235 .
- an exclusive assessment algorithm may be employed by the groupwise selection program 305 such that the least preferred partiality to a particular media file 335 is stored for any single users and used by the algorithms described above.
- the algorithm lowers the weighting for the media file in the random selection process based upon the degree to which that user strongly dislikes the media file.
- that user's partiality governs the weighting of that media file 335 in the random selection process.
- an averaging assessment algorithm may be used by the groupwise selection program 305 in the determination of the weighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235 .
- the partiality data for a particular media file is accessed for each of the plurality of users in the group of users and is averaged together into a resultant composite value.
- the algorithm accesses media taste preference data 330 for each of the plurality users, averages the subjective rating data 345 for that media file 335 across the plurality of users, and employs averaged data in the weighting algorithm.
- the groupwise selection program 305 will access media taste preference data 330 for each of the five users, including subjective rating values 345 for each of a plurality of media files 235 for each of the five users, and average the subjective rating values on a media file 335 by media file 335 basis across the five users.
- a composite subjective rating value 345 will be computed that is the average of the subjective ratings of that media file 335 for each of the five users in the plurality of users. This average value is then employed in the algorithms described above to determine the random selection weighting factor 375 for that particular media file. In this way, the central tendency of user partiality to a particular media file 335 among of the plurality of users in the group of five users will be considered by the algorithm.
- the central tendency indicates that the group as a whole is strongly favorable to a particular media file
- the media file will be positively weighted in the random selection process.
- the central tendency indicates that the group as a whole strongly dislikes the particular media item
- the media items may be negatively weighted or reduced in significance in the random selection process.
- the central tendency indicates that the group as a whole is neutral to the particular media item, the media items will be neutrally weighted in the random selection process.
- ⁇ may be used to find the central tendency of partiality to a particular media file 335 among the group of users. For example, in some such exemplary embodiments, the median partiality value for a particular media file 335 may be found across a plurality of users. In other exemplary embodiments, more complex statistical assessments may be employed to determine the central tendency of partiality to a particular media file 335 among the plurality of users. The central tendency is then used in the weighted random selection process.
- a media file 335 is not merely negatively weighted or otherwise reduced in significance in the random selection process, but is removed altogether from consideration. This may occur if a media file 335 is universally disliked by one or more users in the group of users. This may occur if a media file 335 has been recently experienced by one or more users in the group of users.
- the media file 335 is removed from a data structure that lists all media files available for selection at the current time.
- the media file 335 is assigned a weighting value 375 of zero, which removes the media file from being selected.
- a weighted random selection process may be used in which the groupwise selection program 305 selects a media file 335 for play from a plurality of available media files 235 using a random selection method such that the probability of selecting a particular media file from the plurality of available media files is weighted 375 based upon the media exposure history data 340 and/or the media taste preference data 330 for each of the plurality of users.
- the media exposure history data 340 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users have experienced a particular media file within a certain time period and/or a certain number of times within a certain prior time period 355 , that particular media file is negatively weighted within the random selection process such that it is statistically less likely to be selected at random.
- the media exposure history data 340 indicates that some or all of the users have not experienced a particular media file within a certain time period and/or have not experienced that particular media file more than a certain number of times within a certain previous time period, that media file is positively weighted 375 within the random selection process such that it is statistically more likely to be selected relative to a purely random selection process.
- the groupwise selection program 305 provides a weighted random selection process such that media files 235 that have been recently experienced by some or all of the users are statistically less likely to be selected at random than media files 235 that have not been experienced recently by some or all of the users in the group of users.
- the weighting process for a particular media file 335 may be configured to consider the elapsed time since the media file 335 was last experienced by each user in the group, assigning a more positive weighting to the media file 335 if the elapsed time is higher and assigning a less positive weighting (or a negative weighting) if the elapsed time is lower.
- a nominal threshold value may be assigned such that if the elapsed time is greater than the assigned threshold, a positive weighting is assigned with a value that increases positively with larger elapsed time, and if the elapsed time is lower than the assigned threshold, a negative weighting is assigned a value that increases negatively with smaller elapsed time.
- a weighting algorithm could be implemented such that if a particular media file 335 has been experienced by a user in the group within the last 24 hours (as determined by the elapsed time associated with that media file 335 in the media exposure history data 340 of one or more users) the media file is negatively weighted or otherwise reduced in significance, the more recently the media file 335 had been experienced the more negatively weighted. And if a particular media file 335 has not been experienced by a user in the group within the last 24 hours (as determined by the elapsed time associated with that media file 335 in the media exposure history data 340 of one or more users) it is positively weighted, the longer ago the item had been experienced the more positively weighted.
- Such an algorithm may generally be constructed with a positive saturation point such that a media file 335 that has not been listened to by any of the user for more than some upper threshold amount of time is assigned a maximum positive weighting value enabled by the algorithm (for example is assigned 10 times the nominal chances of being selected at random).
- the algorithm may also be configured with a negative saturation point such that a media file 335 that has very recently been experienced by one or more of the users in the group of users, for example within the last ten minutes, may be assigned a maximum negative weighting (for example is assigned 1/10 the nominal chances of being selected at random) or is simply removed from the random selection process such that its chances of being selected are zero at the present time.
- a negative saturation point such that a media file 335 that has very recently been experienced by one or more of the users in the group of users, for example within the last ten minutes, may be assigned a maximum negative weighting (for example is assigned 1/10 the nominal chances of being selected at random) or is simply removed from the random selection process such that its chances of being selected are zero at the present time.
- some weighting algorithms may be configured to consider the number of times (i.e., the frequency) for which a particular media file 335 was experienced within a particular prior time period.
- the weighting process may be configured to positively weight a media file 335 more if it has been experienced a lower number of times over a given time period and negatively weight a media file 335 more if it has been experienced a greater number of times over a given time period.
- the given time period may be an assigned value such as 10 days, for example.
- the algorithm can be configured, for example, to positively weight a media file 335 more if it has been experienced a lower number of times during the past 10 days and negatively weight a media file 335 more if it has been experienced a greater number of times during the past 10 days.
- a frequency threshold value is assigned such that if the number of times a user has been exposed to the media file 335 during the defined time period is greater than the frequency threshold, a negative weighting is assigned with a value that increases negatively with increasing number of exposures.
- a positive weighting is assigned with a value that increases positively with decreasing number of exposures.
- a weighting algorithm could be configured such that if a particular media file 335 has been experienced by a user in the group more than 3 times within the last 10 days it is negatively weighted such that the more times it has been experienced, the more it is negatively weighted.
- a particular media file 335 may be positively weighted such that the fewer times it has been experienced, the more it is positively weighted.
- the above algorithms are such that the random selection routine accesses the media exposure history 340 from each of the plurality of users in the group of users and employs data from the media exposure history 340 of each of the plurality of users in the determination of a weighting factor 375 used for each of a plurality of media files 235 .
- the media exposure history data 340 for each of a plurality of users may be considered in the determination of the weighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235 .
- an exclusive assessment process is used such that the largest amount of exposure to a particular media file to any single user is incorporated into the algorithms described above.
- the algorithm collects media exposure history data 340 for each of the plurality users and employs the data from the users which indicates the shortest elapsed time for any of the plurality of users in the algorithm.
- the media player 100 will access media exposure history data 340 for each of the five users and determine the elapsed time since each user was exposed to each of a plurality of media items. For each media file 235 , the most recent exposure among any of the five users is employed in the algorithms described above to determine the random selection weighting factor 375 for that particular media file 335 .
- an averaging assessment algorithm may be used by the groupwise selection program 305 in the determination of the weighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235 .
- the amount of exposure to a particular media file that is detected among the plurality of users in the group of users is averaged together and then employed by the algorithms described above.
- the algorithm accesses media exposure history data 340 for each of the plurality users, averages them together on a media file 335 by media file 335 basis across the plurality of users, and employs averaged data in the weighting algorithm.
- the algorithms described above will access media exposure history data 340 for each of the five users, determine the elapsed time since exposure for each of a plurality of media files 235 for each of the five users, and average the elapsed times together on a media file 335 by media file 335 basis, across the five users.
- an average elapsed time since exposure value 355 will be computed that is the average of the elapsed times since exposure to that media file 335 for each of the five users in the plurality of users.
- This average value is then employed in the algorithms described above to determine the random selection weighting factor 375 for that particular media items.
- the central tendency of exposure to a particular media file 335 among of the plurality of users in the group of five users will be considered by the algorithm. If the central tendency (i.e. the average) indicates that the group as a whole has been exposed recently to the particular media file 335 , the media file 335 will be negatively weighted in the random selection process, the more recent the exposure the more negative the weighting.
- more complex statistical assessments may be employed to determine the central tendency of exposure to a particular media file 335 among the plurality of users. The central tendency is then used in the weighted random selection processes described previously.

FIG. 2 provides a generalized communications arrangement between a plurality ofpersonal information devices 110A,B,C, amedia player 100 and/or athird party server 200. In an exemplary embodiment, apersonal information device 110A is inprocessing communications 285A with themedia player 100. In an exemplary embodiment, themedia player 100 becomes alerted to the presence of thepersonal information device 110A when thetransceiver 65A of thepersonal information device 110A performs a handshake transaction which identifies thepersonal identification device 110A to themedia player 100. The identification of eachpersonal information device 110A,B,C may be determined by each device's MAC number or other unique identifier for example, a digital certificate or serial number. - In this exemplary embodiment, each of the
portable information devices 110A sends data representing its associated user's personal information retrieved from each device's data file 30A,B,C over awireless connection 285A,B,C to themedia player 100 for use by thegroupwise selection program 305. This arrangement results in the playing ofmedia file 35 which corresponds to what a majority or a significant portion of the users are likely to be partial to. - In another exemplary embodiment, the each
portable information device 110A,B,C is equipped with aGPS receiver 70A. In an exemplary embodiment, theGPS position data 290A,B,C from eachportable information device 110A,B,C is sent over awireless connection 285F to athird party server 200. TheGPS data 290A,B,C may be sent directly 285G to thethird party server 200 or sent via awireless network 285E. Thethird party server 200 determines if one or more of theportable information devices 110A,B,C are within a predetermined proximity or area. The predetermined proximity or area being sufficiently close to themedia player 100 to experience amedia file 35 when played. If one or more of theportable information devices 110A,B,C are within a predetermined proximity or area, thethird party server 200 signals themedia player 100 or otherwise takes appropriate action to ensure that at least a portion of the personal information associated with the one or moreportable information devices 110A,B,C is used in the groupwise media selection process that selects media formedia player 100. - In some such exemplary embodiments, the
third party server 200 may be configured to service a plurality ofmedia players 100, each of the plurality ofmedia players 100 independently playing different music for a different physical location. For example, thethird party server 200 may be configured to service a plurality of different restaurants, bars, health clubs, and coffee houses, each having at least oneseparate media player 100 playing separate music for a separate physical location. - In such exemplary embodiments, the
third party server 200 maintains in accessible memory a plurality of predetermined proximities and/or areas that are each relationally associated with aparticular media player 100, indexed by a unique ID value or other identifier for thatmedia player 100. Thethird party server 200 receives GPS location data from a plurality ofportable information devices 110A,B,C of a plurality of users, determines if the user is located within any one of the plurality of predetermined proximities and/or areas, and if so determines whichmedia player 100 that location and/or area corresponds to. Thethird party server 200 then takes action to ensure that at least a portion of the personal information associated with that user is used in a groupwise selection process associated with thatmedia player 100. - In an alternate exemplary embodiment, the user of each portable information device may cause his or her
portable information device 110A,B,C to send an electronic message to thethird party server 200 indicating affirmatively that the user is in proximity of amedia player 100 and desires to have at least a portion of that user's personal information used in the groupwise media selection process that selects media for play upon that media player. Because the third party server may be configured to perform such functions for a plurality ofseparate media player 100's, each playing separate music to a separate physical location, this exemplary embodiment may require that the electronic message sent from theportable information device 110 to thethird party server 200 indicates by unique ID code, which physical location (and/or associated media player) the user wishes his or her personal information to be used in the groupwise media selection process for. - For example, the user may send an short message service (SMS)
message 290 to the third party server that includes a unique code associated with a particular restaurant, bar, club, or coffee house, thereby indicating to thethird party server 200 that the user wishes to have at least a portion of his or her personal information used in the groupwise media selection process for the media player associated with that particular physical establishment. Thethird party server 200 then takes action to ensure that at least a portion of the personal information associated with that user is used in a groupwise selection process associated with thatmedia player 100. This arrangement enables, for example, a user to enter a physical establishment such as a restaurant or bar or coffee house, send a quickSMS text message 290 to thethird party server 200 identifying the establishment, and thereby have his or her personal tastes and/or exposure history used in combination with other similar users in the groupwise media selection of media for that physical establishment. - In certain exemplary embodiments a user is charged a fee for sending such an
SMS text message 290 or other electronic message to the third party server, enabling a pay for participation service in which a user's personal tastes and/or exposure history are used in the groupwise media selection process in exchange for said fee. In one exemplary embodiment the user's personal tastes and/or exposure history are used in the groupwise media selection process for a certain period of time following the receipt of theSMS text message 290 or other electronic message, for example one hour, in exchange for said fee. In some such embodiments the fee is added to the phone bill of a user. In one exemplary embodiment a user is charged a fee, for example $0.25, in exchange for having his or her personal tastes and/or exposure history used in the groupwise media selection process associated with the particular physical establishment for the particular period of time. - In an exemplary embodiment, the
third party server 200 receives each portable information device's personal information from the data files 30A,B,C and sends a representation of the received personal information to themedia player 100 over thenetwork 285E. In an exemplary embodiment, the third party server may determine a composite of the personal information and send the composite over thenetwork 285E to themedia player 100. - In certain exemplary embodiments, the
third party server 200 may perform some or all of the functions of the groupwisemedia selection program 305. In this way thethird party server 200 may determine one ormore media files 235 which correspond to what the majority or a significant portion) of the individual users are likely to be partial to at the present time. Thethird party server 200 then sends an indication of thedetermined media files 235 to themedia player 100 to be played. The sent indication may be an identifying reference enabling thethird party player 100 to locally access and play the selected media file. The sent indication may be the content of themedia file 235 for play by themedia player 100. In this way thethird party server 200 andmedia player 100 work cooperatively to perform the groupwise media selection and playing functions for users who are physically local to themedia player 100. - In some of the above exemplary embodiments that employ a
third party server 200, the personal information for a particular user may be sent as an electronic message from that user'spersonal information device 110 to thethird party server 200 for processing. In other exemplary embodiments, the third party server maintains a datastore ofpersonal information 230 associated with each of theportable information devices 110A,B,C (and/or its user.) In such exemplary embodiments, thethird party server 200 identifies the corresponding user of each portable information device based on aunique user ID 295 that is conveyed electronically and/or other unique communications handshake that is performed when theportable information devices 110A,B,C wirelessly connect either to theserver 200 or thenetwork 285E coupled to theserver 200. - As before, the identification of each
personal information device 110A,B,C may be determined by each device's MAC number or other unique identifier for example, a digital certificate or serial number. In certain exemplary embodiments, the users establish accounts with thethird party server 200 and are assigned aunique ID 295. In other exemplary embodiments, theunique ID 295 may be the user's phone number or other communication address. In various exemplary embodiments, thethird party server 200 may perform some or all of the processing necessary to determine a composite of the user taste preferences and predict which of a plurality of media files, stored in datastore locally 235 or adatastore 35 coupled to themedia player 100, would likely be appreciated by a majority or significant portion of the users who are then currently local to that particular media player. - Because the composition of users who are local to a particular media player 100 (or believed to be local to a particular media player) at any given time is continually changing as users enter and leave proximity of the media player, the
media player 100 and/orthird party server 200 are also configured to cease using the personal information associated with particularpersonal information devices 110A,B,C (and/or particular users) when it is determined that the user is no longer within proximity of themedia player 100 and/or after more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since a message was received affirmatively indicating that the user is within proximity of the media player. - For example, in some exemplary embodiments that user RFID messaging, GPS locative messaging, and/or other proximity based detection and/or messaging, a user's personal information is ceased from being used in a groupwise media selection process for a
particular media player 100 when the locative information no longer indicates that the user is within proximity of that media player and/or more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since it was affirmatively determined that the user is within proximity of thatmedia player 100. Similarly, for exemplary embodiments that enable a user to explicitly send a message, for example anSMS message 290, indicating that the user's personal information should be used in the groupwise media selection for a particular media player, that user's personal information is ceased from being used in the groupwise media selection process for thatmedia player 100 when either a message is received explicitly indicating that the user's personal information should no longer be used in the groupwise media selection for a particular media player and/or more than a certain amount of time has elapsed since the initial message was received. - In certain exemplary embodiments, the certain amount of time is one hour. Thus a user may enter an establishment, send a message to the
third party server 200 as described previously, and have his or her personal information used in the groupwise media selection process for that establishment for a period of one hour following the transmission of the message. - Finally, a hybrid exemplary embodiment may be employed in which the
media player 100 interrogates a plurality ofpersonal information devices 110 that are within certain proximity, accesses aunique ID value 295 associated with each user (or each personal information device), and transmits theunique ID values 295 to the third party server. Thethird party server 200 then accesses personal information for each user by referencingdata store 230 with the unique ID values 295. Thethird party server 200 then performs, alone or in combination with themedia player 100, a groupwise media selection process using a representation of the personal information for each of the plurality of users. The media player then plays the selected song to the users who are within listening proximity. - Referring
FIG. 3 , an exemplary pseudo-processing architecture of themedia player 100 is depicted. It should be noted that the functions described here with respect to themedia player 100, in some exemplary embodiments, may be shared with and/or performed bythird party server 200. Themedia player 100 executes agroupwise selection program 305 to automatically select and play a media file from a plurality of available media files that are stored indatastore 235. In an exemplary embodiment, the selected media file is intelligently selected such that it is likely to be favored by a plurality of users who are currently within listening (and/or viewing) proximity of themedia player 100. - In an exemplary embodiment, the
media player 100 receivesdata 30 representing one or more individual user'smedia taste preferences 330, for example over awireless connection 85A from one or morepersonal information devices 110A,B,C in communications with thetransceiver 65. Theprocessor 5 directs the incoming individual user's media taste preferences into thememory 10 for processing by aGroupwise selection program 305. - The
Groupwise selection program 305 determines from the receiveddata 30 each of the user'smedia taste preferences 330 with respect to one ormore characteristics 335 associated with the media files stored in thedatastore 235. Thecharacteristics 335 include genre, artist, album, composition, and time period of release. In an exemplary embodiment, the receiveddata 30 may also includemedia exposure history 340. - The
media exposure history 340 includes a log ofchronological exposure information 335 which includes, for example, the time of last play, frequency of play, and/or number of plays over a previous time interval and the last play occurrence of one or more media files. - Each of the
characteristics 335 and/or thechronological information 355 may be separated provided withratings 345. For example, a user may provide arating 345 using a standard scale of 1-10 which is used to determine a user's preference for a particular media file, particular media genre, particular media album, particular media artist, and/or particular time period of media release. As described previously, ranking values may also or alternatively be used. - An exemplary data file 30 may have formats such as provided in Tables 1, 2 and 2 below. The exemplary data file formats are indicative of a database, however, a flat file format would work as well.
TABLE 1 Exemplary User Ratings Based on Genre Genre Rating User_001 Rock 10 Jazz 7 Rap 2 Blues 6 Country 3 User_002 Rock 6 Jazz 4 Rap 0 Blues 6 Country 3 User_003 Rock 3 Jazz 5 Rap 6 Blues 2 Country 9 - Table 1 provides a high level data arrangement where a user enters his or her preferences for predetermined genre categories. This arrangement allows a relatively rapid determination of individual media taste preferences to arrive at a composite media taste preference. In certain exemplary embodiments, unrated characteristics are automatically assigned a nominal value, for example a neutral value of 5 on a scale of 0 to 10.
TABLE 2 Exemplary User Ratings Based on Additional Characteristics Artist Album Composition User_001 File_001 Heart Greatest Hits Magic Man Rating 10 8 7 File_002 Eagles Greatest Hits Hotel California Rating 8 8 10 File_003 Beastie Boys License To Ill Fight For Your Right Rating 6 3 5 User_002 File_001 Heart Greatest Hits Magic Man Rating 5 7 7 File_002 Eagles Greatest Hits Hotel California Rating 7 7 8 File_003 Beastie Boys License To Ill Fight For Your Right Rating 6 6 8 User_003 File_001 Heart Greatest Hits Magic Man Rating 2 1 3 File_002 Eagles Greatest Hits Hotel California Rating 5 6 9 File_003 Beastie Boys License To Ill Fight For Your Right Rating 10 9 10 - Table 2 provides a more detailed data arrangement where each user enters his or her preferences for an actually experienced media file. This arrangement allows a more accurate assessment of individual media taste preferences to arrive at a composite media taste preference. A data format of this type is particularly useful when all users have experienced the same media files and provided ratings thereto.
TABLE 3 Exemplary User Ratings Based on Chronology Interval No. Times Freq.

The data includes the number of times a media file was experienced, how often a particular media file was experienced over the course of a month, an average interval of experiencing the particular media file and the last date in which the particular media file was experienced. The chronological data chosen in this exemplary Table 3 are arbitrarily chosen. The date information is shown in a Julian date format.
- Based on the personal information obtained from each of the
portable information devices 110A,B,C (and/or accessed from athird party server 200 with reference to a unique ID value accessed from theportable information devices 110A,B,C) a composite of the individual media taste preferences can be determined using simple weighting of the various results. For example, using the highest media taste preference information from Table 1 would provide composite media taste preferences of 6.3 for Rock, 5.3 for Jazz, 2.7 for Rap, 4.7 for Blues, 5.0 for Country. As such Rock would be favored for selection over all other categories. In an exemplary embodiment, a playlist could be generated which included 6 Rock media files, 5 Jazz media files, 3 Rap media files, 5 Blues media files and 5 Country media files. Thedetermined weighting factors 375 may then be used to select one or more media files from the datastore. - In certain exemplary embodiments, only media files associated with genres that have a composite media taste preference values exceeding a certain threshold are selected. For example, if a composite media taste threshold value of 5.0 was used, only Rock and Jazz media files would be selected for the group of users represented by the example data. In addition, the proportion of Rock selections versus Jazz selections may be controlled such that it approximately reflects the relative composite rating values.
- Analogously, the more specific media taste preference information from Table 2 could be used to determine the most favorable artist based on the numeric ratings provided by each of the users. In an exemplary embodiment, the most favorable artist appears to be The Beastie Boys 7.3, followed by the Eagles 6.7 and Heart 5.7. In an exemplary embodiment, the most favorable album would be the Eagles greatest hits 7.0 followed by License to Ill 6.0 and Hearts greatest hits 5.3. In another exemplary embodiment selecting the most favorable composition, Hotel California 9.0 followed by Fight for Your Right 7.7 and Magic Man 5.7.
- In an exemplary embodiment, the chronology information could be used to vary the above determined weighting factors by reducing or increasing the weighting factors 375 based on whether a media file has been experienced within a certain time period, recently and/or frequency. Additional information regarding performing intelligent selection of media based upon user preference data and/or user exposure history data is provided in the instant inventor's co-pending U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 11/285,534 and entitled “System, Method and Computer Program Product for Rejecting or Deferring the Playing Of A Media File Retrieved By An Automated Process,” filed Nov. 23, 2005 and Ser. No. 11/267,079 filed Nov. 03, 2005, and entitled “System, Method, and Computer Program Product for Automatically Selecting, Suggesting, and Playing Music Media Files,” which have been incorporated herein by reference.
- In an exemplary embodiment, additional criteria may be incorporated into the media file selection process. For example, ambient factors may be used to further refine the media file selections. Information regarding inclusion of ambient factors is provided in the instant inventor's aforementioned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/267,079, filed Nov. 03, 2005.
- Once the composite of the individual media taste preferences has been determined, one or more media files are retrieved from the
datastore 235 using the composite data. The selected media file(s) 335 are operatively stored in thememory 10 and played by amedia player program 300. Themedia player program 300 outputs the playingmedia file 335 to theaudio processing subsystem 80. Theaudio processing subsystem 80 then outputs the playingmedia file 335 in a human cognizable form to theloudspeakers 95A,B. In an exemplary embodiment, both audio and video outputs may be provided to the users (not shown.) For certain exemplary embodiments in which multiple media files are selected at once, they may be arranged in a playlist format that indicates which files are to be played as well as the order in which they are to be played. In common embodiments the media files are selected sequentially; a next media file being selected immediately before a previous media file completes play. - This arrangement enables close time proximity between the selection of a media file and the play of a media file, which is advantageous because it helps ensure that the plurality of users whose personal information is used by the groupwise media selection process is current at the time of selection. This helps account for new users who have joined the plurality (by coming within proximity of the media player) and/or old users who have left the plurality (by leaving proximity of the media player or by timing out), during the time period since the last media selection was made.
- In certain exemplary embodiments, a media file is selected from a plurality of media files using a weighted randomization process that employs the media taste
preference data 330 and/or mediaexposure history data 340 of a plurality of users currently within listening proximity of themedia player 100. The media tastepreference data 330 for each of the plurality of users may be considered by the random selection process by thegroupwise selection program 305. For example, if the media tastepreference data 330 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users are favorable toward a particular media file (i.e. have indicated that they like the particular media file, like the particular genre of media file to which it belongs, and/or like the particular artist associated with the media file) 325, that media file will be positively weighted within the random selection process such that it is statistically more likely to be selected than at random. - Alternately, if the media taste
preference data 330 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users have indicates are not partial a particular media file (i.e. have indicated that they dislike the particular media file, dislike the particular genre of media file to which it belongs, and/or dislike the particular artist associated with the media file) that media file may be negatively weighted within the random selection process such that it is statistically less likely to be selected at random. In this way the random selection process is more likely to select media files that the members of the group of users are favorable. - Partiality towards a particular media file, a particular genre of media file, a particular album or collection of media files, a particular time period of release of media files, and/or a
particular media artist 325 may be represented within the media tastepreference data 330 of each user in a plurality of ways. - In some exemplary embodiments,
subjective rating data 345 may be stored within the media tastepreference data 330, thesubjective rating data 345 indicating a degree of partiality for particular media files, media genres, media albums, and/or media artists, on a scale for example from 0 to 10. For example, a 10 rating indicates that the user strongly likes the particular media file, media genre, media album, ormedia artist 325 to which the rating is associated, while a rating of 0 indicates that the user strongly dislikes the particular media file, media genre, media album, ormedia artist 325 to which the rating is associated. Rating between 0 and 10 thereby indicate the degree of partiality between the two extremes, rating values at or near 5 indicating a neutral partiality. Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the media tastepreference data 330 is stored within apersonal information device 110 for each user, the media tastepreference data 330 including values indicating the user's partiality toward particular media files, media genres, media albums or collections, and/ormedia artists 325. - The above described algorithms may be configured such that the random selection routines accesses the media taste
preference data 330 from each of the plurality of users in the group of users and employs the media tastepreference data 330 of each of the plurality of users in the determination of theweighting factor 375 determined for each of the plurality of media files 235. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are a variety of methods by which the media tastepreference data 330 for each of a plurality of users may be considered in the determination of theweighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235. - For example, an exclusive assessment algorithm may be employed by the
groupwise selection program 305 such that the least preferred partiality to a particular media file 335 is stored for any single users and used by the algorithms described above. Thus, if any single user in the group strongly dislikes a particular media file, the algorithm lowers the weighting for the media file in the random selection process based upon the degree to which that user strongly dislikes the media file. Thus, in such an arrangement it is the user who most strongly dislikes aparticular media file 335, that user's partiality governs the weighting of thatmedia file 335 in the random selection process. Such an algorithm ensures that if any single user strongly dislikes a particular media file, the selection probability will be significantly reduced for the group of users by the weighted random selection routine. - In alternate exemplary embodiments, an averaging assessment algorithm may be used by the
groupwise selection program 305 in the determination of theweighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235. In such an averaging assessment algorithm, the partiality data for a particular media file is accessed for each of the plurality of users in the group of users and is averaged together into a resultant composite value. - The resultant composite value is then used by the algorithms described above. Thus, if the algorithm considers the subjective
rating partiality data 345 for a particular media file, the algorithm accesses media tastepreference data 330 for each of the plurality users, averages thesubjective rating data 345 for thatmedia file 335 across the plurality of users, and employs averaged data in the weighting algorithm. - For example, if there were five users within the plurality of users, the
groupwise selection program 305 will access media tastepreference data 330 for each of the five users, including subjective rating values 345 for each of a plurality ofmedia files 235 for each of the five users, and average the subjective rating values on amedia file 335 bymedia file 335 basis across the five users. - Thus, for a particular media file 335 a composite
subjective rating value 345 will be computed that is the average of the subjective ratings of thatmedia file 335 for each of the five users in the plurality of users. This average value is then employed in the algorithms described above to determine the randomselection weighting factor 375 for that particular media file. In this way, the central tendency of user partiality to a particular media file 335 among of the plurality of users in the group of five users will be considered by the algorithm. - If the central tendency (i.e. the average) indicates that the group as a whole is strongly favorable to a particular media file, the media file will be positively weighted in the random selection process. If the central tendency (i.e. the average) indicates that the group as a whole strongly dislikes the particular media item, the media items may be negatively weighted or reduced in significance in the random selection process. If the central tendency (i.e. the average) indicates that the group as a whole is neutral to the particular media item, the media items will be neutrally weighted in the random selection process.
- It should be noted that other statistical methods, in addition to or instead of averaging, may be used to find the central tendency of partiality to a particular media file 335 among the group of users. For example, in some such exemplary embodiments, the median partiality value for a particular media file 335 may be found across a plurality of users. In other exemplary embodiments, more complex statistical assessments may be employed to determine the central tendency of partiality to a particular media file 335 among the plurality of users. The central tendency is then used in the weighted random selection process.
- It should be noted while the above descriptions are provided with respect to the media taste
preference data 330 for aparticular media file 335; similar processes may be used for particular media genres, media albums, media collections, compositions and/ormedia artists 325. For example, in such implementations, if a user strongly dislikes a particular media genre, all media files associated with thatgenre 325 will be decreased in its weighting used by the random selection process. Similarly, if a user strongly likes a particular media artist, as indicated by the media taste preference data for that user, all media files associated with that artist will be increased in weighting used by the random selection process. In this way, multiple characteristics may be considered simultaneously in the weighting of media files for random selection. - In some exemplary embodiments, a
media file 335 is not merely negatively weighted or otherwise reduced in significance in the random selection process, but is removed altogether from consideration. This may occur if amedia file 335 is universally disliked by one or more users in the group of users. This may occur if amedia file 335 has been recently experienced by one or more users in the group of users. In some exemplary embodiments, themedia file 335 is removed from a data structure that lists all media files available for selection at the current time. In other exemplary embodiments, themedia file 335 is assigned aweighting value 375 of zero, which removes the media file from being selected. - In an exemplary embodiment, a weighted random selection process may be used in which the
groupwise selection program 305 selects amedia file 335 for play from a plurality ofavailable media files 235 using a random selection method such that the probability of selecting a particular media file from the plurality of available media files is weighted 375 based upon the mediaexposure history data 340 and/or the media tastepreference data 330 for each of the plurality of users. - For example, if the media
exposure history data 340 indicates that some or all of the plurality of users have experienced a particular media file within a certain time period and/or a certain number of times within a certainprior time period 355, that particular media file is negatively weighted within the random selection process such that it is statistically less likely to be selected at random. - Alternately, if the media
exposure history data 340 indicates that some or all of the users have not experienced a particular media file within a certain time period and/or have not experienced that particular media file more than a certain number of times within a certain previous time period, that media file is positively weighted 375 within the random selection process such that it is statistically more likely to be selected relative to a purely random selection process. - In this way, the
groupwise selection program 305 provides a weighted random selection process such that media files 235 that have been recently experienced by some or all of the users are statistically less likely to be selected at random thanmedia files 235 that have not been experienced recently by some or all of the users in the group of users. - The weighting process for a particular media file 335 may be configured to consider the elapsed time since the
media file 335 was last experienced by each user in the group, assigning a more positive weighting to themedia file 335 if the elapsed time is higher and assigning a less positive weighting (or a negative weighting) if the elapsed time is lower. In some such exemplary embodiments, a nominal threshold value may be assigned such that if the elapsed time is greater than the assigned threshold, a positive weighting is assigned with a value that increases positively with larger elapsed time, and if the elapsed time is lower than the assigned threshold, a negative weighting is assigned a value that increases negatively with smaller elapsed time. - If the threshold was assigned to be 24 hours, for example, a weighting algorithm could be implemented such that if a particular media file 335 has been experienced by a user in the group within the last 24 hours (as determined by the elapsed time associated with that
media file 335 in the mediaexposure history data 340 of one or more users) the media file is negatively weighted or otherwise reduced in significance, the more recently themedia file 335 had been experienced the more negatively weighted. And if a particular media file 335 has not been experienced by a user in the group within the last 24 hours (as determined by the elapsed time associated with thatmedia file 335 in the mediaexposure history data 340 of one or more users) it is positively weighted, the longer ago the item had been experienced the more positively weighted. Such an algorithm may generally be constructed with a positive saturation point such that amedia file 335 that has not been listened to by any of the user for more than some upper threshold amount of time is assigned a maximum positive weighting value enabled by the algorithm (for example is assigned 10 times the nominal chances of being selected at random). - Analogously, the algorithm may also be configured with a negative saturation point such that a
media file 335 that has very recently been experienced by one or more of the users in the group of users, for example within the last ten minutes, may be assigned a maximum negative weighting (for example is assigned 1/10 the nominal chances of being selected at random) or is simply removed from the random selection process such that its chances of being selected are zero at the present time. - In addition to, or as an alternative to using the elapsed time that a particular media file 335 has been experienced, some weighting algorithms may be configured to consider the number of times (i.e., the frequency) for which a particular media file 335 was experienced within a particular prior time period. In such an weighting algorithm, the weighting process may be configured to positively weight a
media file 335 more if it has been experienced a lower number of times over a given time period and negatively weight amedia file 335 more if it has been experienced a greater number of times over a given time period. - The given time period may be an assigned value such as 10 days, for example. Thus the algorithm can be configured, for example, to positively weight a
media file 335 more if it has been experienced a lower number of times during the past 10 days and negatively weight amedia file 335 more if it has been experienced a greater number of times during the past 10 days. In some such exemplary embodiments, a frequency threshold value is assigned such that if the number of times a user has been exposed to themedia file 335 during the defined time period is greater than the frequency threshold, a negative weighting is assigned with a value that increases negatively with increasing number of exposures. Similarly if the number of times that a user has been exposed to themedia file 335 during the defined time period is less than the frequency threshold, a positive weighting is assigned with a value that increases positively with decreasing number of exposures. - If the frequency threshold was assigned to be 3 times, for example, a weighting algorithm could be configured such that if a particular media file 335 has been experienced by a user in the group more than 3 times within the last 10 days it is negatively weighted such that the more times it has been experienced, the more it is negatively weighted.
- Alternately, or in addition thereto, if a particular media file 335 has been experienced less than 3 times within the last 10 days by any user in the group of users, it may be positively weighted such that the fewer times it has been experienced, the more it is positively weighted.
- The above algorithms are such that the random selection routine accesses the
media exposure history 340 from each of the plurality of users in the group of users and employs data from themedia exposure history 340 of each of the plurality of users in the determination of aweighting factor 375 used for each of a plurality of media files 235. - There are a variety of methods by which the media
exposure history data 340 for each of a plurality of users may be considered in the determination of theweighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235. In some exemplary embodiments, an exclusive assessment process is used such that the largest amount of exposure to a particular media file to any single user is incorporated into the algorithms described above. - Thus, if the algorithm considers the elapsed time since the last exposure to a
particular media file 335, the algorithm collects mediaexposure history data 340 for each of the plurality users and employs the data from the users which indicates the shortest elapsed time for any of the plurality of users in the algorithm. - Thus, for example, if there were five users within the plurality of users, the
media player 100 will access mediaexposure history data 340 for each of the five users and determine the elapsed time since each user was exposed to each of a plurality of media items. For eachmedia file 235, the most recent exposure among any of the five users is employed in the algorithms described above to determine the randomselection weighting factor 375 for that particular media file 335. - In this way if any users in the group of five users have been recently exposed to the media files 235, those
media files 235 will be negatively weighted in the random selection process, the more recent the exposure the more negative the weighting. - In alternate exemplary embodiments, an averaging assessment algorithm may be used by the
groupwise selection program 305 in the determination of theweighting factor 375 for each of a plurality of media files 235. In such an averaging assessment algorithm, the amount of exposure to a particular media file that is detected among the plurality of users in the group of users is averaged together and then employed by the algorithms described above. - Thus, if the averaging assessment algorithm considers the elapsed time since the last exposure to a particular media item, the algorithm accesses media
exposure history data 340 for each of the plurality users, averages them together on amedia file 335 bymedia file 335 basis across the plurality of users, and employs averaged data in the weighting algorithm. - For example, if there were five users within the plurality of users, the algorithms described above will access media
exposure history data 340 for each of the five users, determine the elapsed time since exposure for each of a plurality ofmedia files 235 for each of the five users, and average the elapsed times together on amedia file 335 bymedia file 335 basis, across the five users. - Thus, for a particular media file 335 an average elapsed time since
exposure value 355 will be computed that is the average of the elapsed times since exposure to thatmedia file 335 for each of the five users in the plurality of users. This average value is then employed in the algorithms described above to determine the randomselection weighting factor 375 for that particular media items. In this way, the central tendency of exposure to a particular media file 335 among of the plurality of users in the group of five users will be considered by the algorithm. If the central tendency (i.e. the average) indicates that the group as a whole has been exposed recently to the particular media file 335, themedia file 335 will be negatively weighted in the random selection process, the more recent the exposure the more negative the weighting. - It should be noted that other statistical methods, in addition to or as an alternative to averaging, may be used to find the central tendency of exposure to a particular media file 335 among the group of users. For example, in some such exemplary embodiments, the median elapsed
time 355 since exposure may be used. - In exemplary embodiments, more complex statistical assessments may be employed to determine the central tendency of exposure to a particular media file 335 among the plurality of users. The central tendency is then used in the weighted random selection processes described previously.

FIG. 4 depicts a flow chart of an exemplary embodiment which performs the various functions and processes of the groupwise selection program. The process is initiated 400 by establishing processing communications with one or morepersonal information devices 405. The personal information devices include RFID chips, smartcard chips, cellular telephones, portable media players, PDAs, portable computing devices, and athird party server 410. In an exemplary embodiment, the personal information devices establish processing communications with athird party server 415 over a wireless communications link 415. In this exemplary embodiment, the third party server receives proximity data from thepersonal information devices 420 and determines whether one or more of the portable information devices is within a predetermined proximity or area near amedia player 425. If none of the portable information devices are within a predetermined proximity of themedia player 425, the third party server continues monitoring theGPS data 420 until one or more of the portable information devices enter the predetermined proximity of the media player. - In another exemplary embodiment, the personal information devices establish processing communications with a
third party server 415 over a wireless communications link 415. In an exemplary embodiment, the third party server receivesmessaging data 418 from the personal information devices indicating that the user is within listening proximity of a particular media player and wishes to have personal information included in a groupwise media selection process for that media player. The messaging data generally includes a unique ID for the user, enabling the accessing of personal information for that user indexed by theunique ID 418. The messaging data may also include unique ID for the particular media player (or physical location of play of the media player); enabling the personal information for that user to be used in a groupwise media selection process associated with that particular media player (or associated location). - In some exemplary embodiments, the messaging data received by the third party server is an SMS message sent by a personal information device in response to
user interaction 418. In this way a user may send an SMS message to the third party server indicating a desire to have his or her media taste data and/or media history data used in the groupwise media selection process for a particular media player. In one such embodiment the user of the personal information device sends a text message to the third party server that includes a unique ID code for the particular media player (or associated location) that he or she wishes to have his or her media taste data and/or media history data used in the groupwise media selection process. - In one such exemplary embodiment, the unique ID code for the particular media player (or associated location) is encoded as unique numeric value bracketed between two pound symbols, for example #162342#. This allows the SMS message or other electronic message sent to the third party server to be easily parsed by routines of the third party server such that any numeric value that is received between two pound signs is interpreted to be the unique ID code of a particular media player (or associated location) to which the request applies.
- While a variety of symbols could be used for identifying the numeric code of a particular media player (or associated location), the pound signs are particular convenient for users of mobile phones because they may be entered on a standard telephone keypad without needing to engage a shift function or other multi-step process. In this way a user may send an SMS message or other similar electronic message from a mobile phone to the third party server that consists only of the string #563482# and cause the routines of the present invention to include the media taste data and/or media history data for that user in the groupwise media selection process for the media player associated with the unique code 563482. In such an exemplary embodiment, the unique identity of user may be determined from the phone number or other electronic address of the mobile device from which the message was sent. This arrangement enables a very short and simple text message to trigger the inclusion of a particular user's media taste data in the groupwise media selection being performed for a particular physical location.
- In another exemplary embodiment, the media player interrogates 430 the
portable information devices 430 within the predetermined proximity or area. The portable information devices send data representations of user media taste preferences to the media player 435.
