Part ii-system regions summary
Along with paper-digital integration becomes more universal, exist to change over and utilize this integrated or so that it can more effectively
Many aspects of the prior art that ground realizes.This section highlights some problems in these problems.
3.Search
Search document complete or collected works, even complete or collected works big as WWW, for using keyboard structure to be sent to search engine
Become customary for the domestic consumer of search inquiry.This section and ensuing part discussion are from rendered document
The structure of inquiry that causes of capture and the aspect of both search engines of processing such inquiry.
3.1Capture/speak/key in as search inquiry
If the use of described system is typically to use any one of drying method including those discussed above method
From the beginning of some words of the document capture reproduced.In the case of input needs certain to explain to convert thereof into text, such as, exist
In the case of OCR or phonetic entry, system there may be end-to-end feedback so that document complete or collected works can be used to strengthen and identify
Process.The approximation that can be identified by execution or explain, identify one group of one or more candidate matches document and then make for
The information that may mate in candidate documents is improved further or is limited described identification or explanation and apply end-to-end feedback.Candidate
Document can be according to their possible dependency (such as based on other users capturing the information from these documents quantity
Or they popularities on the internet) and be weighted, and these weights can apply to this iteration identification process.
3.2Short phrase searching
Owing to the selection power of search inquiries based on some words is greatly enhanced when the relative position of these words is known, thus only need
Capture a small amount of text so that system banner text position in complete or collected works.Being most commonly that, input text will be neighbouring word order
Row, the shortest phrase.
3.2.1The position in document and document is found according to short capture
In addition to the document in phrase source, location, system can also identify the position in the document and can be based on this knowledge
Take action.
3.2.2Find the additive method of position
System can also use the watermark on the document such as reproduced by use or other special tokens to find document and position
Additive method.
3.3Other factors are merged in search inquiry
In addition to the text of capture, other factors (i.e. about the information of user identity, profile and context) can also shape
Become a part for search inquiry, knowing of time, the identity of user and geographical position, user habit and the latest activities such as captured
Know etc..
Document identification and other information relevant with previous capture especially can be with shapes in the case of they occur quite in the recent period
Become a part for search inquiry.
The identity of user can be according to the unique identifier associated with capture device and/or biometrics or other side information (languages
Sound pattern, fingerprint etc.) determine.
3.4The knowledge (OCR mistake etc.) of the unreliability in search inquiry
Search inquiry can construct by being likely to the type of error that occurs in specific catching method that consideration uses.Its one
Individual example is the suspicious mistake in the identification of instruction specific character；In this example, these characters can be regarded as logical by search engine
Join symbol or distribute the priority that they are relatively low.
3.5For performing/local cache of index that uses of off-line
Sometimes, capture device may not communicate with search engine or complete or collected works when data capture.For this reason, can be with thing
First helpful information will be used to download to equipment, or certain entity that the equipment that downloads to can communicate the off-line of equipment.
In some cases, all or substantial portion of index associated with complete or collected works can be downloaded.This theme will enter at Section 15.3
One step is discussed.
3.6The inquiry of quovis modo can be recorded and work afterwards
If being likely that there are and transmit inquiry or receive delay or the cost that result associates, then the information of this prestrain being permissible
Improve the performance of local device, reduce communications cost and be provided with help and user feedback timely.
The most do not communicate in the situation of available (local device " off-line "), can preserve and inquire about and extensive such as communicating
Multiple etc the time is transmitted to the remainder of system.
In these cases, it may be important that transmit timestamp together with each inquiry.The time of capture can be inquiry
Key factor in explanation.Such as, Section of 13.1 importance discussing the capture time relevant with capture in early days.Important
Be note capture time the most always with perform inquiry time identical.
3.7Parallel search
For performance reasons, multiple queries can sequentially or be concurrently started in response to single capture.Some inquiries
Can send in response to single capture, such as when adding neologisms to capture, or to inquire about multiple search concurrently and draw
Hold up.
Such as, in some instances, system is by searching that the inquiry of the special index for current document is sent on local machine
Index is held up, the search engine being sent on enterprise network, and the remote search engines being sent on the Internet.
Compared with the result searched for from other, the higher priority of result of specific search can be given.
Response for given inquiry may indicate that other inquiries co-pending are unnecessary；These inquiries can take before completion
Disappear.
4.Paper and search engine
Generally it is desirable that the search engine processing tradition online query processes those inquiries of the document deriving from reproduction.Conventional
Search engine can strengthen in a number of ways or revise so that they are more suitable for being used together with described system.
The search engine of system and/or miscellaneous part can with safeguard the index with different or extra features.System is permissible
What amendment arrived derives from the inquiry of paper or changes the mode processing inquiry in Search Results, thus these are derived from paper
Inquiry with from key in web browser inquiry and other originate those interrogation zone separate.And originate with from other
Inquiry compare, system can be taked different actions or provide different option when the search deriving from paper returns result.
Each of it is discussed below in these methods.
4.1Index
Generally, it is possible to use derive from paper or the identical index of traditional query search, but can be with various
Mode strengthen index in current system.
4.1.1Knowledge about paper form
Helpful extra field in the case of search based on paper can be added to such index.
The directory entry of the document availability under instruction paper form
First example is that known document exists with paper-based form or the field of distribution.System can inquire about the situation from paper
Under give the priority that such document is higher.
The knowledge of popular paper form
In this example, the statistical number of the popularity (and relating to these documents Nei Zi district alternatively) of paper document is related to
According to, circulation that the such as amount of capture activity, publisher or other sources provide etc., it is used for giving such document higher
Priority, improves priority (such as inquiry based on browser or web search) of digital copies document etc..
The knowledge of the form reproduced
Another important example is probably the information of the layout recording the specific reproduction about document.
Such as, for the books of particular version, index can include line feed occur about where and skip；Employ which word
Body, the information of any uncommon capitalization.
Index can also include about other the nearness of such as image, text box, form and advertisement etc on the page
Information.
The use of the semantic information in original paper
Finally, it is also possible to still unconspicuous semantic information in paper document can be inferred from source marking in record in the index,
Such as specific character section quotes project for sale or the fact that specific paragraph comprises program code.
4.1.2Index in the knowledge of catching method
Second factor of the character that can revise index be most likely with portion or the knowledge of type.If index is considered
Hold confusing character during OCR, or include some knowledge of the font used in document, then by the text captured
The search that image is initiated may be benefited.Such as, it is that the sequence of alphabetical " n " may be with after letter " r " during OCR
Letter " m " is obscured.Therefore, string " m " or " rn " may associate with identical document sets in the index.Similarly, as
Fruit inquiry is from speech recognition, then can much effectively search for index based on similar sounding phoneme.As another example,
System can make document fuzzy so that reflection user is by moving to capture device above document before index document artificially
The fuzzy of appearance it is likely to when capturing the image of document.Similar technology is so that system is for poor optics, noise etc.
There is elasticity.The additive factors of the use that can affect index in described model is the weight of iterative feedback during identification process
The property wanted.If search engine can provide the feedback from text when text is captured, then it can greatly increase capture
Precision.
Use the index of skew
In some instances, if most likely with described in Section 9 based on skew/auto-correlation OCR method search index,
During so suitable skew or signing messages are stored index by system.
4.1.3Many indexes
Finally, in described system, may commonly scan on many indexes.Index can be in enterprise network
Safeguard on some machines on network.The index of part can download to capture device or the machine near capture device.Can be
Have special interests, custom perhaps can user or user organize establishment individually index.For each file system on user's hard disk
, index can be there is in system, each catalogue, the most each file.Index is by user and is announced by system and subscribes to.Then,
It is important that structure can effectively be distributed, updates, merge and separate index.
4.2Process inquiry
4.2.1Know that capture is from paper
Search engine can take different actions when search inquiry derives from paper document recognizing.This engine can be with example
Mode such as the more type of error that tolerance is likely to appear in specific catching method processes inquiry.
Certain designator (the such as mark of instruction capture character) that it may comprise from inquiry infers this point, or
It can infer this point (such as, it can identify typical fault or the uncertainty of OCR process) from inquiry itself.
Alternatively, the inquiry from capture device can be by with the passage originated from other or port or connection type not
Same passage or port or connection type arrive engine, and can distinguish by that way.Such as, some examples of system will
By dedicated gateway query routing to search engine.Therefore, search engine knows that all inquiries by dedicated gateway derive from
Paper document.
4.2.2The use of context
Following Section 13 describes various different factor, and it is in the outside of the text of capture itself, but it is at mark
Know in document and be probably important help.These factors include such as being recently captured history, the longer-term reading habit of specific user,
The geographical position of user and user are recently for the thing of use etc of particular electronic document.Such factor claims in this article
For " context ".
Some contexts can be processed by search engine itself, and is reflected in Search Results.Such as, search engine is permissible
Follow the tracks of the capture history of user, and can also be by this capture history cross reference to conventional inquiry based on keyboard.So
In the case of, search engine is safeguarded and uses the status information comparing the most conventional search engine more about each personal user,
And each with search engine may be considered that leap is searched for and the time period more longer than nowadays typical situation several times alternately.
Some contexts can be transferred to search engine (Section 3.3) in the search query, and can be stored in possibly and draw
The place of holding up is to work in following inquiry.Finally, some contexts process the most elsewhere, and therefore become should
Use filter or the binary search of the result from search engine.
It is input to the data stream of search
An important input to search procedure is communities of users how mutual such as which document with the reproduction version of document
The broader context read the most widely and read by whom.There is the similarity with web search, described web search
The page returning most frequent link or those pages most frequently selected from the Search Results in past.This theme is entered
The discussion of one step, sees the 13.4th and 14.2 joints.
4.2.3The sub-district of document
Described system can not only send and use the information overall about document, and send and use and be even down to
The sub-district of document of other word.Many existing search engines concentrate on the location document relevant to ad hoc inquiry or file simply.Can
To provide notable for described system with those search engines working in finer granularity and identifying the position in document
Benefit.
4.3Return result
Search engine can use some Future Informations of its maintenance now to affect the result returned.
System can also return specific document, user as just have the result of paper copies and described in Internet access specific
Document (Section 7.4).
Search engine can also surmount the simple retrieval of text and provide the new element or the option that are suitable for described system.
5.Labelling, annotate, strengthen, metadata
In addition to performing capture-search-retrieving, described system also by additional functionality and document associations, especially with
Text position in document or text chunk association.This additional functionality often (although not exclusively) is by the document with reproduction
Electronic copies association and with reproduce document associations.As an example, the hyperlink in webpage is defeated in the printing of this webpage
Identical function it is likely to be of when going out captured.In some cases, described function limits the most in an electronic document, but not
Place's storage or generation.
The function that this layer adds is referred to herein as " labelling ".
5.1Static and dynamic covering
A kind of mode considering labelling is to regard " covering " on document as, and it provides about document or its certain part additionally
Information and can specify that the action with document or its certain partial association.Labelling can include the content that people is readable, but
Invisible often for user and/or be intended for machine use.Example includes when user's capture is from the spy in the document reproduced
Nearby rendering preferences in the popup menu on display when determining the text in region, or the audio frequency of the pronunciation of explanation particular phrase
Sample.As another example, system can clang when user's capture is from the advertisement of the document reproduced.
5.1.1If possibly from the dried layer in some sources
Any document can have multiple covering simultaneously, and these coverings can be derived from various position.Flag data can be by
The author of document or by user or created by other certain sides or provide.
Flag data can be attached to electronic document or be embedded.It can in conventional position (such as with document
In identical position, but there is different file name suffix) find.Flag data may be embodied in looking into of location original document
In the Search Results ask, or can be found by the individually inquiry to identical or another search engine.Flag data can
Find with other capturing informations or contextual information with the text of the capture original by use, or it can be closed by use
Find in the position of capture and the information inferred of document.Even if labelling itself is not included in document, flag data also may be used
Find with the position specified in a document.
Labelling can be largely static and be that document is distinctive, and the link being similar in tradition html webpage is often made
The mode embedded for the static data in html document, but labelling can also dynamically produce and/or be applied to substantial amounts of literary composition
Shelves.A dynamically labeled example is attached to the information of the up-to-date share price of the company including mentioning in the document of document.Extensively
One example of labelling of ground application be on the chapters and sections of multiple documents or document automatically can the translation information of language-specific.
5.1.2Individual's " plug-in unit " layer
User can also install or the particular source of subscribed flag data, thus the individualized system for specific capture responds.
5.2Keyword and phrase, trade mark and mark
Some elements characteristic based on himself in document rather than its position in particular document and be likely to be of and they
Specific " labelling " or the function of association.Example include the purpose being used purely for being captured and print special token in a document with
And user can be made to be linked to mark and the trade mark of the other information about the tissue related to.This is equally applicable in text
" keyword " or " crucial phrase ".They are associated or they want the particular phrase of association to organize possibility to register, and
And specific markers is attached with it, this labelling is by captured can the using Anywhere at this phrase.
Any word, phrase etc. can have related labelling.Such as, no matter when user capture word " books " or
The title of books or the theme relevant with books, specific project can be added to popup menu and (such as arrive online book by system
The link in shop).In some examples of system, digital copies document or index are consulted to determine whether capture occurs in word
Near language " books " or the title of books or the theme relevant with books, and the behavior of system is according to away from key element
Element this nearness and be modified.In example above, it is noted that labelling makes to catch from non-commercial text or document
The data obtained can trigger business transaction.
5.3The content that user provides
5.3.1User comment and annotation, including multimedia
Annotation is can be with the another type of electronic information of document associations.Such as, user can be attached his/her about spy
Determine the audio file of the view of document to retrieve as voice annotation later.As another example of multimedia annotation,
User can be attached the photo in the place quoted in document.The annotation of the commonly provided document of user, but system can associate from
The annotation (such as, other users in working group can share annotation) in other sources.
5.3.2Notes from check and correction
One important example of the labelling being derived from user is the paper document of the part as check and correction, editor or checking process
Annotation.
5.4Third party content
As mentioned earlier, third party the most such as can provide flag data by other readers of document.Online discussion and
Examination is good example, as information, the translation of volunteer contribution and the explanation of the community management relevant with particular job.
Another example of third party's labelling is the labelling provided by advertizer.
5.5Data streams based on other users dynamically labeled
By analyzing data capture by the several of system or all users from document, can be with community-based activity and interest product
Raw labelling.One example is probably establishment labelling or the online bookstore of annotation, and this labelling or annotation tell user, it is true that
" people appreciating this book also appreciates ... ".The less anonymity of this labelling, and can tell that user is in his/her contacts list
Who the most also read the document.Other examples of data-flow analysis are contained in Section 14.
5.6Based on external event and the labelling of data source
Labelling is often based on external event and data source, the such as input from enterprise database, the letter from public the Internet
Breath or the statistics collected by native operating sys-tern.
Data source can also be more local, particularly can provide the information about user's context, his/her identity,
Position and activity.Such as, system can be with the mobile phone component communication of the capture device of user and provide mark layer, this mark
Note layer gives user and sends documents to user's option of the someone of talk on phone recently.
5.7Image enhaucament and compensation
In some instances, system provides the document of enhancing by utilizing different display element to cover the display of display document
View.The view of this enhancing can utilize display element different from document associations to cover the document part in the capture device visual field
Real time imaging, or the different display elements from document associations can be utilized to present and cover the document being obtained by system or producing
Image or the electronic version of association.In some instances, system provides document interaction technique, and it compensates each of capture device
Kind different hardware configuration, such as photographing unit and other image-forming blocks set relative to display or the position of documentation center point, capture
Standby size and/or the display of capture device.System can provide document interaction technique, and it allows users to the papery literary composition that navigates
Shelves, mark and the labelling of document associations, scaling paper document etc..Such as, system can respond the user of capture device and makes
Attitude, such as move up the attitude of capture device in each different side relative to paper document.Therefore, system makes to use
Family can show alternately with paper document, destination object and other information by using multifunction mobile equipment, described multi-functional shifting
Dynamic equipment is not necessarily manufactured in addition to other benefits only mutual with information or captures the information from equipment surrounding.
6.Certification, individualized and safety
In many cases, it will know the identity of user.Sometimes, this will be " anonymous Identity ", the most such as only by
The serial number mark user of capture device.However typically, it may be desirable to system will have the knowledge the most much of user,
It may be used for individualized to system and allows the nominal execution activity with user and transaction.
6.1User's history and " life library shop "
One of the simplest but most useful function that system can perform be under user record he/her capture text and with
Any further information that this capture is relevant, including the position in the details of any document found, the document and as knot
Any action really taked.In some instances, the information of capture can be sent to the Email ground that user specifies by system
Location, wherein user can pass through email client by means of the email protocol of such as POP3, IMAP etc
Access the information of capture.Additionally, the information being stored as the capture of Email can include that more fully life library shop is experienced
Link, such as described in Section 16.1.
The history of this storage is useful for user and system both of which.
6.1.1For user
Can provide a user with in " life library shop ", the record of anything that i.e. he/her has read and has captured.This may be only
Merely for individual interest, but may such as in library by the bibliography material of the next chapter paper collecting him
Academic librarian use.
In some cases, user may want to such as by library being published to network by the way of similar with network log
It is public for above making library, thus other people can see that he/her is reading and is finding funny shit.
Finally, user captures certain text and this capture can not be taked action (such as, because document by system immediately wherein
Electronic version not yet can use) situation in, this capture be possibly stored in library and can the most automatically or ring
Should be acted upon in user's request.User can also order new labelling service and apply them to previous capture.
6.1.2For system
The record of user's capture in the past is also useful for system.Know that reading habit and the history of user can strengthen system
Many aspects of operation.Simplest example is, any capture that user makes more likely from user in recent past from it
The document of capturing information, and particularly when previous capture is within nearest a few minutes, then it is likely from identical
Document.Similarly, more likely, to start to the order reading documents terminated.Therefore, for English document, with
More likely, later capture will the most down occur farther place sample.Such factor can occur with help system
Establish the position of capture in the case of Mo Hu, and the amount of text needing capture can also be reduced.
6.2Capture device is as payment, identity and authenticating device
Owing to acquisition procedure generally starts with the equipment of certain kind, thus this equipment can serve as identifying user and authorizing specific
The key of action.
6.2.1Capture device is associated with user account
Capture device can be associated with mobile phone account.For example, it is possible to by the SIM that will associate with mobile phone account
Card inserts and is associated with the account by capture device in capture device.Similarly, this equipment can embed the credit card or other
Fu Kazhong, or have connected for such card device.Therefore, described equipment can serve as payment token, and can
To initiate financial transaction by the capture from the document reproduced.
6.2.2Use capture to be authenticated
Can also by token, symbol or the text that associate with specific user or account of capture by capture device and this user or
Account associates.Additionally, capture device such as can be used for biometric identification by the fingerprint of capture user.Based on audio frequency
Capture device in the case of, system can by coupling user voice mode or by require user say particular password or
Phrase and identify this user.
Such as, capture the quotation of books and in the case of being provided the option that retailer from network buys books user, use
Family can select this option, and is then prompted to capture his/her fingerprint to confirm this transaction.
Also refer to the 15.5th and 15.6 joints.
6.2.3Safely capture equipment
When capture device be used for identifying and certification user and represent user initiate transaction time, it is important that its of equipment and system
Communication between his part is safe.It is also important that and protect such as another equipment imitation capture device and wherein equipment
Situation with intercepted so-called " go-between " attack etc that communicates between miscellaneous part.
For providing the technology of such safety to be well understood in the art；In different examples, in equipment with
And the hardware and software in system other places is configured to implement such technology.
7.Publish model and element
One advantage of described system is, it is not necessary to change the conventional procedure of establishment, printing and publishing documents to obtain
Many benefits of this system.But, the founder or the publisher hereafter simply referred to as " publisher " that there is document may
Wish the reason of the function of the system described by supporting that creates.
This section relates generally to the document itself published.For about other about the information of business transaction (such as advertisement), ginseng
See the Section 10 of entitled " P-business ".
7.1The electronics companion of document printing
System allows document printing to have related electronics existence.Conventionally, publisher often ships together with books and comprises
Other digital information, study course film and other multi-medium datas, code sample or document or the CD-of other reference material
ROM.Additionally, some publishers safeguard the website that associates with niche publication, these websites such material of offer and can
The information that can update after publication time, such as errata, further comment, the reference material updated, bibliography and
The other source of related data and the translation to other language.Online forum allow reader contribute they about this publication
Comment.
Described system allows to be linked together by the document of such material with reproduction much than the tightst, and permits
Family allowable find much easierly they and mutual with them.By capturing a part of text from document, system can be certainly
Connect the user to and document associations and the digital material that more particularly associates with this specific part of document dynamicly, and catching
Obtain and on equipment, show these materials.Similarly, user can be connected to discuss the online society of this part of text by capture device
District, or the annotation of other readers and comment.In the past, such information typically needs by searching for the specific page number or chapters and sections
And find.
The application of one example is at academic textbook field (Section 17.5).
7.2" subscribe to " document printing
Some publishers are likely to be of mail tabulation, if reader wishes notified new dependencies or when publishes books
Redaction, then they can subscribe to mail tabulation.System described by utilization, user can more easily register for spy
Determine the interest of document or documentation section, the most even just might be used before publisher considers to provide any such function
With so.The interest of reader can be fed to publisher, affects them possibly about when and where providing renewal, entering one
The information of step, redaction or even about having turned out the brand-new publication of theme intriguing in existing books
Decision-making.
7.3There is particular meaning or the printing mark comprising special data
Many aspects of system enable simply by the text used in Already in document.But, if known
Generation document in the case of document can be used in combination, then can be by the extraneous information of the form of printing special token with system
And adding extra function, described special token can be used to more closely identify text or required action, or with other
Mode strengthens the mutual of document and system.The simplest and most important example is to indicate to reader certainly to access literary composition by system
Shelves.Can such as use special icon so that instruction the document has online forum associated with it.
Such symbol it is expected to be used purely for reader, or they can captured and when being used for initiating certain action by
System identification.Enough data can be encoded not only to identify this symbol: it can also store such as about literary composition in symbol
The information of the position of shelves, version and symbol, it can be by system identification and reading.
7.4Authorize by having paper document
Exist in which to have document printing or access document printing and will give user some privilege, such as, access the electronics of document
Copy or some situations of additional materials.System described by utilization, can be as just user's capture from the part of document
The result of text or the capture especially symbol of printing and give such privilege.To be necessary to ensure that user has whole for system wherein
In the case of document, it prompting user may capture specific project or word from specific webpage (such as " page 46 second row ")
Group.
7.5Overdue document
If document printing is the gateway of additional materials and function, then access such feature and be also likely to be the limited time.
After at the date of maturity, user may be charged or obtain the more redaction of document again to access described feature.Certainly,
Paper document will remain spendable, but will lose its some electric functions strengthened.This is probably desired, example
As, because or there is profit requiring user to buy in redaction every now and then in collecting the expense accessing electronic material in publisher,
Or because there is the shortcoming associated with the out-of-date document printing version keeping circulation.Reward voucher is the business being likely to be of the Expiration Date
One example of industry Doctype.
7.6Popular analysis and publication decision-making
Section 10.5, the price discussing the compensation and advertisement to affect author of the statistics of use system.
In some instances, the system activity according to the electronic communities associated with publication and the use according to paper document push away
The popularity of disconnected publication.These factors can help publisher they to be published in the future to what to make a policy.If it is the most existing
Certain chapter in books is had to be proved to the most welcome, then probable value must be broadened into single publication.
8.Document access services
One importance of described system is that the user of the reproduced copies to Internet access document provides for the document
The ability of the access of electronic version.In some cases, document can be on the private network of public network or user's Internet access
Free acquisition.System uses the text of capture to identify, positioning and obtain the document, in some cases on capture device
Show it or it is left in its email INBOX.
In some cases, document will Electronically can be used, but for various reasons, possibly for user not
May have access to.For only listing some probabilities, may not there is enough connections to obtain the document, user may have no right to obtain
Take the document, it is understood that there may be the cost associated with acquisition the document, or the document may be removed and possibly by redaction
Replace.
Mention in Section 7.4, if it is known that the printing copy of specific user's Internet access document, then give this use
The degree of the access at family or character may be different.
8.1The document access of certification
Access for document may be limited to specific user or meet those users of specified criteria, or may be only spy
Can use in the case of Ding, such as, can use when user is connected to secure network.Section 6 describes wherein can be set up user and catch
Obtain some modes of the authority of equipment.
8.2Document is bought copyright owner and is compensated
The document that can not freely obtain for the general public still may may have access to when paying, usually used as publisher or
The compensation of copyright holder.System can directly realize payment mechanism or can utilize other methods of payment with user-association,
Including those methods described in Section 6.2.
8.3Document trustship and active obtaining
Electronic document is often short-term；But the digital source version of the document reproduced may currently available following inaccessible.
System can represent user obtain and store existing version, even if user does not ask it, thus user's further request it
In the case of ensure its availability.This also makes it can use for the use of system, such as the mistake as mark capture in future
The search of a part for journey.
If requiring to pay to access document, then trust " document trustship " service can be such as when paying appropriateness expense
Represent user and obtain document, it is ensured that be following user once full remuneration copyright ownerL copyrighted material's owner in the case of this service request document.
If when capture, document the most Electronically can be used, then can implement the modification of the program.User can be at electronics
The document date afterwards be made available by the case of authorize described service represent he/her submit to for document request or for
Document pays.
8.4Subscribe to other and account associates
Sometimes can abandon, reduce or sacrifice payment based on user and another account or the existing association of subscription.Such as,
The subscriber of newspaper printing version can automatically have the right to obtain electronic version.
In other cases, this association may will not be the most direct: the account that can set up based on its employer or right based on it
In the friend as subscriber have printing copy capture and authorized user access.
8.5Utilize capture and print replacement photocopy
Capture the text from paper document, mark electronic original part and print this original paper or this original paper associated with capture
Some portion of process forms the alternative of tradition photocopy, and it has many advantages:
Paper document is without being in the position identical with final printout, and the most all without simultaneously at that
In
Can avoid photolithography process to document, the abrasion that especially old, frangible and valuable document caused and broken
Bad
The quality of copy is the most much higher
The record about which part the most often copying which document or document can be kept
As a part for this process, copyright owner can be made payment
Unauthorised copies can be forbidden.
8.6Valuable original paper is positioned from photocopy
When as in the case of the legal documents with history or other certain sense or document, when document is the most valuable,
People typically may use on the copy of these documents, often uses many years, and original paper is maintained at safe position.
Described system is alternatively coupled to the data base of the position recording original document such as in achieving warehouse, so that
The someone of Internet access copy easily positions the original paper document of archive.
9.The information processing technology
It is conceived on optical character recognition (OCR) technology tradition to comprise such as from the flat bed scanner of capture full page
The image of a large amount of texts.OCR technique it is frequently necessary to a large amount of training of user and corrects to produce useful text.OCR skill
Art often requires that the machine carrying out OCR has suitable disposal ability, although and many system use dictionaries, it is usually desirable to
They work on practically unlimited vocabulary.
All traditional characteristics above can be modified in described system.But, technique described herein, such as
The identification of text, the mark of document, the detection of information and other technologies, it is of course possible to use typical OCR technique real
Existing.
The many problems discussed map directly to other identification technology, especially speech recognition.Mention in Section 3.1,
Loudly text can be read in by user from the process of paper capture and the equipment of capture audio frequency realizes.Those skilled in the art
Should be appreciated that the principle about image, font and text fragments discussed herein is often also applied for audio sample, user speech
Model and phoneme.
The capture device being used together with described system is often little, portable and lower powered, or is not made
Cause and only capture text.Capture device is likely to be of the optical element being not preferably suited for OCR, or may lack
Help the optical element of OCR.
Capture device can the most only capture some words, and the most once captures whole character,
But by the dropping cut slice of text, many such sections are stitched together to form the recognizable letter that can therefrom infer text
Number.Capture device can also have very limited amount of disposal ability or amount of storage, although thus it can perform in some instances
All OCR processes itself, but many examples will depend upon which the connection to more powerful equipment of the time the most afterwards,
So that the signal of capture is converted into text.Finally, it can have for the mutual very limited amount of device of user, thus can
After needing to postpone till any request that user is inputted, or work in the degree bigger than the most common degree
In " best-guess " pattern.
In some instances, system processes the information of capture in the following manner: first identify information of interest to be identified
The existence of (such as text or voice), extract with information of interest capture information in the corresponding feature in position (such as
The frequency range of specific speaker in position in the page of word, row, paragraph, row etc., crowd), and identify interested
The characteristic of information, such as text layout in the document reproduced or with the alphabetical corresponding Unicode identified in the document reproduced
The mark of character, in order to such as identify the source of the image of capture, or produce and show the mark layer above the image of capture.
Although these processes can be performed for any kind of information, but the document that example below reproduces with reference to text based is retouched
These processes are stated.
9.1Mark and extraction
Mark determines that the process of the probability that the image of capture comprises text.Owing to capture device can constantly capture image,
Thus the image that first system can determine capture before attempting to extract text feature from the information of capture or identify text is
No comprise text.In other words, system is " text perception ", because at any time it may determine that whether it faces text.
Once system determines that text exists, then system can start to extract process.Text in extraction process identifier capture
Position.Such as, extraction process can produce border corresponding with the word in the image captured and paragraph.
Some questions can enter mark and extraction process.Such as, when analyze text time, system can identify with in text
The various different feature of stroke association, such as in the existence of high-contrast edges, stroke, the shortage of color change (such as compares
Background and the existence of foreground color in stroke), consistent width (level, vertically or the two), the existence of straight edge, flat
The existence of sliding boundary curve, etc..As another example, system can identify the characteristic of potential text in the image of capture
The periodicity of (such as stroke edge) or repetition, level and/or vertically stroke, baseline, altitude line, vertical curve and baseline it
Between the existence of angle, font or font subconstiuent (such as turning, curve, diagonal, the bridging line between the part of font,
The such as narrow stroke between wide stroke in calligraphy mail, serif, consistent line cap and mitered etc.) existence.System also may be used
To use motion blur so that based on dark color ribbon bright in the direction of motion (along from left to right in the case of such as extreme sport is fuzzy
Script in the background of horizontal text axle and prospect band) the existence of existence mark text.
During the mark of text and extraction, admissible additive factors includes:
OK
Font vertical curve in ο row
Font horizontal line in ο row
ο baseline
ο row inside spread eagle or the height of symbol
Horizontal space between ο font, word and/or stroke
Vertical space between ο row
ο edge and back gauge
Density
The ratio of ο stroke background
Density in ο row and in the ranks
Grapheme sequence
ο N-gram (sequence of N number of continuous word)
Word
Capitalization
Punctuate
Sentence (capitalization, punctuate, cycle)
Paragraph
Title
Cut line
ο is based on the nearness away from image
Legend
ο frame, icon etc.
Word on figure
ο short text
Bigger than background image for ο contrast, cycle etc.
Mark
ο company/product/service name
ο primary commercial mark
ο and the demarcation line (such as elliptical boundary) of background.
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that system is permissible when performing Text Flag and extraction and being in any analysis level
Use any or all features described above.Such as, during identification procedure, system can be in the distance depended between horizontal space
While depend only on the quantity of horizontal space, and during extraction process, depend in the image of capture they and edge
Relation.
System can also smooth gradient based on the biggest region, randomness (the such as position of high-contrast specific region, height
The height at contrast edge, the inhomogeneity of high-contrast edges), face in the image of capture, health or the existence of building,
Inconsistent size of line or Connected component etc. performs mark and extracts non-textual information.
9.2Text identification
Based on the positional information extracted, system can attempt to text or the feature of text identifying in the image of capture.Such as,
System text can be sent to OCR component or text based mark feature (such as rise in text letter and/or under
The pattern of row letter) and produce signature.Before performing text identification, system can be by such as by all italics or runic literary composition
Originally the form of standard it is converted into and to text standardization or normalization.
Text identification process may rely on some features to identify the characteristic of text or producing the signature of the document reproduced,
Such as font style characteristic (space such as closed, vertically and horizontally stroke etc.), punctuate, capitalization, character space, row feature,
Character features on paragraph feature, row feature, title feature, cut line feature, key/legend feature, flag sign, figure
Etc..Additionally, word feature can be with help text identification process, such as word spacing and density.Such as, system can use and literary composition
The information of space correlation between the word of printing on shelves, such as distance between space (level, vertical, orthogonal etc.
Deng), width between space etc..System can will be merged in analysis about the knowledge of line feed further.Such as, when changing
When row is known, what system may rely on that lexeme puts is vertically aligned, and when line feed is unknown, system may rely on neighbouring phase
To word length sequences.As another example, system can use the phase between the information associated with character density, such as character
To density (level, vertical, orthogonal etc.), packet character pairing between relative density or absolute density letter
Breath.Specific feature is constant possibly for font, font size etc., the symmetry of such as Points And lines (in such as font, point
And/or the auto-correlation around line).System can be dynamically selected which feature of analysis in the image of capture.Such as, in village
In the case of optical dimming and motion blur, system can use the less details aspect of text, such as relative term width.One
In a little examples, system can be by deviateing the degree of certainty of the public n unit syntax, the length of deviation, the rule of coupling based on such as character
Then represent (such as e-mail address and URL) etc. determine the unknown or the rare n unit syntax be whether noise or
Person's height signal message (cacography, e-mail address, URL etc.) and utilize unique n unit the syntax.
System can use the resource outside the document of reproduction with the text in the document of identification reproduction, such as, relate to the word in word
The appropriate number of shape, dictionary (such as word frequency dictionary), grammer and punctuate rule, find the specific word syntax in complete or collected works and character
The probability of the syntax, the knowledge of Rule Expression (such as e-mail address, URL etc.) of coupling kinds of characters string.Additionally,
System can use such as dns server, address book and telephone directory etc resource checking identify text, such as URL,
E-mail address and telephone number.As another example, system can use font array to help identify and verify various
Different fonts.Can based on the relation between the Unidentified and character identified reflected in font array by given font not
The character identified is compared to help their identification with the character of the identification of same font.For example, if font square
Battle array shows that the expression of " d " is similar to " c " and the combination of " l ", then Unidentified " d " can be based on " c " identified
" l " and be identified as " d ".
System can use the text of identification or feature to identify among the document of document complete or collected works in the image of capture and describing
Document.Quantity of information and information type for identifying can change, these factors such as document based on any amount of factor
Type, the size of complete or collected works, document content etc..Such as, in the image of capture between sequence or the word of 5 or 6 words
The relative position in space can uniquely identify corresponding document in relatively large complete or collected works.In some instances, system is permissible
Use conversion table will to uniquely identify document with the combination determining the information about special characteristic or the information that belongs to special characteristic
Probability.Such as, conversion table may indicate that the word sequence of 5 words and two 3 different word sequences, 2 consecutive rows of rises letter
And/or descender pattern etc. has the identical probability uniquely identifying document.In some instances, system can be automatic
Ground accumulates the image of capture or it " is sewed up " together such as to produce the combination picture of the document of reproduction, this composite diagram
As corresponding document more may be uniquely identified than the document of individually capture.
In some instances, text identification process can affect the capture of information.Such as, if text be identified as out of focus or
Person is imperfect, then system can regulate the focus of the photographing unit of capture device or prompting user reapposes or regulates capture and sets
Standby.System can be used to identify that the various different technology of text is been described by the most in further detail.
9.2.1" uncertain " OCR
In described system, the main new features of OCR are the fact that inspection is generally present in other places and possibility by it
The image of the text obtained in digital form.Therefore, the definite text transcription from OCR engine is the most always needed.OCR
System can export one group of possible coupling or the matrix of possible coupling, includes probability right in some cases, and it is still
Can be used to search for numeral original paper.
9.2.2The conjecture of iteration OCR, disambiguation, conjecture ...
If the equipment performing to identify can contact document index when processing, then along with the continuation of OCR process, Ke Yitong
The content crossing document complete or collected works informs OCR process, thus provides much bigger accuracy of identification potentially.
Permission equipment is also informed that user has captured enough texts with reference numbers source by such connection.
9.2.3Use the knowledge of possible reproduction
When system is aware of each side (font typeface such as used in printing or the page that the possible printing of document reproduces
Layout or which part be italic) time, this can also help identification process (4.1.1 joint).
9.2.4Font cache determines the font on the main frame downloading to client
When the candidate source text identified in document complete or collected works, font or its reproduction can be downloaded to equipment to help to identify.
9.2.5Auto-correlation and character skew
Although the composition character of text fragments is probably the mode approved most representing the text fragments that can serve as document signature,
But other expressions of text can be worked well enough, thus the text in attempting location digital document and/or data base
During fragment or when text fragments being represented disambiguation becomes readable form, it is not necessary to use the actual text of text fragments.
Other of text fragments represent can provide actual text to represent lacked benefit.Such as, with other of text fragments of capture
Unlike expression, the optical character recognition of text fragments is the most easily made mistakes, described other represent can be used to search and/or
Rebuild text fragments and do not appeal to and optical character recognition is carried out for whole fragment.Such method is more likely to be appropriate for and is currently
Some equipment that system is used together.
Those skilled in the art and other people should be appreciated that and there are the many modes of outward appearance describing text fragments.Text sheet
Section such sign can include but not limited to word length, relative term length, character height, character duration, character shape,
Character frequency, token frequency etc..In some instances, (quantity of token adds the skew between matched text token the most between two parties
1) it is used for characterizing text fragments.
Conventional OCR uses the knowledge about font, letter configuration and shape to attempt the character determining in the text of scanning.
The example of the present invention is different；They use various methods, and these methods use the text itself reproduced to help to know
Other process.These methods use character (or token) " to identify each other ".A kind of mode quoting this self-identifying is " template
Join ", and it is similar to " convolution ".In order to perform this self-identifying, the copy of text is flatly slided above itself by system,
And write down the matching area of text image.Existing template matching and convolution technique comprise various correlation technique.Token
Change and/or identify that these technology of character/token will be referred to collectively as " auto-correlation ", because when mating character/token, text is used for
Relevant to the ingredient of himself.
When auto-correlation, the complete connected region of coupling is interesting.This occurs in character (or character group)
When covering other examples of identical characters (or group).The complete connected region of coupling is automatically provided and text token is turned to group
Become token.Along with two copies of text slip over each other, perfect match (the i.e. vertically all pixel matching in section) wherein occurs
Region write down.When character/token mates with self, the horizontal extent (the connection compatible portion of such as text) of this coupling
Also mate.
It should be pointed out that, without the actual identity (i.e. corresponding with token image particular letter, the numeral that determine each token
Or symbol or these group), only determine the skew next time occurred to identical token in the text of capture.Offset numbers is
The distance (token number) next time occurred to identical token.If token is unique in text string, then skew is zero
(0).The token offset sequence so produced may be employed to the signature of the text of mark capture.
In some instances, the token skew determined by the token string for capture is carried out with the index of index electronic document complete or collected works
Relatively, token skew (4.1.2 joint) of these contents based on them.In other instances, by true for the token string for capture
Fixed token skew is converted into text and content based on them and it is carried out with the more conventional index of index electronic document complete or collected works
Relatively.
As pointed out earlier, when acquisition procedure includes the audio sample of oral word, similar token correlated process can be answered
For sound bite.
9.2.6Font/character " self-identifying "
The image of scanning is compared by conventional template matching OCR with character picture storehouse.It practice, deposit for every kind of font
Store up alphabet, and be compared to find out with the image of storage by the image newly scanned and mate character.This process generally has
There is initial delay, until identifying correct font.Afterwards, OCR process is relatively fast, because most of document is in the whole text
Use identical font.Follow-up image thus text can be converted into by comparing with the fontlib of recently mark.
The shape of the most-often used character in font is relevant.Such as, in most of fonts, letter " c " and letter
" e " is visually correlated with, as " t " and " f " etc..OCR process is by using this relation to be configured to not yet sweep
Retouch letter template and be enhanced.Such as, capture the short text string of the font previously not run into reader from paper document,
Thus system not by its with one group of image template comparing of image of capture in the case of, system can utilize specific character
Between possible relation to construct font masters storehouse, even if it not yet runs into all letters in alphabet.System is the most permissible
Use the font masters storehouse of structure to identify the text of subsequent captured and to improve the fontlib of structure further.
9.2.7Unidentified anything (including figure) is sent to server
When image can not machine transcription become to be suitable for the form of search procedure time, image itself can be preserved so as later by with
Family use, possible manual transcription or different resources possibly for system can the later date process.
10.P-business
Many actions that system makes it possible to cause some business transactions to occur.Word p-business is here used for describing by being
The business activity that system is initiated from paper.
10.1The document copied from its physical print is sold
When user's capture is from the text of document, user may be provided the purchase of the document of papery or electronic form.With
Family is likely to be provided relevant document, such as in paper document quotation or those documents of otherwise quoting, or
Person is about those documents of similar topic, or those documents of same authors.
10.2The sale of any anything else initiated by paper or assist
In a wide variety of ways the capture of text can be associated with other business activities.The text of capture may be clearly
Ground is designed in the catalogue of items for merchandising, and in this case, the most directly purchase with article is associated the (the 18.2nd by text
Joint).Text can also be a part for advertisement, in this case, it is possible to thus occur by the sale of the article of advertisement.
In other cases, user captures other texts, therefrom may infer that their the potential interest for business transaction.Example
As, there may be spent a holiday interested by the reader of the novel collection of particular country.Read new car comment someone may just consider to purchase
Buy this car.User can capture specific text fragments, knows that certain commercial opportunity will be supplied to them as result, or it
It can be the afterclap of their capture activity.
10.3Cause the label on the article of sale, icon, serial number, the capture of bar code
Sometimes, text or symbol are actually printed in article or its packaging.One example is often at the back of the body of electronics
The serial number found on the label of face or bottom side or product id.System can by capture the text provide a user with purchase one or
Multiple identical items facilitate mode.They can also be provided handbook, support or maintenance service.
10.4Contextual advertisement
Except Direct Acquisition is from addition to the text of advertisement, and system allows also to a kind of new advertisement, and it is the most clearly again
In existing document, but the thing read based on people.
10.4.1Based on capture context and the advertisement of history
In traditional paper publication thing, advertisement is commonly angled relative to the word of newspaper article and consumes substantial amounts of space, and limited
The advertisement of quantity can be placed in around certain articles.In described system, advertisement can be associated with other word or phrase,
And can according to user by the capture text special interests that show and consider its capture history possibly and select wide
Accuse.
System described by utilization, it is possible to purchase is associated with specific document printing and advertizer obtains significantly more
The feedback of the effect about its advertisement in specific printed publication.
10.4.2Based on user's context and the advertisement of history
System can be collected the otherwise information of the substantial amounts of context about user and (see the 13rd for self use
Joint)；The geographical position of estimation user is good example.Such data may also be used for customizing the user's of the system of presenting to
Advertisement.
10.5Compensation model
System allows to realize some new compensation model for advertizer and marketing person.The publisher of the document printing comprising advertisement is permissible
Certain income is received from the purchase of the document deriving from them.This is probably really, and no matter whether advertisement is with original printing shape
Formula exists；It may be added by publisher, advertizer or certain electronic third-party, and the source of this advertisement may be
Subscribed to by user.
10.5.1Based on epidemic compensation
The analysis of the statistics that system produces can reveal that the popularity (Section 14.2) of the specific part of publication.Such as,
In newspaper, it can reveal that reader spends the welcome journey at the time quantum or specific columnist browsing specific webpage or article
Degree.In some cases, activity of based on reader be may be appropriate that rather than based on such as writing out for author or publisher
The more conventional tolerance of the copy number of word or distribution etc receives and compensates.Its works become the authority's work often read of certain topic
The author made should in following contract with its Books Marketing identical copy number but the author being seldom opened differently adds
To consider.
10.5.2Based on epidemic advertisement
Decision-making about the advertisement in document can also be based on the statistics about Readership.Most popular columnist
Advertising space around can be sold with premium rate.Even can document publish after a period of time how to be received based on about it
Knowledge to advertizer charge or to its compensate.
10.6Marketing based on life library shop
" life library shop " or capture history described in 6.1st and 16.1 joints can be the interest about user and custom
The most valuable information source.Through suitable agreement and privacy concern, such data can inform user's commodity or service
There is provided.Even under anonymous form, the statistics of collection is also likely to be exceedingly useful.
10.7Sale/the information (when applicable) on date later
The advertisement of business transaction and other chances may not be immediately presented to user when capture.Such as, novel final result is bought
Chance may be not available user reads novel when, but system can present this chance when final result is published to them.
User can capture and the data bought or other business transactions are relevant, but can select not making capture when
Initiate and/or complete this transaction.In some instances, the data relevant with capture are stored in the life library shop of user, and
And these life library shop entries can keep " activation ", and (i.e. can carry out subsequently is mutual, the when of being similar to make capture
Available is mutual).Therefore, user can look back capture in certain later time, and completes based on this capture alternatively
Transaction.Can follow the tracks of when with where, original capture occurs due to system, thus the institute related in transaction can be adequately compensated for
The side of having.Such as, when after six months, user accesses their life library shop, from history, select this specific capture, and from bullet
Go out in menu (it can be similar or identical with the menu presented alternatively capture when) and select " to buy this thing at Amazon
Product " time, to writing the author of the story occurring in user near the advertisement of its capture data and this story can be published
Publisher compensates.
11.Operating system and application integration
Modern operating system (OS) and other software kits have numerous characteristics, these characteristics can be advantageously employed in case with institute
Describe system be used together, and these characteristics can also be revised in a different manner to provide even preferably platform with
For it.
11.1Capture and printing relevant information are merged in metadata and index
New and upcoming file system and association thereof data base often have storage and each file association various respectively
The ability of the metadata of sample.Traditionally, this metadata includes the ID of the user such as creating file, date created, recently
Amendment and the thing of nearest use etc.The file system updated allows to store such as keyword, picture characteristics, document source
With the extraneous information of user comment etc, and in some systems, this metadata can at random extend.Therefore, file system
System can be used to storage by information useful in realizing current system.Such as, file system can store given document quilt recently
The date of printing, as storing about the system described by using captures which text and when from it from paper
Capture and the details by whose capture.
Operating system also begins to merge the search engine device allowing user to be more easily found local file.These devices are permissible
Advantageously used by system.This means many search related notions that the 3rd and 4 joints are discussed be not only applicable to based on because of
Special net with similar search engine, and be also applied for each personal computer.
In some cases, specific software application also will include propping up for the system outside the device that above-mentioned and OS provide
Hold.
11.2OS for capture device supports
Along with the use of the capture device with integrated photographing unit and mike of such as mobile communication equipment etc becomes day by day
Generally, in some applications it may be desirable to by with mouse and printer are provided support roughly the same in the way of by embedding for the support for them
Enter in operating system, because the suitability of capture device is beyond outside single software application.This is for its other party of system operation
Face is real equally.Some examples are discussed below.In some instances, the system of whole description or its core are by OS
(such as Windows, Windows mobile, Linux, Max OS X, iPhone OS, Android or Symbian)
There is provided.In some instances, the support for system is carried by the application programming interface (API) that can be used by other software kits
Confession, described software kit includes those software kits being directly realized by each side of described system.
11.2.1For OCR and the support of other identification technology
From the method for the text of the document reproduced, great majority capture requires that certain identification software, by source data, is typically capture
Image or some words said be construed to the text that is suitable in system.Some OS include for voice or handwriting recognition
Support, although OS includes it being uncommon for the support of OCR, because the use at past OCR is typically limited to little model
The application enclosed.
Owing to identification component becomes a part of OS, they can better profit from other devices that OS provides.Many systems
Including such as speed dictionary, syntactic analysis instrument, internationalizing and localize device, all these can be had by described system
Identifying process for it, this is particularly because they may customize for specific user to include what he/her was frequently run onto sharply
Word and phrase.
If operating system includes full-text indexing device, then these devices may also be used for the announcement as described in Section 9.3
The other process of knowledge.
11.2.2The action taked during capture
If capture occurs and is supplied to OS, then it can have is not having the statement of other subsystems to have that of this capture
The default action taked in the case of Xie.One example of default action is the selection presenting alternative to user, or will catch
The data obtained are submitted to the embedded searcher of OS.
11.2.3OS has the default action for particular document or Doctype
If finding the digital source of the document of reproduction, then OS can have its document quilt in this particular document or the category
The standard operation will taked during capture.Applying can be with the similar side of its process particular file types of application declaration with other subsystems
Formula is registered as the potential handle of specific capture type to OS.
Can include to the startup of operating system specific with the document reproduced or the flag data associated with the capture from document
The instruction of application, transmission application variables, parameter or data etc..
11.2.4Explain attitude and be mapped to standard operation
In 12.1.3 saves, discussing the use of " attitude ", the special exercise wherein utilizing capture device to make may generation
The beginning of the action of table standard, such as retrtieval region and end.
It is similarly to such action: while using cursor key selection text filed, press the shift key on keyboard, or
The roller on mouse is used to roll document.Such action of user is abundant standard so that they are by the OS of capture device
Explain in the way of system scope, so that it is guaranteed that consistent behavior.Capture device relevant action for other, it is desirable to the most such as
This.
11.2.5Response for standard (with non-standard) icon/text printing menu item is set
In a similar manner, specific text items or other symbol items make standard operation occur when captured, and
OS may provide for these selection.One example is probably, and captures the text in any document and " prints " and will make OS
Obtain and print the copy of the document.OS can also provide the side registered such action and it associated with specific capture
Formula.
11.3For the support of exemplary capture promotional activities in system graphical user interface parts
Most software application is substantially based on Standard graphical user interface (GUI) parts that OS provides.
Developer uses these parts to contribute to guaranteeing the consistent behavior across multiple software kits, such as in any text editing
Hereinafter press left cursor key and cursor should be moved on to the left side, and realize identical function independently without each programmer.
When being captured by text or during other aspect promotional activities of described system, the similar concordance in these parts
It is desired.Shown below is some examples.
11.3.1Find the interface of certain text content
The typical use of system is probably the region capturing paper document for user, and can show for system or edit it
Software kit in open electronic copies, and make this bag be rolled to and highlight the text (12.2.1 joint) of scanning.This mistake
The Part I of journey, i.e. finds and opens electronic document, typically provided by OS and across each software kit be standard.But,
Part II is at one section of particular text of document inner position and makes bag be rolled to it and highlight its not yet standardization, and
And often differently realized by each bag.Availability for standard API of this function can be significantly enhanced this aspect of system
Operation.
11.3.2Text is mutual
Once one section of text in document inner position, then system may want to the text is performed various operations.Make
Being an example, system can ask the text of surrounding, thus user may cause system to access for the capture of some words comprises
Their whole sentence or paragraph.Similarly, this function effectively can be provided by OS rather than process each of text
Software realizes.
11.3.3Context (ejection) menu
The certain operations that system enables will need user feedback, and this most preferably please in processing the context of application of data
Ask.In some instances, system use traditionally with on certain text, click on the application popup menu that right mouse button associates.
Additional option is inserted in such menu by system, and makes them as the work of the such as part capturing paper document etc
Dynamic result and show.
11.4Gateway/network interface
In the world that today networks more and more, function available on most of individual machines can also be accessed by network,
And it is no exception with the function of described system relationship.As an example, in office environment, what user received is permitted
Many paper documents can be printed by the machine of other users on same enterprise network.By suitable control of authority, on a computer
System in response to capture may can to other machines inquiry may document corresponding with this capture.
11.5The printing of document causes preservation
Papery and digital document integrated in important factor be safeguard as much as possible about the transformation between both
Information.In some instances, the simple record that OS keeps any document when to be printed and printed by whom.At some examples
In, OS takes one or more other action, and this will make it be more suitable for described system to be used together.Example includes:
The digital reproduction version of each document of printing is preserved together with the information about the source printing each document from it
Preserving the subset of the useful information about printing edition, the font such as used and where and line feed occur, this is permissible
Following capture is helped to explain
Preserve the version of the source document associated with the copy of any printing
Document is automatically indexed printing and storage result is searched for for future when.
11.6I (printing/capture) document
OS often safeguards particular file folder or the file class with special significance.By convention or design, can such as exist
" my document " file finds the document of user.The file open dialog of standard can automatically include opening recently
The list of document.
On the OS optimized to be used together with described system, such classification can be to consider user and storage
Mode that the hard-copies of file are mutual and be enhanced or expand.Such as " document of my printing " or " I recently reads
Document " etc classification may the most identified and be merged into its operation in.
11.7OS level mark layer aggregated(particle) structure
Owing to the importance of system is typically via using " labelling " concept discussed in Section 5 to provide, it is apparent that
Favourable will be to have this labelling provided for OS for multiple application and mode addressable for OS itself
Support.Additionally, mark layer can document at the control based on OS self and the knowledge of its device that can provide and
Thered is provided by OS.
11.8The use of OS DRM device
The operating system of increasing number supports some form of " digital copyright management ": according to authorizing specific user, software
The ability of the use of the Rights Control particular data of entity or machine.It can stop the unauthorised copies of such as particular document or divide
Send out.
12.User interface
The user interface of system can be completely on capture device, if it is complicated and has the great process of himself
If ability, such as mobile phone or PDA, or completely on PC, if capture device is the mutest and is connected by cable
If PC.In some cases, during some functions reside in each parts.
Therefore, the description in sections below is in specific implementation mode it may be desirable to what instruction, but they are not necessarily fitted
Together in all and can modify in a number of ways.
12.1On capture device
For most of capture devices, the attention of user would generally be on equipment and paper capture when.Then, non-
Often it is desirable for that the attention that needs all need not user as any input of a part for acquisition procedure and feedback is too much located in
In other places, such as on the screen of computer.
12.1.1The feedback of capture device
Capture device can be to have the various modes providing a user with the feedback about particular condition.The most obvious type
Being direct vision, wherein capture device merges display completely or the display lamp of the image captured, and audition, wherein captures
Equipment can sound a buzzer, click on or other sound.Important alternative includes that sense of touch is fed back, and wherein capture device can
With vibration, hummed or otherwise stimulate the sense of touch of user, and projection feedback, wherein it is by will be from colourama
Speckle projects to indicate on paper state to anything of complex display.
The important immediate feedback that can provide on capture device includes:
Move capture device angle too fast, that ether is big about the feedback user of acquisition procedure move or drift about the highest
Or it is the lowest
Sufficiently content captured enough in case quite determine find coupling (if present) this for
The operation disconnected is important
The known source that located text of context
Unique known exclusive source that located text of context
Whether content availability content can be the instruction that user freely obtains or obtains with certain cost.
If capture device has the some or all of enough abilities such as showing document, the usual and later stage of system
Perhaps the multiusers interaction of stage association can also occur on capture device.
12.1.2Control on capture device
Capture device can provide the input in addition to basic text capture, example to provide various modes for user
Such as button, roller/touch wheel, Touch sensitive surface, and/or for detecting the accelerometer of the motion of equipment.In these inputs one
Allow a bit to realize while still holding capture device one group more rich mutual.
Such as, in response to capturing certain text, capture device presents one group of some possible coupling document to user.User makes
From list, one is selected with the Touch sensitive surface of capture device.
12.1.3Attitude
Moving the main cause of capture device across paper is capture text, but some motions may be by equipment Inspection and be used for
Indicate other user mutual.Such motion is referred to herein as " attitude ".
As an example, user can be by capturing several leading word and in dextrosinistral fortune in motion from left to right
Disorder of internal organs captures last several words and indicates big text filed.User can also move capture set by crossing several rows along the page
The standby vertical scope indicating text.Backward moving during capture may indicate that cancels previous capture operation.
12.1.4On-line/off-line behavior
The network that many aspects of system are likely to be dependent between the system unit of such as capture device etc and wireless network is connected
Property, or to enterprise database and the network connectivity with the external world of the type of attachment of Internet search.But, this connection
Property is not likely to be and exists always, thus can there is occasion when part or all of system may be considered " off-line ".At this
In the case of Xie, it is desirable to permission system works with remaining valid.
When other parts of capture device Yu system are out of touch, capture device can be used to capture text.The simplest
Equipment may be merely capable of storing and associate with capture, ideally with the image indicating its timestamp when being captured to associate or audio frequency
Data.Each different capture can upload to the remainder and then of system with system when next capture device contacts
Process.Capture device can also be uploaded and capture other data associated, such as voice annotation or positional information.
More complicated equipment itself may perform the operation of some or all of systems, is disconnected regardless of it.Section 15.3, beg for
The various different technology of ability for improving they do so are discussed.Generally, situation would is that some rather than is hopeful
Action can perform while off-line.For example, it is possible to identification text, but the mark in source be likely to be dependent on based on because of
The connection of the search engine of special net.Therefore, in some instances, equipment storage is sufficiently about each operation progress how far letter
Breath is so that the remainder of system continues effectively when connecting recovery.
The operation of system generally will benefit from immediately available connection, but exist in which the some captures of execution and then perform
They are likely to be of some situations of advantage as batch processing.Such as, as discussed in following Section 13, specific capture
The mark in source can be by checking that other captures that user makes in the approximately uniform time are significantly enhanced.Wherein to
User provides in the system of Real-time Feedback, and system is only able to use capture in the past when processing current capture.But, as
Fruit capture one of batch processing of storage when being equipment off-line, then system when carrying out it and analyzing by it can be considered that can be from catching later
Obtain and any data of previous capture acquisition.
12.2On the host device
Capture device can communicate with other equipment of certain of such as PC etc to perform many functions of system, including with use
Family more detailed mutual.
12.2.1The activity performed in response to capture
When main process equipment receives capture, it can initiate various activity.The electronics that system associates with capture in location
Possible the imperfect of activity performed after position in copy document and the document is listed as follows.
The details of capture can be stored in the history of user.(Section 6.1)
Document can be obtained from local storage or remote location.(Section 8)
The operating system metadata with document associations and other records can be updated.(Section 11.1)
The labelling with document associations can be checked to determine ensuing associative operation.(Section 5)
Software application can be started to edit, to check or otherwise to document function.The selection of application can be depended on
In source document or depend on capture content or depend on capture other aspects.(11.2.2,11.2.3 save)
Application can be rolled to, highlights, mobile insertion point to or be otherwise indicated that the position of capture.(Section 11.3)
The exact boundary of the text of capture can be revised, in order to such as select capture text around whole words, sentence or
Paragraph.(11.3.2 joint)
User can be given and will capture text copy to clipbook or to its execution other standards operating system or dedicated operations
Option.
Can be by annotation and document or the textual association of capture.These annotations can come from instant user and input, or such as
Can be captured in early days in the case of the voice annotation associated with the image of capture.(Section 19.4)
Can be with check mark to determine the one group of other possible operation selected for user.
12.2.2Context popup menu
Sometimes the suitable action that system is taked will be apparent from, but it would be required to user and makes a choice sometimes.The one of do so
Kind of good mode is " popup menu " by using the content on the display of capture device to occur or so-called
" context menu ".(seeing 11.3.3 joint).In some instances, popup menu is projected to paper document by capture device
On.User can use the traditional method of such as keyboard and mouse etc, or by using control on capture device (the
12.1.2 joint), or by use capture device and computer display mutual (12.2.4 joint) from such menu
Select.In some instances, default item can be included as the popup menu that the result of capture occurs, these default item generations
Table such as, is ignored menu user and makes the action occurred in the case of another captures in the case of user is not responding to.
12.2.3The feedback of disambiguation
When user starts to capture text, some documents or other text positions that it can mate originally will be there is.Along with more
Many texts are captured, and consider other factors (Section 13), and the quantity of position candidate will reduce, until actual position
Putting identified, further disambiguation is the most impossible.In some instances, system such as with
List, thumbnail image or text chunk form provide the real-time display of the document found or position, and for the unit in this display
Prime number amount, reduces quantity along with the continuation of capture.In some instances, system shows the thumbnail of all candidate documents, its
The probability that it is correct coupling is depended in the size of middle thumbnail or position.
When specifically identifying capture, audible feedback can be such as used to emphasize that this is true to user.
Sometimes, during the text of capture will appear in many documents and will be identified that quotation.System can be such as by wrapping
Document containing the list of references quoted is grouped in around original source document and shows this point on screen.
12.2.4From screen capture
Some capture devices may can capture the text of display on screen and paper.Therefore, the document that term reproduces is at this
In be used to refer to be printed onto on paper the unique forms not being to reproduce, and for the text of system or the capture of symbol at this article
It is equally valuable when this shows on an electronic display.
For various other reasonses, the user of described system may need mutual with computer screen, in order to from
Option list selects.Other chapters and sections describe as the physical control (12.1.2 on the capture device of input method
Joint) or attitude (12.1.3 joint), it may be even convenient when capturing information, is formed and closes with replaceable input method
The display device of connection, such as keyboard or mouse.
In some instances, capture device can be without in the case of processing the text captured, possibly by means of computer
On specialized hardware or software sense its position on screen.
13.Context interpretation
One importance of described system uses other factor to help outside being in addition to the simple capture of text string
The document that mark uses.The capture of appropriateness amount of text often can uniquely identify document, but in most cases, it will mark
Know some candidate documents.A solution is the source that prompting user confirms the information of capture, but one preferred replaceable
Scheme is to utilize other factors automatically to reduce probability.Such side information can reduce the text needing capture sharp
Amount and/or increase can identify reliability and the speed of the position in electronic copies.This extra material is referred to as " context ", and
And it has carried out brief discussion in 4.2.2 saves.We consider it deeper into ground now.
13.1System and capture context
Perhaps, the most important example of this information is the capture history of user.
It is very likely that any given capture is from the document identical with previous capture, or carry out the document of auto correlation,
In the case of capture previously occurred within nearest a few minutes, especially true (6.1.2 joint).If on the contrary, system inspection
Measure font to change between two captures, then more likely they are from different documents.
The most usefully the longer-term of user captures history and reading habit.These may also be used for development of user interest and
Correlation model.
13.2The real world context of user
Another example of useful context is the geographical position of user.Such as, the user in Paris reads Die Welt than reading
Seattle Times more may be much.Therefore, the opportunity of the printed copy of document, scale and geographical distribution are probably important,
And can infer from the operation of system to a certain extent.
Such as always read a type of publication on the road being on duty and read in the lunchtime or on the train gone home
In the case of reading the user of different types of publication, it is also likely to be significant during day.
13.3Relevant the most hereafter
User is recently for electronic document, and the use including those documents searched for by more conventional means or obtain can also
It is helpful to designator.
In some cases, such as on enterprise network, can effectively consider other factor:
Have printed which document recently？
Which document is have modified recently on corporate file server？
Which document is have sent more recently by Email？
All these examples perhaps imply that user is the most reading the hard-copies of these documents.Contrast to that,
If the resident warehouse of document can be affirmed that document is not printed or is sent to it and may be printed Anywhere, then
The document can be eliminated safely in any search derive from paper.
13.4Other statistics global context
Section 14 covers the data-flow analysis obtained by search based on paper, it should be pointed out that here,
About document popularity in other readers, about this epidemic opportunity and about the documentation section most frequently captured
Statistics is all the example of other factor that possible useful in search procedure.System is by the probability of Google's formula page rank
Take the paper world to.
For context for some other implication of search engine, save referring also to 4.2.2.
14.Data-flow analysis
The use of system produces the most valuable data stream as side effect.This stream is what and when user is reading
The record read, and it is what especially valuable record they find in the thing of their reading in many cases.This
Before the data of sample, paper document the most really be can use.
Section 6.1, in, describe some modes that wherein these data user possibly for system and for system is useful.This section
Concentrate on it for other aspects.What certainly, exist substantial amounts of hidden for reading any distribution of data about people
Private problem, but the problem of such as anonymity retaining data etc is well known to the skilled person.
14.1Document tracking
When system knows which document any given user reading, it can also infer that who is reading any given literary composition
Shelves.This allow by tissue follow the tracks of document, it is allowed to analyze such as who reading it and the most reading, how extensive it have
How long ground distribution, this distribution spend and who has seen current version other people still use out-of-date copy when.
For there is the document of widely distributed publication, follow the tracks of each copy more difficult, but analyze Readership and divide
Cloth remains possible.
14.2Read ranked document and the popularity in sub-district
During user captures the situation of their text of special interest or other data wherein, system may infer that particular document
And the popularity of the special stator region of those documents.This formed to system itself valuable input (4.2.2 joint) and
Important information source (Section 7.6, Section 10.5) for author, publisher and advertizer.These data are drawn being integrated into search
Also be useful when holding up and search in index, such as to help the Search Results of the inquiry from the document reproduced is carried out ranking,
And/or help the conventional query to keying in web browser to carry out ranking.
14.3Customer analysis sets up profile
What knowledge user reading and enabling the system to create the interest of user and movable model in considerable detail.This
Useful " buying the 35% nearest books also reading this author of the user of this newspaper " it is probably on the basis of abstract statistics
But as discussed below, it can also allow mutual with other of individual user.
14.3.1Social networks
One example be by a user with there is related interests other people be connected.These people can be that this user already is familiar with
People.System can inquire college professor, and " you know that you have the most just read this paper the colleague of XYZ university？”
System can inquire user, and " you want also to contact other people reading " letter like " in your neighbours？" such
System can be the basis automatically formed of entity world or online book club and similar structure of society.
14.3.2Marketing
Section 10.6, it has been mentioned that the mutual thought providing products & services to individual user of based on user Yu system.Currently
Online bookman be such as often based on user previously with bookman make recommendation to user alternately.Such recommendation they based on
Become during with actual books mutual useful much.
14.4Based on the otherwise marketing of data stream
We have discussed more such modes, and wherein system can be to affect those modes of publishing documents, by them
Those modes of advertisement and initiate from paper other sell (Section 10).Some business activities may be basic with paper document
The most mutual, but may be affected by them.Such as, the people in a community are in the sports part side of newspaper
Face is probably than the knowledge taken more time in terms of Financial interested to the someone setting up Health Club.
14.5The data type that can be captured
In addition to the statistics (such as who is reading which position of which document and when is reading with where) discussed,
May meaningfully check the actual content of captured text, no matter whether document is positioned.
In most cases, user also will not only capture certain text, and certain action will be made to occur as result.It
It is probably and is such as sent to acquaintance by quoting for document by Email.Even do not exist the identity about user or
In the case of the information of the recipient of Email, someone thinks that the document is worth the knowledge sent by Email to be also very
Useful.
In addition to for inferring the distinct methods that the value of particular document or one section of text is discussed, in some cases,
User will be by clearly indicating that this value to its one grade of distribution.
Finally, when known one group of specific user forms a group, such as when known they be the employee of specific company time,
This group collects the importance that statistics can be used to infer particular document for this group.This is applicable to pass through machine sort
Technology is based on the group identified about document, capture, user etc., and described machine sort counts such as Bayesian statistic, gathers
Class, k arest neighbors (k-NN), singular value decomposition (SVD) etc..
15.Equipment feature and function
In some instances, capture device can be integrated with mobile phone, and wherein telephony hardware is not modified in order to described in support
System, such as its Chinese version capture can be sufficiently completed by image capturing and is in reason by phone directory, or by passing through
The system that such as wireless network connects or honeycomb connects and can be accessed by mobile phone processes, or stores in the memorizer of phone
Process so that following.Many modern phones have the ability of the software of some part downloading the system that is adapted for carrying out.At some
In example, it is embedded into the photographing unit in many mobile phones for capturing the image of text.Generally act as the diastimeter of photographing unit
Telephone displays can cover about picture quality and just captured for the suitability of OCR, which text chunk and very
Extremely in the case of OCR can perform on phone in the real time camera image information of the transcription of text.Telephone displays is also
Can provide interface, user alternately and can cause the action associated by this interface with the text of capture.
Similarly, voice data can be by the microphones capture of mobile phone.But, the capture of such speech is in many situations
Under (such as when there is substantial amounts of background noise) be likely to suboptimum, and accurate speech recognition optimal when also
It it is the task of difficulty.Audio devices can preferably be used for capturing voice annotation.
In some instances, amendment phone is to add special acquisition equipment, or in the single bluetooth with telephone communicationTM
Connect in peripheral hardware or clip adapter and such function is provided.Regardless of the character of catch mechanism, system is integrated with modern cell phones
There are other advantages many.Phone is connected with the broader world, it means that inquiry can be submitted to remote search engines or
Other parts of person's system, and the copy of document can be obtained soon to store or to check.Phone typically has enough
Disposal ability is locally to perform many functions of system, and enough amount of storage are to capture rational data volume.Storage
Amount often can also be extended by user.Phone has goodish display and audio devices to provide user feedback, and warp
Often there is the vibrating function for sense of touch feedback.They also have good power supply.
Perhaps, it will therefore be apparent that many intended users have carry mobile phone.
The capture device being used together with system needs only to a kind of capture mode from the text reproducing version of document.As
Previous described, this capture can be realized by various methods, these methods include the part of document is taken pictures or
Some words are keyed in keypad by person.This capture can use have image and audio capture capabilities or also recording of voice annotation light
Learn scanner to realize.
15.1Input and output
Section 12.1, the many described for this equipment may useful additional input and output device.They include button,
Roller and for input touch pad and display, display lamp, for output audio frequency and sense of touch transducer.Sometimes, equipment
By merging the many devices in these devices, the most then merge considerably less device.Sometimes, capture device can such as use nothing
Line link communicate with another equipment with them (Section 15.6), sometimes, capturing function be incorporated into such other
In equipment (Section 15.7).
15.2Connectivity
In some instances, equipment realizes the major part of system itself.But, in some instances, it is commonly used logical
T unit and PC or other calculate equipment and with broader world communication.
These communicators connect often in general data network (such as Ethernet, 802.11 or UWB) or standard peripherals
Connect network (such as USB, IEEE-1394 (live wire), bluetoothTMOr infrared) form.When using such as live wire or USB
Etc wired connection time, equipment can receive electric power by identical connection.In some cases, capture device may be even
The machine connect appears as the conventional peripheries of such as USB storage device etc.
Finally, in some cases, equipment " can dock " with another equipment, or use together with this equipment or be used for
Storage easily.
15.3Caching and other on-line/off-line functions
Section 3.5, and 12.1.4 joint proposes the topic of opening operation.When capture device has the limited of the function of whole system
Subset and during not with other section communication of system, equipment may remain useful, although available function reduces sometimes.
Under simplest level, equipment can record captured original image or voice data and this can be acted upon afterwards.
But, for the interests of user, it may be important that be given in the conceived case about captured data whether possibly for
Task on hand be enough, whether it can be identified after whether can being identified or be likely to identified and data source
Or it is likely to identified feedback.Then, the user would know that whether their capture activity is worth.Even in all above institutes
When stating the unknown, remain on and can store initial data so that at least user can quote them afterwards.Such as, OCR is worked as
When process can not identify capture, the image of capture can be presented to user.
In order to some options in the option scope that can use are described, minimal optical scanning device and so is described below
After be the more full optical scanning device much of feature.Many equipment occupy the intermediate zone between both.
15.3.1SimpleScanner-low side off-line example
SimpleScanner has the probe that can read the pixel from the page along the length of line of text when moving.It
Its moving and recording about this some moved information along the page can be detected.It also has clock, and it allows every time
Timestamp is added a cover in scanning.When SimpleScanner connects, clock is Tong Bu with main process equipment.Clock cannot represent reality
During day, but the relative time can be determined from it so that main frame may infer that the sweep time of reality, or in the worst feelings
Elapsed time between scanning is inferred under condition.
SimpleScanner itself does not has the disposal ability of enough any OCR of execution, but it has really about typical case
Word length, word spacing and some ABCs of the relation with font size thereof.It has the display lamp that some are basic, these
Display lamp tells whether scanning input may can read, and whether probe be moving too quickly across paper, the most slowly or too inaccuracy,
And when it is determined that have scanned enough to the word of sizing for document to be identified.
SimpleScanner has USB connector and the USB port being inserted on computer, at this USB port
It will be recharged by place.For computer, it appears to have recorded on it and adds a cover the data file of timestamp and be
The USB storage device that the remainder of system software is taken over from this point.
15.3.2SuperDevice-high-end off-line example
SuperDevice also depends on connectivity to realize its complete operation, but it has on substantial amounts of plate and stores and process,
This can help its data for capture when off-line to make preferably judgement.
When SuperDevice captures text by the image of the document of the photographing unit capture of such as place's reason SuperDevice,
The text of capture is delivered to the OCR engine attempting to identify the text.Some fonts, including going out of at most reading from user
Version thing those fonts, download to equipment so as to help perform this task, as with the user's spell check dictionary on user PC
Synchronize and thus comprise the dictionary of many words that they frequently encounter.Word and the list of phrase with its typical frequencies used
Also being stored on SuperDevice, this can combine with dictionary.SuperDevice can use frequency statistics data to help
Identification process and also inform that it is about the judgement when capturing enough amount of text；Most frequently used phrase unlikely can use
It is search for the basis of inquiry.
Additionally, store on SuperDevice newspaper that user the most often reads and periodical most recently in the complete index of article,
Buy as user bookman the most from network or recent months user captures the index of books of anything from it.Finally,
Storage has the title of the thousands of the most popular publication of the data that can be used for system so that in the case of there are not other information,
User can capture title and have about the good master that whether may Electronically obtain the capture from particular work later
Meaning.
During acquisition procedure, system informs that the data that user captures have enough quality and enough character so that working as extensive
The electronic copy of the multiply-connected information that can obtain capture when connecing is possibly realized.Often, system indicates to the user that known acquisition success also
And onboard one of index identifies context, or known relevant publication makes its data can use for system, thus
Later acquisition should be successful.
SuperDevice rests in the bracket of live wire or the USB port being connected to PC, at this point, except uploading capture
Data outside, on its different plates index and other data bases upload based on nearest User Activity and new publication.
SuperDevice also has and is connected to wireless public network, the device of cellular network or passes through bluetoothTMWith mobile phone communications
And thus when such device can use and public network communication.In some cases, can wirelessly update on plate index and
Other data bases.This renewal process can be initiated by user or automatically be initiated by system.
15.4Feature for image capturing
We consider some features that may be particularly desirable in capture device now.
15.4.1Location and convenient optics flexibly
One of reason of paper continued popularity be its be readily used in the most such as computer by impracticable or inconvenient various respectively
In the situation of sample.Expection capture user's substantial portion of equipment mutual with paper thus should be easy to use similarly.For mistake
For the scanner gone, situation is really not so；Even minimum portable equipment also some heaviness.It is designed to contact with the page
Those equipment must keep becoming with paper accurate angle and very carefully length along text to be scanned move.This
It is acceptable during scanning business report on desk, but then may when scanning the phrase from novel waiting train when
Impracticable.Operating in the capture device based on photographing unit at a certain distance from paper may be the most useful.
Some examples of system use such scanner, and it scans contiguously with paper, and it replaces lens to use image
Catheter fiber bundle by the image transmitting from the page to optical sensor device.Such equipment can be shaped to allow it to keep
In natural position；Such as, in some instances, the part contacted with the page is wedge shape, thus allows the hands of user with class
The motion being similar to use e-Pointer is more naturally mobile above the page.Conduit or directly contact with paper, or next-door neighbour's paper,
And can have the replaceable clear tip that image conduit can be protected from possible damage.In saving such as 12.2.4
Mentioning, scanner can be used to scan from screen scanning and from paper, and the material at tip can be selected to reduce and damages
The probability of bad such display.
Finally, some examples of equipment will provide feedback to user during acquisition procedure, its will by making to use up, sound or
Sense of touch feedback indicate when user move capture device the soonest, the most slowly, the most uneven or get Tai Gao or too of drifting about on capture row
Low.
15.5Safety, identity, certification, individualized and charging
As described in Section 6, capture device can be formed for Secure Transaction, purchase and other operations various
Mark and the pith of mandate.Therefore, in addition to circuit needed for this effect and software, it can merge can make
Its safer different hardware feature, such as smart card reader, RFID or key in the keypad of PIN thereon.
It can also include the various different biometric sensor helping mark user.At such as capture device, there is image
In the case of capture ability, photographing unit is likely to read fingerprint.For voice recorder, it is possible to use if user
Sound pattern.
15.6Equipment associates
In some instances, capture device can be formed with equipment near other and associate to increase the merit of himself or they
Energy.In some instances, such as, near its use, the display of PC or phone is to provide the supplementary feedback operated about it,
Or use their network connectivity.On the other hand, equipment can its as safety and mark equipment role in operate with
The operation that certification is performed by other equipment.Or, it can simply form association to be used as the peripheral hardware of this equipment.
One interesting aspect of such association is, they can use the acquisition equipment of equipment to initiate and certification.Such as,
Wish to identify self user the acquisition equipment of equipment can be used so that capture terminal screen to public computer terminal security
The code of display or symbol and thus realize crucial transmission on specific region.Similar procedure can use voice recording equipment to pick up
The audio signal taken performs.
15.7With other integration of equipments
In some instances, the function of capture device is integrated in certain other equipment used.Integrated equipment may
Power supply, data capture and storage capacity and network interface can be shared.Such integrated can just to convenient, reduce into
This or enable and in the case of other, disabled function completed.
Some examples of the equipment that can be integrated into by capturing function include:
Existing peripheral hardware, such as mouse, stylus, USB " IP Camera " photographing unit, bluetoothTMHeadband receiver or
Person's remote controller；
Another process/storage device, such as PDA, MP3 player, voice recorder or digital camera；
Other article often carrying or often wearing, just to facilitating wrist-watch, jewelry, glasses, a cap
Son, pen, automobile key chain；Etc..
The example application of ii I part-system
Exemplary application that this section lists system and the application that can build thereon.This list expection purely illustrative is also
And be not the most exhaustive.
16.Individual application
16.1Life library shop
Life library shop (6.1.1 joint) is the Digital Archives that subscriber wishes any important documents preserved, and is that this is
The set of the Service Instance of system.Important books, magazine article, newspaper editing etc. can be saved in life in digital form
In library.Additionally, the annotation of subscriber, comment on and take down notes and can preserve together with document.Life library shop can be by because of spy
Net and world wide web access.
System is that subscriber creates and managerial life library document file shop.Subscriber or is led to from the information of document by capture
Cross and otherwise add this particular document the life library shop of subscriber to system instruction and indicate which document subscriber wishes
It is saved in his life library shop.The information of capture is typically from the text of document, but can also be mark document
Bar code or other codes.System accepts this code and uses it to identify source document.After identifying document, system can
The copy of document is stored in the life library shop of user or stores the link in the source that wherein can obtain the document.
One example of life library shop system can check whether that authorized subscriber obtains electronic copy.Such as, if reader catches
Obtain text or the identifier of the copy of article from the New York Times (NYT) so that this article is added to the life figure of reader
Book shop, then whether life library shop system will have subscribed the online version of NYT with NYT checking reader；If it is then
Reader allows the copy of article store in his life library shop account；If it does not, so identify document and how to order its
Information stores in his life library shop account.
In some instances, system is that each subscriber safeguards the subscriber profiles comprising access privileges information.Document access information can
To edit in a number of ways, two of which is: 1) document access information is carried together with his account name and password etc. by subscriber
Supply life library shop system；Or 2) life library shop ISP is to the information of publisher inquiry subscriber, and publishes
Person is responded for the access of electronic copy by offer in the case of life library shop subscriber is authorized to described material.
If the uncommitted electronic copy having document of life library shop subscriber, then publisher carries to life library shop ISP
For price, then this life library shop ISP provides the option buying electronic document to client.If so, life figure
Book shop ISP directly pays to publisher and presents the bill with backward life library shop client, or the service of life library shop
Supplier presents the bill to the credit card of client for this purchase immediately.Life library shop ISP will be because this transaction of promotion
The certain percentage of acquisition purchasing price or little fixed charge.
System can achieve for document in the in-depth interview of subscriber and/or subscriber have any other library of archives privilege.
Such as, when user's capture is from the text of the document of printing, life library shop system can identify document and the electricity thereof of reproduction
Sub-copy.After identifying source document, the information about source document can be recorded the individual of user by life library shop system
Library and subscriber have in colony's library of archives privilege.Colony's library is the cooperation archives of such as document repository etc,
For the colony worked together for certain project, academic research personnel colony, group network daily record etc..
Can regular organization activity library in many ways: in chronological order, by theme, by the interest level of subscriber, by publishing
Type (newspaper, books, magazine, technical papers etc.), where are read, when are read, by ISBN or press Du Weishi
System etc..In a kind of alternative, how system can classify identical document and learning classification based on other subscribers.System
System can be advised classification to user or automatically classify the document for user.
In different examples, directly annotation can be inserted in document or annotation can be safeguarded in single file.
Such as, when subscriber's capture is from the text of newspaper article, this article is archived in by the text captured with highlighting his life figure
In book shop.Alternatively, this article is archived in together with the comment file associated in his life library shop (thus keep depositing
The document of shelves is not modified).The example of system can keep the copy of source document in the library of each subscriber, order in many
The main library that family can access keeps copy, or remains to the link of the copy that publisher holds.
In some instances, life library shop only stores user to the amendment (such as highlighting etc.) of document and at document
The link of online version (being stored in other places).These changes and document are closed by system or subscriber when subscriber obtains document subsequently
And together.
If annotation is maintained in single file, then source document and comment file are supplied to subscriber and subscriber combines it
With produce amendment document.Alternatively, system combined both of these documents before both of these documents is supplied to subscriber.?
In another alternative, comment file is covering and can being covered by the software in the computer of subscriber of document files
On document.
Subscriber's Monthly Payment of life library shop service is to allow the archives of system maintenance subscriber.Alternatively, subscriber is shelves
In case shop, each document of storage pays small charge (such as small amount payment).Alternatively, subscriber is propped up by each interview expenses
Pay to access the archives of subscriber.Alternatively, subscriber can edit library and with life library shop ISP and
Other people are allowed to access material/annotation on the gainsharing model of copyright owner.Alternatively, life library shop ISP
Receive the payment from publisher (with the gainsharing model of publisher, wherein to live when life library shop subscriber's subscription
Library services supplier obtains being divided into of publisher's income).
In some instances, life library shop ISP serves as subscriber and copyright owner (or generation of copyright owner
Reason mechanism, such as copyright settlement center, also known as CCC) between intermediary in case for copyright material promotion draw up bill and payment.
Life library shop ISP uses the bill information of subscriber with other user account informations to provide this intermediary sevices.Substantially,
Life library shop ISP utilizes and the relation being pre-existing in of subscriber buys copyright material to allow to represent subscriber.
In some instances, life library shop system can store the extracts from document.Such as, capture from paper as subscriber
During the text of matter document, the region around the text of capture is taken passages and is placed in life library shop rather than whole document is deposited
Shelves are in life library shop.This is particularly advantageous when document is longer, because the situation retaining original capture prevents subscriber's weight
New reading documents is to find out interesting part.Of course, it is possible to include the whole electronic copies of paper document together with taking passages material
Hyperlink.
In some instances, the information about document is also stored in life library shop by system, these information such as author,
Publication title, the publication date, publisher, copyright owner (or devolution mechanism of copyright owner), ISBN,
To document public annotation link, read ranking etc..It is paper document unit number about some in this additional information of document
According to form.Third party can create public comment file and access for the people's (such as the general public) being different from themselves.
It is favourable to third party for the link of the comment of document, because the comment file reading other users enhances subscriber for literary composition
The understanding of shelves.
In some instances, material is achieved by system category.This feature allows life library shop subscriber to store whole rapidly
The electronic copies of the paper document of classification and do not access each paper document.Such as, capture from national geography magazine as subscriber
During certain text copied, system provides the option of the archive of all a back issues to National Geographic to subscriber.If subscriber
Select to achieve all a back issues, then life library shop ISP will verify together with national geography association subscriber whether by
Authorize do so.If it does not, so life library shop ISP can facilitate purchase to achieve national geography magazine set between two parties
Right.
16.2Life conservator
A kind of modification or the enhancing of life library shop concept are " life conservators ", wherein system use user capture text with
Infer the more information of other activities about them.From the menu of certain restaurant, the program from specific theatrical performances, spy
Determine the timetable in railway station or from the capture permission system of the article of local paper, position and the social activity of user made
Infer, and can be that they construct automatic diary, such as website.User can edit and revise diary, add all
Additional materials and certain project the most again looking at capture such as photo etc.
17.Academic application
The capture device of described system support has many compellent purposes in academic environment.They can strengthen
Student/teacher is mutual and expands learning experience.In addition to other purposes, student can annotate of its unique needs applicable
Practise material；Teacher can monitor classroom performance；And teacher can automatically verify the source material quoted in students' work.
17.1 is children's book equipped
Child is mutual by character learning acquisition system prosecution with the paper document of such as books etc, and this character learning acquisition system uses should
One group of particular instance of system.Child uses the capture device of other element communication with character learning acquisition system.Except capture device
Outside, character learning acquisition system also includes display and speaker and the data base that can be accessed by capture device.When child sees figure
During unknown word in book, child utilize capture device capture it.In an example, character learning acquisition system by capture text with
Resource in its data base is compared to identify this word.Data base includes dictionary, dictionary and/or multimedia file (such as
Sound, figure etc.).After mark word, system uses speaker to read pronunciation and the definition thereof of this word to child.Separately
In one example, word and definition thereof are shown over the display by character learning acquisition system.Can also be play by display and speaker
Multimedia file about the word of capture.Such as, if the child reading " golden hair girl and three Bearss " captures word " Bears ",
System can read the pronunciation of word " Bears " and play the short-sighted frequency about Bears over the display.In this way, little Hai Xue
Learned word can be read and be visually taught the implication of this word by multimedia presentation.
Character learning acquisition system provides instant audition and/or visual information to strengthen learning process.Child uses this side information fast
Obtain the deeper understanding for written material fastly.System can be used to instruct emergent readers to read, it is bigger to help child to obtain
Vocabulary quantity etc..This system provides or child unfamiliar about child for the information of the word of its more information to child.
17.2Character learning gathers
In some instances, system editor individual dictionary.If reader sees new, interesting or useful especially or spine
The word of hands, its (defining together with it) is saved in computer documents by reader.This computer documents becomes the individualized word of reader
Allusion quotation.The size of this dictionary is generally little than common dictionary, thus can download to the equipment of movement station or association, and thus even
Also can use when system can not access immediately.In some instances, individual's dictionary entry includes the audio frequency helping correct word to pronounce
File and mark are from the paper document of its capture word.
In some instances, system is phonetic and the vocabulary test that student creates customization.Such as, when students ' reading operation,
Student can utilize capture device to capture unfamiliar word.The list of all words of system storage student's capture.After a while, system exists
Association monitor on manage to the customization of student phonetic/vocabulary test (or such test is printed upon association printing
On machine).

Conventional internet search engine typically provides the free search of electronic document, and the most not because its content is included in
Index is charged to content provider.In some instances, system provides charge to user in operation and the use of system
And/or pay to search engine and/or content provider.
In some instances, the subscriber of system service is the search paying of the capture deriving from paper document.Such as, stock warp
Discipline people may read the article of the Wall Street Journal of the new product about the offer of X company.By capturing X from paper document
Business Name and agree to pay necessary expense, stock broker use the special or proprietary data base of described systematic search with
Obtain the premium information about the said firm, such as analyst's report.System can also be made arrangements so that such as by assuring that specific
Date publish all newspapers indexed and when they lists can with and allow be likely to paper form reading the preferential rope of document
Draw.
Content provider can Zhi Fuyu from the search inquiry that paper document is submitted to particular item association expense.Such as, exist
In one example, based on the additional context about supplier, (in this case, context is that content provider pays to system
The expense of reach the results list) select most preferred content provider.It practice, search supplier based on be pre-existing in
The financial arrangement of content provider and regulate paper document Search Results.Referring also to the keyword in Section 5.2 and crucial phrase
Describe.
In the case of access certain content is limited to specific crowd (such as client or employee), such content can be prevented fires
Wall is protected and thus generally can not be indexed by third party.But, content provider may want to provide the rope to protected content
Draw.In this case, content provider can pay to ISP to provide the rope of content provider to system subscriber
Draw.Such as, law office can index all of Client document.After these documents are stored in the fire wall of law office.
But, law office wants its employee and client to be entitled by capture device and access document, thus it provides ISP
The index pointer of index (or), ISP submits to capture device to catch the employee of law office or client in turn
The index of law office is searched for during the search terms obtained.Employee and/or customer list can be supplied to service and carry by law office
The system of donor is to allow this function or the system can be by inquiring about law office before the index of search law office
Authentication-access authority.It should be pointed out that, in example above, the index that law office provides is only the document of client
Index rather than the index of all documents of law office.Therefore, ISP can only authorize the visitor of law office
Family accesses the authority of the document that law office is this client index.
There is at least two and individually can come from the search of paper document with origin and the income stream that causes: income stream from
Function of search, and another income stream is from content delivery function.Function of search income can be with origin from the paid subscriptions of user
Produce, but can also produce by often searching for charge.Content delivery income can be divided into content provider or copyright owner
(ISP can obtain certain percentage or fixed charge, the most mutual small amount payment sold), but
Can also be produced by " changing the place of examination " model, in the model, system is ordered from line directory for subscriber and system has been paid
Or each project of contribution obtains certain expense or percentage ratio, facilitate this transaction the most between two parties regardless of ISP.At some
In example, any follow-up in certain predetermined amount of time or when making the purchase of product to mark of system service provider
Time, receive the income of all purchases that subscriber makes from content provider.
