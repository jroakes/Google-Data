Definitions
- Search appliances such as are used in conjunction with an intranet, typically receive an initial list of URLs to crawl, crawl those URLs, and create an index based on the documents retrieved. Recrawls are typically performed in sequence—the first page crawled is also the first page recrawled. The result can be that less important pages and pages which change infrequently that appear earlier in the URL list are crawled before other, more important pages. Since a crawler can only crawl a finite number of pages in a given time period, situations can arise where less important or unchanged pages may be crawled to the exclusion of more important or changed pages. There exists a need to be able to schedule when pages should be recrawled.

To help remedy this, at 404 , a crawl period is set, based on the change period. In this embodiment, the crawl period is set to half of the change period. For example, while URL 310 is estimated to change every two days, the crawl period of URL 310 is one day. In other embodiments, other relations are used as appropriate. In some embodiments, crawl periods are “bucketized” into groups such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.

- Use of an importance rank may be especially helpful when a search appliance is faced with the daunting task of recrawling millions of pages. Pages that are more important should generally be crawled more frequently than pages that are less important, even if some of the important pages may change less frequently than some of the less important pages.

Abstract
A method for determining a recrawl schedule of items on an intranet using a search appliance includes estimating, using the search appliance installed on the intranet, a change period for items on the intranet using a history of crawl information for the items. The change period for an item may be a frequency of change in content of the item. The method includes calculating a crawl period for each of the items, where the crawl period for an item is set relative to the change period for the item. The method includes determining whether to adjust the calculated crawl period for each of the items using adjustment criteria, adjusting the calculated crawl period for selected items determined for adjustment using the adjustment criteria and creating a recrawl schedule of the items on the intranet using a recrawl time for each of the items.
Description
This application is a continuation application of Ser. No. 11/113,819, filed on Apr. 25, 2005, and titled “Scheduling A Recrawl,” which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Search appliances, such as are used in conjunction with an intranet, typically receive an initial list of URLs to crawl, crawl those URLs, and create an index based on the documents retrieved. Recrawls are typically performed in sequence—the first page crawled is also the first page recrawled. The result can be that less important pages and pages which change infrequently that appear earlier in the URL list are crawled before other, more important pages. Since a crawler can only crawl a finite number of pages in a given time period, situations can arise where less important or unchanged pages may be crawled to the exclusion of more important or changed pages. There exists a need to be able to schedule when pages should be recrawled.
Various embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.
Determining a schedule for recrawling pages is disclosed. In one embodiment, a search appliance is configured to determine a recrawling schedule. A search appliance, such as the Google Search Appliance, is typically a self-contained sealed computer which is installed within a network, such as a corporate intranet. The search appliance indexes documents on the intranet and delivers search results. As part of this process, documents are crawled and recrawled. In one embodiment a recrawl schedule, specifying when a page or group of pages should be recrawled, is created. To create the crawl schedule, a change period for a page is calculated. In this case, the change period for a page is how often the page is observed to change. A crawl period—specifying how often to crawl the page—is determined based at least in part on the change period. In some cases, the calculated crawl period may be adjusted before being finalized. This may be based on such factors as whether the page is important.
In this embodiment, crawler 108 performs multiple functions, including requesting URLs from crawl manager 102, fetching the documents at those URLs, and processing retrieved documents, for example, to extract link information. Documents can include Web pages, text files, multimedia files, object features, link structure, and other content. In some embodiments, some of the functions of crawler 108 may be performed by other, separate components.
While the system depicted in FIG. 1 is a search appliance, the claimed invention could be practiced in a variety of information retrieval contexts. For example, intranet search engines, Internet search engines, and intrasite search engines may all replace the system of FIG. 1 or operate in conjunction with the system of FIG. 1 .
The records shown contain, for each URL (202), the time the URL was crawled (204) and a checksum (206) of the document located at the URL at the time it was crawled. URL 202 is represented here and throughout as a URL for purposes of clarity. In some embodiments, URL 202 may be a URL fingerprint, a document ID, or some other fingerprint or pointer to a URL, rather than a URL itself. Similarly, the time crawled may be stored in a variety of ways and is represented here in date/time format. The document checksum may be created in a variety of ways, such as by using one of several different hash functions, and/or may employ the HTTP If-Modified-Since header field.
In some cases, a page may change more frequently than its estimated change rate. This can occur, for example, if a page changes every day, but is only crawled every seven days. If a page has changed every time it is crawled, the search appliance may erroneously believe that the crawler is crawling the page at precisely the correct frequency, and not that the page has changed several times between crawls. To help remedy this, at 404, a crawl period is set, based on the change period. In this embodiment, the crawl period is set to half of the change period. For example, while URL 310 is estimated to change every two days, the crawl period of URL 310 is one day. In other embodiments, other relations are used as appropriate. In some embodiments, crawl periods are “bucketized” into groups such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
At 406, it is determined whether the crawl period of the URL, such as URL 310, exceeds a threshold that is set for the importance rank of the page (hereinafter the “importance crawl period”). Use of an importance rank may be especially helpful when a search appliance is faced with the daunting task of recrawling millions of pages. Pages that are more important should generally be crawled more frequently than pages that are less important, even if some of the important pages may change less frequently than some of the less important pages.
For example, URL 310 has an importance rank of 9, indicating that it is a very important page. The importance crawl period for a URL having an importance rank of 9 may be 4 days, where the importance crawl period for a URL having an importance rank of 1, such as URL 326, may be 4 months. Using URL 310 as an example, at 406 it is determined that the crawl period for URL 310 (1 day) is less than its importance crawl period (4 days for a document having an importance rank of 9), thus no change is necessary. If URL 310's change period had been larger, such as 20 days, and its crawl period had thus been 10 days, then at 408 URL 310's crawl period would be set to the maximum importance crawl period, 4 days.
At 410, the URL is compared against a list of “hints.” In this example, hints are defined by an administrator and take the form of “begins <string>” such as “begins www.google.com/important” or “ends <string>” such as “ends .doc,” or they could be represented other ways, such as by use of regular expressions. In this example, there are two sets of hints, minimum hints and maximum hints. Similar to the importance crawl period, hints provide overriding crawl periods for documents that match them. If a URL does not match a hint, or if it matches a hint, but its crawl period is within the threshold of the hint, the process ends at 416.
If a URL matches a minimum hint and its crawl period is shorter than the value specified for the minimum, its crawl period is set to the value specified for the hint (412). For example, if a URL has a crawl period of 5 days, but matches a hint that specifies a minimum of 20 days, at 412, the URL's crawl period will be set to 20 days. A mailing list archive is one example of when a minimum hint may be used. In that case, an administrator knows that the document may not change for months. While the crawler may eventually determine this, without the aid of a hint, it may waste a great deal of time recrawling the archive before reaching this conclusion. Similarly, the archive may have a very high importance value which could skew the crawler to needlessly recrawl it frequently if a hint were not employed. Hints may also be employed on pages that are automatically generated and/or contain dynamically generated elements that result in the page having a different checksum every time it is crawled. Without a minimum, an unimportant page with a clock may be erroneously crawled faster and faster to an absurd level such as “crawl once every 3 seconds.” A global minimum can also be imposed on all pages, such as “once an hour” to help prevent this scenario.
If a URL matches a maximum hint and its crawl period is longer than the value specified for the maximum, its crawl period is set to the value specified for the hint (414). For example, if a URL has a crawl period of 5 days, but matches a hint that specifies a maximum of 1 day, at 414, the URL's crawl period will be set to 1 day. A company directory is one example of when a maximum hint may be used. While the page may change only infrequently, when it does change, it may be desirable for the changes to be crawled promptly, and thus, the page should be crawled every day. Corporate handbooks provide a similar example. Maximum hints can also be used to help promptly crawl pages which are known, for example by an administrator, to change frequently. For example, without a hint, if the search engine is faced with the prospect of crawling several million pages, it may take the crawler a long time to determine that a particular page changes every 12 hours.
In some embodiments, rather than having minimum and maximum hints, ranges of hints may be implemented, such as “crawl these pages every day,” “crawl these pages once a week,” and “crawl these pages every three months.” In some embodiments, if a pattern is matched, rather than defaulting to a minimum or maximum value, the crawl period for a URL can be set to specific time (crawl on Mar. 3rd at 14:23), or could be based on other factors, such as PageRank.
If both a maximum and a minimum hint are matched, in this example, the URL is treated as having matched a maximum hint. This errs on the side of crawling the URL more frequently. In other embodiments, if both maximum and minimum hints are matched, it may be proper to err on the side of crawling the URL less frequently.
Once a crawl period has been selected and any modifications to the crawl period have been made, a crawl schedule can be created as described in further detail below.
If there are no past due items, crawl manager 102 waits, for example, for a specified amount of time, and begins the process at 602 again. This typically occurs when the URLs aren't changing very quickly, aren't very important, or were crawled sufficiently recently that little benefit is gained by crawling them again so soon.
In some embodiments, at 606, crawl manager 102 waits for an event, such as a command from an administrator to check the schedule, or for the system to reach a particular state, such as a load of a particular value. In some embodiments, if there are no past due items, rather than waiting, crawl manager may look for items with due dates in the near future, such as “crawl in 5 minutes” and treat them as ready to crawl items. In some embodiments, rather than waiting, crawl manager 102 may attempt to avoid future bottlenecks by determining whether a large number of items will become due within a short amount of time, and treating them as ready to crawl items. In some embodiments, if there are no past due items, crawl manager 102 may select random URLs to crawl, or may crawl important pages.
At 610, the ready to crawl list is optionally sorted. Typically, the list may be sorted in chronological order. Thus, the most overdue items will be recrawled before less overdue items. Depending on factors such as how large the past due list is, how overdue the oldest items on the list are, server load, network conditions, and so on, it may be desirable to sort the past due list in an alternate crawl order. Typically, if a page has a crawl period lower than the amount of time that crawler 108 behind, the page will be crawled at crawler 108's amount of tardiness. For example, if a page changes every hour, and crawler 108 is eight hours behind, crawler 108 will attempt to crawl the page every eight hours, rather than every hour until crawler 108 is back on schedule. In some embodiments, crawl manager 102 has different measures of how far behind it is, and which sort order is used depends on which level of tardiness has been reached.
In one example, when crawler 108 is only slightly behind, the list is sorted in chronological, due date order. For example, so long as crawler 108 is no more than three hours behind (the oldest item in the list was due no more than three hours ago), crawler 108 continues to crawl the items from most overdue to least overdue. When crawler 108 slips behind a threshold, for example, when crawler 108 is more than three hours behind, the ready to crawl list may be sorted at 610 by an alternate criterion, such as importance rank or PageRank. In this case a top fraction of pages is crawled and a bottom fraction of pages is ignored. For example, if sorted by PageRank, crawler 108 may crawl the top 80% rated documents, and discard the bottom 20% documents from its list.
Another alternate sorting method is to use a combination of importance rank and the due date. This combination may be implemented many ways as appropriate. One example for calculating in which order documents should be crawled in this sorting scheme is to multiply the importance rank of a URL by the number of minutes the URL is overdue for a crawl.
Another alternate sorting method is to use a combination of importance rank, due date, and change rate. For example, if crawler 108 is severely behind schedule, it may be desirable to focus on the documents that were crawled the longest ago, but change the most frequently, and are not unimportant pages.
Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, the invention is not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the invention. The disclosed embodiments are illustrative and not restrictive.
The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a composition of matter, a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. A component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task includes both a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. While the invention is described in conjunction with a search appliance, the invention may be embodied in a web search engine, such as Google.com, and in other information retrieval systems. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention.

Claims (12)
1. A method for determining a recrawl schedule of items on an intranet using a search appliance, the method comprising:
estimating, using a search appliance installed on an intranet, a change period for items on the intranet using a history of crawl information for the items, the change period for an item being a frequency of change in content of the item;
calculating, using the search appliance, a crawl period for each of the items, the crawl period for an item being set relative to the change period for the item;
determining, using the search appliance, whether to adjust the calculated crawl period for each of the items using adjustment criteria, wherein the adjustment criteria includes a combination of an importance rank for an item and a list of hints, wherein the list of hints provides crawl periods for items that include information that match a hint from the list of hints;
adjusting the calculated crawl period for selected items determined for adjustment using the adjustment criteria including when the selected items include information that matches a hint from the list of hints and the calculated crawl period for the selected items exceeds a threshold for the crawl period associated with the hint; and
creating, using the search appliance, a recrawl schedule of the items on the intranet using a recrawl time for each of the items, the recrawl time for each of the items being based on a last crawl time and either the calculated crawl period for the item or the adjusted crawl period for the item.
2. The method as in claim 1 wherein an item includes a document.
3. The method as in claim 1 further comprising optionally sorting the recrawl schedule.
4. The method as in claim 3 wherein sorting the recrawl schedule includes sorting the recrawl schedule such that more overdue items are recrawled before less overdue items.
5. A system for determining a recrawl schedule of items on an intranet, comprising:
one or more processors installed in a search appliance on an intranet, the one or more processors being configured to:
estimate a change period for items on the intranet using a history of crawl information for the items, the change period for an item being a frequency of change in content of the item;
calculate a crawl period for each of the items, the crawl period for an item being set relative to the change period for the item;
determine whether to adjust the calculated crawl period for each of the items using adjustment criteria, wherein the adjustment criteria includes a combination of an importance rank for an item and a list of hints, wherein the list of hints provides crawl periods for items that include information that match a hint from the list of hints;
adjust the calculated crawl period for selected items determined for adjustment using the adjustment criteria, including when the selected items include information that matches a hint from the list of hints and the calculated crawl period for the selected items exceeds a threshold for the crawl period associated with the hint; and
create a recrawl schedule of the items on the intranet using a recrawl time for each of the items, the recrawl time for each of the items being based on a last crawl time and either the calculated crawl period for the item or the adjusted crawl period for the item.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein an item includes a document.
7. The system of claim 5 wherein the one or more processors are configured to optionally sort the recrawl schedule.
8. The system of claim 7 wherein the one or more processors are configured to sort the recrawl schedule such that more overdue items are recrawled before less overdue items.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage device comprising instructions for determining a recrawl schedule of items on an intranet that, when executed, cause one or more processors installed on a search appliance to perform the actions of:
estimating, using a search appliance installed on an intranet, a change period for items on the intranet using a history of crawl information for the items, the change period for an item being a frequency of change in content of the item;
calculating, using the search appliance, a crawl period for each of the items, the crawl period for an item being set relative to the change period for the item;
determining, using the search appliance, whether to adjust the calculated crawl period for each of the items using adjustment criteria, wherein the adjustment criteria includes a combination of an importance rank for an item and a list of hints, wherein the list of hints provides crawl periods for items that include information that match a hint from the list of hints;
adjusting the calculated crawl period for selected items determined for adjustment using the adjustment criteria, including when the selected items include information that matches a hint from the list of hints and the calculated crawl period for the selected items exceeds a threshold for the crawl period associated with the hint; and
creating, using the search appliance, a recrawl schedule of the items on the intranet using a recrawl time for each of the items, the recrawl time for each of the items being based on a last crawl time and either the calculated crawl period for the item or the adjusted crawl period for the item.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9 wherein an item includes a document.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9 further comprising instructions that, when executed, cause the one or more processors to perform the action of optionally sorting the recrawl schedule.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 11 wherein sorting the recrawl schedule includes sorting the recrawl schedule such that more overdue items are recrawled before less overdue items.
