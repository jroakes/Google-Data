Definitions
- the present disclosure is directed to electronic devices and methods for controlling electronic devices with both touch screens and touch pads.
- Modern electronic devices include increasing functionality as technologies converge on single platforms. For example, computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, music players, video players, televisions, and network technology are being encompassed on a single device. These devices are being built smaller and smaller, and they may incorporate multiple input mechanisms such as one or more keys and a touch-screen as well as proximity and image-based input components.
- Some electronic devices use touch screen displays for displaying information and for various input functions, including entering data, manipulating icons and images, navigating windows and images, and the like.
- touch screen displays For displaying information and for various input functions, including entering data, manipulating icons and images, navigating windows and images, and the like.
- some devices add more touch-sensitive components to simplify and enhance a user's experience such as joysticks, touchpads, and other touch-sensitive surfaces.
- some of these input components may be confusing or inconvenient for a person to use and, instead of creating a better user experience, lead to erroneous (false) inputs and cause user frustration.

- exemplary embodiments disclosed herein provide an electronic device and a method for controlling the electronic device that includes both a touch screen display and a touch pad.
- the user may perform various functions based on inputs at the touch screen display and/or the touch pad depending on the mode of the device. For example, in a default touch pad mode, the user may scroll or page through images displayed on the touch screen display based on inputs via the touch pad.
- a rear or side touch pad offers an unobstructed view of a front touch screen display, typically the functionality of a rear touch pad is limited in the default mode because rear touch interaction can often be inadvertent or inaccurate—especially with handheld devices.
- the device Upon detection of a first predetermined user input, the device activates a navigation touch pad mode in which the user may trigger a number of additional functions via the rear touch pad, including positioning a pointer icon on a static image, selecting a portion of the static image, positioning a cursor for editing, panning the image, and/or zooming on the image.
- a second predetermined user input such as any touch input on the front touch screen display or a predetermined touch input on the rear touch pad, cancels the navigation mode such that the device returns to the default touch pad mode.
- Another example of a second predetermined user input may be the completion of the intended navigation mode task, such as a selection of a displayed hyperlink or a completed entry of information, from either the front touch screen or from the rear touch pad.
- Input inactivity for a predetermined period of time may also cancel the navigation mode to avoid user confusion about the current mode of the device after a delay in use.
- exemplary embodiments described below increase the utility of a rear touch pad while reducing inadvertent inputs caused by unintentional contact on the rear of the device.
- a pointer icon may appear on the front display screen depicting the functional position of the user interaction on the rear touch pad. This provides more intuitive control of the device via the rear touch pad, particularly when the touch pad is implemented to have relative opposite directions of the gestures and displayed interactions, and because the user's finger otherwise cannot be directly viewed underneath the device.

- the display element 126 may include a liquid crystal display (LCD) or other suitable device to display information or an image to the user to support the functions discussed herein. As also shown in FIG.
- the rear touch pad 142 may optionally include a display element 146 to display information or an image for the user.
- the display element 146 may display an indication about the current mode of the device 100 , such as an icon or a particular color of light emitting diode (LED).
- the device 100 further includes a controller 300 coupled to the front touch screen display 122 and the rear touch pad 142 .
- the controller 300 is implemented as a processor, computer, integrated circuit, or the like controlled by software or firmware.
- the controller 300 includes an input detection module 310 to obtain and interpret location and force information from the front touch screen display 122 and rear touch pad 142 .
- a function module 312 of the controller 300 evaluates the input and implements the appropriate functions in accordance with the input, including directing display signals to the display element 126 , haptic signals to a vibration component (not shown), and/or audio signals to an audio speaker 302 .
- the function module 312 may control the operation of the device in a default mode or a navigation mode based on the inputs received on the front touch screen display 122 and the rear touch pad 142 .
- a memory 306 coupled to the controller 300 , stores software programs for performing the functions described herein, including operation of the device 100 , an operating system, various application programs, and data files.

- FIG. 4 is an exemplary flow diagram 400 illustrating a method of operating of the device 100 according to an exemplary embodiment.
- the device 100 operates in a first or default mode in which the controller 300 controls the device 100 based on the user inputs on the front touch screen display 122 .
- any function of the device 100 may be controlled by inputs on the front touch screen display 122 , including navigating, selecting, scrolling, and the like.
- the controller 300 may also enable limited control of the device 100 based on inputs at the rear touch pad 142 .
- the rear touch pad 142 is typically used for scrolling.
- the inputs may be formed from any type of gesture or combination of gestures, including single- and multi-finger glides and taps.
- the inputs received on the rear touch pad 142 may be categorized as first, second, third, fourth, and fifth inputs that respectively result in different functions.
- any gesture or input mapping scheme may be provided for a desired function.
- a single-finger glide corresponds to the first input; a single-finger extended glide corresponds to the second input; a double-finger glide corresponds to the third input; a tap corresponds to the fourth input; and a double tap corresponds to the fifth input.
- An “extended glide” is a touch gesture that contacts a perimeter of the touch-sensitive surface and stays in contact with the perimeter for at least a set period of time. A non-extended glide does not stay in contact with the perimeter of the touch-sensitive surface for the predetermined period of time.
- substeps 411 , 412 , 413 , 414 , and 415 the functionality of the rear touch pad 142 is limited. Particularly, only the second input (e.g., a single-finger extended glide) in substep 412 results in the performance of a function (e.g., scrolling or paging) on the device 100 . The remaining inputs in substeps 411 , 413 , 414 , and 415 are generally ignored by the controller 300 .
- additional or alternate gestures may be defined.
- the controller 300 may distinguish between a double-fingered tap (a tap using two fingers) and a double tap (two sequential taps presumably using one finger). Also, while this example ignores four of the five defined gestures, other implementations may define different numbers of gestures and/or direct fewer gestures to be ignored.
- FIGS. 5-7 illustrate operation of the device 100 , and particularly a user's interaction through the rear touch pad 142 , in the default touch pad mode.
- FIG. 5 is a view of the front side of the device 100 displaying a list of contacts on the front touch screen display 122 .
- FIG. 6 is a view of the rear side of the device 100 being held by a user. The user may manipulate the rear touch pad 142 to scroll up and down the contacts list. For example, when the user glides a finger on the rear touch pad 142 in the direction of the depicted arrow (in a negative y-axis direction), the list of contacts scrolls in the upwards direction (in a positive y-axis direction).
- FIG. 5 is a view of the front side of the device 100 displaying a list of contacts on the front touch screen display 122 .
- FIG. 6 is a view of the rear side of the device 100 being held by a user. The user may manipulate the rear touch pad 142 to scroll up and down the contacts list.
- FIG. 7 is a view of the front side of the device 100 that illustrates the results of the user input of FIG. 6 .
- the controller 300 recognizes the second input in substep 412 and scrolls the displayed image accordingly. In this example, the controller scrolls the image within the single, active application shown.
- Other embodiments may use the same gesture (e.g., an extended glide) or a different gesture (e.g., a two-fingered extended glide) to page between images within a single, active application (e.g., an electronic book application or a photo gallery application) or use a different gesture (e.g., a three-finger extended glide) to switch between active applications.
- the rear touch pad 142 is typically used for scrolling or paging functions on the images displayed on the front touch screen display 122 , although any function may be provided. Note that, in this implementation, a downward glide (in the negative y-axis direction) on the touch pad 142 results in an upward scroll (in the positive y-axis direction) of the image on the front touch screen display 122 . An alternate implementation could be to have a downward glide on the touch pad result in a downward scroll on the front touch screen.
- glides on the rear touch pad in other directions may direct scrolling of the image(s) on the front touch screen display.
- a glide to the left in the negative x-axis direction
- a glide to the right in the positive x-axis direction
- a glide to the right in the positive x-axis direction
- a glide to the right in the positive x-axis direction
- Diagonal glides may pan the image across the touch screen display, and other types of gestures may direct yet other functions as dictated by the application.
- the device 100 monitors inputs received from the user for a first predetermined input.
- the first predetermined input may be any suitable input, such as a “figure 8” input on the front touch screen display 122 or the rear touch pad 142 , a double tap input on the rear touch pad, or a press-and-hold input on the rear touch pad 142 that indicates a user intention to modify the operating mode.
- the first predetermined input may also be an icon-press on the front touch screen display 122 , a press of a hard key on the device, or an accelerometer detected motion (e.g., a tilt or shake). If the first predetermined input is not received, the flow diagram 400 returns to step 410 and the device 100 continues to operate in the default mode.
- the flow diagram 400 proceeds to step 430 and the device 100 operates in a second touch pad mode, particularly in a navigation touch pad mode.
- the navigation mode may provide a different group of functions for the rear touch pad 142 relative to the default touch pad mode.
- a specific pointer icon may be displayed on the front touch screen display 122 when the device 100 is in the navigation mode to provide a visual indication to the user of activation of the navigation mode and a reference for subsequent inputs.
- the pointer icon is initially positioned at the center of the front touch screen display 122 .
- the pointer icon may be, for example, a static image such as a translucent disk or pointer or an animated image such as a blinking, rotating, or color-changing graphic.
- the pointer icon is different from other pointer icons that may be displayed while the device is in the default touch pad mode.
- another type of icon e.g., a green LED
- step 450 the device 100 monitors the inputs on the front touch screen display 122 and the rear touch pad 142 . If the device 100 detects a second predetermined touch input on the front touch screen display 122 or the rear touch pad 142 , the navigation mode is canceled and the flow diagram 400 returns to step 410 to operate in the default mode.
- any touch input on the front touch screen display 122 may form the second predetermined touch input.
- This touch on the front touch screen display 122 may be intentional (e.g., touching a displayed icon to launch an application) or inadvertent (e.g., touching an inactive area of the front touch screen). In the either of these cases, the touch on the front touch screen display 122 is also a cancellation input.
- Another example of the second predetermined touch input may be a specific cancellation gesture such as another “figure 8” or double tap on the rear touch pad 142 .
- the navigation mode is canceled in step 450 and the flow diagram 400 returns to step 410 .
- the predetermined period of inactivity may be, for example, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or any suitable preset, user-selectable, or user-adjustable time period.
- the special pointer icon on the rear touch pad 142 or front touch screen display 122 may be removed or changed.
- step 460 provides examples of five functions for the rear touch pad 142 in parallel substeps 461 , 462 , 463 , 464 , and 465 that provide a contrast to similar inputs in substeps 411 , 412 , 413 , 414 , and 415 .
- substeps 461 , 462 , 463 , 464 , and 465 enable navigation of images on the front touch screen display 122 via the rear touch pad 142 , e.g., without obscuring the image on the front touch screen display 122 .
- Substeps 461 , 462 , 463 , 464 , and 465 are merely examples of functions in the navigation mode. Not all of the functions depicted in FIG. 4 may be provided, and additional functions may be enabled (via the described or different touch gestures), depending on user preference or software application.
- a finger glide corresponds to the first input; a single-finger extended glide corresponds to the second input; a double-finger glide corresponds to the third input; a tap corresponds to the fourth input; and a double tap corresponds to the fifth input.
- a first type of touch input e.g., a finger glide or movement
- a second type of touch input e.g., an extended single-finger glide
- the rear touch pad 142 functions to pan the image displayed on the front touch screen display 122 .
- the panning functions to scroll the image displayed on the front touch screen display 122 at a reduced rate relative to the scrolling in the default mode of substep 412 .
- panning may move the image on the front touch screen display 122 at a rate of 1:2 or 1:3, as examples, relative to similar touch inputs in the default touch pad mode.
- a third type of touch input e.g., a double-finger glide
- a fourth type of touch input e.g., a tap
- a fifth type of touch input functions to select or execute (e.g., launch) a portion of an image displayed on the front touch screen display 122 .
- this input may select a hyperlink or execute an application when the pointer icon is positioned in the appropriate location on the image.
- Other types of input may include combination of inputs such as a “hold and glide” to direct drag-and-drop functionality to manipulate displayed icons or objects or such as an “extended press” that initiates a menu or dialog box.
- any type of functionality in the navigation mode may be provided, although the functionality is typically different from the functionality triggered by similar inputs in the default mode, as shown by a comparison between steps 410 and 460 .
- the separate touch pad modes enable an improved experience for the user.
- the rear touch pad 142 has limited functionality which reduces the risk that inadvertent user touches may lead to unintended results yet allows the user to have freedom of movement within or between applications.
- additional functions are provided through the rear touch pad 142 based on multiple types of inputs that may be used to enhance the precision with which the user controls the device 100 . In this example, the precision is enhanced by limiting the scope of the user's rear touch pad interaction during the navigation mode to an image that is fully or partially displayed within a single application.
- step 470 the device 100 determines if the intended task in the navigation mode is complete. This determination may depend on the current application on the front touch screen display 122 or user preference. For example, during step 460 (e.g., substep 461 ), the user may position the icon displayed/shown on the front touch screen display 122 . However, considering that the user typically positions the icon for a particular purpose, it may be assumed that this input does not complete the intended task of the user. In such a situation, the flow diagram 400 would return to step 450 and the device 100 would continue to monitor touch inputs in the navigation mode.
- substep 465 the user selects a portion of the image to execute a hyperlink. It may be assumed that the task of the user is completed with the selection and the flow diagram 400 returns to step 410 such that the device 100 further operates in the default mode.
- determinations of when tasks are complete include: when text entry is complete as determined by the selection of an “enter” or “submit” function using a physical button, a front touch screen gesture, or a rear touch pad gesture (e.g., a fifth input per substep 465 ), when an application is launched as determined by a physical button, a front touch screen gesture, or a rear touch pad gesture (e.g., a fifth input per substep 465 ), or when a “cancel” function is invoked using a physical button.
- An additional example of one suitable implementation is provided below.
- FIGS. 8-11 illustrate schematic representations of the front touch screen display 122 and the rear touch pad 142 during activation of the navigation mode and operation of the navigation mode (e.g., steps 410 , 420 , 430 , 440 , 450 , 460 , and 470 of flow diagram 400 ).
- FIG. 8 illustrates the front touch screen display 122 displaying a website or electronic newspaper.
- inputs on the rear touch pad 142 scroll the displayed view up and down and side to side as also shown in FIGS. 5-7 .
- the user provides the first predetermined input on the rear touch pad 142 , depicted as a “figure 8” in FIG.
- FIG. 9 illustrates the front touch screen display 122 in the navigation mode and particularly illustrates the icon 900 that indicates activation of the navigation mode (in response to the gesture on the rear touch pad 142 ) and also serves as a reference point for subsequent inputs (e.g., as in steps 430 , 440 , and 440 ).
- the icon 900 hovers over a selectable portion of the image the portion may change in appearance.
- a hyperlink is highlighted when the icon 900 hovers over the hyperlink.
- the highlighting may include one or more of color effects, outlining, haptic effects, sound effects, text effects, and changes to the icon 900 , such as changing the icon 900 into a pointer or changing the icon's color.
- FIG. 9 the user may provide the first type of input to the rear touch pad 142 to position the icon 900 .
- a glide downward in the negative y-axis direction
- the icon causes the icon to move up (in the positive y-axis direction) within the stable image displayed.
