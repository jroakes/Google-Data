- the dispatching program may analyze the entered information 420 and break it into discrete parts such as “John,” “Doe,” “View,” and “Mountain,” as well as groups of discrete parts such as “John Doe,” “Mountain View,” etc.
- the dispatching program may associate each discrete part and/or groups of discrete parts (parts) with one or more input fields. In this regard, for each part the dispatching program may compare the part to the data types associated with the input fields. Upon determining the part satisfies a data type of an input field, the part may be dispatched to the satisfied input field. For example, the dispatching program may compare two parts of the entered information, such as “1234567890123456” and “64043” against the data types of the input fields 310 - 326 . The dispatching program may determine the “CC #” and “CCV” input fields, 322 and 326 , may only accept numeric data of sixteen digits and three digits, respectively.
- the dispatching program may then determine the “CC #” input field 322 and “CCV” input field 326 are satisfied by parts “1234567890123456” and “64043,” respectively.
- the parts “1234567890123456” and “64043” may then be dispatched to the “CC #” input field 322 and “CCV” input field 326 , respectively.
- Each dispatched part may be used to populate the respective input field to which it was dispatched. For example, as shown in FIG. 5 , the dispatching program may populate the “CC #” input field 322 and “CCV” input field 326 with dispatched parts “1234567890123456” and “64043,” respectively.
- more than one part may be dispatched to an input field.
- the “Name” input field 310 may only accept alphabetic data types.
- the entered information 420 may include two or more alphabetic parts, such as “John” and “Doe.” As such, the two or more alphabetic parts of the entered information 420 may be dispatched to the “Name” input field 310 .
- External or internal sources of supplemental data may be used to assist in dispatching the parts to their respective input fields.
- the dispatching program may rely on sub-databases of data, such as historical data, mapping data, address books, contacts data, name directories, etc.
- sub-databases may be stored remotely or internally to the device running the dispatching program.
- the dispatching program may determine that parts “John” and “Doe,” when taken in combination is found in an address book sub-database associated with the user.
- the dispatching program may dispatch “John Doe” to the “Name” input field 310 , as shown in FIG. 5 .
- the dispatching program may determine that “Amphitheatre Parkway” is not a name in the address book sub-database, and therefore the dispatching program may determine that “Amphitheatre Parkway” does not satisfy the “Name” input field.
- Completion services may also be used to assist in dispatching the parts to their respective input fields. Completion services may analyze the entered information and return possible completion values for each input field. In this regard, each completion service may provide possible completion values for specific types of input fields. For example, as shown in FIG. 6 , when the user navigates to website 600 , an input box 610 may be presented. The input box 610 may provide instructions to enter payment information. The user may enter information 630 , which includes “my credit card,” into the input box 610 . The dispatching program may then determine that the entered information 630 corresponds to payment information, and subsequently send the entered information to a credit card completion service. In some embodiments the dispatching program may send all entered information to one or more completion services, regardless of the type of data which is entered.
- the completion service may receive the information provided by the dispatching program, and determine whether possible completion values are available based on the received data.
- the credit card completion service may determine that the entered information 630 “my credit card,” corresponds to the user's bank credit card, and may then retrieve the user's bank credit card information for use as possible completion values.
- the credit cart completion service may then forward the user's bank credit card information to the dispatching program.
- the dispatching program may then populate the fields 722 - 726 , associated with the payment information section 710 , with the received bank credit card information.
- the completion services can be global or local, and access private public or private data.
- the completion services can be implemented on the computing device or at an external location, such as server 110 .
- the data provided by the completion services can be private data, such as a user's credit card information, or public data, such as a street address of a business. User permission may be required for the dispatching program or completion service to access the private data.
- a user's private home address may be stored locally in a private address book sub-database.
- the dispatching program may query a local completion service, such as an auto-completion service on the computing device.
- the auto-completion service may accesses the private address book sub-database.
- the local address completion service may determine that part “1600” matches part of an address in the address book sub-database.
- the matching address may be forwarded to the dispatching program as a possible completion values, and populated into the input fields associated with the address (e.g., input fields 310 - 320 .) If the user fails to provide permission to access private data, the dispatching program would not access the local completion services, such as the auto-completion service.
- the dispatching program may query a global mapping completion service, such as Google Maps which serves public data.
- the mapping completion service may access public address data, and determine possible completion values by determining which public addresses adequately match the “1600” part.
- the global mapping completion may then forward the matching addresses to the dispatching program for populating the input fields.
- a large number of results are determined by one of the completion services, only the most relevant results, as described herein, may be forwarded to the dispatching program.
- the possible completion values may be updated by the completion services. For example, referring back to FIG. 4 , when the user enters the numeral ‘1,’ the dispatching program may dispatch the ‘1’ as a discrete part to an address completion service and a payment completion service. Each completion service may provide possible completion values based on the ‘1’ to the dispatching program. As the user continues to enter the numeral ‘6,’ the dispatching program may dispatch the ‘16,’ as a discrete part to both completion services.
- the address completion service may determine that ‘16’ corresponds to 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, and will update the possible completion value previously sent to the dispatching program.
- the payment completion service may determine that no possible payment completion values include ‘16,’ and will return no possible completion values to the dispatching program.
- Each association of a part to an input field may limit the association of the other parts to input fields.
- the dispatching program may determine one or more parts which each satisfy a respective input field and, based on these one or more parts, the association of the remaining parts may be limited. For example, referring again to FIG. 5 , the dispatching program may determine that part “64043” satisfies the “Zip:” input field 320 . As such, the dispatching program may use mapping data, as found in the mapping sub-database or a completion service, to determine that there is no street, city, or state named “John Doe” in the 64043 zip code.
- “John Doe” may not be associated with the “Address Line 1” 312 “City” 316 or “State” 318 input fields.
- the dispatching program may determine that “Mount View” and “Amphitheater Parkway” are streets in the 64043 zip code, and dispatch both to the “Address Line 1” input field 312 .
- the dispatching program may compare the entered information to previously entered information to increase the likelihood of correctly populating the input fields. For example, if a user has previously filled out a text box on a website order form, the previously entered information and its association to the populated input fields may be stored by the dispatching program. When the dispatching program determines the entered information matches the previously entered information, the input fields may be populated by the entered information based on the previously entered information and its association to the populated input fields.
- An input field may be populated by multiple parts allowing the user to select the correct part.
- the dispatching program may rank the two or more parts according to relevancy based on predetermined criteria.
- predetermined criteria may include determining which part was most recently used in the input field or which part matches the previously entered information. For example, as shown in FIG. 8 , the highest ranked parts 815 and 825 may be presented as the top selection in drop down lists, 810 and 820 , respectively. The user may then select between the two parts, with the highest ranking part displayed first in the input field.
- other display elements may be used to enable the user to select between the two parts, such as dialog boxes or radio buttons.
- relevancy of a part may be based on public or private data of the completion services or the dispatching program. In this regard, based on the settings of the dispatching program, the relevancy of all of available data determined by analyzing the global or local frequency or importance of a word or phrase in the parts.
- a part may contain the name of a large city and small village.
- the completion service may determine that the large city is a priori more likely to appear in a location input field than the name of a small village. As such, the completion service may forward instructions to the dispatching program to display the large city first.
- a completion service may determine that the large city is less likely to appear in the location input field based on the other user's queries at a certain location, and therefore forward instructions to the dispatching program to display the small village first.
- the dispatching program may supplement the information entered into the input box.
- the information entered into the input box may be missing information requested by one or more input fields.
- the dispatching program may determine the missing information requested by the one or more input fields based on the parts of the entered information which are associated with other input fields. For example, the dispatching program may determine that none of the parts satisfy the “State” input field. However, the dispatching program may determine from mapping data that zip code “64043” is located in California, and automatically populate the “State” input field 318 with “CA,” as shown in FIG. 5 .
- the entered information may be parsed and dispatched incrementally and in substantially real-time. For instance, as the user enters “12,” the entered information may be parsed after the entry of each character, such as after the ‘1’ is entered and after the ‘2’ is entered. Each time the entered information is parsed, the parts may be dispatched and populated in one or more input fields, such as to the “Exp” input field 324 and the “CC #” input field 322 . As such, the “Exp” and CC #” fields may display ‘1’ after the user enters the ‘1’ and ‘12’ after the user enters the ‘2’. The user may select one of the displayed entries as correct, and the other unselected entry may be removed.
- the one or more parts may be ignored, or presented to the user for correction. Further, if certain information requested by the input fields is not entered, additional text boxes may be presented requesting the information and/or the input field associated with the missing information may be left empty.
- Flow diagram 900 of FIG. 9 is an example flow diagram of some of the aspects described above that may be performed by one or more computing devices such as client computing devices 120 or 130 . It will be understood that the steps discussed herein are merely an example; the steps may occur in a different order, steps may be added, and steps may be omitted.
- a first location such as a webpage
- an associated data type for each input field in the set of input fields may be determined, and the computing device may generate and display a text box including instructions requesting entry of user data based on the associated types of each input field, as shown at block 905 .
- the computing device may then receive the entered user information in the text box and parse the entered information into one or more parts, as shown in blocks 907 and 909 . As shown at blocks 911 and 913 , the computing device may compare each of the one or more parts to the associate data type for each input field and associate each of the one or more parts with the input field corresponding to the associated data type which it satisfies. The computing device may then dispatch each of the one or more parts to the input field corresponding to the associated data type which the respective one or more part satisfies, as shown in block 915 . Each input field may then be automatically populated with the one or more parts which were dispatched to the respective input field, as shown in block 917 .
