- a comment may be deemed abusive if it violates provider policies.
- a comment may be deemed abusive if the comment violates policies of the provider of the add-on application (e.g., toolbar 160 ) that allows users to create comments and to read other people's comments.
- a comment may be deemed abusive if the comment includes spam (i.e., unwanted promotional or commercial content, or posts that include keyword spamming); malware, viruses, or anything that may disrupt the comment service or harm a user's computing resources; hateful, threatening, harassing, or bullying content; content promoting unlawful or illegal activities; copyright infringement; sexually explicit material or content that serves to drive user traffic to sites that include sexually explicit material; impersonation of other users; or confidential or private information of other users.
- spam i.e., unwanted promotional or commercial content, or posts that include keyword spamming
- malware viruses, or anything that may disrupt the comment service or harm a user's computing resources
- hateful, threatening, harassing, or bullying content content promoting unlawful or illegal activities
- copyright infringement sexually explicit material or content that serves to drive user traffic to sites that include sexually explicit material
- impersonation of other users or confidential or private information of other users.
- Some types of abusive content may be automatically detected. For example, some types of spam or malware may be automatically detected using spam or malware detection algorithms, and may be automatically removed. However, other types of abusive content may be difficult to detect automatically, and comments server 130 may need to depend on users' reports of abusive content to identify such abusive content.
- the comment When a user reports an abusive comment, by clicking on report abuse button 132 , the comment may be flagged as abusive and marked for manual review. An administrator may need to review the reported comment to determine whether the abuse report is valid, indicating that the reported comment violates provider policy. However, relying on manual review of abuse reports may be an expensive and slow process that depends on available human resources. Another option may include configuring the system so that when a particular number of different users (e.g., 3 users) report a comment as abusive, the comment may be automatically taken down until the comment is reviewed by a human operator. However, in this case, three colluding users may conspire to take down undesirable, yet legitimate, content. Furthermore, a well-meaning user may have a poor understanding of the provider policy and may report comments that the user deems abusive, yet that do not violate the provider policy.
- a well-meaning user may have a poor understanding of the provider policy and may report comments that the user deems abusive, yet that do not violate the provider policy.
- a trust score of a user may be based on the user's past track record. For example, the trust score of a user may be based on the difference between the number of valid reports and the number of invalid reports that the user has reported.
- a trust score of a user may be modified based on other scores associated with the user. For example, a user's trust score may be further based on an author score of the user, a rater score of the user, a publisher score of the user, or a certification of the user.
- An implementation described herein may respond to a report of abuse based on a trust score of the reporting user and may assign a removal score to the reported comment. If the removal score of a comment is less than or equal to a suspension threshold, the comment is placed in a queue for manual evaluation without removing the comment. If the removal score of a comment is greater than the suspension threshold and less than or equal to a removal threshold, the comment may be removed temporarily and placed in a queue for manual evaluation. If the removal score of a comment is greater than the removal threshold, the comment may be automatically and permanently removed, without subsequent manual evaluation. Furthermore, if a second user reports the same comment, the second user's trust score is used to modify the removal score of the comment. Thus, if multiple users with high trust scores report a particular abusive comment, the removal score of the reported abusive comment may rise above the removal threshold, and the reported abusive comment may be automatically removed.
- a trust score for a user and a removal score may be applied to other types of content.
- a particular implementation may relate to reviews written by users about businesses, reviews written by users about products, reviews written by users about applications for a mobile communication device, or web pages that violate a web page provider policy.

- FIG. 3 shows exemplary components of client device 110 , document hosting server 120 , comments server 130 , or abuse review server 240
- client device 110 , document hosting server 120 , comments server 130 , or abuse review server 240 may contain fewer components, different components, additional components, or differently arranged components than depicted in FIG. 3 .
- one or more components of client device 110 , document hosting server 120 , comments server 130 , or abuse review server 240 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of client device 110 , document hosting server 120 , comments server 130 , or abuse review server 240 .
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of exemplary functional components of abuse review server 240 .
- Abuse review server 240 may include an abuse report manager 410 , a user profile database 420 , a removal component 430 , an abuse report review queue 440 , and a manual review interface 450 .
- Abuse report manager 410 may receive an abuse report from client device 110 , reporting a particular comment as abusive, and may act on the received abuse report.
- Abuse report manager 410 may access user profile database 420 to retrieve information associated with the user. For example, abuse report manager 410 may retrieve a trust score associated with the user that originated the abuse report.
- Abuse report manager 410 may determine a removal score for the comment based on the retrieved trust score, and may determine how to act on the abuse report based on the determined removal score. If the removal score is less than or equal to a suspension threshold, abuse report manager 410 may create an abuse record for the comment and place the comment in abuse report review queue 440 without removing the comment from being available for presentation to users.
- abuse report manager 410 may label the comment for temporary removal and provide the comment to removal component 430 , and create an abuse record for the comment and place the comment in abuse report review queue 440 . If the removal score is greater than the removal threshold, abuse report manager 410 may label the comment for permanent removal and provide the comment to removal component 430 .
- Abuse report manager 410 may also determine whether other abuse reports about the reported comment have been received. For example, abuse report manager 410 may access abuse report review queue 440 to determine whether an abuse record associated with the comment is in the queue. If an abuse record about the comment is in the queue, abuse report manager 410 may add the received abuse report to the abuse record and may adjust a removal score of the comment based on the retrieved trust score of the user. The adjusted removal score may be used by the abuse report manager 410 to reassess how to act on the comment. For example, the adjusted removal score may be greater than the removal threshold, and the abuse record may be removed from the queue, the comment may be labeled for permanent removal and provided to removal component 430 . Additionally, abuse report manager 410 may increase a user's trust score based on labeling a comment for permanent removal as a result of other user's reports.
- User profile database 420 may store information about users.
- user profile database 420 may store information associated with users that is used to determine how to act on an abuse report, such as a trust score of the user and other parameters that may affect the trust score, such as an author score of the user (e.g., based on ratings of comments, authored by the user, or a quantity of times comments, authored by the user, were accessed by other users), a rater score of the user (e.g., based on how often the user rates comments in the same way as a majority of users that rated the comment), a publisher score of the user (e.g., based on rank scores of documents associated with the user or how many times documents associated with the user were accessed by other users), or a certification of the user (e.g., an indication of the user's knowledge of policies associated with providing comments to users).
- an author score of the user e.g., based on ratings of comments, authored by the user, or a quantity of times comments, authored by the user,
- user profile database 420 may be associated with comments server 130 and may include other information, associated with a user, relating to comments, such as what languages the user understands, the user's interests, a geographic location associated with the user, etc.
- user profile database 420 may be associated with abuse review server 240 .
- information about a user, such a user's trust score may be stored locally, on client device 110 , such as in a memory structure associated with the browser add-on application (e.g., toolbar 160 ).
- Removal component 430 may remove comments. For example, removal component 430 may send an instruction to comments server 130 to remove a particular comment and, in response, comments server 130 may remove the particular comment from comments database 140 . Removal component 430 may remove comments permanently or temporarily. Removal component 430 may receive an abuse record from abuse report manager 410 . The abuse record may include an indication as to whether a comment is to be removed temporarily or permanently. If a comment is to be removed permanently, removal component 430 may send an instruction to comments server 130 to delete the comment, if abuse review server 240 is implemented separately from comments server 130 , or may delete the comment, if abuse review server 240 is implemented in comments server 130 .
- removal component 430 may send an instruction to comments server 130 to suspend providing the comment to client device 110 , until a decision is received from manual review interface 450 , if abuse review server 240 is implemented separately from comments server 130 , or may suspend the comment from being provided, until a decision is received from manual review interface 450 , if abuse review server 240 is implemented in comments server 130 .
- Abuse report review queue 440 may store abuse records associated with comments for which abuse reports have been received. Abuse report review queue 440 may provide the abuse records to manual review interface 450 for review, such as in the order in which the reports have been received.
- Manual review interface 460 may include an interface to review abuse reports associated with comments. Manual review interface 460 may receive input from human operators who review abuse reports and make decisions about whether particular comments should be removed. If manual review interface 460 receives input that a comment should be deleted, manual review interface 460 may provide this information to removal component 430 to delete the comment. If manual review interface 460 receives input that a comment should not be deleted, manual review interface 460 may provide this information to removal component 430 to restore the comment, if the comment has been removed temporarily.
- manual review interface 460 may adjust trust scores of all users that provided abuse reports about the comment. If the comment is to be removed, and thus the abuse reports are deemed valid, trusts scores of all users that provided abuse reports about the comment may be increased. If the comment is not to be removed, and thus the abuse reports are deemed invalid, trusts scores of all users that provided abuse reports about the comment may be decreased.
- FIG. 4 shows exemplary functional components of abuse review server 240
- abuse review server 240 may contain fewer functional components, different functional components, additional functional components, or differently arranged functional components than depicted in FIG. 4 . Additionally or alternatively, one or more components of abuse review server 240 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of abuse review server 240 .
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of exemplary data fields of a user profile record 500 that may be stored in user profile database 420 of FIG. 4 .
- User profile record 500 may include a user identification (ID) field 510 , an author score field 520 , a rater score field 530 , a publisher score field 540 , a certification field 550 , and a trust score field 560 .
- ID user identification
- User ID field 510 may store information that identifies a particular user. In one implementation, user ID field 510 may not include any information that may be used to determine a user's identify. For example, user ID field 510 may include a string that may be matched to a string, identifying a user, included in an abuse report received from client device 110 .
- Author score field 520 may store a score that measures a reputation of the user as an author.
- author score field 520 may store a score that measures the user's reputation as an author of comments.
- the author score may be based on ratings of the user's comments. For example, if another user rates a comment, written by the user, as useful, the user's author score may be increased. Additionally or alternatively, the author score may be based on a number of times other users have read the user's comments. In one implementation, this may be measured by a number of times that other users have clicked on “more” button 112 associated with the user's authored comments.
- the author score may be associated with a reputation of the user as an author of other content, such as, for example, a reputation of the user as a writer of product reviews, a writer of updates on a social web site, a blog web site, or a microblogging web site, or a writer of news articles.
- the author score associated with other content may be based on ratings of the user's authored content by other users and/or based on a number of times other users have accessed the user's authored content.
- the author score may be determined, for example, by comments server 130 .
- Rater score field 530 may store a score that measures a reputation of the user as a rater.
- rater score field 530 may store a score that measures the user's reputation as a rater of comments.
- a user may be considered to have a high reputation as a rater if the user tends to vote with the community.
- the rater score may be computed based on a percentage of time that the user's rating of a comment agrees with a majority of users that have rated the comment.
- a user's score as a rater may be decreased if the user tends to rate comments positively or negative a disproportionate percentage of time. Thus, if a user rates comments negatively more than a threshold percentage of times (e.g., four out of five times), the user's rater score may be decreased.
- the rater score may be determined, for example, by comments server 130 .
- Publisher score field 540 may store a score that measures a reputation of the user as a publisher of content.
- Content published by the user may or may not include content authored by the user.
- the publisher score may be based on web sites associated with the user. Thus, if a user writes a blog that is accessed by a large number of users (e.g., more than a threshold number of users per day), or if the user owns a web site that consistently ranks high in a search engine (e.g., has a rank score greater than a particular threshold), the user's publisher score may be increased.
- the publisher score may be determined, for example, by comments server 130 .
- Certification field 550 may store certifications obtained by the user that may be relevant to the user's knowledge of policy associated with comments. For example, a user may take a test to determine the user's knowledge of policy associated with abusive comments. If the user passes the test, it may demonstrate a good knowledge of policies regarding what is considered an abusive comment, and the user may be considered a trustworthy user. As another example, a user may be an administrator associated with toolbar 160 , or a user may be a designated manual reviewer of abuse reports. The certification may be determined, for example, by abuse review server 240 .
- Trust score field 560 may store a trust score that measures how trustworthy a user is considered by abuse review server 240 . The trust score may be based on a difference between a number of valid abuse reports that a user has submitted and a number of invalid abuse reports that the user has submitted. Trust score field 560 may store a trust score as well as the number of valid abuse reports and the number of invalid abuse reports that have been generated by the user. Storing the number of valid and invalid abuse reports may be necessary to adjust the trust score when future abuse reports are generated by the user. Additionally, a trust score of a user may be adjusted based on the information in user's author score field 520 , rater score field 530 , publisher score field 540 , and certification field 550 .

- FIG. 6 is a diagram of exemplary data fields of an abuse report record 600 that may be stored in abuse report review queue 440 of FIG. 4 .
- Abuse report record 600 may include a comment ID field 610 , one or more abuse report fields 620 , a removal score field 630 , and a removal status field 640 .
- Comment ID field 610 may store a string that uniquely identifies a particular comment.
- Abuse report record 600 may include one or more abuse report fields 620 .
- a new abuse report field 620 may be added to abuse report record 600 each time a new abuse report is received from a particular user for the comment identified in comment ID field 610 .
- Abuse report field 620 may include user ID field 622 , a time stamp field 624 , and trust score field 626 .
- User ID field 622 may store information that identifies a particular user. For example, user ID field 622 may store a string, identifying a particular user, which was received with an abuse report from client device 110 .
- Time stamp field 624 may store the date and/or time that an abuse report was generated. The date/time for time stamp field 624 may be generated by client 110 or may be generated by abuse review server 240 based on a date/time at which the abuse report was received.
- Trust score 626 may store a trust score which was retrieved from user profile record 500 associated with user ID field 622 .
- Removal score field 630 may store a removal score that may be used to determine whether the comment identified in comment ID field 610 should be removed. For example, if the score stored in removal score field 630 is greater than a particular threshold, the comment may be removed. The removal score may be adjusted each time a new abuse report is received, based on the trust score of the user who generated the abuse report.
- Removal status field 640 may store a status of the comment identified in comment ID field 610 .
- removal status field 640 may store information about whether a comment is labeled as active, temporarily removed, or permanently removed.
- a comment marked for permanent removal may be removed from abuse report review queue 440 and provided to removal component 430 for deletion.
- abuse report record 600 may contain fewer fields, different fields, additional fields, or differently arranged fields than depicted in FIG. 6 . Additionally or alternatively, one or more fields of abuse report record 600 may include information described as being included in one or more other fields of abuse report record 600 .
- FIG. 7A is a diagram of an exemplary trust function 700 for generating a trust score for a user.
- Trust function 700 may, for a particular user, take as input values for one or more of the depicted parameters and generate a trust score 760 .
- trust function 700 may be implemented by comments server 130 or by abuse review server 240 . In another implementation, trust function 700 may be implemented by the comments add-on application (e.g., toolbar 160 ) of client device 110 .
- Trust function 700 may include a track record input 710 associated with a user.
- Track record input 710 may include a difference between a number of abuse reports generated by a user that were deemed valid and a number of abuse reports generated by a user that were deemed invalid.
- a benefit of using the difference between the number of abuse reports generated by a user that were deemed valid and the number of abuse reports generated by a user that were deemed invalid as an input to trust function 700 may include identifying users that have demonstrated good judgment in identifying abusive comments.
- Trust function 700 may include an author score input 720 associated with a user.
- Author score input 720 may include an author score retrieved from author score field 520 of user profile 500 associated with a user.
- a benefit of using an author score as an input to trust function 700 may include identifying users that have developed a good reputation as authors. Users with a good reputation as authors may be more reliable members of the user community, and may thus be more trustworthy in identifying abusive comments.
- Trust function 700 may include a rater score input 730 associated with a user.
- Rater score input 730 may include a rater score retrieved from rater score field 530 of user profile 500 associated with a user.
- a benefit of using a rater score as an input to trust function 700 may include identifying users that have demonstrated a reputation as raters. Users with a good reputation as raters may be in tune with the mindset of the user community, and may thus be more trustworthy in identifying comments that may appear abusive to the user community.
- Trust function 700 may include a publisher score input 740 associated with a user.
- Publisher score input 740 may include a publisher score retrieved from publisher score field 540 of user profile 500 associated with a user.
- a benefit of using a publisher score as an input to trust function 700 may include identifying users that have developed a good reputation as publishers of content. Users with a good reputation as publishers of content may be more reliable members of the user community, and may thus be more trustworthy in identifying abusive comments.
- Trust function 700 may include a certification input 750 associated with a user.
- Certification input 750 may include an indication as to whether user profile 500 associated with a user includes a certification in certification field 550 .
- a benefit of using a certification as an input to trust function 700 may include identifying users that have demonstrated knowledge of policies regarding comments. Users with a certification may thus be relied upon to correctly identify comments that violate a policy.
- Inputs of trust function 700 may be combined to generate trust score 760 for a user.
- inputs of trust function 700 may be combined as a weighted sum.
- each of the inputs of trust function 700 may be multiplied by a weight and the results may be added to generate trust score 760 .
- track record input 710 may be given a greater weight than the other inputs, and thus trust score 760 may depend most significantly on track record input 710 .
- author score input 720 , rater score input 730 , and publisher score input 740 may not influence trust score 760 unless the values are greater than particular thresholds.
- an author score of a user may not influence the user's trust score 760 , unless the author score of the user is greater than a particular threshold, and/or lower than a particular threshold.
- trust function 700 may contain fewer inputs, different inputs, or additional inputs, than depicted in FIG. 7A . Additionally or alternatively, one or more inputs of trust function 700 may include information described as being included in one or more other inputs of trust function 700 .
- FIG. 7B is a diagram of an exemplary trust function plot 770 of a trust score function according to an implementation described herein.
- trust score 760 may be a value in the [0,1] range, and when multiple users report abuse, the trust value associated with each user is added to the removal score associated with a comment. When the removal score reaches a value of 1, the associated comment is labeled for permanent removal.
- H represents the unit step function
- P represents the logistic function
- h represents an empirically chosen constant.
- a unit step function may return a value of 0 for a negative argument and a value of 1 for a positive argument.
- a logistic function may correspond to
- trust function plot 770 when based on Equation (2), may assign a trust score of 0 to a user that provided more incorrect reports than correct reports. As the number of correct reports rises, the trust score may rise in a sigmoid manner corresponding to a logistic function, rising rapidly and tapering off asymptotically to a particular score, in this case to a trust score of 0.5. Thus, in the implementation depicted in FIG. 7B , based on a user's track record, a user may achieve a maximum trust score of 0.5. Therefore, a minimum of two users with high trust scores may be required to increase the removal score of a comment to a value of 1, prompting removal of the comment.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for determining a trust score for a user according to an implementation described herein.
- the process of FIG. 8 may be performed by abuse review server 240 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 8 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including abuse review device 240 .
- the process of FIG. 8 may include determining a number of correct abuse reports made by a user (block 810 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may determine the number of correct abuse reports generated by a user, by keeping track of each time a comment that the user reported is labeled for permanent removal based on the removal score of the comment reaching a threshold, and/or by keeping track each time that a reviewer decides that an abuse report generated by the user is valid, and labels the comment for permanent removal.
- a number of incorrect abuse reports made by the user may be determined (block 820 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may determine the number of incorrect abuse reports generated by a user, by keeping track of each time a reviewer decides that an abuse report generated by the user is invalid.
- a trust score for the user may be determined based on a difference between the number of correct and incorrect abuse reports made by the user (block 830 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may calculate the difference between the number of correct and incorrect abuse reports using, for example, Equation (2).
- the trust score may be adjusted based on an author score associated with the user (block 840 ). For example, abuse report manager 410 may retrieve the author score associated with the user from author score field 520 and adjust the trust score stored in trust score field 560 based on the retrieved author score.
- the author score of the user may be used to adjust the trust score of the user regardless of the value of the author score.
- the author score of the user may be used to increase the trust score only if the author score is greater than a particular author score threshold. In such an implementation, the author score of the user affects the trust score of the user only if the user has achieved a particular level of reputation as an author (as set by the author score threshold).
- a second author score threshold may be set for low author scores. If a user's author score is less than or equal to the second author score threshold, indicating that the user is considered a particularly poor author of comments by other users, the user's trust score may be decreased. If a user's author score changes, for example by having other users rate the user's authored comments as useful, abuse report manager 410 may adjust the trust score of the user accordingly.
- the trust score may be adjusted based on a rater score associated with the user (block 850 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may retrieve the rater score associated with the user from rater score field 530 and adjust the trust score stored in trust score field 560 based on the retrieved rater score.
- the rater score of the user may be used to adjust the trust score of the user regardless of the value of the rater score.
- the rater score of the user may be used to adjust the trust score only if the rater score is greater than a particular rater score threshold. In such an implementation, the rater score of the user affects the trust score of the user only if the user has been determined to be a reliable rater (as set by the rater score threshold).
- a second rater score threshold may be set for low rater scores. If a user's rater score is less than or equal to the second rater score threshold, indicating that the user is considered a particularly poor rater of comments, the user's trust score may be decreased. If a user's rater score changes, for example by calculating that the user tends to vote with the community more often than in the past, abuse report manager 410 may adjust the trust score of the user accordingly.
- the trust score may be adjusted based on a publisher score associated with the user (block 860 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may retrieve the publisher score associated with the user from publisher score field 540 and adjust the trust score stored in trust score field 560 based on the retrieved publisher score.
- the publisher score of the user may be used to adjust the trust score of the user regardless of the value of the publisher score.
- the publisher score of the user may be used to adjust the trust score only if the publisher score is greater than a particular publisher score threshold.
- the publisher score of the user affects the trust score of the user only if the user has been determined to be associated with a published web site that is considered to be of a particular level of quality or a particular level of popularity. If a user's popularity score changes, for example by determining that a web site associated with the user has increased in rank or has increased in the number of times the web site is accessed, abuse report manager 410 may adjust the trust score of the user accordingly.
- the trust score may be adjusted based on a certification associated with the user (block 870 ). For example, abuse report manager 410 may access certification field 550 associated with the user to determine whether the user has obtained any certifications. If it is determined that the user has obtained a certification, the trust score associated with the user may be increased. The trust score may be increased based on a type of certification. For example, a first type of certification may cause the trust score to be increased by a first particular amount, while a second type of certification may cause the trust score to be increased by a second particular amount.
- blocks 840 - 870 of FIG. 8 are depicted in a particular order, blocks 840 - 870 may be performed concurrently or in a different order from the one depicted in FIG. 8 .
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for adjusting a trust score for a user according to an implementation described herein.
- the process of FIG. 9 may be performed by abuse review server 240 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 9 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including abuse review device 240 .
- the process of FIG. 9 may include receiving an abuse report from a user (block 910 ).
- abuse review server 240 may receive an abuse report from client device 110 , in response to a user of client device 110 clicking on report abuse button 132 associated with a particular comment.
- the abuse report may include information identifying the user, such as a unique string that may be used to locate user profile 500 associated with the user.
- the received abuse report may be placed in a review queue (block 920 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may determine that the trust score associated with the user that generated the abuse report is less than or equal to a suspension threshold, indicating that the user is not trusted enough by the system to automatically remove the comment.
- abuse report manager 410 may generate abuse record 600 and place the abuse record in abuse report review queue 440 .
- a manual review decision may be received for the abuse report (block 930 ).
- abuse report review queue 440 may eventually provide abuse record 600 to manual review interface 450 .
- a human operator may review the comment specified by the abuse record.
- the user's trust score may be decreased (block 950 ). For example, the human operator may mark abuse record 600 as invalid and may delete abuse record 600 , thereby keeping the reported comment active.
- manual review interface 450 may provide information to abuse report manager 410 , and abuse report manager 410 may decrease the user's trust score, based on the fact that the user provided an invalid abuse report.
- the comment may be labeled for permanent removal (block 980 ).
- the human operator may mark abuse record 600 as valid and may indicate that the reported comment should be deleted.
- manual review interface 450 may provide information to abuse report manager 410 , indicating that an abuse report generated by the user was deemed valid.
- the user's trust score may be increased (block 990 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may increase the user's trust score, in response to receiving an indication of a valid abuse report from manual review interface 450 , by accessing user profile 500 associated with the user in user profile database 420 .
- abuse reports for the same comment, may be received from other users (block 960 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may receive abuse reports from other client devices 110 , reporting the same comment.
- abuse record 600 of the reported comment may be updated with the received abuse reports.
- a removal score of the comment may be adjusted (block 970 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may increase the removal score of the comment based on the trust scores of the other users that reported the comment.
- the trust scores of all users that reported the comment may be combined (e.g., added together).
- the comment may be labeled for permanent removal (block 980 ) and the user's trust score may be increased (block 980 ). For example, combining the trust scores of all of the users that reported the comment may raise the removal score of the comment above a removal threshold, and abuse report manager 410 may indicate, in removal status field 640 , that the comment should be permanently removed. In response, abuse report manager 410 may increase the user's trust score, as the user's abuse report has been deemed to be valid.
- Adjusting a user's trust score when an abuse report was deemed valid based on trust scores of other users that reported the comment may appear to be subject to user collusion. For example, it may appear that multiple users may conspire to report a particular comment, because they do not like the content of the comment, even though the comment does not violate policies. If the users succeed in increasing the comment's removal score above the removal threshold, the users may be able to illegitimately remove the comment as well as illegitimately increase their own trust scores. However, this seems unlikely, because in order for the users to increase the removal score of the comment above the removal threshold, the users need to have trust scores greater than a certain value, or there needs to be a large number of users, with low trust scores, conspiring together. However, as can be seen in FIG. 7B , in order to earn even a low positive value trust score, a user may need to generate at least one valid abuse report.
- Abuse report manager 410 may adjust the trust score of a user that reported a comment only if the trust scores of the other users that reported the comment are greater than a particular trust score threshold. Thus, abuse report manager 410 may set a high trust threshold. A first user that has a trust score greater than the high trust threshold may be trusted enough so that a second user's trust score may be increased, if the second user reports a comment that was also reported by the first user, and if the comment ends up being removed. The high trust threshold may be set sufficiently high so that only users with a very good track record may earn trust scores above the high trust threshold.
- a random number generator may be used to select a number of abuse reports generated by trusted users (e.g., users with a trust score above a particular trust score threshold).
- the selected abuse reports may be placed in abuse report review queue 440 for manual review.
- Providing a random sample of abuse reports from trusted users for manual review may be used to verify that an algorithm for calculating trust scores for users is performing correctly.

- the process of FIG. 10 may include receive an abuse report from a user (block 1010 ).
- abuse review server 240 may receive an abuse report from client device 110 , in response to a user of client device 110 clicking on report abuse button 132 associated with a particular comment.
- the abuse report may include information identifying the user that sent the report, which may be obtained by the browser add-on application.
- user may need to create an account to activate the browser add-on application.
- the user may be assumed to be associated with a particular client device 110 .
- the information identifying the user need not include information that may be used to determine the user's identity. Rather, the information identifying the user may include a unique string which may be associated with a user profile that stores a trust score associated with the user.
- clicking on report abuse button 132 may send an abuse report to abuse review server 240 without further information from the user.
- a user may be prompted to identify the type of violation that the user believes is associated with the comment. For example, the user may asked to identify whether the comment includes spam; malware; hateful or threatening language; content promoting unlawful or illegal activities; copyright infringement; sexually explicit material; impersonation of other users; or confidential or private information of other users. It may be desirable to give higher priorities to some types of policy violations. For example, if a user indicates that a comment promotes illegal activities, the abuse report may be given a higher priority and may be moved to the front of a queue.
- a user's trust score may be retrieved (block 1020 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may identify user profile 500 associated with the user that generated the abuse report, and retrieve the trust score stored in trust score field 560 of user profile 500 .
- a removal score, for the comment associated with the received abuse report may be adjusted (block 1030 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may check abuse report review queue 440 to determine whether abuse record 600 exists for the reported comment. If abuse record 600 exits, abuse report manager 410 may add the received abuse report to abuse record 600 , and may adjust removal score 630 of abuse record 600 based on the trust score retrieved from trust score field 560 of user profile 500 .
- abuse report manager 410 may generate the removal score of the report comment from the trust score retrieved from trust score field 560 of user profile 500 .
- the comment may be labeled for temporary removal (block 1070 ), and the abuse report may be placed in a queue (block 1080 ).
- abuse report manager 410 may change removal status field 640 of the comment to indicate temporary removal (i.e., suspension of the comment), and may send a message to removal component 430 to suspend the comment. Removal component 430 may temporarily suspend the comment from being provided, or may send a message to comments server 130 to temporarily suspend the comment from being provided. Additionally, abuse report manager 410 may create abuse record 600 for the comment and place the comment in abuse report review queue 440 .
- the abuse report may be placed in a queue (block 1080 ), without temporary removal of the comment.
- abuse report manager 410 may create abuse record 600 for the comment and place the comment in abuse report review queue 440 .
- the comment may be provided for manual evaluation (block 1090 ).
- abuse report review queue 440 may provide abuse record 600 of the comment to manual review interface 450 , and a human operator may review the comment to determine whether the comment violates one or more policies.
- An indication may be received from manual review interface 450 whether the comment violates one or more policies. If the comment was not temporarily removed from being provided to users prior to abuse record 600 associated with the comment being placed in abuse report review queue 440 , and the comment is deemed not to violate any policies, no action may be taken. If the comment was temporarily removed from being provided to users and the comment is deemed not to violate any policies, the comment may be restored and comments server 130 may resume providing the comment to users. If the comment is deemed to violate a policy, the comment may be deleted.
- FIG. 11 is a flowchart of a process illustrating an example of receiving abuse reports for a comment according to an implementation described herein.
- the process of FIG. 11 may be performed by abuse review server 240 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 11 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including abuse review device 240 .
- a first abuse report about a comment may be received from a first user (block 1110 ). For example, a user may click on “Report Abuse” button 132 .
- a removal score of the comment may be set based on the user's trust score (block 1120 ). Assume that the user's trust score is 0.2. The removal score of the reported comment may be set to 0.2. Further assume that the suspension threshold for temporarily removing a comment has been set to 0.3. A determination may be made that the removal score of the comment is less than or equal to a suspension threshold (block 1130 ), and the comment may be placed in a review queue (block 1140 ).
- a second abuse report for the comment may be received from a second user (block 1150 ). Assume that the second user's trust score is 0.4. The removal score of the comment may be adjusted based on the second user's trust score (block 1160 ). The second user's trust score may be added to the removal score of the comment to arrive at a new removal score of 0.6. A determination may be made that the removal score of the comment is greater than a suspension threshold of 0.3 (block 1170 ), and the comment may be temporarily removed (block 1180 ).
- the comment may be manually evaluated and determined to violate a policy (block 1190 ).
- the comment may be permanently removed and the abuse reports may be determined to be valid.
- the trust scores of the first and second user may be increased (block 1195 ). For example, assume that the first user has previously generated two valid reports and one invalid report and that the user's trust score is not adjusted based on other factors. Based on Equation (2), as stated above, the user's trust score had been set to 0.2.
- Abuse record manager 410 may adjust the trust score based on the newly received indication, from manual review interface 450 , that the user has generated another valid report. The difference between the number of valid and invalid abuse reports generated by the user may now be 2 and, based on Equation (2), the user's trust score may be increased to 0.4. Similarly, assuming the second user has previously generated two valid abuse reports. Based on Equation (2), the second user's trust score may be increased to 0.45.
- a comment may be associated with a particular product rather than a particular document describing the product, and may be provided to a user in connection with a first document about the particular product in a first context and may be provided to a user in connection with a second document about the particular product in a second context.
- an implementation of the systems and methods described herein may be applied to ranking of users who report abuse of business reviews in connection with, for example, a local search service (e.g., users who report abusive business reviews in Google Maps).
