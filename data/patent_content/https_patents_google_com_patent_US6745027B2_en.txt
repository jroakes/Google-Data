Definitions
- the present invention relates to methods of forming ad hoc data communication networks and distributed databases and, in particular, to methods of dynamic self-organization of wireless transceivers based on classes of articles associated with the wireless transceivers to form hierarchical ad hoc wireless data communication networks and distributed databases.
- Wireless ad hoc networks allow node-to-node communication without central control or wired infrastructure. Such networks may have dynamic, randomly-changing, multihop topologies composed of wireless data communication links between the nodes. Ad hoc networks are advantageous because they are inexpensive, fault-tolerant, and flexible. Various known methods relate to data transmission within an ad hoc wireless data communication network. However, most known methods do not address self-configuration of wireless nodes for the formation and maintenance of efficient network topology.
- Bluetooth radio technology is an ad hoc networking solution for personal data applications, it provides for only a limited number of communication channels, thereby restricting the number of Bluetooth devices that will communicate over an ad hoc network at any given time.
- Bluetooth radio technology is an ad hoc networking solution for personal data applications, it provides for only a limited number of communication channels, thereby restricting the number of Bluetooth devices that will communicate over an ad hoc network at any given time.
- ad hoc networking methods typically organize the network on the basis of geographic proximity of the nodes or the strength of signals received by the various nodes. While geographical organization or signal strength organization may work well for some applications, many others are limited. Known methods of ad hoc network organization also require nodes to regularly transmit network information to all other nodes in the network, which results in increased radio traffic and interference. Increased radio interference inhibits the formation and maintenance of ad hoc networks having a large number of nodes and requires nodes to transmit at a greater power, which reduces their battery life. Thus a need exists for more efficient methods of forming, organizing, and maintaining ad hoc wireless networks.
- Wireless data networks are known for use in warehouse management and other asset tracking applications.
- existing wireless data network technologies are not well suited to asset tracking, which involves a large number of network nodes (e.g., hundreds and thousands).
- existing wireless technologies are cost prohibitive, are prone to RF interference, and consume a large amount of electrical power.
- a method of forming an ad hoc hierarchical wireless data communication network involves associating a plurality of wireless transceivers with articles to be tracked, and assigning to each of the transceivers a “class designation” representative of a characteristic or behavior of the article with which the transceiver is associated.
- Each of the wireless transceivers includes a network organization routine that operates in coordination with the network organization routines of other transceivers to establish the hierarchical network based on the transceivers' class designations.
- the hierarchical network provides an efficient topology for selective communication among wireless transceivers of the same class.
- the ad hoc network organization routines are preferably implemented in software operable on a digital processor of the wireless transceivers. Alternatively, the ad hoc network organization routines may be implemented in other ways, such as hardwired logic circuitry.
- Each wireless transceiver's class designation assignment is included in a profile that is stored in a memory readable by the digital processor of the wireless transceiver.
- the class designation may be set in hardwired or programmable logic circuitry.
- the class designation may represent an abstract class of article, such as a ball; a subclass of the class, such as a soccer ball; or a subclass of the subclass (a sub-subclass), such as a size 5 soccer ball, etc.
- the class designation represents a subclass, it may also include information about the class or classes abstracted from the subclass, e.g., /ball/soccer_ball/size — 5_soccer_ball.
- the wireless transceiver's class designation may be intentionally limited to subclass (/size — 5_soccer_ball), while information about the subclass' abstract class is represented in memory on the transceiver or remotely from the transceiver in class dictionaries or rule sets.
- the profile may include auxiliary information such as, for example, a characteristic of the associated article (e.g., serial number, status, process step, physical location, color, size, density, etc.), a behavior of the associated article (e.g., temperature sensitivity, light sensitivity, shelf life, etc.), sensor derived information (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude, pressure, etc.), a rank of the wireless transceiver in the hierarchical network (e.g., primary (“master”), secondary (“slave”), sub-primary, tertiary, etc.), a priority designation to provide improved response to selected transceivers, a privilege level (e.g., visitor, employee, manager, administrator, super user, etc.), and time-sensitive information (e.g., synchronization timing, real-time sensor data, GPS data, etc.).
- a characteristic of the associated article e.g., serial number, status, process step, physical location, color, size, density, etc.
- a behavior of the associated article e
- the profile and, in particular, the class designation are used by the wireless transceiver to selectively receive packets intended for receipt by transceivers of the same class designation (including/class/subclass).
- messages or commands are transmitted to a class (or subclass) of nodes by broadcasting or multicasting the commands in packets that begin with a preamble including the class designation information and possibly other profile information.
- Transceivers within range of the transmitting transceiver will wake up from a standby mode to receive and process an entire packet only when the packet's preamble matches the receiving transceiver's class designation.
- each of the wireless transceivers includes a low-power radio frequency device (“LPRF”), which operates in accordance with the BluetoothTM system specification. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to use with BluetoothTM technology, but can be used with any wireless transceiver having the capability to communicate directly with multiple other wireless transceivers, such as wireless ethernet transceivers, 802.11, Home RF, and others.
- LPRF refers generally to a two-way wireless radio-frequency data communication device that transmits data in packets, and is not limited to a particular signal strength or power consumption.
- the self-configuration routines used to form ad hoc class-based networks in accordance with the present invention may also be used to perform autonomous modification and reconfiguration of such networks in response to changes in the location, status, behavior, characteristics or class designation of articles associated with the transceivers.
- the self-configuration methods of the present invention facilitate maintenance of radio communication links in response to changes in the operational characteristics of the wireless transceivers and radio frequency transponders that comprise the network fabric.
- self-configuration routines are responsive to changes caused by battery drain, radio transmitter failures, radio interference, and digital processor failure, by their inherent methods of organizing the network to have optimal link integrity and node connectivity.
- a class adoption step involves an adopting one of the LPRF units that detects the class designation of one or more nearby radio frequency transponders (also known as radio-frequency identification tags, RFID Tags, or RFTs) or of nearby LPRFs, and incorporates the detected class designation in its own profile.
- radio frequency transponders also known as radio-frequency identification tags, RFID Tags, or RFTs
- class adoption is performed only when the adopting LPRF is unable to participate in the ad hoc hierarchical network because of a missing or corrupted class designation. In some circumstances, class adoption may be useful even if the adopting LPRF has sufficient class designation information to support communication.
- an LPRF attached to a pallet could periodically update its class by detecting the classes of nearby LPRF and RFID Tags (e.g., those attached to items placed on the pallet).
- an LPRF unit can be manually programmed with a class designation by use of a handheld interrogator module (“HIM”).
- the HIM is a sort of remote control device that allows a human operator to program LPRF units and to query LPRF and RFT units.
- the HIM includes an LPRF unit that is controlled by application software designed to facilitate manual human interaction and communication with nearby LPRF and RFT units.
- a network interface module serves as a communication gateway between the ad hoc hierarchical network and an external network such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.
- the NIM includes at least a NIM RF unit for communication with LPRF nodes of the ad hoc network and an external network interface for connecting the NIM RF unit to the external network.
- a server computer that is typically connected to the external network includes communication interfaces for directing messages and instructions, via the NIM, to selected classes of LPRFs of the ad hoc network.
- LPRFs of the ad hoc network can direct messages and instructions to the server via the NIM.
- class-switching facilitates automated and semi-automated segregation, tracking, monitoring, and delivery of assets.
- the server issues, via the NIM, class-directed messages and class-directed queries to monitor and track a class of LPRF units.
- User-defined class granularity facilitates the use of separate sub-classes for various attributes and states of the articles, e.g., production batches, phases of production, and the delivery process. By increasing granularity, i.e., using many subclasses (including sub-subclasses, etc.), control commands and messages from the server can be directed to only those subclasses of interest, rather than all LPRF units.
- the LPRF radios excluded from the class do not wake up from standby mode to receive the packets and do not acknowledge or reply to the packets. This reduces radio interference and power consumption while making asset tracking functions more efficient.
- the class-based ad hoc network serves as a dynamic distributed hierarchical database system.
- transceivers and RFTs include a query handling routine in communication with a memory of the transceiver or RFT.
- the query handling routine interprets and responds to class-directed database queries and update transaction requests, for example, from an HIM or a server-based asset tracking application operating on the external network.
- Database queries may include status queries that gather up-to-date status information about the articles.
- Profile update transaction requests may include requests to change profile data on specified transceivers of the distributed database system.
- Increased class granularity also facilitates improved data retrieval efficiency in the distributed database system by reducing the number of transceivers that must be involved in a profile query or update transaction.
- FIG. 1 shows various network components and an example arrangement in the context of a warehouse application in accordance with the present invention
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a preferred operation of the network organization routine operating on LPRFs in accordance with the present invention
- FIGS. 3-11 show a time sequence that depicts LPRF units of arbitrary classes “circle” and “triangle”, transmitting a series of messages in the course of self-organizing a hierarchical network using a bottom-up propagation approach;
- FIGS. 6A, 8 A, 9 A, 10 A, and 11 A depict the topology of the ad hoc network formed at the stages depicted in corresponding FIGS. 6, 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 , respectively;
- FIGS. 12-21 depict a time sequence of ad hoc network formation using a top-down propagation approach.
- each LPRF is associated with or attached to one or more articles to be tracked, such as vehicles, packages, warehoused materials, baggage, and any other items being shipped, manufactured, stored, used, or otherwise existing.
- Each LPRF includes a packet radio device, preferably operating in accordance with the BluetoothTM wireless data transmission standard. Skilled persons will understand that radio transmission methods other than Bluetooth may also be utilized.
- Each LPRF includes a memory that stores a profile, which includes a class designation representative of the associated article or articles.
- a network organization routine operates on each LPRF unit for forming an ad hoc network with other LPRF units of the same class at various times: upon start up, on command, to maintain the network, or as otherwise needed. The network organization routines of multiple LPRF units cooperate to propagate a single-level or multi-level hierarchical network among the LPRF units.
- Class-switched networks are reconfigurable in response to changes in the location, status, behavior, characteristics or class designation associated with the transceivers. For example, articles of a class (e.g., in-production) can be selectively transferred to a new class (e.g., shipping) by merely changing the class designation assigned to the transceivers with which the articles are associated.
- Class-switching also facilitates the use of asset tracking applications and process flow controls to track and manage the assets based on real-world requirements, such as manufacturing requirements, shipment, warehouse management, zone control, environmental impacts, etc. Class-switching also facilitates automated segregation and delivery of assets.
- FIG. 1 shows a deployment of a system in accordance with the present invention in a shipping environment 100 including a warehouse 104 .
- an LPRF unit 110 is attached to each pallet 120 in the shipping environment 100 .
- An actual implementation would involve thousands of pallets and LPRFs. For clarity, only three pallets and LPRFs are shown in FIG. 1 .
- at least some of the LPRF units 110 are associated with and assume a class designation representative of one or more radio frequency transponders 130 (also known as radio-frequency identification tags, RFID Tags, or RFTs), which are in turn associated with packages 134 .
- the RFTs 130 may be of one of several types.
- Passive RFTs are devices that collect RF energy inductively and selectively respond, including sending information that is stored on the RFT. They may be viewed as selective reflectors of incident RF signals.
- Semi-passive and semi-active RFTs are devices that use a battery to power some portion of the circuit to either detect from reader or transmit to the reader.
- Active RFTs are devices that use a battery to detect and transmit information to or from the reader.
- RFTs 130 can be read-write or read-only, depending on the requirements of the particular asset tracking application.
- LPRFs 110 acquire class designation by reading RFTs 130 nearest them, then storing class designation and other profile information in non-volatile read/write memory. Alternatively, LPRFs are preprogrammed (in non-volatile read/write memory) with a class designation representative of packages 134 .
- a network interface module (“NIM”) 140 may be used as a communication gateway between an external network (LAN) 150 and the ad hoc network formed by the LPRF units.
- the NIM 140 comprises a radio base station directly or indirectly connected to a wired network (e.g., using ethernet, or wireless ethernet).
- the radio base station portion of NIM 140 is an LPRF-compatible module that communicates with LPRFs of the ad hoc network using the network formation and communications methods of the present invention.
- the NIM 140 links the ad hoc network of the present invention with conventional network topologies that use conventional network protocols.
- the NIM 140 facilitates monitoring, controlling, and querying transceivers (LPRFs 110 and RFTs 130 ) in the ad hoc hierarchical network using application software running on a server computer 160 connected to the external network 150 .
- the server 160 may be operated on a general purpose computer, such as a personal computer, minicomputer, or mainframe.
- a system in accordance with the present invention may include network components in addition to the RFT, LPRF, and NIM components described above.
- a handheld interrogator module (HIM) 170 and a mobile locating gateway unit (MLG) 180 are provided in this example.
- HIM 170 is used to manually read class information from network entities, such as LPRFs and RFTs, and to assign class designations.
- MLG 180 which is installed in shipping vehicle 184 , has the core capabilities of an LPRF and NIM, plus at least two additional features.
- MLG 180 includes a GPS receiver (not depicted) for determining geographic location of shipping vehicle 184 and a cellular or satellite transmitter 186 for transmitting data to server computer 160 via a mobile phone network 188 .
- NIM 140 , HIM 170 , and MLG 180 all include the core hardware and software of LPRFs, they can actively participate in the formation, control, and maintenance of the class-based ad hoc network when used in proximity to the ad hoc network.
- the pallet's LPRF 110 migrates to join an ad hoc network sub-hierarchy headed by MLG 180 .
- MLG 180 is then able to report the migration to server 160 via a network link that it has formed with NIM 140 .
- the following description of the network formation methods of the present invention refer to an ad hoc network organization routine of multiple LPRF units for forming a class-based ad hoc hierarchical network.
- NIMs, HIMs, and MLGs include similar network organization routines and utilize the network formation methods of the present invention to participate in the ad hoc network.
- the network organization routines of multiple LPRF units cooperate to propagate a distinct hierarchical network among each of multiple classes of the LPRF units.
- class designation information is stored in memory on each LPRF unit and thereafter included in the preamble of network formation messages generated by the LPRF units.
- the class designation information may be represented by any series of codes or characters, the interpretation of which should be standardized and used by all possible message recipients (LPRF, MLG, NIM, HIM, etc.).
- the class designation may include a class/subclass list (e.g., /Television/Color/24′′/Serial — 123) or a linked list representing relationships of various classes and subclasses defined in the LPRF's profile.
- the class designation may also include other information concerning a status, characteristic, or privilege of the LPRF, the network, or other conditions.
- Virtually any profile information can be included in the preamble and combined with class designation information to be used for network formation.
- the preamble information can be represented in any convenient format, including various encoding schemes.
- a Walsh code is assigned to each class definition and provided to LPRF units of the class. Walsh codes are well understood in the field of digital wireless communications and, therefore, require only a brief explanation here.
- Walsh codes are used to encode data packets and to designate the class of LPRFs that are enabled to receive and decode a particular packet of data.
- the association of Walsh codes with class designation information facilitates reduced battery consumption in LPRFs by utilizing message targeting methods requiring very little processing power.
- the use of Walsh codes also improves data security by encoding of messages. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many other methods may be used for encoding class designation information in the preamble of data packets to facilitate class-based network formation and messaging while reducing battery consumption and RF interference.
- FIG. 2 is a process flow diagram depicting a preferred method of operating the network organization routine in accordance with the present invention to propagate a class-based ad hoc wireless network.
- a first LPRF of a predetermined class upon power up, a first LPRF of a predetermined class initially listens for transmissions of other LPRFs 210 , which would indicate the presence of an ad hoc network. If an ad hoc network is sensed and it includes nodes of the predetermined class, then the first LPRF attempts to join the network as a secondary unit by issuing a registration request signal 220 .
- the first LPRF attempts to join the network as a primary unit by broadcasting a primary_ready signal to all other LPRFs of its class 230 .
- the first LPRF then listens for replies from other LPRFs wanting to register as secondaries 240 .
- the first LPRF registers the secondaries 260 until the first LPRF's “cluster” is full 270 .
- a “cluster” comprises a primary LPRF and the secondary LPRFs with which the primary communicates directly, and may be limited in size by the number of communication channels that can be supported by the primary operating as cluster head. Once a cluster is full, the first LPRF (cluster head) responds to the next LPRF attempting to register as secondary by promoting it to the status of primary to the first LPRF 280 . The first LPRF then attempts to register with the new primary as one of its secondaries 290 .
- the new primary would in turn be available to serve as cluster head for other LPRFS, to promote other LPRFs to higher level primaries, and so forth, thereby propagating the ad hoc network from the bottom up.
- the first LPRF and all other LPRFs form the ad hoc network by using the same network organization routine.
- the first LPRF's cluster does not fill and there are no more LPRFs attempting to register with it as secondaries, and the LPRF has a class other than its root class, then the first LPRF truncates its class designation 250 and starts the entire network organization routine from the top (i.e., listening for the presence of LPRFs of the truncated class 210 , etc.). If no other LPRFs are attempting to register and the first LPRF's class cannot be abstracted, the first LPRF attempts to register with the NIM (step 294 ) then goes into idle mode (step 296 ).
- the first LPRF may start attempting to register with the NIM soon after it becomes a primary 230 , concurrently with filling its cluster.
- the first LPRF would also pass to the LPRF responsibility for communication with the NIM, if possible.
- the NIM communicates over a maximum of only 10 channels. However, on each channel, the class designation can revolve to address multiple classes of LPRFs.
- the system may establish a revolving communication schedule with revolving class addressing that allows the NIM to communicate with hundreds or thousands of classes of LPRFs. Synchronization between the NIM and LPRFs is important for proper operation of revolving class addressing and to minimize battery consumption. Accordingly, as classes of LPRFs are added to the network and establish communication with a NIM, the NIM may synchronize, reconfigure, and optimize the class' schedule for revolving class addressing.
- Sub-primaries which continue as secondaries below the first primary, provide connectivity between the first primary and any additional LPRFs that are attempting to join the network in the cluster headed by the sub-primaries.
- promoted secondaries become cluster heads that may provide connectivity to LPRF units of the same class that are beyond the transmission range of the first primary.
- the LPRF units thereby form a hierarchical multi-tiered network based on class that propagates both in quantity of nodes and geographic coverage.
- Tightly grouped class-based networks in accordance with the present invention make it possible to communicate to and among a particular target class of LPRF units without requiring messages to be received, processed, or routed by LPRFs that are not of the target class or an abstracted class.
- This hierarchical class-based network organization is, thus, an efficient topology for communicating among LPRF units of the same class because it reduces the number of network links through which messages must pass, reducing RF interference and battery power consumption.
- FIGS. 3-11 depict LPRF units in a time-sequence of events showing a bottom up method of class-based network formation in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- LPRF units 1 - 6 and A-G include transceivers of respective classes “circle” and “triangle”, which are arbitrary class designations assigned for purposes of illustration only.
- the LPRF units 1 - 6 and A-G operate on up to three communication channels and one general channel (also called the control channel).
- the LPRF units all include network organization routines operating in accordance with the method shown in FIG. 2 .
- the network organization routines of LPRF units 1 - 6 and A-G are configured to initially listen for the preambles of packets to identify only those packets transmitted by other LPRF units of the same class (FIG. 2, step 210 ).
- the preamble of each packet is represented by a colon-separated string of information, as follows:
- Target Class My Profile: Action Requested: Target Cluster Head ID
- Target Class is the class of LPRFs directed to wake up from standby to receive and process the packet.
- the Target Class is either/circle or /triangle (no subclasses).
- the Target Class designation could include subclass information in a slash-separated list, e.g., /ball/soccer_ball/size — 5_soccer_ball, in a linked list, with Walsh codes, or by any other method of representing class and subclass information.
- the Target Class portion of the preamble may include a unit ID unique to a single recipient, e.g.,/circle/unit 1 .
- LPRF unit 1 After listening for packets of its class (circle) and hearing none, LPRF unit 1 attempts to start a network as a primary, by broadcasting a packet having the following preamble:
- the class designation “/circle” causes only LPRF units of the circle class to receive and process the packet.
- LPRF unit 1 if it receives no replies, may retransmit the primary_ready message multiple times before timing out and beginning a beacon procedure or entering a battery-saving lost mode.
- the packets (and others described below) may encapsulate a data payload or may have a null payload.
- LPRFs are preferably synchronized to allow scheduled communication to a particular class of LPRFs at regular intervals.
- the LPRF transmits a packet at a time precisely synchronized with the receiving class.
- the receiving class of LPRFs only powers up to listen at each interval and only for very small periods of time (e.g. a few milliseconds) when packet preambles would normally be transmitted.
- the intervals at which an LPRF listens for messages directed to its class is called the duty cycle, which can be dynamically adjusted to respond to network communication demands while minimizing battery consumption.
- a period of inactivity may prompt an LPRF to limit its duty cycle to intervals of minutes or hours.
- an LPRF may ping (transmit) to determine whether other LPRFs are still alive and available for communication. Assuming that no network changes have occurred, the LPRF goes back to sleep until the next duty cycle. Network changes may cause all or a part of the ad hoc work to reconfigure.
- LPRF units of class “/circle” that are within range of unit 1 respond with a registration request, as listed in Table 1:
- the registration request packets include in their preambles a target class of LPRF unit 1 , only LPRF unit 1 will wake up from standby to receive and process the registration request packets.
- the transmitters of units 2 - 6 would typically include collision avoidance routines to avoid interfering transmissions of the registration request packets.
- network organization routine of LPRF unit 1 registers and acknowledges secondary LPRF units to form a cluster.
- LPRF unit 1 has a maximum cluster capacity of three secondary units. Consequently, it only registers and acknowledges the three LPRF units from which the strongest registration request signals are received (in this example, units 2 - 4 ).
- the network organization routine establishes a cluster that is energy efficient for communication within the cluster.
- LPRF transmits an acknowledgement signal to the secondaries, as set forth in Table 2:
- the network topology is now shown in FIGS. 6 and the cluster hierarchy is depicted in FIG. 6 A.
- the two concentric circles of LPRF unit 1 indicate that it is a cluster head at level 2 in the network hierarchy.
- LPRF unit 1 (the cluster head) selects from the un-networked LPRFs the one having the strongest registration request signal (in this example LPRF unit 5 ) and directs the selected un-networked LPRF to become a new primary.
- the new primary will serve as a new cluster head for a cluster in which LPRF unit 1 will become a secondary.
- the command from LPRF unit 1 to LPRF unit 5 would be:
- LPRF unit 5 acknowledges the promotion signal from LPRF unit 1 and begins to propagate the network at the next higher level in the hierarchy.
- the hierarchy now has three tiers, as depicted in FIG. 8 A.
- LPRF unit 5 transmits its acknowledgement packet to all units of its class within range, by the following preamble:
- LPRF unit 5 By transmitting to all units of its class within range, LPRF unit 5 efficiently registers with LPRF unit 1 and concurrently shares primary status information with all LPRF units of its class.
- the three concentric circles around LPRF unit 5 indicate that it is a primary in the third-level of the hierarchy.
- LPRF unit 6 upon receiving unit 5 's registration acknowledgement (FIG. 8 ), requests to register as a secondary below unit 5 by sending a packet with the following preamble:
- unit 5 responds with: : /circle/unit 6 : /circle/unit 5 : registration_ackn: /circle/unit 5
- a subnet of triangle class LPRF units A-G is similarly formed (concurrently with the steps shown in FIGS. 3-9, so that there are two distinct hierarchies, as shown in FIG. 10 A.
- the root primaries (LPRF units 5 and A, also called “primary primaries”), register with the NIM to establish connectivity to an external network, and computers communicating thereon.
- FIGS. 12-21 illustrate a top-down class based network formation sequence in accordance with a second preferred embodiment.
- the LPRF units transmit a series of messages in the course of self-organizing a hierarchical network, the topology of which is shown at various stages adjacent to FIGS. 13, 16 , 19 , and 21 in respective FIGS. 13A, 16 A, 19 A, and 21 A.
- the transmitting transceivers are shown in heavy bold outline.
- a first LPRF unit 1 wakes up and reads profile information stored in its memory, including a predefined class designation (“circle”). LPRF unit 1 then listens for transmission activity by other LPRF units of the same class. If nearby LPRF units of class circle have already formed a network, LPRF unit 1 will attempt to join the network. Otherwise, LPRF unit 1 attempts to organize an ad hoc network.
- LPRF unit 1 transmits a primary_ready signal including its class designation.
- the primary_ready signal is preferably a data packet that includes in its preamble digital data representative of the “circle” class designation.
- the bold boundary of LPRF unit 1 indicates that it is transmitting rather than receiving.
- the range of the transmission is depicted by dashed circle “R”.
- the receiving LPRF unit (in this example, each of LPRF units 2 - 5 ) wakes up, receives, and processes the entire primary_ready signal, then responds as shown in FIG. 13, described below.
- each of the LPRF units of the circle class that received the primary_ready signal in FIG. 1 responds to the primary_ready signal with a registration_request signal.
- LPRF unit 1 assumes the status of a “primary” network node, while LPRF units 2 - 5 assume the status of secondaries.
- FIG. 13A shows the resulting 2-tiered network hierarchy tree representative of the network formed between LPRF units 1 - 5 .
- LPRF unit 6 was out of range of LPRF unit 1 's primary_ready signal (FIG. 12 ), but within range of the registration_request of LPRF units 3 and 5 (FIG. 13 ).
- LPRF unit 6 which was listening during the step shown in FIG. 13, received the registration_request signals of LPRF units 3 and 5 because those signals included the “circle” class designation matching the “circle” class designation of LPRF 6.
- the registration request signals indicate to LPRF unit 6 the presence of a nearby network of “circle” class LPRF units, which causes LPRF unit 6 to transmit a request to join the network.
- FIG. 14 also depicts the beginning stages of the formation of a network of “triangle” class LPRF units A-G.
- Triangle LPRF unit A wakes up and listens for the presence of a “triangle” class network.
- Hearing no other triangle class LPRF signals, LPRF unit A transmits a primary_ready signal, similar to the transmission of LPRF unit 1 shown in FIG. 1, but with a “triangle” class designation forming part of the preamble of the primary_ready signal.
- triangle class LPRF units B, C, and D receive the primary_ready signal of LPRF unit A and respond with registration_request signals, thereby forming a second ad hoc network hierarchy, as shown in FIG. 15 A.
- circle LPRF units 3 and 5 respond to the request to join of LPRF 6 (FIG. 14) with primary_ready signals. LPRF 6 then responds to the strongest primary_ready signal received (in this example, the signal from LPRF unit 5 ), with a registration_request. LPRF unit 6 thereby forms a third tier of the circle network hierarchy, as shown in FIG. 16 A.
- triangle class LPRF unit E joins the network of triangle class LPRFs already formed by LPRF units A, B, C, and D.
- FIGS. 20 and 21 illustrate use of the method of the present invention to establish communication with devices outside of the ad hoc hierarchical network shown in FIGS. 1-8.
- External connectivity is established by creating a connection between an NIM and the root primaries of each of the circle and triangle classes.
- top-down and bottom-up may be used to propagate a class-based multi-level hierarchical network amongst LPRF units.
- a middle-outward approach or star configuration may be used to propagate the hierarchical network.
- transceivers and RFID Tags may include a handling routine in communication with a memory of the transceiver or RFID Tag.
- the handling routine interprets and responds to class-directed database commands, e.g. data queries or data updates from an asset-tracking application.
- Database queries may include status queries that provide the asset tracking application with real-time up-to-date status information about the articles.
- class-directed database commands include preambles that identify a class (and subclass) of LPRF units to which they are directed. In this manner, only those LPRF units of the selected class need process the database command.
- Class-directed database commands may also include, in their preambles, a wildcard that indicates to query handling routines that all subclasses of the class should receive and process the database commands.
- Class-based addressing avoids radio interference and reduces power consumption by LPRF units that are clearly outside the scope of the search criteria.
- Database performance can also be enhanced by selecting LPRF classes and subclasses in a way that mirrors a preferred hierarchical structure for the data they will carry. In this way, the network structure acts as a hierarchical database that facilitates fast and efficient data queries.
- Profile/preamble information might include, for example:
- Tag_Type Airline_Name: Passenger_Class: Origin_and_Destination: Flight_No: Tag_Status: passenger_id
- An example passenger-RFT profile might include:
- the luggage Upon check-in, the luggage enters the conveyer belt where it is read by another LPRF that changes its Tag_Status from “check-in” to “luggage-transfer_station — 4334”.
- Multiple LPRFs can be placed along the conveyer belt system to identify location and give granularity to the position of the luggage.
- Trucks that deliver the luggage to the plane also have LPRFs attached to the truck and convey a new state of “departure_on-transfer-truck-1441 ”.
- the luggage is checked in by an LPRF and its state is changed to destination information (i.e. “arrival_on-transfer-truck-6633”).
- destination information i.e. “arrival_on-transfer-truck-6633”.
- the RFTs on the luggage are read by an LPRF station located near an exit of the baggage area.
- the LPRF checks the luggage RFTs against the passenger's personal passenger-RFT to insure that the passenger is authorized to pick up the luggage and to alert the passenger if he or she has inadvertently picked up the wrong luggage.
- a warehouse store (e.g., Costco) carries hundreds of brands and wants to keep a real-time inventory of goods in the warehouse.
- An LPRF is attached to each pallet of goods and assigned a class designation that denotes the manufacturer of goods on that pallet (e.g., Pillsbury, Sony, Kellogg's, etc.).
- Each LPRF may also include in its class designation or profile, information about the goods on the pallet. Boxes on the pallet each carry an RFT that is read by the LPRF.
- Each LPRF gathers information about the RFTs that its pallet is carrying and relays the information back to the network server on demand.
- an employee of the warehouse store can inventory goods of a selected manufacturer class by sending a query that will be received only by LPRFs of the selected class of manufacturer. Messages or queries directed to a selected class will not affect the battery life of LPRFs of other classes because only LPRFs of the selected class will wake up from standby mode to receive the messages and queries.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided into subclasses to further reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- Containers full of material can be received and logged in to a yard by manufacture based on class information stored on the LPRFs.
- the LPRFs form a network with other containers from a particular manufacturer and allow quick and efficient tracking of containers. Messages or queries directed to a selected class will not affect the battery life of LPRFs of other classes because only LPRFs of the selected class will wake up from standby to receive the messages and queries.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided into subclasses to further reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- a company manufactures computers and wants to track the status of the supply chain.
- the classes defined are raw material, component stuffing, monitor assembly, final assembly, shipping, in transit, and distributor.
- the manufacture can inventory raw material throughout the process by addressing the raw material class, find out where in the manufacturing process the computer has reached by addressing monitor assembly or final assembly classes.
- first and second preferred embodiment network formation methods that comprised a peer-centric network formation, in which transceivers self formed an ad hoc network then contacted a server via an NIM.
- an LPRF contains software that is pre-programmed to interpret class information contained in the preamble of messages being transmitted by other LPRFs and then negotiate for primary status.
- the LPRFs use commands such as inventory RFTs, determine primary, and others (described below) to make decisions on class and other profile information that has been pre-programmed in the LPRFs. Once the LPRFs have formed the network, information is transmitted by the LPRFs for connectivity to server applications.
- Other network propagation methods include a server initiated method and a client/server shared method.
- the server initiated method the LPRFs have been attached to pallets or areas to read RFT information.
- the LPRFs are turned on and form an arbitrary network using commands such as Determine Primary. This arbitrary formation is done so that the server can address particular LPRFs, but is not based on class designations.
- the RFTs are read by the LPRFs and profiles are downloaded to the RFTs from the LPRFs based on commands such as “Inventory RF Tags”, described below.
- Profiles defining a new class structure are then downloaded from the server to the LPRFs (and any read/write RFTs) based on business rules.
- the networks are then instructed to Determine Primary again so that the network is re-formed according to the newly-assigned class structure.
- the LPRFs contain software that has been pre-programmed to interpret profile information.
- the profile information could be RFT IDs, states, etc.
- the LPRFs are reset and boot up looking to read the saved profile, to form hierarchical networks based on a class designation of the profile, and to look for primary/secondary configurations.
- network server business rules are downloaded to the LPRFs in the form of new profiles to “fine tune” the network.
- Acquire Class or Sub-Class Structures Software is located on the LPRFs and RFTs that interpret Class and Sub-Class structures. To initialize, the LPRFs arbitrarily form networks based on the ability to talk to other LPRFs. When a radio wakes up it broadcasts a message to other LPRFs that it is a primary and is looking for secondaries. Other LPRFs that are waking up receive the message and try to become part of the primary's network. If they are unable to communicate to the primary or if the primary's network is full the secondary LPRF will attempt to become a primary and continue the process. Once the LPRFs have established their network, the primary radios contact the network server and are downloaded a profile.
- the profile downloaded is based on options such as reading RFTs, LPRF IDs, business rules located at the server and other information that has been downloaded by an HIM.
- the LPRFs reform the networks based on class and sub-class rules defined by the software located on the LPRFs.
- the class structure can be pre-programmed but will not be able to be modified dynamically. Dynamic acquisition of class is based on rules defined by the network server application.
- Allow Class/Sub-Class/State Change are allowed based on business rules setup by the customer to track and group their assets. The rules are built into the server application and the software on the LPRFs. The profile provides information that allows dynamic decisions to be made by the LPRFs. Once the LPRFs have determined that their class, sub-class or state has been changed, the LPRFs must join the new class of LPRFs. The ability to allow a class change provides functionality to allow dynamic changes to LPRF class. For example, with reference to FIGS.
- class triangle could represent goods in the process of being manufactured in a factory. When these goods enter a shipping section of the factory, they would automatically acquire a “shipping” class representative of their current location and associated status.
- Form Class A new class can be established by downloading a new profile and using the command “Determine Primary”.
- the command uses techniques in FIGS. 2-21 to establish the class based network.
- Profiles and software on the LPRFs form the basis for decisions on network formation. The profile must be pre-programmed in the LPRFs or RFTs or downloaded from the server application.
- Combine Classes The combination of classes is required when the user no longer wishes to differentiate between two originally defined classes.
- the profile is downloaded either as a new class profile that has a new class name or downloads to the class to be replaced by the other existing class.
- the LPRFs may reform the network using the LPRF network organization methods of the present invention.
- LPRF “wakes up”, it determines whether it is capable to become a primary. If the health of the device is sufficient, it sends out a message to other LPRFs of its class that it wants to be a primary.
- the LPRFs will send out a special message identifying itself as part of an MLG, NIM or HIM.
- the purpose of this message is to inform the LPRFs (in stand-alone mode) that they have additional capabilities.
- the identifying message allows the HIM to query information from the LPRFs or RFTs while the message from the NIM and MLG indicate ability to communicate to the server application.
- the LPRF will read all RFTs within range.
- the profile downloaded from the server will help the LPRF control mis-reads and extra tags. Multiple reads of the tags insures high reliability.
- an LPRF Upon formation of an ad hoc network, an LPRF stores identifiers that describe the LPRFs network neighbors in adjacent levels of the network hierarchy. The primary will have all the IDs for its secondaries, while the secondaries store data on the primary and any sub-secondary LPRFs. The knowledge of communication links, both upstream and downstream will support responsiveness to queries from the network server.
- LPRF radios will store class information about other radios in the vicinity.
- the LPRFs will support queries from the network server to supply the local class information back to the network server, regardless of whether the reported class is maintains connectivity to the server.
- Class Structure Secondary only The secondary only designation provides entry into a system without giving network formation rights.
- the LPRF with this designation in the profile is allowed to act like the other secondary LPRFs but is unable to take on the role of a primary in the system. This allows the LPRF the ability to move from class to class without disturbing the network formation.
- a practical use could allow a customer who walks into a distributor (e.g., Costco) to read item names, cost or location of items in the store, without interrupting or usurping the distributor's asset tracking network.
- a distributor e.g., Costco
