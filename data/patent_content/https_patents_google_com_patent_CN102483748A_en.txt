Embodiment
In the described map search method of this document, the map search processing engines is by input clauses and subclauses user input, that be used to inquire about, and is provided for reflecting one or more Search Results of this user's interest based on the information in these input clauses and subclauses.For example, the user possibly want search about particular items (for example, commerce) or about be positioned at the particular geographic location place, within or near the information of the entity of particular types.Can realize the map search method and system described in this paper; To allow user's typing input clauses and subclauses in single frame; Discern the position part that is used for being illustrated in the included geographic position of these input clauses and subclauses of these input clauses and subclauses intelligently, and the query portion that can the entity list of entity or particular types be shown ferret out of these input clauses and subclauses.For example; Can handle the user who is entered in the single frame and import clauses and subclauses " hotel, Yantai ", with parse the position part " Yantai " that is used for specified geographic location and be used to represent be positioned at this geographical location, within or near the query portion " hotel " of ferret out.Therefore, the map search engine identifies that the user is intended to search among the Yantai City or the hotel and the place of execution graph search of periphery.
To import that clauses and subclauses are cut apart or when resolving to position part and query portion, at first should import clauses and subclauses and resolve to one or more sections, and section divided into groups with construction location part and query portion.During resolving, so identification is used for the sequence of symbol, letter, speech or the phrase of presentation address relevant information, and correspondingly with being called as " item " single significant section in this sequence analysis Cheng Zaiben document.Can realize identification through for example using the one or more dictionary of address relevant information or databases of comprising to the address relevant information.
During clauses and subclauses resolve to input, can parameter " type " be distributed to or note is given, whether comprise the address relevant information with this item of indication, and if comprise the address relevant information, then indicate the type of this represented address relevant information.The type note can be used for increasing the accuracy of map search.Can be through for example carrying out types of comments with reference to one or more dictionaries or database employed in the parse operation, that comprise the address relevant information.
The type of can predefine giving a note.For example, type can comprise the grade of administrative region, such as " province ", " city ", " district ", " county ", " township ", " town ", " village ", so that note is used to represent the item of this type of administrative region.Type can also comprise type " road ", with the item in indication expression road or street.Type can also comprise and be used to indicate address suffix or the prefix corresponding to the item of specific address suffix or prefix, such as " address name suffix ", " direction suffix " (for example, south, north etc.) and " measure word suffix ".It should be noted that define styles " sky " with note not the presentation address relevant information the item.To whether with type " sky " distribute to an item confirm to depend on by map search engine one or more dictionaries that use, that comprise the address relevant information or the clauses and subclauses in the database, and can type " sky " be distributed to the item that is used for representing true geographic position but in employed one or more dictionaries that comprise the address relevant information of parse operation or database, does not have coupling.For different language, can be used for item is carried out the type of note based on the concrete definition of language characteristic.
In some are realized, can before implementing map search, carry out and resolve.Just in this point; Search engine can use the result's of parse operation position part at first to confirm the position; For example through when the type that is associated indication address relevant information and when not being " sky ", search geocoding database is to obtain by longitude and latitude or by the geographic coordinate sign indicating number (being called as geocoding) of additive method mark.When the type of item is " sky ", does not for example carry out the position that the search of the geocoding through item carries out and confirm.After confirming the position, for example, after finding the geocoding that joins with the position part correlation, carry out, and send Search Results to the user for search by the position of for example this geocoding definition or near query portion.Can use a kind of like this realization of this method to avoid depending on and come the place of execution graph search based on initial input clauses and subclauses or its section; And need not pre-service; For example; In to the search of geocoding of coupling, just initial input clauses and subclauses or its section are sent to the geocoding database through need not pre-service, wherein this realization is at first resolved and is imported clauses and subclauses with extraction and home position part and query portion and confirm the position through the geocoding of for example obtaining the position part subsequently.And above-mentioned realization can support to carry out and send according to effective and efficient manner and in short search time map search, and this effective and efficient manner has high accuracy in the searching of correlation map Search Results.
In this document, with resolving and the operation of types of comments is referred to as " tokenization ".Can be described as input clauses and subclauses token is changed into the sequence or the sequence of tokens of token with the input clauses and subclauses section of resolving to and to the parse operation of section type of comment of input clauses and subclauses with being used for, wherein by be used to represent these input clauses and subclauses section and note to this, the type of the address relevant information that is used to indicate which kind of kind of this expression defines each token.Can confirm the position part and the query portion of input clauses and subclauses through sequence of tokens being divided into position part and query portion.
When realizing that will import clauses and subclauses resolves to position part and query portion; Can use statistical model that the statistics scoring is provided; Various possible section different grouping with to these input clauses and subclauses is graded, and can select to have the result of the section of the highest statistics score as parse operation.Can and use the training data that obtains from different data sources (such as metadata provider, government organs, phone directory etc. such as Yellow Page) to train the statistical model this paper based on training pattern.Training data comprises address and title, and title is the title (such as trading company) of entity.In training pattern; Each title and address token are turned to sequence of tokens; And for particular item sequence and type sequence included in item, type and the sequence of tokens, be recorded in frequency that occurs in the title and the frequency that in the address, occurs, when sequence of tokens is divided into position part and query portion; Based on the frequency that writes down in the statistical model, each possible cutting apart is counted the score.Based on the score that provides by statistical model, can use the particular filter rule and get rid of and incorrectly cut apart and select correct cutting apart.
Fig. 1 is the example that is applicable to the network system 100 that realizes the described map search system and method for this document.Network system 100 comprises one or more clients 110, and client 110 is connected to one or more servers 120 via network 130 or communicates by letter with one or more servers 120, and network 130 provides communicating by letter of client 110 and server 120.Example among Fig. 1 shows two clients 110 and two servers 120 for simplicity.In various realizations, network system 100 can comprise more or less client 110 and server 120.In some were realized, client 110 can be carried out some functions of server 120, and server 120 can be carried out some functions of client 110.Can be according in network system 100, realizing the map search engine in the various configurations, for example in one or more servers 120 or in one or more servers 120 and one or more client 110 in the two.
Can realize client 110 according to various forms, these forms comprise such as the equipment of mobile phone, personal computer, PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), laptop computer etc. or the object that operates in thread or the process on one of these equipment and/or can be carried out by one of these equipment.Each client 110 comprises and is used for receiving the input clauses and subclauses and presenting the map search interface for the Search Results of these input clauses and subclauses to this user from the user, and the communication interface that is used for receiving to one or more server 120 these input clauses and subclauses of transmission and from one or more servers 120 via network 130 Search Results.
In the example in Fig. 1; Each server 120 comprises server entity, this server entity comprise the resolution system 200 map search engine, that be used to resolve the input clauses and subclauses that receive via network 130 and map search engine, be used for the map search system 140 that analysis result based on resolution system 200 comes the place of execution graph search and returns Search Results.Transmit Search Results via network 130 to client 110.In some were realized, resolution system 200 was arranged in different separately servers with map search system 140.In other are realized, resolution system 200 is integrated into the part of map search system 140.Can in client 110 and the server 120 each be connected to network 130 via one or more communication links (for example, wired and wireless communication link be connected).
Can realize networks 130 according to the configuration of various communication networks, these configuration such as Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) (MAN), telephone network, Intranet, the Internet or two or more these and the combination of other networks.
Fig. 2 shows the example that is used for cut apart or resolve to the resolution system 200 of position part " where " and query portion " what " from the input clauses and subclauses of user's inquiry; Wherein position part " where " expression is by this specified position of input clauses and subclauses, and query portion " what " expression is used to search for the request of the target that is associated with this position.For example; The input clauses and subclauses can be " dining room, Shanghai " (Shanghai Restaurant); Wherein " dining room " is that to be used to indicate the target of user search be the query portion in dining room, and " Shanghai " be used for indicating the position of this query aim be Shanghai City or near the position part.Based on this parsing of being undertaken by resolution system 200, map search system 140 search in " Shanghai " or near " dining room " and return Search Results and send to the user being used to.
As an example; Can resolution system 200 be embodied as and comprise based on the one or more dictionaries of address relevant information or the token device of database; With the input clauses and subclauses of analyzing user queries, thereby make and to keep to import location name in the clauses and subclauses as single section by the token device.This token device can use the dictionary that comprises management entity title, zone name and road name and various suffix and prefix to carry out the parsing to the input clauses and subclauses, to minimize for the undesirable separation as the section of location name of input in the clauses and subclauses.For example, resolution system 200 can remain Chinese street name included in the input in Chinese clauses and subclauses " subtlety road " (Chengfu Road) section rather than be divided into littler fragment.Search accuracy that the identification of this address information is resolved and search response time often are superior to using the search accuracy and the search response time of the parsing of following divider system; This divider system nonrecognition address relevant information and will import location name included in the clauses and subclauses and be divided into littler fragment wherein is such as Chinese street name " subtlety road " is divided into independent Chinese character " city ", " mansion ", " road ".In various realizations, the token device can be to the section type of comment of input clauses and subclauses, indicating whether presentation address relevant information of this section, and if presentation address relevant information then indicate the kind of the represented address relevant information of this section.
Token module 210 is based on can importing the clauses and subclauses token and change into token from the relevant and location dependent information in address that for example dictionary 240 obtains.In realization; Can token be defined as item that comprises the section that is used to represent to import clauses and subclauses and the type that note is given this, the type is used to indicate this whether presentation address relevant information and if then indicate the address relevant information of what kind of this expression.Token module 210 can the identification address relevant information, and address relevant information token is changed into significant token.For example; Can be identified as the road name and its token is turned to single token by the Chinese phrase " subtlety road " that token module 210 will be imported in the clauses and subclauses, this single token comprises that phrase " subtlety road " is as item and type " road " parameter that is used for referring expression " subtlety road " expression road name.Token module 210 can use address dictionary 240 relevant or location dependent information to carry out tokenization.Dictionary 240 memory address relevant informations.
Fig. 3 is the synoptic diagram that is used to illustrate the exemplary configurations of dictionary 240.Dictionary 240 has dictionary entry (DE) 300, and each DE 300 has two fields: a field 310 and type field 320.The item or the phrase of item field 310 storage representation address relevant informations.This can be the address title, for example, and title of administrative region (such as " Beijing ", " Chaoyang District ", " Chaoyang ") or road name (such as " Chang Dedao " and " subtlety road ").Item can also the relevant prefix of relevant suffix of presentation address or address.For example, can be address title suffix (such as " province ", " city ", " district ", " county ", " township ", " town ", " village ", " road ", " road "), direction prefix or suffix (such as " east ", " west ", " south ", " north ", " northeast ", " southeast ", " northwest ", " southwest ") or measure word suffix (such as " number ").Item can also be other speech and the expression that can be used to describe the address, for example, and numeral.The type field 320 of DE300 comprises the type of the type that is used to indicate this represented address relevant information.Can define different types.For example, type comprises rank (such as " province ", " city ", " district ", " county ", " township ", " town ", " village "), address suffix or the prefix (such as " address title suffix ", " direction suffix " and " measure word suffix ") of administrative region.Type can also comprise the type " road " that is defined as the respective items that is used to indicate expression road name, and be defined as the respective items that is used for indication expression number (for example, street Taoist monastic name) type " number ".Can also define other types as required.Alternatively, the DE 300 of dictionary 240 also has language field 330, to indicate this language, for example, Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Japanese, Korean etc.In some are realized, make up dictionary 240 based on available data (such as existing address information database).In some are realized, the dictionary entry of predefine dictionary as required.
Return with reference to figure 2, token module 210 receives the input clauses and subclauses, will import the clauses and subclauses token and turn to token, and output token result is as sequence of tokens.In some were realized, token module 210 was at first carried out tokenization based on dictionary 240, so that address related term or section in the identification input clauses and subclauses.As an example, token module 210 uses forward direction maximum match (FMM) method to carry out tokenization based on dictionary 240.The word string that the FMM method is selected to comprise some characters (for example, Chinese character) is as initial maximum word string, and confirm initial maximum word string whether with dictionary 240 in the item coupling.If any in initial maximum word string and the dictionary 240 does not all match; Then continue confirming to this coupling through deduct a character from this initial maximum word string; And the word string of confirming to comprise all the other characters whether with dictionary 240 in the item coupling, till in dictionary 240, finding occurrence or this word string to be reduced to sky.Occurrence that in dictionary 240, finds and the type that is associated with this occurrence become the item and the type of token.Except the FMM method, can also use additive method, for example, the back is to maximum match (BMM) method and two-way coupling (BM) method.Can in open source literature, find some examples that are used to realize FMM method, BMM method and BM method.
Import possible locative one or more parts of clauses and subclauses based on the above processing ID of dictionary 240.In some are realized, be not stored in the dictionary 240 even be used as for specific number, token module 210 also can identifier, and its token changed into have type " number " token.In some are realized; For input the unrecognized of clauses and subclauses is the part of address relevant information; Promptly import the part that in dictionary 240, does not have occurrence of clauses and subclauses; Token module 210 can be divided into speech with it, makes these speech become the item of token, and is " sky " with the types of comments of this token.Type " sky " indication respective items does not belong to any kind of definition in the dictionary 240, and respective items presentation address relevant information not.For example, when to input in Chinese clauses and subclauses " big light fixture city, city " when carrying out token, token module 210 can be through confirming that as the dictionary 240 of location name Chinese phrases " city is big " are not location names with reference to the dictionary entry that does not have " city is big ".
By being associated of token module 210 token that generates and the statistics scores that provide by statistical model 250, and parsing module 230 this statistics score of consideration in the time will importing clauses and subclauses and resolve to position part and query portion.The model training module 220 that resolution system 200 is provided is to be used for training and to upgrade statistical model 250.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram that is used to illustrate the example of the process of being carried out in order to train statistical model 250 by model training module 220 400.
At step S410, model training module 220 obtains training data from one or more sources.In some are realized, can obtain training data from two frame inquiry logs.To be used for the application of high-performance search, can obtain training data in the mass deficiency of two frame daily records from other sources.For example, can training data be provided by data provider such as commercial entity or government department.Can also (such as Yellow Page, map data base etc.) obtain training data from other sources.Training data comprises address and title.The title of title presentation-entity, for example, like the Business Name of " Google ", like the building title of " section builds mansion ", like government organs' title of " Beijing Municipal Government ".The example of address comprises " No. 29, Zongguancun Street, Haidian District, Beijing City ".In some are realized,, the raw data of original acquisition need carry out pre-service before being used as training data to these former data that begin.To the pre-service of raw data is in order to remove the unnecessary part of these data, for example, and the tail tag topic (trailing title) in the prefix title of the administrative region in the title (prefixing name), the address etc.
For example, if the fragment of the raw data of title is " shallow lake, a Haidian District, Beijing City hospital ", this pre-service is filtered into pure title " Haidian hospital " through removing the administrative region title " Haidian District, Beijing City " of prefix with it so.As another example; For the fragment of the raw data of address " No. 29 Haidian hospitals in Zongguancun Street, Haidian District, Beijing City ", this pre-service is filtered into pure address " No. 29, Zongguancun Street, Haidian District, Beijing City " through the hospital name " Haidian hospital " of removing suffix with it.
At step S420; Model training module 220 to the token module (for example; Token module 210) transmission by one in the title in the pretreated training data and the address carrying out tokenization, and from this token module reception with item and type sequence of tokens as token result's token.Alternatively, carry out type at step S430 and correct, to correct in this token sequence the type of note by error.Carrying out type according to some predefined rules corrects.For example, rule can stipulate if having the Xiang Wei of type " measure word suffix " follow closely and have type " number " item, change type " measure word suffix " into type " sky " so.For example, after tokenization carry out in address " No. 29, street, Zhong Guan-cun ", obtain to have type " number " item " 29 " and acquisition item with type " measure word suffix " " number ".Owing to have item " 29 " of item " number " follow closely and have type " number " of type " measure word suffix ", thus will not change item " number ".Yet, after title " China's time-honored brand Donglaishun " carry out tokenization, possibly obtain to have type " measure word suffix " item " number ", but identical Chinese character " number " no longer expression number but the trade mark of expression commercial undertaking.Therefore, the type will be made into type " sky ".Selectively, at step S440, can the sequence of tokens discipline be belonged to identical suffix or the adjacent token of prefix types is combined into single token.
At step S450,, respectively the number of times that occurs in title and the address is counted for type in the sequence of tokens and item.In some are realized, carry out counting for a particular type sequence in the sequence of tokens and a sequence.In some are realized, count for the number of times that following project occurs in title and address:
-meta-model, it is single,
-binary model, it is the item sequence of being made up of two adjacent items,
-type is the sequence of the adjacent item of " sky ",
-whole sequence,
-type one meta-model, it is single type,
-type binary model, it is the type sequence of being made up of two adjacent types, and
The sequence of-all types
For example; When being turned to, address " Da Tun road, Chaoyang, Beijing " token comprises a plurality of tokens: [: Beijing, type: city], [: Chaoyang, type: district] and [: the Da Tun road; Type: road] sequence of tokens the time, will count for following appearance in the address:
Item one meta-model: " Beijing ", " Chaoyang ", " Da Tun road ";
The item binary model: " Chaoyang, Beijing ", Da Tun road, Chaoyang ";
Whole sequence: " Da Tun road, Chaoyang, Beijing ";
Type one meta-model: " city ", " district ", " road ";
Type binary model: " city, district " " district, road ";
The sequence of all types: " city, district, road ";
Type in the sequence of adjacency is not counted for the above-mentioned item of " sky " in this example; This is because at sequence of tokens [item: Beijing; Type: city], not have type in [: Chaoyang, type: district] and [: Da Tun road, type: road] be the item of " sky ".
At step S460, for each project that is counted, the number of times of in model 250, storing its number of times that in title, occurs and occurring respectively in the address.
Fig. 5 shows the exemplary configurations of model 250.Model 250 comprises model clauses and subclauses (ME) 500.Each project that is counted has corresponding model clauses and subclauses in model 250.In a realization, the model clauses and subclauses have 4 fields:
-" project " field 510 is used for record a meta-model, type one meta-model and comprises that type is one or more content of sequence of item or type sequence, all sequence, type binary model and all types of sequence of the adjacency of " sky ";
-" item types " field 520, the type that is used to write down this project is following which kind of item types: a meta-model, type one meta-model, type binary model, a binary model, type are the sequence of the adjacency of " sky ", sequence all, the sequence of all types;
-" number of times that in title, occurs " field 530, how many times appears in the project that its record is corresponding in title; And
-" number of times that in the address, occurs " field 540, how many times appears in the project that its record is corresponding in the address.
In some were realized, the model clauses and subclauses can also have the 5th field " language " field 550, are used to indicate the language of this project.
The example that consideration is counted project " Da Tun road, Chaoyang " to address " Da Tun road, Chaoyang, Beijing " at step S450.If there are not following existing model clauses and subclauses; Its " project " field, " item types " field and " language " are if field exists then all matees with project " Da Tun road, Chaoyang "; Then use value is that 0 " number of times that in title, occurs " field, value are that 1 " number of times that in the address, occurs " field and value are " language " field of " Chinese " for " project " field on " Da Tun road, Chaoyang ", value for " item types " field, the value of " binary model ", creates the model clauses and subclauses on " Da Tun road, Chaoyang ".
When having its " project " field, " item types " field and " language " field all with the existing model clauses and subclauses of project " Da Tun road, Chaoyang " coupling; Then the value with " number of times that in the address, occurs " fields of this model clauses and subclauses increases by 1, and the value of other fields of these model clauses and subclauses remains unchanged.As a concrete example, consider for address " Da Tun road, Chaoyang, Beijing " another example that project " city, district, road " (its type is " an all types sequence ") is counted.If having its " project " field is that " city, district, road ", " item types " field are that " all types sequence " and " language " field are the existing model clauses and subclauses of " Chinese "; Promptly exist its " project " field, " item types " field and " language " field all with the existing clauses and subclauses of project " city, district, road " coupling; Then the value of " number of times that in title, occurs " field of model clauses and subclauses and " language " field remains unchanged, and the value of " number of times that in the address, occurs " fields of this model clauses and subclauses is increased by 1.
In step 470, whether the training pattern inspection has handled all titles and address.If handled all titles and address, then accomplished the process 400 that is used to train statistical model 250, and generated or upgrade statistical model 250 for using when the input clauses and subclauses of resolving from user inquiring by parsing module 230.Otherwise process 400 turns back to step S420 to handle next title or address.
Can realize the training undertaken by model training module 220 according to variety of way to statistical model 250.In some were realized, for example, model training module 220 train statistical model 250 when the beginning of the operation of system 200, and periodically or when particular event takes place (for example when the renewal training data) renewal statistical model 250.
Parsing module 230 can use the statistical model 250 that is generated by model training module 220 to confirm position statistics score and query statistic score to project, token or sequence of tokens." project " indicated a kind of like this project herein; Number of times for this project occurs in title and address is counted, and promptly a meta-model, a binary model, type are the sequence of sequence, type one meta-model, type binary model or all types of the sequence of the adjacent item of " sky ", whole items.Position statistics score indication this project, token or the sequence of tokens probability relevant of project, token or sequence of tokens with the position.The indication of query statistic score this project, token or the sequence of tokens and the relevant probability of inquiry (being entity title or entity class) of project, token or sequence of tokens.
In some are realized,, can count the position statistics score and the query statistic score of this project through using equality (1) and (2) respectively so if project has corresponding clauses and subclauses in statistical model 250:
Position statistics score=log (l_count) * l_count/ (l_count+q_count) of project ... Equality (1);
Query statistic score=log (q_count) * q_count/ (l_count+q_count) of project ... Equality (2),
Wherein l_count and q_count are illustrated respectively in number of times storage, that this project occurs in the statistical model 250 in address and title.For example; When adding up score and query statistic score for the project calculating location of item one meta-model " Chaoyang "; If a number of times that a meta-model " Chaoyang " occurs in address and title is respectively N1 and N2; Then the position statistics score with this project is calculated as logN1*N1/ (N1+N2), and the query statistic score of this project is calculated as logN2*N2/ (N1+N2).If project does not have corresponding clauses and subclauses in statistical model 250, position statistics score and the query statistic score assignment for this project is " 0 " so.
In some are realized, the position statistics score of token is defined as this token item (meta-model) position statistics score and the type (type one meta-model) of this token position statistics score and.
Hereinafter is described and is used for based on the illustrative methods of statistical model 250 for sequence of tokens calculating location statistics score and query statistic score.
Fig. 7 A illustrates the example process 700A of the position statistics score that is used for the computational token sequence.At step S710, confirm a position score for sequence of tokens.Item position score is based on the statistics score of confirming about the position statistics score of the project of the item of this token sequence.Diagram and be described in the realization hereinafter, be used for confirming the process of the item position score of sequence of tokens in Fig. 7 B.At step S720, confirm type position score for sequence of tokens.Type position score is based on the statistics score of confirming about the position statistics score of the project of the type of this token sequence.Diagram and be described in the realization hereinafter, be used for confirming the process of the type position score of sequence of tokens in Fig. 7 C.At step S730, through the position statistics score that the item position score and the type position score of sequence of tokens are sued for peace to confirm this token sequence.
Fig. 7 B shows the example process 700B of the item position score that is used for definite sequence of tokens.At step S7102, first token in the sequence of tokens is defined as current token.At step S7104, confirm the position statistics score of the following items (if having this project) of sequence of tokens through reference statistical model 250: " meta-model " of current token and with " binary model " of the item beginning of current token and " type is adjacent the sequence of ' sky ' ".At step S7108, be chosen in the item position score of position statistics score the highest in the position statistics score of confirming among the step S7104 as current token.At step S7112; Confirm in this token sequence, whether have next token; And if the result that should confirm is for being (in step S7112 for being), whether then at step S7114, having considered when confirming in the position of definite current token score should next one token.Should next one token if considered (in step S7114 for being); Then skip the token of having considered; And process 700B proceeds step S7112, otherwise (in step S7114 for not), should next one token if when confirming the item position score of current token, do not consider; Then should be defined as current token (step S7116) by next one token, and process 700B turns back to step S7104.At step S7112, if confirm in this token sequence, not exist next token (being not) in step S7112, then process 700B advances to step S7118 with the result items position score summation to token, as score S1.Next, through reference statistical model 250, confirm the position statistics score (being labeled as score S2) of the project " all sequences of item " of sequence of tokens at step S7120.At step S7126; Relatively score S1 and S2, and if score S1 be equal to or greater than score S2 (in step S7126 for being), then a position score of this token sequence is confirmed as score S1 (step S7128); Otherwise; If score S1 then confirms as score S2 (step S7130) with the item position score of this token sequence less than score S2 (being not) in step S7126, process 700B accomplishes then.
Next, through describe the example process 700C of the type position score that is used for definite sequence of tokens with reference to figure 7C.At step S7202, first token in the sequence of tokens is defined as current token.At step S7204, confirm the position statistics score of the following items of sequence of tokens through reference statistical model 250: " the type binary model " that " type one meta-model " of current token and (if existence) begin with the type of current token.At step S7208, be chosen in the higher position of confirming among the step S7204 and add up the type position score of score as current token.When current token is last token in the sequence of tokens, " the type binary model " that does not certainly exist the type with current token to begin, and the type position of this current token is that score is added up in the position of " type one meta-model ".At step S7212; Confirm in this token sequence, whether have next token; And if the result that should confirm is for being (in step S7212 for being), whether then at step S7214, having considered when confirming in the type position of definite current token score should next one token.Should next one token if considered (in step S7214 for being); Then skip the token of having considered; And process 700C proceeds step S7212, otherwise, should next one token if when confirming the type position score of current token, do not consider (in step S7214 for not); Then should be defined as current token (step S7216) by next one token, and process 700C turns back to step S7204.At step S7212, if confirm in this token sequence, not exist next token (being not) in step S7212, then process 700C advances to step S7218 with the result type position score summation to token, and the result is marked as score S3.Next, at step S7220,, confirm the position statistics score (this score is marked as score S4) of the project " sequence of all types " of sequence of tokens through reference statistical model 250.At step S7226; Relatively score S3 and S4, and if score S3 be equal to or greater than score S4 (in step S7226 for being), then the type position score of this token sequence is confirmed as score S3 (step S7228); Otherwise; If score S3 then confirms as score S4 (step S7230) with the type position score of this token sequence less than score S4 (being not) in step S7226, process 700C accomplishes then.
Can add up the query statistic score that score is confirmed sequence of tokens similarly with the position.Fig. 8 A illustrates the example process 800A of the query statistic score of computational token sequence.Can be through the query statistic score that the item inquiry score and the type inquiry score of sequence of tokens are sued for peace to confirm sequence of tokens; Wherein, Inquiry score is based on the statistics score of confirming about the query statistic score of the project of the item of this token sequence, and type inquiry score is based on the statistics score of confirming about the query statistic score of the project of the type of this token sequence.
Fig. 8 B illustrates the example process 800B of the item inquiry score of computational token sequence, and Fig. 8 C illustrates the example process 800C of the type inquiry score of computational token sequence.Be appreciated that the detail operations of Fig. 8 A-Fig. 8 C for the associated description of Fig. 7 A-Fig. 7 C through reference.
Below be the example of query statistic score that is used to confirm to have the input sequence of tokens of following three tokens:
: Beijing, type: city
; The Chaoyang, type: district
: Da Tun road, type: road
At first the item of computational token sequence is inquired about score.This calculating starts from definition first token " item: Beijing; type: city " as current token; And confirm the item inquiry score of this current token: confirm item one meta-model " Beijing " of these current tokens and with the query statistic score of the item binary model " Chaoyang, Beijing " of the item beginning of this current token through reference statistical model 250; Relatively two result queries are added up scores and (are for example selected higher query statistic score; The query statistic score of " Chaoyang, Beijing ") as the item inquiry score of current token, it is labeled as score ST1.Then, skip token ": Chaoyang, type: district " because when this current token of confirming to have " Beijing " inquire about score the time considered this of this token.Next token is " item: Da Tun road; type: road "; When confirming the item inquiry score of current token, do not consider this token, so this token " item: Da Tun road, type: road " is defined as current token; And item inquiry score that will this current token is confirmed as the query statistic score of the monobasic model terms that is stored in the model, is labeled as score ST2.Score ST1 and score ST2 are sued for peace, and the query statistic score of result and whole sequence (all sequences of item) " Da Tun road, Chaoyang, Beijing " is compared, select higher query statistic score to inquire about score as the item of this token sequence.
Next, calculate the type inquiry score of input sequence of tokens.As stated; First token in this token sequence " item: Beijing; type: city " is defined as current token; And the calculating of the type inquiry score of input sequence of tokens is started from the type inquiry score of confirming this current token ": Beijing; type: city ": confirm type one meta-model " city " of these current tokens and the query statistic score of the type binary model " urban district " that begins with the type of this current token through reference model 250, the query statistic score that is relatively obtained and select higher query statistic score (the for example query statistic score in " city ") to inquire about score as the type of first token is labeled as score ST3 with it.Then; Next token " item: Chaoyang; type: district " is defined as current token, and confirms the query statistic score of type one meta-model " district " and type binary model " Qu Lu ", and (for example select higher query statistic score through reference statistical model 250; The query statistic score of type binary model " Qu Lu ") as the type inquiry score of second token, is labeled as score ST4.Skip the 3rd token, because when confirming the type inquiry score of previous token " item: Chaoyang, type: district ", considered the 3rd token.Score ST3 and score ST4 are sued for peace, and the query statistic score of result and whole type sequence (sequence of all types) " urban district road " is compared, select the type inquiry score of higher query statistic score as this token sequence.
At this moment, the item inquiry score and the type of sequence of tokens are inquired about score add and be in the same place, and the result is the query statistic score of sequence of tokens.
Return with reference to figure 2, the parsing module 230 of system 200 will be imported clauses and subclauses and resolve to position part and query portion.Fig. 6 A is used to illustrate the process flow diagram that is used for being resolved by parsing module 230 the example process 600A of input clauses and subclauses.
At step S610, for example import clauses and subclauses and it carry out tokenization, and obtain sequence of tokens through using token module 210 to receive.Input clauses and subclauses token is turned to the sequence of coming the token of note with type.As stated, these input clauses and subclauses can be by the user in client terminal 210 places inputs and be transferred to parsing module 230 via network 130.
Alternatively, at step S620, can carry out aftertreatment and correct the type that rule corrects apparent error in this token sequence to use predefined type.Type corrects rule and is used to correct the type of apparent error of note of giving token.In various realizations, can come definition rule: condition and target action or value through two parts.If satisfy condition, then carry out the target action or return desired value.For example, type correct rule can stipulate if having the token of type " measure word suffix " be not immediately following have type " number " token, then type " measure word suffix " is changed into type " sky ".Described in example before; With title " China's time-honored brand Donglaishun " the item " number " initial type of comment " measure word suffix " make type " sky " into; Because " number " though use with " number " identical Chinese character, " number " trade mark of expression enterprise and its make up use to represent " old established firm " with " old word ".
At step S630; For each position between two adjacent tokens in the sequence of tokens; For example, confirm that through using the predefined rule of not cutting apart whether it be can divided possible position, and if its obviously be impossible position then filter out this position.Do not cut apart rule and be used to stipulate should not to be the position of split position.For example, do not cut apart rule can stipulate to have the token of type " street " and have type " number " token between the position should not be split position.The operation that filters out the split position of apparent error can reduce the noise effect (effects of noises) in the statistical model 250.
At step S640, for each possible partitioning scheme computed segmentation score.The statistical probability of cutting apart the correctness of this possible partitioning scheme of score indication.By query portion and position part definition partitioning scheme.Each possible partitioning scheme is corresponding to a possible split position.Possible split position can be the position between two adjacent tokens in the sequence of tokens, and it is divided into two parts with sequence of tokens.Possible split position can also be first token position or last token position afterwards before of this token sequence, and it " is divided into " a sub-sequence of tokens with this token sequence.More specifically; Be divided into two parts about the possible split position between two adjacent tokens in the sequence of tokens and with sequence of tokens; I.e. two sub-sequence of tokens; For each the sub-sequence of tokens in these two sub-sequence of tokens, confirm that through for example using Fig. 7 A-Fig. 7 C and the process shown in Fig. 8 A-Fig. 8 C query statistic score and position add up score.The probability that the position of sub-sequence of tokens this sub-sequence of tokens of statistics score indication is the position part, and this sub-sequence of tokens of the query statistic score of sub-sequence of tokens indication probability that is query portion.Between two sub-sequence of tokens that are divided into by possible split position; A sub-sequence of tokens that will have higher position statistics score is regarded as importing the possible position part of clauses and subclauses, and another sub-sequence of tokens is regarded as the possible query portion of these input clauses and subclauses.Based on the query statistic score of the position of the position part of cutting apart statistics score and the query portion cut apart, confirm the possible score of cutting apart of this correspondence.As an example, through to the position statistics score of this possible position part and the query statistic score summation of this possible query portion, confirm the score that this is cut apart.In addition, about sequence of tokens being divided into the possible split position of a sub-sequence of tokens, confirm position statistics score and query statistic score for whole sequence of tokens.Through whole sequence of tokens is regarded as the position part; Confirm possible partitioning scheme corresponding to this position; And if statistics score in the position of whole sequence of tokens is higher than the query statistic score of this whole sequence of tokens, then this is cut apart the position statistics score that score is confirmed as this whole sequence of tokens.Similarly; Through whole sequence of tokens is regarded as query portion; Confirm possible partitioning scheme corresponding to the position that sequence of tokens is divided into a sub-sequence of tokens; And if the query statistic score of whole sequence of tokens is higher than the position statistics score of whole sequence of tokens, then this is cut apart the query statistic score that score is confirmed as whole sequence of tokens.
Alternatively, can confirm to comprise the inquiry multiplier that is used for query portion and two multipliers that are used for the position multiplier of position part, to be used to adjust the query statistic score of query portion and the position statistics score of position part.Any one in inquiry multiplier of cutting apart if possible and the position multiplier is zero and can gets rid of this possible cutting apart.Can confirm multiplier as follows.At first confirm to comprise the basic query multiplier that is used for query portion and two basic multipliers that are used for the home position multiplier of position part.In a realization, be predetermined value with basic multiplier predefine.In another is realized, confirm basic multiplier based on the item and the length of two parts.Can directly basic multiplier be used as inquiry multiplier and position multiplier.Alternatively, can or reduce and adjust the basic multiplier in position, and will be used as the position multiplier through the basic multiplier in adjustment position through lifting.For example, if the sequence of tokens of position part comprises the address component (such as [province+city+district+street]) by rank order, then can the raised position multiplier.Can calculate the length of graduation management address (such as city, district) and the length of the conventional address of graduation (such as street, building), and can increase weighted value to the basic multiplier in position.As another example, if the sequence of tokens of position part comprises the address component not according to rank order, basic multiplier then dips.As another example, if in sequence of tokens, there is the address component (such as " BeiJing, Beijing City ") of repetition, basic multiplier then dips.After confirming inquiry multiplier and position multiplier, use institute to confirm to inquire about multiplier and the position multiplier is adjusted the query statistic score of query portion and score is added up in the position of position part.Particularly, the query statistic score of query portion and inquiry multiplier are multiplied each other, and the position statistics score and the position multiplier of position part multiplied each other.Can be through adjusted query statistic score and position statistics score be sued for peace to confirm the score that this is cut apart.
Alternatively, at step S650, to each possible allocation priority of cutting apart.Can use two other right of priority of level and can it be expressed as two numerals 1 and 0, wherein 1 is that higher-priority and 0 is than low priority.Allocation priority as follows.For example, about corresponding to the cutting apart of the split position between two adjacent tokens in the sequence of tokens, be that separator by such as space, comma etc. is cut apart if this is cut apart, then this right of priority of cutting apart is 1.Otherwise, if cutting apart, this is not to cut apart by separator, then this right of priority of cutting apart is 0.For whole sequence of tokens is cutting apart of query portion or position part, if the input clauses and subclauses comprise separator, then this right of priority of cutting apart is 1, otherwise this right of priority of cutting apart is 0.
At step S660, possible cutting apart sorted, and select the highest possible cutting apart as analysis result.In a realization, possible cutting apart sorted through cutting apart score.In each possible another realization of cutting apart allocation priority, can at first sort to possible cutting apart through assigning to again then through right of priority.As stated, query portion of cutting apart through the result and position part represent that this result cuts apart.
Alternatively, at step S670, confirm whether whole input clauses and subclauses are possible positions.If the input clauses and subclauses satisfy any following condition then it is confirmed as possible position: 1) these input clauses and subclauses satisfy some specified conditions, and for example, these input clauses and subclauses end up with numeral; And 2) whole position cut apart (being that whole sequence of tokens is the position part) be have second top score cut apart and ratio that score that this is cut apart and best result cut score is higher than predetermined threshold.If whole input clauses and subclauses are confirmed as possible position, being position parts with whole input clauses and subclauses then, this is cut apart and is regarded as additional result and cuts apart, and can this additional result be cut apart as a reference and export.
Alternatively, at step S680, cut apart for each result and to confirm to cut apart degree of confidence (confidence) score.Cut apart the degree of confidence of degree of confidence score indication for this correctness of cutting apart.In a realization, with the carve information score as giving a definition.At first, define for project the inquiry degree of confidence score and the position degree of confidence score of (comprising that meta-model, a binary model, type are the sequence of empty adjacent item, sequence, type one meta-model, type binary model all, the sequence of all types) through equality (3) and (4):
Query_conf=query_score/ (query_score+location_score) ... Equality (3)
Location_conf=location_score/ (query_score+location_score) ... Equality (4)
Wherein, query_conf and location_conf are respectively the inquiry degree of confidence score and the position degree of confidence scores of project, and query_score and location_score are respectively the query statistic score and the position statistics score of this project.Secondly; The inquiry degree of confidence score of this query portion of cutting apart is defined as the mean value of inquiry degree of confidence score of the project (Fig. 8 B) of the item inquiry score that is used for confirming this query portion, and the position degree of confidence score of this position part of cutting apart is defined as the mean value of position degree of confidence score of the project (Fig. 7 B) of the item position degree of confidence score that is used for confirming this position part.Cut apart the mean value of inquiry degree of confidence score that the degree of confidence score is defined as position degree of confidence score and this query portion of cutting apart of this position part of cutting apart with what this was cut apart.As an example, cut apart the degree of confidence score and have the value of scope for [0,1], and it is high more to cut apart the degree of confidence score, then the degree of confidence to this correctness of cutting apart is high more.Cut apart the degree of confidence score and also be the additional analysis result that to export as a reference by parsing module 230.
With reference to figure 6A, at step S690, by parsing module 230 output analysis results.This analysis result is included in the result that step S660 obtains and cuts apart.In example process 600A, this analysis result also is included in the additional result of step S670 and step S680 acquisition, and the user of system 200 can be used as reference with it.The user of system 200 comprises the result's of using system 200 module, assembly or system.For example, map search system 140 is one of users of system 200.
Can realize the various processing operations of the above process among Fig. 6 A through alternative processing.Fig. 6 B is the process flow diagram that diagram is used for being resolved by parsing module 230 another example process 600B of input clauses and subclauses.Treatment step S610, S640, S660 and S690 in process 600B is identical with those steps that in the process 600A of Fig. 6 A, have identical reference number in essence.
Described and be used among Fig. 2 will importing the various characteristics that clauses and subclauses resolve to the resolution system 200 of position part and query portion, described map search based on the output of resolution system 200 with the lower part for map search about Fig. 2-Fig. 8 C.In the example of Fig. 1, by the resolution system 200 and the map search system 140 place of execution graph searchs at server 120 places.
Fig. 9 is the process flow diagram that diagram is used for the example process of place of execution graph search.At step S902, receive the input clauses and subclauses by resolution system 200.Can should import clauses and subclauses at client 110 places by the user and be input to the map search interface, and be transferred to resolution system 200 via network 130.At step S904, resolve the input clauses and subclauses by resolution system 200, and will comprise that at least one the analysis result in position part and the query portion is forwarded to map search system 140.Map search system 140 based on or through coming the place of execution graph search with reference to this analysis result.In some were realized, at step S906, map search system 140 position-baseds were partly confirmed target geographical area.For example, map search system 140 can carry out geocoding to the position part, to obtain target geographical area.Can pass through longitude and latitude objective definition geographic area.At step S908, map search system 140 is searched for about the information by the represented one or more targets of the query portion within this target geographical area, and for example returns Search Results to client 110 at step S910, and presents Search Results to the user.
Figure 10 is the block diagram that can be used for realizing the example devices 1000 of map search system and method as herein described.Equipment 1000 comprises treatment facility 1002, first data storage area 1004, second data storage area 1006, input equipment 1008, output device 1010 and network interface 1012.Can use comprise that for example the bus system 1014 of data bus and motherboard is set up and Control Component 1002,1004,1006,1008,1010 and 1012 between data communication.Also can use other exemplary system architecture.
In some were realized, equipment 1000 comprised the code in the data storage area (such as second data storage area 1006).Can define this code by instruction, wherein this instruction makes treatment facility 1002 carry out the function of resolution system 200 and/or map search system 140 when being performed.Dictionary 240 and/or statistical model 250 can be stored in data storage area (such as second data storage area 1006).
In realization, can use independently perhaps use the described process that is used to resolve input clauses and subclauses and place of execution graph search of this document with combining with other map searches or data processing technique.For example, can be by equally using the analysis result of resolution system 200 from the system that the other system that is used to resolve or handle the input clauses and subclauses obtains additional result, and make a decision which result is used for map search.System in this example can use cutting apart degree of confidence and must assign to make a decision by parsing module 230 output.As another example; The map search system can carry out the described map search process of this document; And other map search processes of using other technologies, obtaining a plurality of Search Results, and the result of various process is synthesized final search result send to the user being used to.
