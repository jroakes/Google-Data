Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and apparatuses for communicating copyright protected content, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for communicating copyright protected content in a secure or protected manner.
- Copy protection rules such as those defined by SMPTE ExCCI, generally do not take into account the existence of an authorized domain, in which devices owned by a single user can securely exchange content.
- Existing copy protection standards include states, such as “COPY ONE GENERATION,” “COPY NO MORE” and “COPY FREE,” which make sense when content is sent over an external unprotected interface, but would make a user's life very difficult when trying to apply these states to content that is shared by multiple devices in his authorized domain.
- content users should be allowed to legally share content over protected (on-line or removable media) interfaces and this needs to be reflected in the content rights. It is rarely acceptable to allow a user to share pay content with everyone, so it is necessary to be able to specify a list of authorized domains within which content may be shared.
- SMPTE ExCCI specification separates copy protection rules into digital and analog but does not address a concept of authorized domain.
- the present invention is therefore directed to the problem of developing an automated method for controlling copyright protected content in a communications system.
- the present invention solves these and other problems by providing a method for establishing and enforcing copy protection rules that permits intra-domain transfers and copying with certain controls.
- copyright protected rules are set forth as follows for intra-domain operations. According to this embodiment, within a single authorized domain where all interfaces are protected with the same Digital Rights Management (DRM) system, the rights specify:
- copyright protected rules are set forth as follows for inter-domain operations. According to this embodiment, for operations across domains, the rights specify:
- copyright protected rules are set forth as follows for operations to external outputs.
- the specify the following copy protection info (separate for analog, digital uncompressed and digital compressed outputs):

- any reference herein to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.
- the appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
- RuleSet element defined in the Persistent Entitlements XML schema has a “deviceBound” Boolean attribute that when true, indicates that the access device that originally received purchased content is not allowed to make any further copies of the content—not even within the same authorized domain. If this attribute is not set, then further copies may be made within the same authorized domain.
- the RuleSet also contains a Redistribution element that specifies an additional set of authorized domains or specific devices with which this content may be shared. It also has a Boolean “move” attribute that when true indicates that the content must be moved (but not copied) between domains.
- the RuleSet includes AnalogOutput, DigitalCompressed and DigitalUncompressed elements that specify copy protection rules, which apply only when the content is being sent over an external interface that is not protected by a DRM system.
- AnalogOutput DigitalCompressed
- DigitalUncompressed elements that specify copy protection rules, which apply only when the content is being sent over an external interface that is not protected by a DRM system.
- the above embodiments have applicability to digital rights management, particularly in IP Set-Top products.
- IP Internet Protocol
- IPRM IP Rights Management
- DRM Digital Rights Management
- the embodiments of the present invention herein provide XML interfaces that are used by external systems to use services provided by the IPRM system. These XML documents are processed by Caching Servers that deliver content to IPRM clients (Viewers) as well as by the IPRM clients that need to follow copy protection rules for the content that is being rendered and/or persistently stored.
- Caching Servers that deliver content to IPRM clients (Viewers) as well as by the IPRM clients that need to follow copy protection rules for the content that is being rendered and/or persistently stored.
- the embodiments herein specify XML definitions for all IPRM interfaces requiring XML-based input, specifically content access rights (a.k.a. DRM rules), user selection and user authorization (a.k.a. entitlements).
- Content Provider An entity that creates, licenses, aggregates and/or distributes content to the Cache Servers but it does not consume content.
- the Content Provider is also responsible for specifying content access rules and possibly user selection if the user actually makes the purchase at the content provider's web portal. Otherwise, it is made by the Confirmation Server.
- Cache Server An intermediate entity that stores and redistributes content to Consumers and optionally to other Cache Servers. Besides streaming content to viewers, it also enforces the content access rules against the user selection and user entitlements.
- Confirmation Server An application facilitating the creation of a session rights object.
- Consumer An entity such as an end-user that consumes content obtained from a Cache Server and optionally if permitted by the copyright holder, redistributes content to other Consumers in the system.
- the user is given a set of entitlements by the provisioning center that are used to determine the satisfaction of content access rules.
- the provisioning center When a user makes a purchase of a specific content, his selection is included in the Session Rights object.
- Entitlements A set of authorization attributes that allow user to access content.
- Provisioning Center An application that registers a new consumer (e.g., Viewer) with the network, provisions it with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and creates a set of entitlements for the new user.
- KDC Key Distribution Center
- Session Rights Object A signed version of content access rules for a given piece of content and specific user's purchase option selection.
- Ticket A token of trust issued to a viewer by the KDC in order to access content at a particular caching server. It also includes the user's entitlements.
- Viewer A consumer for video content.
- IPRM IP rights management
- the exemplary embodiment of a IPRM system set forth herein provides digital rights management functions, such as authentication, privacy, security, integrity, access control and possibly non-repudiation tools to any multimedia streaming network based on Internet Protocols.
- the system supports point-to-point video on demand (VOD) and multicast delivery of content. Additional features relate to persistent content rights management, such as copy protection.
- An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is initially based purely on software protection, with a limited trust placed upon the clients.
- This embodiment can be enhanced with an optional hardware security module, which may be mandatory to obtain rights to high quality content from copyright owners requiring high security levels.
- the Session rights XML document is generated by the content provider or any other entity (e.g., a Confirmation Server) that provides the final interaction with the end-user.
- the content of the Session Rights document is encoded in the Session Rights Object (SRO) object.
- SRO Session Rights Object
- the Authorization XML document is maintained by the Provisioning Server and is included in each ticket given to an end-user by the KDC.
- the Rights Manager module on the Caching Server evaluates the rules and user selection against the authorization data in the ticket to allow or disallow access to the specified content.
- Each XML document consists of a root element and a set of nested elements.
- the following sections describe the structure and use of the IPRM XML schemas: Session Rights, Authorization Data, Persistent Entitlements and Copy Protection Rules. Their corresponding W3C Schemas are provided below.
- CORE schema that defines IPRM data types and elements that are common to multiple schemas.
- the Rights element is the root element of the Session Rights document. It is a sequence of two required elements: Content and Selection and two optional elements: Provider and Rule.
- FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of the Session Rights Element.
- the Content element uniquely identifies the content associated with this set of session rights.
- Attribute “format” specifies in what format the content identification is specified (e.g., URL, ISBN, etc.) with URL being the default.
- the “id” attribute specifies the unique content identifier.
- the Provider element optionally specifies the ProviderID (“pid” attribute) and the provider name as a text string.
- the Rule element specifies a set of rules associated with the associated content specified in the “Content” element.
- the “extern” attribute specifies whether the rules are defined in this document (value “false”) or in an external document (value “true”). The default value is “false.”
- the Selection element specifies the purchase selection the user, on whose behalf this Session Rights document is presented, has made.
- the “optionID” attribute identifies a particular PurchaseOption defined within the Rule element that was selected by the user. Each option may be associated with different copy protection rules for persistent or non-persistent content.
- the “extern” attribute specifies whether the selection is defined in this document (value “false”) or in an external document (value “true”). The default value is “false.”
- the “deviceBound” attribute When the “deviceBound” attribute is set to “Y”, the content will not be shared outside the access device. If it is set to “N”, then the content will be shared across user's authorized domain. If this attribute is not specified, need to check persistent entitlements to find out. This attribute affects how blackout verification is performed. If the content is not shared outside the access device, then the blackout check only applies to the locations (listed inside Authorization Data) that have the “AccessPoint” attribute set to “Y”. Otherwise, all locations listed in Authorization Data need to be checked. The value of this attribute must be consistent with the persistent entitlements that are associated with the user selection.
- the Rule element specifies all access rules associated with the specified content. It is a choice of one or more of the available rules. If the Rule element is not specified, it is assumed that the content:
- FIG. 2 depicts the Rule Element in block diagram format.
- the PurchaseOption element defines copy protection rules or DRM rules for persistent data associated with a specific option for purchasing this content. This option is also associated with a price and a list of subscription service under which this option may be selected for free or at a decreased cost. Multiple PurchaseOption elements may be included to indicate different options for the user to purchase the content. Some of the options may restrict the purchase to only initial rendering of the content, while other options may allow the user to save a copy of the content with varying DRM rules.
- the “optionID” of the Selection element specifies the ID of the purchase option that was selected by the user.
- an Origin Server generated a full set of Session Rights with both rules and user selection, there would only be a single PurchaseOption element included in the rules, which is the one selected by the user (in order not to waste bandwidth). But if the Origin Server generates only the user selection while rules are cached on a Caching Server, the rules would typically include all PurchaseOption elements associated with this content.
- the Blackout element provides a mechanism to restrict access to the given content geographically. It provides the ability to define an area specified by a list of country codes or other types of location specifiers where the content is or is not allowed. This rule will be evaluated against the list of LocationGroups in the Authorization Data document.
- the GenericRating element specifies the content rating level for a particular rating scale or standard (e.g., MPAA rating, TV rating, etc.). This element can be repeated multiple times in order to define the rating levels for multiple rating scales. This rule will be evaluated against the GenericRating element in the Authorization Data document representing the user-rating ceiling where the ceiling must be equal or higher than the content rating. This rule can be overridden by the Override element in the Selection element.
- a particular rating scale or standard e.g., MPAA rating, TV rating, etc.
- the Fingerprint elements specify a list of fingerprint algorithms that may be applied to the content that is being sent to a client. If at least one such element is present, one of these fingerprint algorithms must be applied by the streaming server.
- the DeviceCapabilities element specifies security requirements for a consumer device receiving this content. Some of these security requirements apply to content rendering, while others apply when a device makes a persistent copy of the content.
- securityLevelToRender attribute is the minimum security level of the content rendering device.
- codecInSecureHW attribute is a flag that when true (“Y”) requires a rendering device to decompress content inside secure hardware.
- WatermarkInSecureHW attribute is a flag that when true (“Y”) requires a rendering device to perform watermark detection inside secure hardware.
- FingerprintInSecureHW attribute is a flag that when true (“Y”) requires a rendering device to insert a fingerprint inside secure hardware.
- SecurityLevelToCopy attribute is the minimum security level of the destination device that is getting a persistent copy of the content.
- This rule will be evaluated against the SecurityLevel attribute of the client ticket.
- the PurchaseOption element is illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- GenericRights element has no type when directly present and indicates that the actual copy protection rules or rights associated with persistent content are specified in a different XML document.
- This element is also a substitution group and the substitution elements may be:
- CopyProtectionRules defineds copy protection rules associated with the content that is not saved persistently but could be forwarded to various digital and analog outputs. This element is defined in a separate XML schema, see section below.
- PersistentEntitlements content usage rules associated with a persistent copy of the content. The presence of this element indicates that the content will either be downloaded or recorded by a client device during a streaming session. This element is defined in a separate XML schema, see below.
- Cost element specifies the price of the content.
- the “currency” attribute specifies the currency expressed as a 3-letter acronym defined by ISO 4217. US dollar is the default value. If a different currency representation is needed in the future, the “format” attribute can be used to specify other formats. This element is not applicable when content is made available on subscription basis only.
- Cost element is not specified, the content cannot be purchased and may be available for subscription. If the Subscription element is not specified either, the content is assumed to be FREE.
- the nested elements specify different ways to buy the content.
- the OneTimePay element specifies the price for the pay-per-view purchase mechanism.
- the “price” attribute specifies the cost for accessing this content.
- the PBT element provides a mechanism to purchase content at time increments.
- the “increment” attribute specifies the time interval (in minutes) the “price” is associated with. For instance, if the “price” is 0.95 cents and the increment value is 30, the user will be charged 0.95 cents for each 30 minutes that she views the content.
- value YES specifies that the element of PurchaseOption in that column must be present and will be evaluated; value N/A specifies that the corresponding element may be present but will not be used for evaluating access rights; value NO means that the rule must not be present; value DENIED means that access will be denied.
- the most right column shows the required value of the Pay element from the user authorization.
- the selected PurchaseOption must contain one or more SubscriptionGroups. If there is at least one matching SubscriptionGroup without an IncrementalCost element, then the Pay element in the user selection will be ignored. Otherwise, the value of the Pay element must be INDIVIDUAL.
- the content can be accessed only if the user Selection is set to FREE.
- SubscriptionGroup includes the following two elements:
- aSubscription element specifies a list of services on which this piece of content is available for subscription and is illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- aSubscription is an abstract placeholder for a specific subscription element.
- substitution elements for aSubscription are:
- the Blackout element is a sequence of locations where the content may or may not be viewed (depending on the value of the “restriction” attribute described below), as illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- the “restriction” attribute specifies whether the content is blacked out (i.e. disallowed) inside the specified geographic area (value IN) or outside of the area (value OUT).
- the “buyThru” attribute specifies whether the content can be purchased when the user would be otherwise blackout out. This is useful for content distributed on subscription basis.
- Each element of the Blackout sequence is a substitution group, needed to accommodate different types of location codes.
- the element aLocation is an abstract placeholder for a specific location element.
- the substitution elements for aLocation are:
- long specifies if the postal code is expressed in long form (e.g., 9-digit US ZIP code instead of a 5-digit one). If this attribute is not present, the short form is assumed.
- An optional “country” attribute specifies a country within which the postal codes are located. If the country is not specified, US is assumed. There is also an accompanying optional “format” attribute that specifies the type of the country code used in the value of the “country” attribute. The default value for “format” is “ISO3166”.
- the GenericRating element specifies a content rating as illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- GenericRating element is of type NMTOKEN and has the following possible values: LEVEL0, LEVEL1, LEVEL2, LEVEL3, LEVEL4, LEVEL5
- GenericRating may be used as a custom content rating scale where the meaning of each level is the same in both the Session Rights and in the Authorization Data XML documents. Because there are multiple rating scales, GenericRating is also a substitution group.
- the substitution elements for GenericRating are:
- DVBRating a positive integer between 3 and 18 that represents a minimum allowable age of the viewer.
- MPAARating a string with no white space that represents one of the MPAA rating levels.
- TvRating a string with no white space that represents one of the North American TV rating levels.
- the Selection element specifies user selection related to the consumption or purchase of the selected content. It is a sequence of the following elements.
- FIG. 7 depicts a Selection Element.
- Purchase element specifies the purchase option the user has selected in order to obtain access to the content.
- the following values are defined:
- ONE-TIME-PAY the user selected the option to buy the content based on a single payment (no subscription)
- PBT the user selected the option to buy the content on pay-by-time basis
- Override element specifies whether the user has overridden his rating ceiling when he ordered the content (e.g. provided a password or PIN code to the purchase or confirmation server). The value of this element specifies what rule was overridden, meaning that the rule is not going to be enforced. RATING is the only value currently supported.
- the Authorization element is the root element of the User Authorization Data document. It is a sequence of several optional elements: purchasing capability (Pay element), user location (Country element), user subscription (Subscr and SubscrList elements), content rating ceiling (Rating element) and an element of type “any”.
- the Authorization element has several attributes:
- FIG. 8 depicts the User Authorization Element.
- Pay element specifies users ability to pay for content.
- the following values for the “type” attribute are defined:
- INDIVIDUAL User is allowed to pay for individual content (e.g. PPV or PBT)
- LocationGroup includes aLocation element that specifies the location of the user, which is used to evaluate blackout rules. This is an abstract placeholder for elements that identify a specific type of location (such as country or zip code). For detailed description of this element, see below (where aLocation is described as a component of the Blackout element).
- AccessPoint element that when true (“Y”), indicates that this is the location of an access point that initially obtains the content after the content purchase. If this element is false (“N”), then this is the location of a segment of the user's personal network and applies when the user purchased content with the rights to keep a persistent copy and render it on any device within the user's personal network. The default value is “Y”.
- the blackout rules are evaluated as if the user were located everywhere meaning that the user will always be blacked out if blackout rules are specified.
- aSubscription element specifies a service or a list of subscription services provided by a given service provider. It is an abstract substitution element that allows for the services and service providers to be identified using different conventions.
- GenericRating element specifies the user-selected content rating ceiling, i.e., the highest level of rating allowed for a given rating dimension. This is an abstract substitution element that allows different rating methods to be used. Authorization for the same user can have multiple GenericRating elements in order to convey the rating ceilings for multiple content rating methods.
- the PersistentEntitlements element is the root element of the IPRM Persistent Rights schema. It can either be utilized as a separate XML document that is included inside the SRO along with the Session Rights document, or it can be included directly inside the Session Rights as part of one of the PurchaseOption elements (see section 3.1.1.1). It is illustrated in the FIG. 9 .
- PersistentEntitlements contains the following attributes:
- PersistentEntitlements is also a sequence of the following elements:
- a RuleSet element of the RenewalOption has the same type as the RuleSet element of the PersistentEntitlements. However, in this case the RuleSet represents incremental changes from the original set of rules. When a renewal option is selected, the resulting set of content rules/restrictions is obtained as follows:
- the OptionCost element of the RenewalOption contains both the cost for license renewal using this option and a cost of superdistribution using this option (that may be different from the renewal cost). For more detailed description of OptionCost, see section 3.3.2.
- Copyright element is the copyright information associated with the content.
- the RuleSet element specifies all the rules associated with the specified persistently stored content.
- the identity of the content e.g., a URI, is not present inside the RulesSet or inside the PersistentEntitlements.
- the content identity is generally a separate parameter that accompanies the PersistentEntitlements XML document (e.g., a separate TLV parameter inside Persistent Data Entitlements DOI object).
- FIG. 10 depicts the RuleSet Element.
- a RuleSet element contains the deviceBound attribute, which is a boolean flag that when set to “Y” means that once a Viewer saves a copy of this content, no further copies of the content may be made, even within the same authorized domain (user's personal network) protected by IPRM security.
- RuleSet also includes the sharedMediaCopies attribute, which is a boolean flag that when set to “Y” allows copies of this content to be made on shared removable media. A single copy of the content on a shared removable media can be played on any device within the same authorized domain. However, if “deviceBound” attribute is “Y”, copies of the content on shared removable media are not allowed even when “sharedMediaCopies” attribute is “Y”.
- RuleSet is of type StoredContentRuleSetType, which is a sequence with each element described in the following subsections.
- This element restricts copies over an analog interface. It can also define MACROVISION parameters, where MACROVISION is a mechanism to prevent analog copies of a video signal and would normally be used when the ‘copyRestriction’ attribute defined below is set to NOCOPY (i.e., analog copies are not allowed).
- AnalogOutput consists of the following attributes which are apply specifically to analog output:
- This element restricts copies over an external digital compressed interface that is not protected with the IPRM system.
- An example of such an interface would be IEEE-1394 (Firewire bus). However, if there is an IP stack running on top of IEEE-1394 and IPRM is used to protect content over this interface, this element would be ignored.
- DigitalCompressedOutput consists of the following attributes:
- This element restricts copies of the content that is received over an external digital uncompressed interface (e.g., DVI) that is not protected with IPRM.
- DVI digital uncompressed interface
- This element defines rules for retransmission of the content beyond the current authorized domain. Note that this element does not apply to superdistribution where a copy of the content is sent to another consumer (in a new authorized domain) without any rights to use the content. This element is used in the cases when an initial set of persistent content entitlements already allows the content to be lawfully shared between multiple authorized domains without an additional cost.
- This element has the following attribute:
- the Redistribution element is illustrated in FIG. 11 .
- Redistribution element includes a sequence of 0 or more Destination elements, where each destination element allows the content to be copied, moved or streamed (as specified by the “contentOperation” attribute) to that specific destination that is outside of the current authorized domain.
- a Destination element contains the following attributes:
- Redistribution element can also optionally include a GeographicalRestriction element that might prevent streaming, movement or copying of content into authorized domains listed in Destination elements if they are located in blacked out geographical regions. This is the same as the Blackout element described herein, except that there is no “buyThru” attribute in this case.
- the Playback element places restrictions on playback of stored content. It defines conditions which determine when stored content becomes expired and may no longer be used.
- the Playback element is illustrated in FIG. 12 .

- (2) For copies, the system must explicitly identify domains to which copies are allowed (Copy to any domain is not allowed, because that would be equivalent to unprotected content); and
-
- Is free;
- Not blacked out anywhere;
- Has no rating associated with it;
- Not available for subscription;
- No particular level of security is required to access it.

-
- aSubscription element specifies a list of services on which this piece of content is available for subscription. This element is described in more detail below. This rule will be evaluated against the list of aSubscription elements in the Authorization Data document if the user selects the “SUBSCR” purchase option. If the user has at least one of the provider/service pairs in his entitlements, he will be granted access to the service (assuming that other rules, such as blackout and rating, are satisfied as well).
- IncrementalCost optional element is associated with a particular aSubscription element and indicates that there is still an amount that needs to be paid when the content is obtained through a subscription to one of the specified services. The “currency” and “format” attributes are the same as the “currency” and “format” attributes for the Cost element of the PurchaseOption. The “price” attribute specifies the (possibly reduced) cost for the content when it is obtained through this subscription.
aSubscription Element
-
- SubscriptionID—a list of 2-byte unsigned integers representing service identifiers. This element also has an optional “provider” attribute that is a 2-byte unsigned integer that identifies a provider. The reason that provider is optional is because in some cases service identifiers may be globally unique and may already imply a specific service provider.
- SubscriptionName—a list of service names separated by white space. Each name may not itself contain white space. This element also has an optional “provider” attribute that is the provider name (with no white space characters). In the case that service names are globally unique or already imply a specific provider, the provider attribute may be omitted.
- SubscriptionNumber—a list of concatenated provider and service identifiers (2 bytes for provider, 2 bytes for service).
Blackout Element
-
- Country—a list of tokens separated by white space, where each token identifies a country as a two-character country code defined in “ISO3166” (the default value of the “format” attribute—other formats may be supported in the future).
- DVDRegion—location specified by a list of DVD region codes separated by white space. The possible region codes are:
- 1=U.S., Canada, U.S. Territories
- 2=Japan, Europe, South Africa, and Middle East (including Egypt)
- 3=Southeast Asia and East Asia (including Hong Kong)
- 4=Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, Central America, Mexico, South America and the Caribbean
- 5=Eastern Europe (Former Soviet Union), Indian subcontinent, Africa, North Korea and Mongolia
- 6=Peoples Republic of China
- 7=Reserved
- 8=Special international venues (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.)
- PostalCode—a list of tokens separated by white space, where each token is a postal code location (e.g. ZIP code in US).
LEVEL0, LEVEL1, LEVEL2, LEVEL3, LEVEL4, LEVEL5
-
- principal—a unique identifier of an end-user client who is requesting the specified content. This attribute is required so that it can be used for billing purposes, for instance.
- operator—an optional attribute identifying the network provider (MSO, ISP, etc.) of the end-user identified by the principal name above.
-
- renewal—if ‘Y’, this license may be renewed after it expires. In other words, a request may be sent to a License Server to obtain a new license for already stored content. The rules that would appear in a new license after a renewal can be either taken from one of the renewal options (see below) or a new set of rules can be obtained (inside an SRO) from an Origin Server.
- superdistribution—if ‘Y’, the corresponding content may be superdistributed to other users (which would still have to pay in order to get a valid license for the content). The rules that would appear in a new license associated with a superdistributed copy of the content can be either taken from one of the renewal options (see below) or a new set of rules can be obtained (inside an SRO) from an Origin Server.
-
- RuleSet element is a set of content usage rules and restrictions associated with the content.
- RenewalOption elements. When the Renewal attribute is set for PersistentEntitlements, each RenewalOption represents a possible set of rules that would go into a new license after a renewal. A RenewalOption also includes a cost—an amount of money that would be charged to a consumer for renewing a content license with this option.
-
- copyRestriction—an enumeration type that specifies a copy protection state associated with analog interfaces. The IPRM system must ignore (but still preserve) this attribute except in the case when it is exporting content over an analog interface. In that case, the IPRM system must translate this copy protection state to whatever means are available on the particular analog interface, including CGMS-A and MACROVISION. This attribute can have one of the following values:
- UNLIMITED—no limitation on the number of copies of the content that is received over an analog interface.
- NOCOPY—copying of the content received over an analog interface is not permitted. In practice this means that when content is transmitted over an analog interface, MACROVISION must be turned on. Some analog video interfaces also support CGMS-A copy protection bits inside VBI.
- NOMORE—no more copies of this content may be made over an analog interface. One way that IPRM-controlled content could get this setting is during the following scenario:
- The content is imported into the IPRM system over an analog interface.
- This analog interface carries CGMS-A copy protection bits over VBI.
- The CGMS-A relayed over the analog interface was set to ONEGENERATION.
- Therefore, when the IPRM system imports this content, it is obligated to transition the copy protection state from ONEGENERATION to NOMORE.
- ONEGENERATION—only a single copy of the content received over an analog interface may be made. When that copy is made, the copy protection state must be changed to NOMORE. It may be possible to relay this copy protection state over some analog interfaces using CGMS-A over VBI.
- numberOfCopies—this attribute is applicable only when copyRestriction attribute is set to ONEGENERATION. In that case, this attribute specifies how many ONEGENERATION copies of the content may be made over an analog interface. The value of 0 (or if numberOfCopies attribute is not present) means that there is no limit on the number of ONEGENERATION copies made. The maximum value of this attribute is 3.
- componentOutput—a boolean flag. When set to ‘Y’, it is OK to transmit this content over a component analog output.
- outputAllowed—a boolean flag. When set to ‘N’, analog output of any type for this content is disabled. Note that ExCCI doesn't have this option—it only disables component (video) output. But component output does not apply to audio-only content, in which case this attribute may be used instead.
- pseudoSyncPulse—a boolean flag. When set to ‘Y’, MACROVISION must utilize a Pseudo Sync Pulse (PSP).
- splitColorBurst—an enumeration type that can have the following values:
- N—split color burst not utilized by MACROVISION
- 2—use 2-line split color burst for MACROVISION
- 4—use 4-line split color burst for MACROVISION
- constrainedImage—limits a video image resolution on an analog output. When set to 0, there is no restriction on resolution. When set to 1, an application generating an analog output will decide how to restrict the video image resolution. Otherwise, this attribute specifies a limit on a number of pixels per frame (e.g., in ExCCI, a constrained video image is limited to 520,000 pixels per frame).
- constrainedAudio—limits audio bit rate on an analog output. When set to 0, there is no restriction on audio bit rate. When set to 1, an application generating an analog output will decide how to restrict the audio bit rate. Otherwise, this attribute specifies a limit on the bit rate in KBits/sec for analog audio output.
- audioChannelLimit—limits the number of audio channels for analog output. When set to 0, there is no restriction on the number of audio channels. Otherwise, this attribute specifies a limit on the number of audio channels (e.g., if the limit is 2, a surround sound audio signal has to be converted to stereo with only 2 channels).
DigitalCompressedOutput
- copyRestriction—an enumeration type that specifies a copy protection state associated with analog interfaces. The IPRM system must ignore (but still preserve) this attribute except in the case when it is exporting content over an analog interface. In that case, the IPRM system must translate this copy protection state to whatever means are available on the particular analog interface, including CGMS-A and MACROVISION. This attribute can have one of the following values:
-
- copyRestriction—an enumeration type that restricts the number of copies of the content that may be made over an external digital compressed interface. The values of this attribute are defined above. This attribute does not apply (but must be preserved) when content is exchanged between devices in the same authorized domain using IPRM security. When content is transferred over an external digital compressed interface, this copy protection state must be translated (e.g., to CGMS-D) and sent over the specific digital compressed interface.
- numberOfCopies—this attribute is applicable only when copyRestriction attribute is set to ONEGENERATION. In that case, this attribute specifies how many ONEGENERATION copies of the content may be made over an external digital compressed interface. The value of 0 (or if numberOfCopies attribute is not present) means that there is no limit on the number of ONEGENERATION copies made. The maximum value of this attribute is 3.
- outputAllowed—when this boolean flag is set to ‘N’, digital compressed content must not be sent over external interfaces even when they are encrypted using a non-IPRM copy protection technology (e.g., 5C). This flag applies when content is sent with an intent to copy as well as when the content is sent with an intent to render-only.
DigitalUncompressedOutput
-
- copyRestriction—an enumeration type that restricts the number of copies of the content received over an external digital uncompressed interface. The values of this attribute are defined above. This attribute does not apply (but must be preserved) when content is exchanged between devices in the same authorized domain using IPRM security. When content is transferred over an external digital uncompressed interface, this copy protection state must be translated (e.g., to CGMS-D) and sent over the specific digital uncompressed interface.
- numberOfCopies—this attribute is applicable only when copyRestriction attribute is set to ONEGENERATION. In that case, this attribute specifies how many ONEGENERATION copies of the content may be made over an external digital uncompressed interface. The value of 0 (or if numberOfCopies attribute is not present) means that there is no limit on the number of ONEGENERATION copies made. The maximum value of this attribute is 3.
- outputAllowed—when this boolean flag is set to ‘N’, digital uncompressed content must not be sent over external interfaces even when they are encrypted (e.g., with HDCP). This flag applies when content is sent with an intent to copy as well as when the content is sent with an intent to render-only.
Redistribution
-
- contentOperation—defines how the content is to be consumed by a particular destination. The list of authorized domains to which the content may be streamed, moved or copied can be optionally restricted—see below. This is an enum-valued attribute that can take on the following values:
- STREAM—This allows you to only stream the content to a particular destination. The content may not be recorded, copied or moved.
- MOVE—This allows you to either stream the content to a destination, or move the content. A move means that as soon as a copy or recording of the content is made at the destination, the original copy must be removed. In the case of a move, all copies of the content in the original authorized domain must be removed.
- COPY—This allows the content to be streamed, recorded, moved or copied to a destination.
- contentOperation—defines how the content is to be consumed by a particular destination. The list of authorized domains to which the content may be streamed, moved or copied can be optionally restricted—see below. This is an enum-valued attribute that can take on the following values:
-
- realm—identifies another authorized domain to which the content can be copied, moved or streamed. In the case of an IPRM system that utilizes the ESBroker key management protocol, this parameter is identical to an ESBroker realm for that authorized domain.
- id—a host identifier for a specific device in the specified authorized domain to where the content may be copied or moved. If this parameter is not included, the content may be copied, moved or streamed to any device in the specified authorized domain.
-
- startDate—the content cannot be accessed before this time.
- endDate—the content cannot be accessed after this time.
-
- PlayBackCount—it is an integer value that specifies the maximum number of times that this content may be played back before it is considered to be expired. This element has an optional attribute maxDuration that limits the duration of each individual play back. When maxDuration is specified, a playback must be automatically terminated after the specified time period. The startDate and endDate attributes of the Playback element may be used in combination with this element. They would limit the period within which the content may be played in addition to the limit on the number of playbacks.
- Rental—a choice between EndTime and Interval elements. EndTime is the expiration time for the content after which it must not be usable. Interval is a period of time within which the content is usable and has the following attribute:
- StartOnFirstUse—a boolean flag. When set to “Y”, it means that the rental interval doesn't start until the first time that the content is accessed, e.g., the first time that a decryption key for this content is retrieved from the content license. If this flag value is “N”, the rental interval starts as soon as a content license is first created. Once a rental interval is started, the Rental element must be modified with the Interval replaced by EndTime, which is calculated as the starting time of the interval+Interval.
-
- PauseTime—max number of minutes of pause time allowed per occasion.
What “occasion” means could vary between different rendering applications.
MulticastLimit
- PauseTime—max number of minutes of pause time allowed per occasion.
-
- fingerprintID—an identifier for a fingerprint algorithm. Which fingerprint algorithms may be used is TBD. When the fingerprint algorithms are selected, it may become necessary to add some additional attributes to this element.
DeviceCapabilities
- fingerprintID—an identifier for a fingerprint algorithm. Which fingerprint algorithms may be used is TBD. When the fingerprint algorithms are selected, it may become necessary to add some additional attributes to this element.
-
- SecurityLevelToRender—minimum security level of a device required to render this content. Currently 6 security levels have been defined for IPRM.
- SecurityLevelToCopy—minimum security level of a device required to save a copy of this content. In practice this security level will be greater or equal to SecurityLevelToRender.
- CodecInSecureHW—if this boolean flag is ‘Y’, a device is required to decompress this content within a secure hardware module.
- WatermarkInSecureHW—if this boolean flag is ‘Y’, a device is required to detect a watermark embedded in this content within a secure hardware module.
- FingerprintlnSecureHW—if this boolean flag is ‘Y’, a device is required to insert a fingerprint into this content within a secure hardware module.
OptionCost Element
-
- currency—currency used to specify the cost. A default value of “USD” identifies US dollars.
- format—format used to specify the value of the currency attribute, default is ISO4217 (a 3-letter achronym).
-
- RenewalCost—the cost of renewing a license with this option that contains this set of content usage rules. This is a required element of the sequence.
- RedistributionCost—the cost of buying a superdistributed copy of the content using this option with this set of content usage rules. When this optional element is present, the same set of content usage rules may be used for both renewing a license and buying a superdistributed copy of the content. The price may be different in the two cases, e.g., you can get a bigger discount when renewing license to the content you already purchased. This element is optional as not all renewal options may also be used for superdistribution. There is currently no provision to have a set of content rules that may be used only for superdistribution but not for content renewal. If such need arises, in the future the RenewalCost could be made optional as well.
CopyProtectionRules Definition
-
- AnalogOutput—restricts copies over an analog interface as described above.
- DigitalCompressedOutput—restricts copies over a digital compressed interface as described above.
- DigitalUncompressedOutput—restricts copies over a digital uncompressed interface as described above.
- ForwardingLimit—limit on the number of simultaneous receivers to which content streams may be forwarded over IPRM-protected connections. The value of 0 means that content cannot be forwarded.
- PauseTime—maximum number of minutes of pause time allowed per occasion. What “occasion” means could vary between different rendering applications.
- Fingerprint—identifies a fingerprint algorithm that is to be inserted into the content as it is being decompressed and delivered over an external analog or digital uncompressed interface. Several Fingerprint elements may be included in order to provide a choice to the rendering device.
