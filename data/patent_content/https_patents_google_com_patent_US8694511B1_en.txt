Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to ranking of search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify documents or other items that are relevant to a user's needs and to present the documents or items in a manner that is most useful to the user. Such activity often involves a fair amount of mind-reading—inferring from various clues what the user wants. Certain clues may be user specific. For example, knowledge that a user is making a request from a mobile device, and knowledge of the location of the device, can result in much better search results for such a user.
- Clues about a user's needs may also be more general. For example, search results can have an elevated importance, or inferred relevance, if a number of other search results link to them. If the linking results are themselves highly relevant, then the linked-to results may have a particularly high relevance.
- Such an approach to determining relevance is premised on the assumption that, if authors of web pages felt that another web site was relevant enough to be linked to, then web searchers would also find the site to be particularly relevant. In short, the web authors “vote up” the relevance of the sites.
- particular inputs may be generated or analyzed to affect the presentation of search results.
- such inputs may increase the relevance that a system will assign to a particular result in a particular situation, thus boosting the score or other indicator of relevance for the result (and perhaps the relevance of the result in the context of a particular query).
- Such an approach may benefit a user by providing them with search results that are more likely to match their needs.
- users can learn more using the internet, can find more relevant information more quickly, and will thus achieve more in their work or elsewhere, and will be more likely to use such a system again.
- a provider of such services may also benefit, by providing more useful services to users, and by thereby inducing more traffic to their search services.
- Such additional traffic may provide an operator with additional revenue, such as in the form of advertising that accompanies the searching and the delivery of search results.
- one or more aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in one or more methods that include associating a query with one or more first prior queries in a first population, the prior queries associated with a document in the ranking.
- the query is associated with one or more second prior queries in one or more second populations encompassing the first population, the second prior queries associated with the document.
- Second data is deemphasized from the second prior queries relative to first data from the first prior queries.
- First data is combined with the deemphasized second data to create a quality of result statistic for the document.
- the statistic is provided as an input to a ranking.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the second data can be deemphasized if a language of the query and a language of a user interface into which the query was entered are the same.
- the second data can be deemphasized if a language of the document and a language of a user interface into which the query was entered are the same.
- the first population is country-specific, one of the second populations is language-specific.
- One of the second populations can be generic.
- the first data and the second data are based on aggregated click data.
- a ranking sub-system can include a rank modifier engine that uses implicit user feedback to cause re-ranking of search results in order to improve the final ranking presented to a user of an information retrieval system.
- User selections of search results click data
- this background probability can be used to adjust future search result rankings.
- a prior model can be used to estimate what the implicit feedback should be for results that are too infrequent, or too recent to have sufficient historical records of implicit feedback applicable to them.

- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 shows an example system 1000 for improving the relevance of results obtained from submitting search queries as can be implemented in an internet, intranet, or other client/server environment.
- the system 1000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 1000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a user 1002 can interact with the system 1000 through a client device 1004 ( 1004 a , 1004 b , 1004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 1004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 1004 can include a random access memory (RAM) 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 1008 .
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions within the system 1000 .
- the processor 1008 is a single-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 is a multi-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 can include multiple processing cores and is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 1004 ) to display graphical information for a user interface.
- a user 1002 a can connect to a search engine 1030 within a server system 1014 to submit a query 1015 .
- a client-side query signal 1010 a is sent into a network 1012 and is forwarded to the server system 1014 as a server-side query signal 1010 b .
- Server system 1014 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- a server device 1014 includes a memory device 1016 , which can include the search engine 1030 loaded therein.
- a processor 1018 is structured to process instructions within the system 1014 . These instructions can implement one or more components of the search engine 1030 .
- the processor 1018 can be a single-threaded processor or a multi-threaded processor, and can include multiple processing cores.
- the processor 1018 can process instructions stored in the memory 1016 related to the search engine 1030 and can send information to the client device 1004 , through the network 1012 , to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 1004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the user query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 can include an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the user query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- the search engine 1030 can include a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the user query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms)
- it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants.
- the technique is exemplified in the GOGGLE® PageRank system, which treats a link from one web page to another as an indication of quality for the latter page, so that the page with the most such quality indicators is rated higher than others.
- Appropriate techniques can also be used to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- the ranking engine 1052 can receive an additional signal from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 provides one or more prior models, or one or more measures of relevance for the documents based on one or more prior models, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 1002 .
- a prior model represents a background probability of document result selection given the values of multiple selected features, as described further below.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations described below to generate the one or more prior models, or the one or more measures of relevance based on one or more prior models.
- the search engine 1030 can forward the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 1028 a through the network 1012 .
- a client-side search results signal 1028 b can be received by the client device 1004 a where the results can be stored within the RAM 1006 and/or used by the processor 1008 to display the results on an output device for the user 1002 a.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components can include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , and a rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the indexing engine 2010 can function as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 can generate scores for document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features can include aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features can include aspects of document cross-referencing, such as the PageRank of the document or the domain.
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned, to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score, using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- the ranking engine 2030 can produce a ranking of document results 2040 for display to a user based on IR scores received from the scoring engine 2020 and one or more signals from the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- a tracking component 2050 can be used to record information regarding individual user selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies user selections (clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 can be a proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- the client e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the user.
- the recorded information can be stored in result selection log(s) 2060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each user selection, the query (Q), the document (D), the time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- Other information can also be recorded regarding user interactions with a presented ranking, including negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user, but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the user interface, IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before the clicked result, the titles and snippets shown to the user before the clicked result, the user's cookie, cookie age, IP (Internet Protocol) address, user agent of the browser, etc.
- Sill further information can be recorded, such as described below during discussion of the various features that can be used to build a prior model.
- similar information e.g., IR scores, position, etc.
- the information stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 can be used by the rank modifier engine 2070 in generating the one or more signals to the ranking engine 2030 .
- a wide range of information can be collected and used to modify or tune the click signal from the user to make the signal, and the future search results provided, a better fit for the user's needs.
- user interactions with the rankings presented to the users of the information retrieval system can be used to improve future rankings.
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the rank modifier engine 2070 and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system.
- a server system 3050 includes an indexing engine 3060 and a scoring/ranking engine 3070 .
- a client system 3000 includes a user interface for presenting a ranking 3010 , a tracking component 3020 , result selection log(s) 3030 and a ranking/rank modifier engine 3040 .
- the client system 3000 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine 3040 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 3070 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in can then re-rank the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific user base.
- FIG. 4A shows an example user interface 4000 of a document search service, such as described above, for presenting a ranking.
- Individual selections of document results 4010 can be tracked within the context of a search query for which the document results 4010 are returned.
- user's click data on web page search results 4010 can be gathered and stored in log(s), which can be kept for all user queries.
- the click can be tracked via JavaScript code embedded in the search results page, an embedded browser tag, etc. This code can track when and on what a user clicks in the main search results page, and can track when the user returns to that main page.
- Post-click behavior can also be tracked via pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- the toolbar software can track all the pages that the user visits, both before and after the search results page is delivered.
- the information gathered for each click can include: (1) the query (Q) the user entered, (2) the document result (D) the user clicked on, (3) the time (T) on the document, (4) the interface language (L) (which can be given by the user), (5) the country (C) of the user (which can be identified by the host that they use, such as www-google-co-uk to indicate the United Kingdom), and (6) additional aspects of the user and session.
- the time (T) can be measured as the time between the initial click through to the document result until the time the user comes back to the main page and clicks on another document result.
- an assessment can be made about the time (T) regarding whether this time indicates a longer view of the document result or a shorter view of the document result, since longer views are generally indicative of quality for the clicked through result.
- This assessment about the time (T) can further be made in conjunction with various weighting techniques.
- Document views resulting from the selections can be weighted based on viewing length information to produce weighted views of the document result.
- a wider range of click through viewing times can be included in the assessment of result quality, where longer viewing times in the range are given more weight than shorter viewing times.
- This weighting can be either continuous or discontinuous.
- a continuous function can be applied to the document views resulting from the selections.
- the weight given to a particular click through time can fall within a continuous range of values, as defined by the specified function.
- a discontinuous function can be applied to the document views resulting from the selections. For example, there can be three viewing time categories, each having a corresponding weight. Note that such functions can be explicitly defined, or merely implicit in the software implementation.
- the individual selections of the document result can be classified into viewing time categories, and weights can be assigned to the individual selections based on results of the classifying. For example, a short click can be considered indicative of a poor page and thus given a low weight (e.g., ⁇ 0.1 per click), a medium click can be considered indicative of a potentially good page and thus given a slightly higher weight (e.g., 0.5 per click), a long click can be considered indicative of a good page and thus given a much higher weight (e.g., 1.0 per click), and a last click (where the user doesn't return to the main page) can be considered as likely indicative of a good page and thus given a fairly high weight (e.g., 0.9).
- the click weighting can also be adjusted based on previous click information. For example, if another click preceded the last click, the last click can be considered as less indicative of a good page and given only a moderate weight (e.g., 0.3 per click).
- the various time frames used to classify short, medium and long clicks, and the weights to apply can be determined for a given search engine by comparing historical data from user selection logs with human generated explicit feedback on the quality of search results for various given queries, and the weighting process can be tuned accordingly. Furthermore, these time frames and weights can be adjusted based on one or more viewing length differentiators, as is described further below.
- the weighted views of the document result can be combined to determine a number to be used in determining a measure of relevance. For example, the weighted clicks described above can be summed together for a given query-document pair. Note that safeguards against spammers (users who generate fraudulent clicks in an attempt to boost certain search results) can be taken to help ensure that the user selection data is meaningful, even when very little data is available for a given (rare) query. These safeguards can include employing a user model that describes how a user should behave over time, and if a user doesn't conform to this model, their click data can be disregarded.
- the safeguards can be designed to accomplish two main objectives: (1) ensure democracy in the votes (e.g., one single vote per cookie and/or IP for a given query-URL (Universal Resource Locator) pair), and (2) entirely remove the information coming from cookies or IP addresses that do not look natural in their browsing behavior (e.g., abnormal distribution of click positions, click durations, clicks_per_minute/hour/day, etc.). Suspicious clicks can be removed, and the click signals for queries that appear to be spammed need not be used (e.g., queries for which the clicks feature a distribution of user agents, cookie ages, etc. that do not look normal).
- a measure of relevance for the document result can be determined within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned. This measure of relevance can be calculated as a fraction, which can be directly applied to IR scores of the search results, thereby boosting the documents in the resulting ranking that have implicit user feedback indicating document quality.
- smoothing factors S 0 , S 1 and S 2 can be used, or one or more of these can be the same smoothing factor.
- the smoothing factors used can be determined based on how much traffic is received within the context of the click fraction. For example, for a given country-language tuple, the smoothing factor can be raised concordant with the amount of traffic received (e.g., a larger smoothing factor can be used for US-English queries if a good deal more of such queries are received). In addition, the smoothing factor can be increased for query sources that have historically generated more spamming activity (e.g., queries from Russia).
- LCC Long Click Count
- the LCC fraction can help to deal with presentation bias (i.e., some documents, such as the topmost document in a results list, or documents that have bolded titles or other difference in appearance, will typically have higher click counts than other documents that don't have these features).
- the LCC click fraction can be high for a given URL even if it gets far fewer clicks than a comparable result in a higher position. Further, since the LCC fraction measures how long the average user stayed on the page once they clicked on it, the LCC fraction can be immune to presentation bias issues (e.g., an attractive title).
- the LCC fraction has associated per-language and per-country LCC fractions.
- the LCC fractions can be smoothed in a similar manner to the traditional click fractions (e.g., different smoothing factors S 0 , S 1 and S 2 can be used, or one or more of these can be the same smoothing factor and the smoothing factors used can be determined based on how much traffic is received within the context of the click fraction). Also similar to the traditional click fraction, the LCC fraction can be directly applied to IR scores of the search results, thereby boosting the documents in the resulting ranking that have implicit user feedback indicating document quality.
- different smoothing factors S 0 , S 1 and S 2 can be used, or one or more of these can be the same smoothing factor and the smoothing factors used can be determined based on how much traffic is received within the context of the click fraction.
- the LCC fraction can be directly applied to IR scores of the search results, thereby boosting the documents in the resulting ranking that have implicit user feedback indicating document quality.
- one or more viewing length differentiators can be identified for use in the weighting.
- a viewing length differentiator can include a factor governed by a determined category of the search query, a factor governed by a determined type of a user generating the individual selections, or a combination of them.
- the document views can be weighted based on the viewing length information in conjunction with the viewing length differentiator(s), such as the determined category of the search query and the determined type of the user.
- the threshold(s) (or formula) for what constitutes a good click can be evaluated on query and user specific bases.
- the query categories can include “navigational” and “informational”, where a navigational query is one for which a specific target page or site is likely desired (e.g., a query such as “BMW”), and an informational query is one for which many possible pages are equally useful (e.g., a query such as “George Washington's Birthday”).
- a navigational query is one for which a specific target page or site is likely desired (e.g., a query such as “BMW”)
- an informational query is one for which many possible pages are equally useful (e.g., a query such as “George Washington's Birthday”).
- Such categories may also be broken down into sub-categories as well, such as informational-quick and informational-slow: a person may only need a small amount of time on a page to gather the information they seek when the query is “George Washington's Birthday”, but that same user may need a good deal more time to assess a result when the query is “Hilbert transform tutorial”.
- the query categories can be identified by analyzing the IR scores or the historical implicit feedback provided by the click fractions. For example, significant skew in either of these (meaning only one or a few documents are highly favored over others) can indicate a query is navigational. In contrast, more dispersed click patterns for a query can indicate the query is informational. In general, a certain category of query can be identified (e.g., navigational), a set of such queries can be located and pulled from the historical click data, and a regression analysis can be performed to identify one or more features that are indicative of that query type (e.g., mean staytime for navigational queries versus other query categories; the term “staytime” refers to time spent viewing a document result, also known as document dwell time).
- a certain category of query can be identified (e.g., navigational)
- a set of such queries can be located and pulled from the historical click data
- a regression analysis can be performed to identify one or more features that are indicative of that query type (e.g., mean staytime for
- Traditional clustering techniques can also be used to identify the query categories. This can involve using generalized clustering algorithms to analyze historic queries based on features such as the broad nature of the query (e.g., informational or navigational), length of the query, and mean document staytime for the query. These types of features can be measured for historical queries, and the threshold(s) can be adjusted accordingly. For example, K means clustering can be performed on the average duration times for the observed queries, and the threshold(s) can be adjusted based on the resulting clusters.
- User types can also be determined by analyzing click patterns. For example, computer savvy users often click faster than less experienced users, and thus users can be assigned different weighting functions based on their click behavior. These different weighting functions can even be fully user specific (a user group with one member). For example, the average click duration and/or click frequency for each individual user can be determined, and the threshold(s) for each individual user can be adjusted accordingly. Users can also be clustered into groups (e.g., using a K means clustering algorithm) based on various click behavior patterns.
- the weighting can be adjusted based on the determined type of the user both in terms of how click duration is translated into good clicks versus not-so-good clicks, and in terms of how much weight to give to the good clicks from a particular user group versus another user group.
- Some user's implicit feedback may be more valuable than other users due to the details of a user's review process. For example, a user that almost always clicks on the highest ranked result can have his good clicks assigned lower weights than a user who more often clicks results lower in the ranking first (since the second user is likely more discriminating in his assessment of what constitutes a good result).
- a user can be classified based on his or her query stream.
- the presented rank (the position) of the document results 4010 is highly correlated with click rate in the sense that the top result will receive many more clicks than the last result, even if their positions are swapped.
- the user interface 4000 presents the search results for the query using multiple pages, and an interface element 4020 allows the user to view additional pages of search results as desired.
- many of the document results for a typical search may never be viewed at all by the user.
- the presentation of the results in the page can have a big impact on the observed click rates, and various aspects of presentation are often independent of the quality of a given result.
- the bolding 4030 of the results (both in the title and the snippet), length of titles 4040 , indenting 4050 , presence of ads 4060 (or similar objects that appear above the first result for a given query) can affect the observed click rates.
- FIG. 4B shows an example process of building a prior model for use in enhancing the quality of signals from document result selections.
- Multiple features can be received 4110 for search results presented in a user interface of a document search service.
- the first feature can be the position of the document result in the user interface within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned
- a second feature can be the language (L) of the search query.
- the set of features used can include features that are correlated with click rate and that are independent of the query (Q) and the search result (D).
- the specific query (Q) or the general type of query e.g., as defined by query clustering
- the selection of features, which are predictive of click through can be guided by standard information gain feature selection techniques.
- information regarding document result selections for searches performed using the document search service can be obtained 4120 , where the information spans multiple different queries.
- This information can be used to generate 4130 a prior model, where the prior model represents a probability of document result selection (e.g., a query-independent probability of selection) given values of the multiple features.
- FIG. 4C shows example features and an example process of building a prior model.
- One or more user selection log(s) 4300 include click through data, such as described above. These user selection log(s) 4300 can be understood conceptually as a set of queries, including a first query 4310 through query N, where many user searches, and document result selections, have been observed within the context of each query.
- a query 4310 includes a document result 4320 that was selected by a user, and the document result 4320 can have an associated relevance feature 4322 (e.g., the IR score of the document) and an associated display bias feature 4324 (e.g., the position of the document).
- another document result 4330 which was returned along with first document result 4320 within the context of the query 4310 , has its own associated relevance feature and display bias feature.
- These features of the document result 4330 , presented along with the document result 4320 can be considered features of the document result 4320 .
- the IR score of the document result 4330 can be saved as a feature of the document result 4320 , which was selected, in a single log entry including the IR score of the result 4320 , the position of result 4320 , and the IR score of the result 4330 returned along with result 4320 . Note that being “returned along with” does not indicate the two documents were necessarily displayed in the same page of the user interface, but only that the two documents were included in the search results for the given query.
- user selections can be collected 4350 from the user selection log(s) 4300 across queries (e.g., independent of query) for multiple combinations of values of the selected features, where those features can include a feature related to another document returned along with a selected document within the context of a query.
- This collecting can involve accumulating counts observed in the log(s) 4300 , including separately accumulating short, medium and long clicks, as well as the event of a result being shown, but another result being clicked.
- a query-independent selection probability can be determined 4360 given the selected features. For example, in the case of the features being position and language, the number of long, short and medium clicks at position 1 on an English language search site can be extracted from the log(s) 4300 , as well as the number of times other results have been clicked while a result at position 1 on the English language search site has been shown. These numbers can be found for every combination of position and language to determine the query-independent selection probability. In general, a mapping can be computed (based on the log(s) 4300 ) between the selected feature values and a predicted click through rate to produce a prior model for the selected features.
- the features can be split into two groups.
- the first group can include a reduced set of more important features, and the second group can contain the rest (i.e., two disjoint groups forming the full set of features).
- the first group can be used for accumulating click counts based on all possible combinations of feature values in the first group.
- the prior model can be trained on the values of the second group of features.
- the prior model can be a standard linear or logistic regression, or other model types.
- the prior model can essentially represent the statistics of historical click data, indicating what percentage of people clicked on a result given presentation of the result and the set of features.
- splitting the features into two groups can allow the use of a larger number of parameters in the model (for every combination of feature values in group one), but not so many parameters that the model cannot be trained.
- the prior model can, be output 4140 to a ranking engine for ranking of search results.
- the prior model can be saved to a computer-readable medium for use by the ranking engine, or otherwise made available to the ranking engine.
- the features of the prior model can be evaluated, the combination of feature values for a given result can be looked up in the prior model to find a click through rate predicted by the prior model, and this predicted click through rate can be compared with the click through rate given by a separate implicit user feedback model (e.g., the traditional click fraction described above).
- the ranking score of a search result can be multiplied by a number smaller than one if the traditional click fraction is smaller than the click fraction predicted by the prior model, or by a number greater than one otherwise.
- the prior model can be used to clean the signal of an implicit user feedback model that gives a measure of relevance for a document result within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned.
- the manner in which the output signal of the prior model is used can be adjusted based on the specific implementation and historical data combined with human generated relevance ratings (e.g., employed in a tuning process to select an appropriate boosting transform for a given implementation).
- the prior model can be used to modify and improve the ranking of search results generated for a given query, and the modified ranking can be presented to a user (e.g., on a display device in a web browser user interface).
- FIG. 4D shows an example hierarchy of databases 4400 for storing information associated with document search results.
- the databases 4400 in FIG. 4D can be used to store click data associated with the selection of results returned from a search query.
- click data stored in the databases 4400 can include counts of how many long, medium and short clicks have occurred for each search result for a given query.
- the databases 4400 can be included in or be part of the result selection log(s) 2060 ( FIG. 2 ).
- the databases 4400 can store click data based on the context of the user performing the clicks. For example, click data associated with the country and the language of the user can be stored.
- the country of the user can be identified by the user interface used to perform the query (e.g., a country of Canada can be identified if a user performs a search using the Google Canadian search site www.google.ca), or the country can be identified by the language of the query, for example.
- a global base model database 4401 can include click data for all countries and all languages.
- click data can be stored in country databases 4402 - 4410 , language databases 4420 - 4424 , and in the global base model database 4401 .
- click data associated with clicks made by a French-speaking Canadian can be stored in the Canada country database 4408 , the French language database 4422 , and the base model 4401 .
- Click data associated with clicks made by an English-speaking Canadian can be stored in the Canada country database 4408 , the English language database 4424 , and the base model 4401 .
- Click data associated with clicks made by a French-speaking user using a French user interface can be stored in the France country database 4406 , the French language database 4422 , and the base model 4401 .
- Click data associated with clicks made by an English-speaking American can be stored in the U.S.A. country database 4410 , the English language database 4424 , and the base model 4401 .
- Click data associated with clicks made by a German-speaking user using a German user interface can be stored in the Germany country database 4402 , the German language database 4420 , and the base model 4401 .
- Click data associated with clicks made by a German-speaking Swiss user can be stored in the Switzerland country database 4404 , the German language database 4402 , and the base model 4401 .
- the click data stored in the databases 4400 can be used to calculate traditional and LCC click fractions.
- the click data in the language, country and global databases can be used to modify a rank of a document in a search results list. If there is sufficient data in the country database, country-specific click data can be used. If there is not sufficient data (e.g., a small number of records) in the country database, data in the language database can be used. For example, for a given English query from Canada, if there is no data associated with that query in the Canada database 4408 , there may be associated data in the English database 4424 (e.g., click data associated with the query may have come from clicks from another English-speaking country, such as the U.S.). If there is no data associated with a query in the country or language databases, there may be data associated with the query in the base model database 4401 .
- the hierarchy presented in FIG. 4D is a logical hierarchy. Separate physical databases can be used, one for each country and language and one for the base model, as illustrated in FIG. 4D , or a different number of databases may be used. For example, all country data may be stored in a single country database, with different country data identified by a country code included in records stored in the database. As another example, all click data may be stored in a single database, with country and language information distinguishable by country and language codes, for example.
- FIG. 4E shows an example of a method 4500 for providing an input to a ranking.
- the method 4500 can be performed, for example, by the rank modifier engine 2070 ( FIG. 2 ).
- a query is associated with first prior queries in a first population (step 4502 ).
- a query originating from a particular country e.g., Canada
- prior queries for the same information originating from that country (e.g., queries stored in the Canada country database 4408 ).
- the query is then associated with second prior queries associated with a second population (step 4504 ).
- the query entered from a user interface associated with a particular language e.g., English
- the query entered from a user interface associated with a particular language can be associated with prior queries for the same information entered in a user interface using the same language (e.g., the query can be associated with prior queries stored in the English language database 4424 ).
- the second prior queries can be queries from the global, base model database 4401 and the first prior queries can be queries associated with the language of the query (i.e., just as information from the associated language database can be used if insufficient data exists in the country database, the global database can be used if insufficient data exists in the language database).
- the second data is then deemphasized (step 4506 ).
- the data associated with the query language can be weighted less than data associated with the query country. If the language data is not deemphasized, popular results in a foreign country can have a disproportionate effect on the ranking, such as affecting the ranking more than less popular, but viable results from the country of the user entering the query.
- the second population is more generic than the first population. Click fractions derived from more generic population data are to be trusted less than less generic population data, because they can include information from unrelated queries. Therefore, the more generic databases are deemphasized. The smoothing described above can do this “deemphasizing” automatically, so that if there is enough data in the more specific database (the first database), the data in the more generic databases can be ignored.
- the second data is deemphasized if click fractions derived from the first data are less than click fractions derived from the second data (step 4508 ).
- a quantity is derived with the property that the larger it is, the more it has a contribution to ranking.
- a value of 0 means that this ranking component does not modify ranking, while larger values provide the ability to make more significant changes to ranking.
- First data less than second data is a comparison between the derived quantities. The interpretation is that if the second database can make more significant changes to ranking than the first, it should be deemphasized to limit its effect on ranking. For example, a language-specific click fraction can be reduced if a country-specific click fraction is less than the language-specific click fraction.
- the second data is deemphasized if a language of the query and a user interface are the same (step 4510 ).
- Foreigners or people who speak a foreign language, may enter a foreign-language query in a particular search interface and expect the foreign results.
- a person in the U.S. can enter a Chinese query using the U.S. Google search site, and Chinese results should not be penalized (i.e., not ranked lower).
- the second data is deemphasized if a language of the document and a user interface are the same (step 4512 ). For example, users who select foreign-language results have likely already determined the language of the result before they make their selection. Therefore click fractions such as the language LCC fraction are not reduced if the language of the document is different than the language of the user interface.
- the first data and deemphasized second data are combined to create a quality of result statistic (step 4514 ).
- a quality of result statistic For example, country-specific and language-specific click fractions can be included in a combined click fraction.
- the quality of result statistic is provided as input to a ranking (step 4516 ).
- the quality of result statistic can be provided to the ranking engine 2030 to adjust the ranking of search results for the query.
- FIG. 4F is an example of a method 4600 for determining whether to provide an input to a ranking.
- the method 4600 can be used to determine whether to perform method 4500 for a given query.
- the method 4600 can be performed, for example, by the rank modifier engine 2070 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Quality of result statistics, such as those generated by the method 4500 can be computed if there have been at least a T 1 threshold number (e.g., 100) of clicks for a given query.
- T 1 threshold number e.g. 100
- T 2 is a threshold value, such as 10. If a document has not been shown very often on the first results page, there is a low probability that it will be clicked on, so deemphasizing click data (e.g., as in method 4500 ) is meaningful for documents that have been displayed at least a certain number of times on the first results page.
- step 4606 it is determined whether the document has a language or global traditional click fraction that is above a threshold T 3 (step 4606 ). If neither the language nor global traditional click fractions for a document are above a threshold value such as 0.1, then it may not be meaningful to deemphasize them (e.g., as in method 4500 ). If the document has a language or global traditional click fraction that is above a threshold T 3 , then a method providing an input to a ranking (e.g., method 4500 ) can be performed.
- a threshold value such as 0.1

Abstract
Description
BASE=[#WC(Q,D)]/[#WC(Q)+S0]
where #WC(Q,D) is the sum of weighted clicks for a query-URL pair, #WC(Q) is the sum of weighted clicks for the query (summed over all results for the query), and S0 is a smoothing factor.
LANG=[#WC(Q,D,L)+S1·BASE]/[#WC(Q,L)+S1]
COUNTRY=[#WC(Q,D,L,C)+S2·LANG]/[#WC(Q,L,C)+S2]
where LANG incorporates language specific click data, plus BASE, and COUNTRY incorporates country (and language) specific click data, plus LANG. In this manner, if there is less data for the more specific click fractions, the overall fraction falls back to the next higher level for which more data is available.
BASE=[#WC(query,url)]/[#C(query,url)+S0]
where #WC(query,url) is the sum of weighted clicks for the query-URL pair, #C(query) is the total number of clicks (ordinal count, not weighted) for the query and URL, and S0 is a smoothing factor. Unlike the traditional fraction, only clicks for the given URL are considered in the LCC click fraction. At a high level, the LCC fraction can be interpreted as a measure of how long people stayed on the page given that they clicked on it, independent of the other results for that query. Therefore, the LCC click fraction can be high for a given URL even if it gets far fewer clicks than a comparable result in a higher position. Further, since the LCC fraction measures how long the average user stayed on the page once they clicked on it, the LCC fraction can be immune to presentation bias issues (e.g., an attractive title).
BASE=[#WC(query,url,language)]/[#C(query,url,language)+S1]
where #WC(query,url,language) is the sum of weighted clicks for the query-URL-language combination, #C(query,language) is the total number of clicks (ordinal count, not weighted) for the query, URL, and language, and S1 is a smoothing factor. The per-country LCC fraction can be defined as follows:
BASE=[#WC(query,url,language,country)]/[#C(query,url,language,country)+S2]
where #WC(query,url,language,country) is the sum of weighted clicks for the query, URL, language, and country, #C(query,language,country) is the total number of clicks (ordinal count, not weighted) for the query, URL, language, and country, and S2 is a smoothing factor.
