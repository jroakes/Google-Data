Definitions
- This document relates to data processing.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources such as video or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, book articles, or news articles.
- a search system can identify resources in response to a text search query that includes one or more search phrases (i.e., one or more words) or in response to user interactions with another interface such as a map interface that can include a location from the displayed map area with search phrases entered or selected by the user.
- the search system ranks the resources based on their relevance to the search query and on measures of quality of the resources and provides search results that link to the identified resources.
- the search results are typically ordered for viewing according to the rank.
- Some users that provide a search query are interested in receiving search results referencing resources that include information relevant to a particular location. For example, a user that submits the search query “Atlanta Activities” may be searching for web pages that provide information about the city of Atlanta. However, search results provided in response to the search query may include a web page does not provide information about Atlanta, but rather merely includes the word Atlanta.
- one resource referenced by the search results may be a retailer site that includes a drop-down menu enabling the user to specify their current location in order to identify retail locations near the selected location.
- Another resource may include the word Atlanta in a footnote of the resource that specifies a business location of the company that developed the web page.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving geotokens for a resource, each geotoken being a resource token that references a geographic location; for at least one geographic location referenced by the geotokens for the resource, computing an initial geotopicality score using token attribute values of geotokens in the resource, the token attribute values specifying a resource location of the geotoken in the resource; selecting a set of geotopical locations for the resource based on the initial geotopicality score for the at least one geographic location, each geotopical location being a geographic location for which the initial geotopicality score exceeds a geotopicality threshold; for each geotopical location, computing a final geotopicality score representing a measure of relevance for the resource relative to the geotopical location; and providing data specifying the geotopical locations for the resource and geotopicality scores for the geotopical locations.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Computing the final geotopicality score for each geotopical location in the set can include computing, for each geotopical location in the set, a normalized geotopicality score based on a ratio of the initial geotopicality score for the geotopical location relative to a sum of initial geotopicality scores for the geotopical locations in the set.
- Methods can further include the actions of determining a total quantity of references to the resource and geotokens that are included in the references to the resource, the references being located in other resources; for each geotopical location specified by the geotokens included in the data, computing an off-page geotopicality score for the resource, the off-page geotopicality score being computed based on a quantity of the references that specify the geotopical location; and computing an aggregate geotopicality score for each geotopical location using the final geotopicality score and the off-page geotopicality score.
- Computing the off-page geotopicality score for each geotopical location can include computing a ratio of a quantity of the references to the resource that specify the geotopical location relative to the total quantity of the references to the resource.
- Computing the off-page geotopicality score for each geotopical location can include computing a ratio of a quantity of the references to the resource that specify the geotopical location relative to the total quantity of the references to the resource that include a geotoken.
- Methods can further include the actions of identifying a geotoken that is included in boilerplate content; and removing the identified geotoken from the geotokens for the resource.
- Computing an initial geotopicality score can include identifying, for each geotoken, the token attribute values for the geotokens; assigning each geotoken a weight based on the token attribute values for the geotoken; and computing the initial geotopicality score using the weight assigned to each geotoken.
- Identifying the token attribute values can include identifying, for each geotoken, at least one of a value representing a location of the geotoken on a web page, a value representing that the geotoken is included in a web page title, a value representing that the geotoken is a merger of two or more tokens, a value representing that the geotoken is bolded or highlighted, or a value representing that the geotoken is included in a web page tag.
- Selecting a set of geotopical locations can include selecting at least one geographic location that has an initial geotopicality score that exceeds the geotopicality threshold and for which a ratio of the initial geotopicality score relative to a highest initial geotopicality score exceeds a minimum specified ratio.
- Methods can further include the actions of receiving a search query that includes a reference to a geographic location; selecting a set of search results responsive to the search query, each search result referencing a resource; adjusting result scores for the selected search results using geotopicality scores for resources referenced by the search results; and providing data that cause presentation of the search results according to the adjusted result scores.
- Selecting a set of geotopical locations can include selecting two or more geotopical locations for a single resource. Selecting a set of geotopical locations can include categorizing the geotokens using a location hierarchy; and selecting at least one location specified by the location hierarchy to be included in the set of geotopical locations.
- Search results that are most likely relevant to a particular geographic location are assigned geotopicality scores that represent relative measures of relevance to adjust result scores for search queries for which particular geographic location is specified.
- the adjusted result scores may cause a presentation order of search results to be adjusted based on the relative relevance of the search results to the particular location.
- search results that have been determined to be more relevant to the particular location may be presented at more prominent display positions.
- boosting and reducing the weight of some geotokens (i.e., tokens that reference geographic locations) in a resource may result in a more accurate measure of geotopicality than geotopicality measurements that do not boost or reduce geotoken weight.
- some geotokens may be more indicative of relevance than other geotokens. Therefore, increasing a weight that is assigned to geotokens that are more indicative of relevance may increase the accuracy of the measures of geotopicality.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which a search system provides search services.
- FIG. 2 is a Venn diagram of an example location hierarchy.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of example resources that include geotokens.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process for calculating an aggregate geotopicality score for a resource.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process for providing search queries using geotopicality scores.
- Geotopicality scores specify measures of relevance between resources and geographic locations (e.g., address, point of interest, city, state, country, or other specified geographic location or region). Geotopicality scores are computed for resources to provide an indication of which resources are more relevant than other resources to a particular geographic location. For example, a first resource that has a higher geotopicality score for the location “Atlanta,” is likely more relevant to the query “Atlanta Activities” than a second resource that has a lower geotopicality score for “Atlanta.”
- Geotopicality scores for resources can be used to adjust a presentation prominence (e.g., a presentation order) of search results that reference the resources.
- geotopicality scores can be used to increase the presentation prominence of a search result for the first resource relative to the presentation prominence of a search result for the second resource.
- the search result that references the second resource may be selected for presentation at a higher presentation position than the search result that references the first resource.
- the higher geotopicality score for the first resource may result in the search result for the first resource being selected for presentation at a higher presentation position than the search result for the second resource.
- geotopicality score is used to refer to a single geotopicality score for a single location unless otherwise specified.
- An aggregate geotopicality score can be computed using an on-page geotopicality score and/or an off-page geotopicality score.
- An on-page geotopicality score is a value that is determined based on geotokens (i.e., tokens that reference a geographic location) that are included in the resource itself.
- geotokens i.e., tokens that reference a geographic location
- the on-page geotopicality score for a particular resource can be determined based on a quantity and/or type of textual references to a particular geographic location that are included in the resource.
- An off-page geotopicality score is determined based on geotokens that are included in references to the resource.
- the off-page geotopicality score for the particular resource can be determined based, in part, on the inclusion of a geographic identifier (e.g., a city name) in the anchor text of an active link to the particular resource.
- a geographic identifier e.g., a city name
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a search system 110 provides search services.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them, connects publishers 104 , user devices 106 , and the search system 110 .
- the environment 100 may include many thousands publishers and user devices 106 .
- a web site 104 is one or more resources 108 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web site 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web site.
- a resource 108 is any data that can be provided by the web site 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources 108 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- the resources can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the search system 110 identifies the resources 108 by crawling and indexing the resources 108 provided by the publishers 104 .
- Data about the resources 108 can be indexed based on the resource 108 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 108 are stored in a search index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 114 to the search system 110 .
- the search system 110 accesses the search index 112 to identify resources 108 that are predicted to be relevant to the search query 109 , for example based on relevance scores that have been computed for the resources 108 .
- the search system 110 selects resources 108 , generates search results 116 that identify the resources 108 , and returns the search results 116 to the user devices 106 .
- a search result 116 is data generated by the search system 110 that references a resource 108 that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes an active link (e.g., a URL) to the resource.
- An example search result 116 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- User devices 106 receive the search results 116 and render the search results 116 , for example, in the form of one or more web pages, for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource 108 referenced by the link.
- the web site 104 hosting the resource 108 receives the request for the resource 108 from the user device 106 and provides the resource 108 to the requesting user device 106 .
- Search queries 114 submitted during user sessions are stored in a data store such as the search log data store 118 .
- Selection data specifying actions taken in response to search results 116 provided are also stored in association with (i.e., indexed according to) the search query in a data store such as the search log data store 118 . These actions can include whether a search result was selected by a user.
- location data specifying a geographic location of the user device that submitted the search query can also be stored in association with the search query in the search log data store 118 .
- the data stored in the search log data store 118 can be used to map search queries 114 submitted during search sessions to resources 108 that were identified in search results 116 and the actions taken by users.
- Search results 116 are selected to be provided to a user device 106 in response to a search query 114 based on result scores.
- Result scores are scores that represent a measure of relevance of the resource 108 to a search query. For example, a result score for a resource 108 can be computed based on an information retrieval (“IR”) score corresponding to the resource 108 , and, optionally, a quality score of the resource 108 relative to other available resources.
- IR information retrieval
- a presentation order for the search results 116 can be selected according to and/or using the result scores. In turn, data that cause presentation of the search results 116 according to the presentation order can be provided to the user device 106 .
- the result score for a resource can be computed and/or adjusted using a geotopicality score for the resource.
- the result score may be computed as a dot product, or another function, of the information retrieval score, the quality score, and/or the geotopicality score for the resource.
- the environment 100 includes a geotopicality apparatus 126 that computes geotopicality scores for resources.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 is a data processing apparatus including one or more processors that are configured to compute geotopicality scores for resources based on references to geographic locations that are associated with the resource.
- a geographic reference e.g., text identifying a geographic location
- a reference e.g., an active link
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 computes an on-page geotopicality score for the resource. As described in more detail below, the geotopicality apparatus 126 determines the on-page geotopicality score for a resource 108 based on a quantity, placement, and/or specificity of geotokens (e.g., words, phrases, meta information, images, audio or other information specifying a geographic location) that are included in the resource 108 .
- geotokens e.g., words, phrases, meta information, images, audio or other information specifying a geographic location
- a web page that includes the text “Atlanta, Ga.” as a tag for the web page may have a higher on-page geotopicality score (“on-page score”) for Atlanta than a web page that only includes “Atlanta” in a dropdown menu or other “boilerplate” content (e.g., content that is included in many different web pages independent of the topic to which the content is relevant).
- on-page score on-page geotopicality score
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 can also compute an off-page geotopicality score. As described in more detail below, the geotopicality apparatus 126 determines the off-page geotopicality score for a resource 108 based on a quantity of geotokens that are included in references to the resource. For example, the geotopicality apparatus 126 can determine the “Atlanta” off-page geotopicality score for a web page based on a quantity of active links that link to the web page and that include the anchor text “Atlanta” (or other references to Atlanta, such as zip codes for Atlanta).
- a web page that is more often referenced by active links having anchor text referencing “Atlanta” can have a higher “Atlanta” off-page geotopicality score (“off-page score”) than another web page that is less often referenced by active links having anchor text referencing “Atlanta.”
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 computes an aggregate geotopicality score (“aggregate score”) for a resource as a function of the on-page score and off-page score for the resource.
- aggregate score can be a sum, product, or another function of the on-page score and the off-page score for the resource.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 can store on-page, off-page, and aggregate scores for the resources 108 in the search index 112 .
- the search system 110 can use these scores to compute and/or adjust result scores for resources.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 does not compute aggregate scores for a resource having an on-page score that fails to exceed a minimum geotopicality threshold. For example, the geotopicality apparatus 126 can compare the on-page score for each resource to the geotopicality threshold, and compute aggregate scores only for those resources having on-page scores that exceed the geotopicality threshold.
- the resources that are assigned aggregate geotopicality scores can be limited to those resources that are considered to have at least a minimum specified on-page relevancy to the geographic location referenced by the geotokens.
- the geographic location referenced by the geotokens is referred to as a geotopical location for the resource.
- a geotopical location for the resource For example, Atlanta is considered to be a geotopical location for a web page having an “Atlanta” on-page score that exceeds the geotopicality threshold.
- a single geotoken can be an indication of relevance to more than one specified geographic location.
- the city Atlanta is located in Fulton County, which is located in the state of Georgia. Therefore, the geotoken “Atlanta” can be an indication that a web page is relevant to the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, and/or the state of Georgia.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 can utilize hierarchical relationships between locations to determine a measure of relevance of a geotoken to a particular geographic location, as described in more detail below.
- FIG. 2 is a Venn diagram 200 of an example location hierarchy.
- the Venn diagram illustrates logical relationships between geographic regions and may not be indicative of the size, shape, or directional relationship between geographic regions.
- the Venn diagram 200 illustrates hierarchical relationships between geographic locations from a national to a city level. It is noted that different governments define locations in different ways, and each level of the hierarchy is related to geographic locations of similar scale. For example, state level data may be related to a state, a province, or a territory, to name a few. City level data may be related to a city, a town, a village, a natural geographic feature, or a street address, to name a few.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 can use, for example, the location hierarchy shown in the Venn diagram 200 when determining geotopicality scores for the resource 108 .
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 identifies geotokens for a resource and assigns the geotokens to a category in the hierarchy. For example, in response to identifying geotokens that display “USA”, or similar geotokens such as “America”, “United States of America” or “USofA” to name a few, are associated with USA 202 .
- USA 202 is a national level category of geographic locations associated with the United States of America. USA 202 has no parent category in this example, but could be associated with a parent category, such as North America.
- the Venn diagram 200 includes two state level categories, Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 .
- Geotokens that display “Texas”, “Arkansas”, or appropriate synonyms thereof such as “Lone Star State” or “US-AR” are associated with Texas 204 or Arkansas 206 , as appropriate.
- Both Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 are contained within USA 202 , indicating that USA 202 is a parent of both Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 . Any geotoken associated with Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 , when examined for national level association, resolve to USA 202 .
- county level categories Logan 208 , Garza 210 , Bowie 212 and Miller 214 and city level categories Paris 216 , Subiaco 218 , Post 220 , and Texarkana 222 are assigned geotokens that display associated names or synonyms. Parentage for city or county level categories is also determined similarly. For example, Post 220 resolves to Garza 210 at the county level, Texas 204 at the state level, and USA 202 at the national level.
- Some categories span two or more parent categories. For example, some of the Great Lakes are in both the USA and Canada, the Rocky Mountains cover multiple states level areas in multiple countries, and some cities cross from one county or state to another.
- One such example city is Texarkana 222 .
- the Texarkana metropolitan area contains two municipal areas: Texarkana, Arkansas and Texarkana, Texas. However, many resources may not specify a municipal area, so the category for Texarkana 222 can span the county level categories Bowie 212 and Miller 214 , and the state level categories Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 . Both Texas 204 and Arkansas 206 are within the national category USA 202 and thus Texarkana 222 resolves to USA 202 at the national level.
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 uses the category to which a geotoken is assigned to determine a measure of relevance of the geotoken to another category.
- a geotoken is generally considered most relevant to the geographic location associated with the category to which the geotoken is assigned, and less relevant to each parent category.
- a geotoken that is assigned to the Post category 220 can be considered to have descending relevance to the Post 220 , Garza 210 , Texas 204 , and USA 202 categories, respectively.
- the relevance of the geotoken relative to each of the geographic regions represented by the respective categories can be assigned based on the category to which the geotoken has been assigned as well as the hierarchical relationships of the categories. For example, the measure of relevance that is assigned to the geotoken relative to the Post category 220 can be higher than the measure of relevance that is assigned to the geotoken relative to the Texas category 204 . As described in more detail below, the measures of relevance that are assigned to each geotoken for a resource are used to compute geotopicality scores for the resource.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of example resources 300 that include geotokens.
- the geotokens may be used to calculate geotopicality scores, as described in more detail below.
- the resources 300 are web pages (or other online documents) that have been indexed by a search system.
- a computer system such as the geotopicality apparatus 126 examines tokens that have been indexed for (or are included in) resource 302 that includes content describing state parks in Pennsylvania. Tokens that include a full or partial reference to a geographic location can be identified as geotokens.
- the resource 302 includes geotokens 304 - 314 (e.g., tokens referencing Pennsylvania, Erie, Cleveland, and other geographic locations).
- the computer system can assign each geotoken 304 - 314 to a category of a location hierarchy such as that described with reference to FIG. 2 .
- geotokens 304 and 306 identify “Pennsylvania” and are assigned to a state level Pennsylvania category.
- Geotokens 308 and 312 respectively identify “Erie, Pa.” and “Erie County, Pennsylvania” and are assigned to the “Erie” category, which is a child of the Pennsylvania category.
- Geotokens 310 and 314 respectively identify “Cleveland” and “Cleveland, Ohio” and are assigned to the “Cleveland” category, which is a child category of the “Cuyahoga” category, which is a child category for the “Ohio” category.
- four geotokens are considered relevant to the Pennsylvania category: two of the geotokens being directly assigned to the “Pennsylvania” category, and two being assigned to a child of the “Pennsylvania” category.
- the locations of the geotokens in the resource 302 are also identified by the computer system.
- the relevance of geotokens can be determined based, in part, on the locations of the geotokens in the resource 302 .
- Different resource areas e.g., title, main text, and tags
- the geotoken 304 is included in the title of the resource 302 , and therefore, may be considered more influential for determining a geographic location to which the resource 302 is relevant than the geotoken 314 that is located in a footnote of the resource 302 .
- the geotoken 304 may be assigned a higher “weight” for determining the relevance of the resource (i.e., relative to geographic locations) than the weight assigned to geotoken 314 .
- geotoken 304 will be more influential than geotoken 314 for determining measures of relevance between the resource and particular geographic locations.
- the weight assigned to a geotoken that appears in the title can be inversely proportional to a quantity of geographic locations that are referenced by geotokens in the title. If a single geographic location is referenced by a geotoken in a resource title, the weight assigned to the geotoken may be higher than the weight assigned to geotokens that respectively reference two or more different geographic locations. For example, when a single location is referenced by the title of the resource 302 , it is more likely that the resource is relevant to the geographic location referenced by the geotoken than when multiple geotokens referencing multiple different locations are in the title.
- Geotokens that are located near a beginning of a resource are referred to as “leading geotokens” and may provide a reliable indication of the locations to which the resource 302 is relevant. Therefore, leading geotokens may be assigned a higher weight than geotokens that appear later in the resource (e.g., outside of the threshold quantity of words or outside of the threshold quantity of pixels).
- the geotoken 306 is in the first sentence of the first paragraph of the resource 302 , and therefore, may be assigned a higher weight than the geotoken 308 that is included in the second paragraph of the resource 302 .
- a news article might have a byline that includes a geotoken representing the location where the news article was filed and/or written. This geotoken may be assigned a higher weight than geotokens that appear later in the article because the location listed in the byline is often the location where events reported in the news article occurred. Therefore, this geotoken may be a reliable indication of a geographic location to which the news article is relevant.
- Geotokens that are located in some portions of a resource can be eliminated or be assigned lower weights than other geotokens in the resource. For example, geotokens that are included in “boilerplate” content can be ignored, or be assigned a weight that is lower than the weights assigned to other geotokens in the resource.
- boilerplate is content that is included in many different web pages independent of the topic to which the content is relevant.
- Example boilerplate includes document elements such as headers, footers, drop-down menus, and legal disclaimers.
- Boilerplate may be included in a resource to aid user navigation of the resource, to provide a consistent look and feel across web pages in a website, or may be the result of using a template to generate the resource.
- the token 314 provides a location of the web developer that created the resource 302 in a footer of the resource 302 . Therefore, the geotoken 314 can be identified as boilerplate since it is located in the footer of the resource 302 .
- Qualified geotokens can be assigned a higher weight than unqualified geotokens.
- Qualified geotokens are geotokens that are formed by the merger of two individual geotokens. For example, Cleveland and Ohio are both geotoken that when combined create the qualified geotoken “Cleveland, Ohio” (e.g., geotoken 314 ). The geotoken 314 is more specific than unqualified geotokens, such as the geotoken 310 , which includes Cleveland, but does not include Ohio.
- Qualified geotokens generally include individual geotokens that are located adjacent to each other and/or appear in a specified sequence, but can be created from geotokens that are not adjacent to each other or in a specified sequence. For example, if Springfield and Ohio both appear on the page and no other states containing Springfield (e.g., Missouri or Illinois) appear on the page, then the geotokens Springfield and Ohio can be reliably combined to make the terms Springfield and Ohio less ambiguous.
- a qualified geotoken can be assigned to a location category with more confidence, such that more qualified geotokens may be more reliable indicators of a geographic location to which the geotoken is referring.
- the unqualified geotoken “Cleveland” in isolation could be referring to one of at least twenty six cities, towns, or other municipalities in America that are named Cleveland.
- “Cleveland” is qualified by (e.g., appears with) “Ohio,” the location being referred to is less ambiguous.
- parental support for a given location can be used to increase the weight of geotokens that are associated with that location. Parental support is a measure of the geotokens that are in child categories of a parent category.
- Erie has parental support of 80% for Pennsylvania (i.e., four of five geotokens, not including the ignored geotoken 314 , are assigned to or resolve to Pennsylvania) and 100% parental support for USA (all five non-ignored geotokens resolve to USA), for an average parental support of 90%.
- the weights that are assigned to each geotoken can be specified using “boost factors.” For example, the weight of a particular geotoken can be increased by 10% by multiplying the particular geotoken by a boost factor of 1.10. Similarly, the weight of a particular geotoken can be reduced by multiplying the particular geotoken by a boost factor that is less than 1.0.
- the quantity of geotokens that reference a particular location and weights for each of the geotokens that reference the particular location can be used to determine an on-page score for the resource 302 relative to the particular location.
- an initial on-page geotopicality score (“initial score”) for a resource may be determined using relationship (1).
- IS (1+max(TS*TBF,QLG*LMBF))*(1+QBF+TagBF)+(GC*PSBF) (1)
- the initial score (relative to Pennsylvania) for the resource 302 can be determined to be 10.03 (i.e., (1+max(1.0*1.2,1.0*1.1))*(1+1.1+1.05)+(5*1.05).
- Boost factors can be selected, for example, based on a statistical analysis of search logs (i.e., logs that specify search results that were clicked by users that submitted search queries) to estimate likelihoods that resources including particular geotokens are relevant to the geographic location referenced by the geotokens. These likelihoods can then be used to select boost factors based on (e.g., proportional to) the likelihoods.
- a final on-page geotopicality score (“final score”) for a particular location can be computed for a resource using the initial score for the particular location and other initial scores for other locations that are referenced by geotokens in the resource.
- the adjusted geotopicality scores for geotopical locations that are not referenced by the title of the resource will be the same as the initial scores (assuming that the title score is a binary value). However, the adjusted geotopicality score for a geotopical location that is referenced by the title of the resource will be greater than the initial score for the geotopical location.
- the final scores can be computed using the adjusted geotopicality scores and relationship (2), as described above.
- Other resource such as resources 316 - 320 can include references 322 - 326 (e.g., hypertext links) to the resource 300 .
- Each of the references 322 - 326 includes a geotoken.
- reference 322 includes the geotoken Pennsylvania
- reference 326 includes the geotoken Erie County.
- Inclusion of a geotoken in a reference to a target resource is an indication that the target resource is relevant to the location specified by the geotoken. Therefore, geotokens that reference a target resource can be used when computing the final score for the target resource. For example, when a large portion of references to the target resource include geotokens that reference a same geographic location, it is likely that the target resource is relevant to the referenced geographic location.
- the final score for a resource is adjusted using an off-page geotopicality score to compute an aggregate score.
- the off-page geotopicality score can be computed, for example, as a ratio of a quantity of references to the resource that specify a particular geographic location (e.g., a geotopical location) for the resource relative to a total quantity of references to the resource or relative to a quantity of the references that specify any geographic location.
- an aggregate score can be a product, sum, or another function of a final on-page score, as described above, and the off-page geotopicality score.
- a resource may only be assigned an off-page score relative to a particular geographic location when at least a minimum threshold quantity of references to the resource specify the particular geographic location.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example 400 process for calculating an aggregate geotopicality score for a resource.
- the process 400 is a process by which geotokens for a resource are received and an initial on-page geotopicality score is computed for a geographic location that is specified by the geotokens.
- a set of locations are selected as geotopical locations for the resource based on the initial score.
- a final score is then computed for each of the geotopical locations for the resource, and data that specify the geotopical locations and final scores are provided.
- the process 400 can be implemented, for example, by the geotopicality apparatus 126 , the search index 112 , and/or the search system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the process 400 .
- a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of the process 400 .
- Geotokens for a resource are received ( 402 ).
- each geotoken is a resource token (i.e., a word, set of words, audio file, video file, or other unit of content) that references a geographic location.
- Each geotoken can be identified from a set of resource tokens that have been indexed for the resource, for example, in a data store that stores data for the resource (e.g., the search index 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- the geotokens can be identified from a set of tokens that are stored with a reference to an index number and data type such that the resource can be represented by a string of tokens that have been extracted from the resource.
- the tokens can be compared to a data set of known geographic locations. Tokens that match or substantially match a known geographic location (e.g., tokens that are stubs, synonyms, common misspellings, alternative names for known geographic locations, or otherwise identified to represent known locations) are identified as geotokens for the resource.
- a token may also be examined in the context of surrounding tokens to determine if the token is used as a geotokens. For example, a number, followed by a proper noun, followed by a type of street or abbreviation thereof may be identified as a street address and marked as a geotoken. Adjacent geotokens may be identified and combined to create a qualified geotoken. For example, the text “Erie, Pa.” can be treated as a single qualified geotoken, as described with reference to FIG. 3 .
- a resource location of each geotoken is identified ( 404 ).
- the resource location i.e., a location of the geotoken in the resource
- the token attribute values can also specify characteristics of the tokens. For example, in addition to specifying a location of the geotoken in a resource, the token attribute values can specify whether the geotoken is included in a tag for the resource or whether the geotoken is included in boilerplate content. The geotoken attribute values can also specify whether the geotoken is highlighted, bolded, or otherwise visually emphasized relative to other content that is presented with the resource. The geotoken attribute values can further specify whether the geotoken is included in a title of the resource or whether the geotoken is a merger of two or more tokens. In some implementations, when a geotoken is identified as being included in boilerplate, that geotoken can be removed from the geotokens that have been identified for the resource.
- Each of the geotokens is assigned to a location category ( 406 ).
- the geotokens are assigned to a location category using a location hierarchy, such as the hierarchy described with reference to FIG. 2 .
- Each geotoken can be assigned to the most specific category that the geotoken matches and/or the most specific category that matches the geotoken with at least a threshold certainty. For example, “Erie, Pa.” may most narrowly be defined as referring to the city of Erie, but may be determined to be referring to the county of Erie, which includes the city of Erie, with a higher level of certainty.
- An initial on-page geotopicality score (“initial score”) is computed for at least one of the geographic locations referenced by the geotokens ( 408 ).
- the initial score is computed using token attribute values of geotokens that are included in the resource and that belong to a same location category.
- the initial score for a particular geographic location can be computed using a quantity of geotokens that belong to the location category representing the particular geographic location and weights (e.g., boost factors) that are associated with the geotokens.
- the relative importance of each geotoken for computing an initial score can be represented by a weight that is assigned to the geotoken.
- the weight assigned to each geotoken can be based on the location of the geotoken in the resource and/or a content type (e.g., boilerplate or tag) for the geotoken.
- portions of resources that are considered areas of high importance may be pre-defined, and geotokens that fall within those areas may be assigned higher weights than other geotokens.
- portions of a resource that contain an overview, summary, or which—according to resource authoring convention—are indicative of locations to which the resource is relevant may be identified as areas in which geotoken weight is increased relative to other geotokens. Examples of these high importance areas include a resource title, tag, and opening content (i.e., leading mentions).
- Geotokens that are considered to be in areas that are less indicative of the relevancy of the resource to a geographic location may be assigned a reduced weight relative to other content, or be assigned a weight of 0.0 (i.e., assigned a null weight).
- a set of geotopical locations are selected for the resource ( 410 ).
- the geotopical locations are locations for which an initial score exceeds a geotopicality threshold.
- the geotopicality threshold can be selected, for example, based on a statistical analysis of geotopicality scores that have been identified as relevant to a particular location.
- the threshold geotopicality score can be a median geotopicality score for resources that have been identified as relevant to the particular location.
- the threshold geotopicality score can be a median geotopicality score for resources that have been identified as not being relevant to the particular location.
- the set of geotopical locations can be selected using a list of tuples (i.e., location, initial score) that are stored following computation of the initial scores.
- tuples i.e., location, initial score
- the tuples can be ordered in descending order based on the initial scores, and any tuple having an initial score that does not exceed the geotopicality threshold can be removed.
- geotopical locations can be selected based on the range of initial scores that have been computed for the resource.
- the geotopical locations are selected using ratios of the initial scores relative to a highest initial score that is associated with the resource. For example, assume that the highest initial score for a resource is 5, and that the resource is also associated with other geotopicality scores of 3, 2, and 1.
- the geotopical locations may be selected as those locations that are associated with an initial score of at least 2.0 (e.g., using a geotopicality threshold of 1.99) and for which the ratio of the initial score to the highest initial score exceeds a minimum specified ratio (e.g., 0.5).
- the locations associated with the geotopicality scores of 5 and 3 may be selected as geotopical locations for the resource because each of these scores has a value of at least 2.0, and has a ratio greater than 0.5 (i.e., 5/5 and 3/5 are each greater than 0.5).
- Final on-page geotopicality scores (“final scores”) are computed for the set of geotopical locations ( 412 ).
- the final score that is computed for each geotopical location represents a measure of relevance for the resource relative to the geotopical location. For example, a resource is considered to be more relevant to a geotopical location that is associated with a higher final score than a geotopical location that is associated with a lower final score.
- final scores can be computed based on normalized initial scores.
- Each normalized initial score can be a score that is proportional to a ratio of the initial score relative to a sum of all initial scores for the resource.
- the normalized initial scores can be computed using relationship (2).
- the initial scores can be adjusted prior to being normalized. For example, each initial score can be adjusted based on whether the geotopical location associated with the geotopicality score is referenced by the title of the resource. For example, relationship (3) can be used to adjust the initial scores.
- the initial scores can also be normalized using other normalization techniques. For example, a lowest initial score and a highest geotopicality score can be respectively set to values of 0.0 and 1.0. In turn, each of the other initial scores can be normalized using linear, logarithmic, or other distribution techniques to assign values between zero and one.
- an aggregate score for each geotopical location for the resource is computed using the final scores and off-page geotopicality scores for the resource ( 414 ).
- the off-page geotopicality scores for the resource can be determined based on a portion of the references to the resources that include geotokens. For example, a total quantity of references to the resource and the geotokens that are included in the references to the resource can be determined.
- a location hierarchy similar to that described with reference to FIG. 2 can be used to categorize off-page geotokens.
- an off-page geotopicality score can be computed for each of the geotopical locations for the resource.
- the off-page geotopicality score for each geotopical location is computed as a ratio of the quantity of references that specify the geotopical location relative to a total quantity of references to the resource (or a total quantity of references that include a geotoken).
- a product, sum, an average or another function of the off-page geotopicality score and the final score is computed to determine the aggregate score for the resource and the geotopical location.
- aggregate scores are only computed for those resources that are referenced by at least a threshold quantity of off-page geotokens that specify the geotopical location.
- Data that specify the geotopical locations for the resource and the final (and/or aggregate) geotopicality scores are provided ( 416 ).
- the data are provided to a search system that uses the data to service search queries that specify a geographic location.
- the data are stored and indexed according to the resource.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for providing search queries using geotopicality scores.
- the process 500 is a process by which a set of search results that are responsive to a search query are selected in response to receiving the search result.
- result scores for the selected search results are adjusted using geotopicality scores for the search results and data that cause presentation of the search results according to the adjusted result scores are provided.
- the adjustment of the result scores results in a reordering of the search results for presentation.
- a search result that is most relevant to a geographic location specified by the query can be promoted (e.g., assigned a higher page presentation position) following adjustment of the result scores, while a search result that is less relevant may be demoted (e.g., assigned a lower page presentation position) following adjustment of the result scores.
- the process 500 can be implemented, for example, by the geotopicality apparatus 126 , the search index 112 , and/or the search system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- the geotopicality apparatus 126 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the process 500 .
- a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of the process 500 .
- a search query that includes a reference to a geographic location is received ( 502 ).
- the query includes a location phrase (i.e., one or more terms that specify a geographic location for a search query).
- a location phrase can be a city name, a zip code, a latitude/longitude coordinate pair, or another identifier of geographic location (i.e., a geographic identifier).
- Location phrases can match a geographic identifier for particular geographic location by having a geographic identifier that includes any reference to the particular geographic region (e.g., zip code) or includes a reference to a location that is within a specified distance of a the particular geographic region. For example, if the particular geographic location includes the city of San Francisco and all areas within 50 miles of the center of San Francisco, then geographic identifiers for queries that reference the city of San Francisco (e.g., zip code 94131), or locations within 50 miles of the city of San Francisco, (e.g., Oakland, Calif.), will match the geographic identifier for the San Francisco region.
- any reference to the particular geographic region e.g., zip code
- the location phrase can be determined and/or inferred based on a location of a user device that submitted the search query.
- the location of the user device can be detected based on user device data that is provided with the search query. For example, a user location associated with a particular search query can be detected using user profile data provided by the user and/or an anonymized Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g., a hash value computed using the IP address) corresponding to the user device.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the user location can also be provided by location-based services (e.g., GPS) that have been enabled by the user.
- a set of search results are selected for the query ( 504 ).
- the set of search results are selected from search results that have been identified as responsive to the search query.
- the set of search results can include those search results having a highest N result scores relative to the search query.
- the search results and corresponding result scores can be received, for example, from the search system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- the result scores can be determined by the search system 110 , for example, based on IR scores for resources referenced by the search results and/or quality measures for the resources.
- the result scores can be used, for example, to select an initial or default ranking for the search results.
- the result scores are adjusted using geotopicality scores for the resources that are referenced by the search results ( 506 ).
- the geotopicality scores that are used to adjust the result scores are the final or aggregate geotopicality scores for geotopical locations that are matched by the location phrase of the search query.
- the result scores can be adjusted, for example, by computing a sum, product, or another function of the result scores and the geotopicality scores for the matched geotopical location.
- Location phrases can match a geographic identifier for a geotopical location by including a phrase that is an exact match of the geographic identifier or otherwise refers to the geotopical location with at least a threshold confidence. For example, if the geographic identifier for a particular geotopical location is a city name (e.g., Atlanta, Ga.), matching location phrases can include the same city name (e.g., Atlanta, Ga.), or other references, such as zip codes, area codes, or other indicia of location that are attributable to the city name. Continuing with this example, the location phrases “30309” “ATL GA” and “Atlanta Fulton County” can each be considered to match the geographic identifier “Atlanta, Ga.”
- Data that cause presentation of the search results according to the adjusted result scores are provided ( 508 ).
- the data can be provided in response to receipt of the search query.
- the data can specify a list of search results and a relative (or absolute) presentation position for each of the search results.
