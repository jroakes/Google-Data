- the present invention is now described with respect to a specific embodiment thereof, in which a gaming link architecture G_linkA is used to provide an on-line gaming service, and in which a certain gaming link protocol G_linkP is used to establish data communication within G_linkA.
- a gaming link architecture G_linkA is used to provide an on-line gaming service
- a certain gaming link protocol G_linkP is used to establish data communication within G_linkA.
- the invention described herein is not restricted to a particular example, which will be described in what follows, but equally applies to other architectures possibly used to establish and provide an on-line gaming scenario.
- G_linkA a schematic diagram of the gaming link architecture G_linkA for providing an on-line gaming environment.
- the main components of G_linkA are a customer site containing customer located equipment CLE 110 , a provider site containing provider located equipment PLE 120 , and an access aggregation network AAN 130 connecting CLE 110 with PLE 120 .
- the customer located equipment CLE 110 includes a gaming consol GC 111 and other hardware components necessary for playing a game, such as a monitor, joysticks, and the like, and a cable modem 112 for establishing the connection to the AAN 130 .
- the access aggregation network ANN 130 generally is a wide area network WAN, and preferably a broadband access network BAN. However, local area networks LAN are also possible solutions for networks providing an on-line gaming service.
- FIG. 2 a schematic diagram is shown, illustrating the basic elements of the software architecture used in providing an on-line gaming environment.
- the main component is a gaming client G_client 210
- the PLE site there is a gaming server G_server 220
- an operations support systems engine G_OSS 230 is included in the CPE site.
- G_portal 240 is included in the PLE site.
- support services G_support 250 is included in the CPE site.
- the purpose of the gaming client G_client 210 is to provide the gaming console with services, such as establishing connectivity and registration.
- G_client 210 comprises a registration client, an authentication client, a console address management module, and a module for enabling connectivity and service to a gaming service provider GSP 121 on the PLE site 120 .
- G_client 210 supports established methods for data communication and transfer, such as Point-to-Point Protocol PPP, and other recognized data protocols.
- G_client 210 checks for connection qualification, and administers bundled instrumentation.
- FIG. 3 a a schematic diagram of the architecture of a GC 300 is shown.
- the gaming console comprises a restricted kernel 301 and a flat memory space 302 .
- the restricted kernel is in connection with the gaming consoles hardware 309 , as well as with the flat memory space 302 .
- the restricted kernel 301 is in connection with the access aggregation network 130 .
- the flat memory space typically comprises one single software application, namely a video game, or other gaming software.
- the client 303 is optionally integrated into the gaming software, and loaded together with the gaming software into the flat memory space 302 .
- This solution is illustrated in the schematic diagram shown in FIG. 3 b .
- changes in client modification require changes in the gaming software package.
- Another solution is to integrate the highly functional client 303 into the restricted kernel 301 .
- This solution is illustrated in the schematic diagram shown in FIG. 3 c .
- two competing application are run in the restricted kernel 301 , namely the gaming software and the highly functional client 303 . This most likely has a negative effect on the gaming performance of the GC.
- a third solution, especially useful in connection with a broadband access network, is to dedicate a small random access memory (RAM) to the highly functional client 303 , thus leveraging a high bandwidth connection to the gaming console, and using it to care and feed a highly functional client 303 .
- the highly functional client 303 is an ultra-thin client UTC.
- the component G_client 210 is referred to as G_UTC.
- the UTC constitutes a continuously resident, tiny core framework, in which client functionality is partitioned into small code segments, loaded and launched as required at run time.
- the code segments or packages are small, in general 50 KB or less, and with a broadband bandwidth of about 1 Mbps take a few hundred milliseconds to load.
- UTC there is no need to maintain state tables; UTC itself becomes a state onto itself, including possible launches from that state.
- UTC packages are thin, take little space away from the primary function of the GC, and do hardly interfere with the gaming software running on the GC.
- the gaming client G_Client 210 becomes very scalable and flexible, and is growing outside the GC without impacting the footprint occupied within the GC.
- client upgrades and updates are done automatically and in-service, value-added services are simple to include, and individual client services are easier to design and to implement.
- client code portability between different gaming platforms is highly simplified. This way, G_UTC is a prototypical example for a highly functional client 303 , and provides an adaptive platform for a consistent gaming environment.
- the purpose of the gaming server G_server 220 is to provide the connectivity and registration services for gaming consoles (GC), and to manage the registered devices.
- G_server 220 deals with console discovery, client registration, subscriber authentication, console address management, as well as Internet protocol (IP) connectivity management and proxy for gaming consoles (GC).
- IP Internet protocol
- G_server 220 also manages the different GC and different subscribers being part of the on-line gaming architecture G_linkA. Further, G_server 220 deals with connection qualification services for consoles, and with bundled instrumentation, and reports facilities for instrumentation, performance and management of G_client 210 .
- G_Server 220 Another purpose of G_Server 220 is to perform additional tasks, and to provide managing, monitoring, and debugging facilities for the gaming link architecture.
- G_Server 220 performs tasks of checking network connections, and of controlling accessibility of relevant hardware components, as well as software modules. Debugging is preferably performed by sending out well-defined test messages, and by running well-defined test applications.
- G_Server 220 performs the additional tasks in cooperation with other clients, as for example G_support 250 and G_OSS 230 .
- G_OSS 230 The purpose of the operation support systems engine G_OSS 230 is to provide an application program interface (API) to tie-in with the network service provider's software engines for subscriber authentication, notification, and billing functionalities.
- G_OSS 230 supports multi-protocol API, containing common utilities with plug-in adapters to facilitate connectivity to a majority of other operation support systems (OSS), the plug-in adaptation cartridges supporting Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), JAVATM and the like.
- G_OSS 230 adds, modifies, or deletes a GC or a subscriber to the on-line gaming service, and takes care of billing and service notification, among other related functionalities.
- the purpose of the gaming portal G_portal 240 is to provide a site for net-based gaming services. It also acts as a proxy site through which net-based game content providers offer content and services to the user of the gaming console GC.
- G_portal 240 provides an entry point into the on-line gaming network for game specific servers, for connection servers enabling group gaming, head-to-head services and find-a-friend scheduling, for bulletin boards and chat rooms, as well as for gaming sites and news proxy. Also, G_portal 240 provides the possibility to tie in the gaming link architecture to make services offered by other providers accessible to a user of the gaming console, such as for example services provided by the hospitality industry.
- G_portal 240 offers possibilities such as pay-per-play services, advertising, download services, and others. Although designed as an on-line gaming environment, G_portal 240 enables one to extend the uses of a plurality of gaming consoles (GC) interconnected through a broadband access network beyond gaming and entertainment.
- GC gaming consoles
- the system of support services G_support 250 fulfills functions such as running a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), Web servicing, platform and application management, subscriber management, license servicing, and the like.

- G_DHCP Web server
- G_Web dealing with GSP content, GSP data, and GSP instrumentation, as well as a registration server G_Reg.
- the protocol G_linkP is used to establish communication within the gaming architecture G_linkA, and is used in supporting the intermodule signaling and control communication and small batch data transfer.
- G_linkP further enables the use of ultra-thin clients (UTC) for gaming consoles (GC).
- the communication medium is an IP-based, packet protocol, running on top of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) including PPP use over Ethernet (PPPoE), utilizing XML for external interfaces, and supporting both connected clients via the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as well as connectionless clients via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
- PPP Point-to-Point Protocol
- PPPoE PPP use over Ethernet
- TCP Transmission Control Protocol
- UDP User Datagram Protocol
- G_linkP attempts to keep small messages, typically smaller than the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
- All protocol messages have a common base structure, consisting of header, payload, and tail.
- the header includes information regarding protocol version, message type, control flags, sequence counter, security field, identification of the originating module, identification of the destination module, gaming console class, gaming console vendor, gaming console model, payload size, payload type, and other relevant data characterizing the type and format of the message.
- the payload contains the main body of the message, comprising any or all of unstructured binary data, structured, formatted data, XML-text-based data, and other interpretable data.
- the tail comprises a sequence counter, a security field, and/or control flags.
- Typical message types of the gaming link protocol include a login-message GlP_hello, a response message GlP_Rsp, a request for registration GlP_RReq, an acknowledgment message GlP_ACK, as well as a non-acknowledgement message GlP_NAK, an information package GlP_info, a data package GlP_data, and a control package GlP_control.
- the main communication between the CLE site 110 and the PLE site 120 over the AAN 130 is handled by the client server G_client 210 and the support services G_support 250 . More specifically, when the highly functional client is an ultra-thin client, gaming services are controlled and administered by the modules G_UTC, G_DHCP, G_Web, and G_Reg in conjunction with G_Server 220 .
- a message sequence chart is shown for the boot process of the gaming console GC.
- Loading the UTC base step 4101 , initializes the sequence.
- client identification ID
- information regarding the make and the model of the GC, as well as the Internet Protocol (IP) address all are retrieved from the non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM).
- the DHCP discovery step 4102 information is passed to G_DHCP, such as the media access control (MAC) address, client ID, and IP address.
- the server G_DHCP performs a client look-up, step 4103 , comparing the provided information against information of clients that are already registered. When no match is found, an unregistered user is detected, and a registration procedure begins. When a match is found, a registered user is detected, and a download procedure begins.
- the boot process is completed in that the DHPC server offers information to G_UTC, step 4104 , the information including a temporary client ID, a temporary IP address, a temporary mask, a current server ID, as well as a next server IP address referring to G_Reg.
- G_UTC updates the information and sends an updated request to G_DHCP, step 4105 , which then is properly acknowledged, step 4106 .
- the client is now ready to authenticate and register, being granted temporary presence solely for registration and authentication purposes.
- the boot process is completed in that the DHPC server offers information to G_UTC, step 4104 , the information including temporary client ID, a temporary IP address, a temporary mask, a current server ID, as well as a next server IP address referring to G_Web.
- G_UTC updates the information and sends an updated request to G_DHCP, step 4105 , which then is properly acknowledged, step 4106 .
- the client is now ready for service; if the IP address and mask acknowledged by G_DHCP does not match the information stored in NVRAM, then NVRAM is updated.
- G_UTC message sequence chart
- the client G_UTC sends a login message GlP_hello to the registration server G_Reg, step 4201 , containing console information and information regarding the G_linkP protocol.
- G_Reg then performs a synchronization step 4202 . If an unsupported version of G_linkP is detected, the client G_UTC will be updated.
- G_Reg sends an acknowledgement to G_UTC, step 4203 , which is answered by a request for registration, step 4204 .
- G_OSS is used to authenticate decrypted parameters against a user account with the network service provider NSP.
- a registration process follows, step 4206 , in which a new client record is created in G_Server, and G_DHCP is updated.
- G_Reg After proper acknowledgment from G_DHCP, step 4207 , G_Reg in turn acknowledges the successful procedure to G_UTC, step 4208 .
- G_OSS indicates a new service added to the existing client record.
- G_UTC then sends a data response GlP_Rsp, step 4208 , optionally encrypted with GlP_hello message values, which is acknowledged with a new client ID, step 4210 .
- the registration procedure is now complete, and G_UTC loads the new client ID into NVRAM and resets.
- G_UTC message sequence chart
- a subscriber is connected to the gaming architecture via a gaming console (GC).
- G_UTC is running on the gaming console, and after successfully registering the GC, G_UTC offers a menu of selections to the subscriber. The subscriber's selection results in downloading a game to the GC.
- G_UTC is notified by the subscriber to load an external game or an external application. The file name of the application is preserved, while all previously loaded modules residing in flat memory space are destroyed.
- G_UTC is now prepared to activate a new game.
- an information package is transferred to G_Server, step 4302 , reporting on the currently active G_UTC element.
- G_Server sets the active state, step 4303 , in which the client record is updated for the currently active state, in which a proper history counter is selected, and in which it is acknowledged that an application is to be run.
- the client ID is transmitted back to G_UTC in an acknowledgement step 4304
- a download request is issued, step 4305 , and data are transmitted from G_Web to the gaming console, step 4306 .
- an application is launched, step 4307 , either as download from G_Web, or from a local medium connected to GC, such as a hard disc, compact disc, cartridge, or the like.
- G_UTC stays active but inert until the application is completed.
- G_UTC An information package is then transmitted form G_UTC to G_Server, step 4308 , informing the support server about the active UTC element for a given client ID.
- G_Server sets up for a restart of G_UTC, step 4309 .
- a request to reactivate G_UTC is sent.
- G_UTC is reset to the last active G_UTC module reloaded by the G_UTC base.
- control information is sent to G_UTC, step 4310 , offering the subscriber several new selections, incorporating the recent history of events taken place in G_linkA.
- a message sequence chart (MSC) is shown for running a saved game.
- G_UTC G_UTC module is already running, and a subscriber attempts to run a preserved binary file.
- G_UTC detects a run attempt from a given application, step 4401 .
- Information about client ID and application ID is sent to G_Server, step 4402 .
- An authentication lookup is performed, step 4303 , in which the client record is checked to determine a right-to-use for the particular application. If the check in unsuccessful, G_UTC will be notified in form of a no-right-to-use message. If the check is successful, the application is acknowledged, step 4304 .
- the application is launched on the gaming console, step 4305 , either as download from G_Web, or from a local medium connected to GC, such as CD or a disc.
- Gaming information is provided from G_UTC to G_Web, step 4406 , and after the application is completed, G_Web sets up for a restart of G_UTC, step 4407 , and sends corresponding control information including new selection menus and related information to G_UTC, step 4408 .
- step 4301 in which a subscriber is offered a menu of selections for downloading a game, is easily modified in that the selection of choices is set up according to preferences specified by the subscriber. This way, an authorization of gaming content is achieved, and a gaming request is filtered through G_UTC before execution.
- desired gaming scenarios are possibly selected, including preferences for meet-me gaming, challenge-me gaming, and the like.
- the possibility of personalizing a GC through the use of the UTC extends the mere entertaining character of a gaming experience, and adds a personal, socially interactive component to the on-line experience.
- peer-to-peer introductions are easily envisioned, and the group dynamical content added to the on-line gaming scenario promises a socially rewarding gaming experience.
- peer-to-peer introduction is not limited to on gaming service provider network, but is easily extended to incorporate the concept of inter-GSP gaming communication.
- the gaming request received from the gaming console is filtered according to certain predefined criteria.
- a personal profile of a subscriber to the on-line gaming services is created according to characteristics described by the subscriber.
- the personal profile is optionally saved on the provider located equipment side, and is identified through the client ID, the corresponding IP address, and the like.
- the described architecture is suitable for bit-cap exemptions. Due to the functionality of the highly efficient client, data streams dedicated to gaming data are optionally not bit-cap counted, thus providing a financially attractive gaming solution to the subscriber to an on-line gaming service.
- UTC is used to run other than gaming applications on the GC, and therefore allows one to extend the use and functionality of a GC beyond mere electronic entertainment.
