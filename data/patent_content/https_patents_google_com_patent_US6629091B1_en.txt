- Step S 11 -step S 14 show a process setting the information concerning to the first order link.
- step S 11 concerning each fundamental table which is managed in a relational data base, it is decided whether there is any table that has same name and same field in the other table by starting from each table itself.
- the process goes to step S 12 , and the original table name (itself table), the terminal table name (another table) and the link condition is settled.
- Step S 13 When there is not a field of the same name and attribute with the table itself, the control goes to Step S 13 , and define by setting an original table name (table itself), a forward table name (another table name) and a direct link impossible as the link condition.
- step S 14 it is decided whether the process concerning the first order link relation ends in all tables or not, and step S 11 ⁇ step S 13 are repeated up to end. After it, the process transfers to the N th order link relation (N ⁇ 2).
- step S 16 a record of which link condition in the intermediate link table is “direct link impossible” (entry of intermediate link tale) is searched successively and when the record of “direct link impossible” is found the process goes to step S 17 .
- the record of link condition of “direct link impossible” is not found at all, the creation of the link table is ended.
- step S 17 it is checked whether there are two records (original record) of link condition of “direct link impossible” of which the original table and the forward table are found.
- the link condition of the record of ⁇ original table name:TECT>-forward table name:RANKT> is “direct link impossible”, but by using the condition of two records of ⁇ original table name :TECT>- ⁇ forward table name :IPPANT> - ⁇ original table name :IPPANT>- ⁇ forward table name:RANKT>, the two records are linked.
- the process goes to step S 18 . Otherwise, the link formation is impossible and the process goes to step S 19 .
- step S 18 in a column of link table of the original record, an intermediate table name (IPPANT of the above mentioned example) is set, and a link condition abstracted from the two records are set in the link condition.
- IPPANT intermediate table name
- step S 19 it is decided at process of N th order link step whether all records of the intermediate link table is ended or not, and when there is a record which is not processed, returning to step S 16 the same process is repeated.
- step S 20 the process for all links is ended.
- record of which link condition is “direct link impossible” is left or new link condition may not be set it is decided for creation of all link process to be ended, and creation of intermediate link table is ended.
- step S 21 When there is a possibility of setting new link relation, at step S 21 one is add to N, and returning to S 16 , the same process of N th order link relation is repeated.
- step S 4 of FIG. 5 by using the intermediate table created by the above mentioned process link contents (link condition) between the tables is created to generate WHERE phrase.
- link contents link condition
