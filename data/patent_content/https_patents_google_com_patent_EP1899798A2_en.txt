Definitions
- This application relates to electronic content classification in computing systems.
- Certain documents are not suitable for use on mobile devices.
- Mobile devices are not necessarily equal to their desktop counterparts. Users of mobile devices who want to see what they consider to be good, mobile content are often provided with content that is not practical, or even displayable, on their devices, hi some instances, users may receive translated content provided by an intermediate source.
- the intermediate source may translate web content from an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) format to a WML (Wireless Markup Language) format and provide the translated content to a mobile device.
- the translated content may or may not be semantically equivalent to the original document, or the format may be still difficult to navigate on the mobile device.
- Simplistic analysis of such documents may take the form of categorization of pages or documents by whether the page contains HTML tags that expressly state that a particular type of device is an appropriate device to display the page. Such analysis may also look to page size, suffixes for files on the pages, document type declarations, or such other straightforward content in a web page.
- a doctype declaration is one in which an author of a web page is supposed to explicitly identify the type of markup language and standard.
- One implementation provides a method for classifying electronic content in a manner that relies at least in part on formats implied by document features, and is thus not dependent on the document's author having complied with particular conventions or rule.
- implicit features differ from explicit features, which are indication in a document whose primary purpose is to be an indication of the format of the document.
- explicit features include content type labels for a document, document type (doctype) tags, and the extensions for file names.
- a method for classifying electronic content is described.
- the method comprises obtaining an electronic document from a computing system, identifying one or more document features of the electronic document, analyzing the identified document features to determine a format of electronic content contained in the electronic document (the determined format being implied by one or more indicators provided by the identified document features), and specifying whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document may be displayed on an identified type of computing device, based on the determined format.
- the specifying may include analyzing content-based document features, and the identified document features may be analyze by a machine learning system.
- the method may determine whether to insert an indexed entry associated with the electronic document into a searchable index based upon a level of confidence that the electronic content contained in the electronic document is displayable on the predetermined type of computing device, and the indexed entry may indicate the determined format of the electronic document.
- the electronic content contained in the electronic document may comprise displayable web content.
- at least one document feature of the electronic document may comprise a tagged feature that may be interpreted for display of electronic content on a computing device.
- the document analysis may comprise applying a predetermined ruleset to the identified document features, and the predetermined ruleset may apply one or more decisions to a plurality of document features.
- the specification of whether the content may be displayed may comprise applying one or more heuristic rules to the determined format and the identified document features, and may also comprise calculating a confidence rating that is based on a determined level of confidence that the electronic content contained in the electronic document is displayable on the predetermined type of computing device.
- the method may further comprise creating an indexed entry associated with the electronic document, the indexed entry indicating whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document may be displayed on the identified type of computing device, and inserting the indexed entry into a searchable index, the indexed entry being ranked within the searchable index.
- the identified type of computing device may comprise a computing device that is capable of displaying electronic content having one or more predetermined formats, and may in some circumstances comprise a wireless device or a predetermined brand or model of computing device.
- the determined format may be selected from a group consisting of an XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) format, an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) format, a WML (Wireless Markup Language) format, and a cHTML (compact HTML) format.
- XHTML Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- WML Wireless Markup Language
- cHTML compact HTML
- the product includes instructions that, when executed, perform a method for classifying electronic content, where the method comprises obtaining an electronic document that is stored in a computing system, the electronic document having electronic content, parsing the electronic document and identifying one or more document features of the electronic document, analyzing the identified document features to determine a format of the electronic content contained in the electronic document (the determined format being based upon one or more indicators provided by the identified document features), and based upon the determined format and the identified document features, specifying whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document may be displayed on a predetermined type of computing device.
- a system for classifying electronic content may comprise means for receiving an electronic document, means for determining a format of electronic content contained in the electronic document, and means for specifying whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document may be displayed on a predetermined type of computing device based upon the determined format.
- a method for classifying electronic content is provided in yet another implementation.
- the method may comprise obtaining an electronic document from a computing system, identifying a document type for the document using an explicit document type identifier associated with the document, analyzing one or more document features and the identified document type to determine a format of electronic content contained in the electronic document, the determined format being implied by one or more indicators provided by the identified document features, and based upon the determined format, specifying whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document maybe displayed on an identified type of computing device.
- another method comprises obtaining from a computing system an electronic document having electronic content, identifying a plurality of document features of the electronic document, calculating a document score based on the plurality of document features, and specifying whether the electronic content contained in the electronic document may be displayed on an identified type of computing device, based on the document score.
- the document features may comprise implied document features, and may also comprise content-based document features.
- a content classification module may automatically classify electronic documents into different mobile-related categories. This helps categorize, for example, web pages as being suitable or unsuitable for display on mobile devices.
- the content classification module is capable of assessing whether content contained within an individual document may be enabled for display purposes on a mobile device, as well as determining the specific devices (or device types) for which the content is most suited.
- FIG. IA is a conceptual diagram showing components of a content classification system.
- FIG. IB is a block diagram of a system that may be used to classify electronic content, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 1C is a diagram that shows the processing of electronic content within the system shown in FIG. IB, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 2A is a flow diagram of a method for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 2B is a flow diagram of another method for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 2C is a flow diagram of another method for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 3 A is a tabular diagram of entries associated with electronic content that may be stored within the index shown in FIG. IB, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 3B is a tabular diagram of entries associated with electronic content that may be stored within an index.
- FIG. 4 is a screen diagram of a graphical user interface that may be provided to a user for searching electronic content within the system shown in FIG. IB, according to one implementation.
- a document that follows a standard and is technically displayable may not be usable on a particular device, and could be classified as lacking displayability as a result.
- a document may be coded in XHTML Mobile and may technically display on a corresponding device because it matches the standard. But it nonetheless might not be usable, for example, if it is excessively wide.
- a system 2 may be provided that classifies such a document as not displayable even though it technically meets the standard and can be shown on the device or class of device, though with poor results and low usability. Such a document is not displayable because it would not be useful to a user on the device.
- Implicit identifying features are features that are part of or related to the document that have some correlation to the file type, but which were not included to explicitly identify the type of document. They may include, for example, functional tags ( ⁇ wml> and ⁇ html> tags, e.g., which are for standards compliance rather than identification). Another example is the accesskey tag attribute, which can be used for key shortcuts and may indicate more utility on mobile devices that are devoid of a pointing device, such as a mouse. Other implicit features may include the number of certain elements in a document, the type of elements (e.g., images, text, or active content), and the links from a document to other documents.
- the document source 6 in this example is a text file containing a number of features, such as tags, according to a standard mark-up language. Some of the features may be unimportant to classification of the document, while others (features 6a, 6b, 6c) may be slightly relevant or very relevant. Thus, the document may be searched for the presence of particular relevant features. In addition, combinations of features or other patterns may also be identified.
- a document may be checked against a standard in yet another manner.
- a lexer/parser that may be capable of parsing to multiple standards or loosely with respect to a standard or standard, may parse and interpret a document to a particular standard.
- the document may be parsed iteratively, or in parallel, to each of multiple different standards until the parse is successful and the document can be interpreted in a particular format.
- the document may then be considered of the type or types in which it can be interpreted.
- other features may be considered to further determine a classification for the document, such as by generating a composite score for the document.
- a web server may be configured to deliver a particular document in different manners.
- the system 2 may obtain the document in each form, and the various forms may be compared to derive information about the displayability of each. For example, where a document is stored in one form having a number of "rich" content features such as Flash animations and the like, and another form that is identical or substantially identical except for the additional rich content, the system may infer that the latter form was intended by the author for display on devices having limited display capabilities.
- a pattern may be used by a content classifier to match document features against known data-type definitions for a given document type.
- One exemplary pattern may specify common mobile tags (e.g., href:tel "click to call” tags), and another exemplary pattern may specify certain Japanese encodings and characters.
- the rules can be generated via a machine learning algorithm. In such an approach, initial rules may be supplied. Apre-labeled corpus of documents may be provided by manually classifying a number of documents. The algorithm may result in the creation of a new set of rules for classification that would, for example, provide a small or the smallest error in determining classifications of the documents in the initial corpus of documents.
- Changes may then be made to the classification system (e.g., by changing the classification rules), and the changed system may be applied to these documents.
- the results of such an application may be compared to standard results believed to provide appropriate classification, so that the appropriateness of the changes made to the system may be determined.
- Whether the documents were truly displayable or not may then be tested, such as by providing them to a particular device or a machine programmed to emulate a particular device, and then determining whether the document displayed satisfactorily. Such a determination could be made automatically or manually, such as by having a user indicate whether the display was or was not adequate.
- Successful display can result in the system reconfirming the rules used to classify the document, including for example, by weighting those rules more heavily for future classifications. Unsuccessful display can result in demotion of the relevant rules in importance for future classification.
- the servers 60 in the system 100 each may contain a wide assortment of electronic content.
- one of the servers may store electronic news content, while another one of the servers may store electronic stock or game content.
- the servers 60 may also store electronic content in a variety of different content formats.
- the servers 60 may store electronic content in electronic documents that are written in XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), WML (Wireless Markup Language), cHTML (compact HTML), or in a language that uses another format.
- Computing devices such as the mobile device 62 or the client computer 64, may process these electronic documents to display the corresponding electronic content on a display device.
- the content classifier 82 determines that an indexed entry associated with the electronic document should be inserted in the index 72 if a predetermined condition is satisfied. For example, the content classifier 82 may determine that an entry should be inserted if the content of the electronic document can be displayed on a mobile device, such as the mobile device 62, if the index 72 contains entries corresponding to mobile content in general. Examples of entries that can be inserted into the index 72 are shown in FIG. 3 A and 3B.
- the content classifier 82 may further determine if the crawler 76 should continue to follow any address links that are contained within an individual electronic document. For example, if the electronic document is written in XHTML, it may contain tags that provide addresses, or embedded URL's, for other electronic documents that are stored on the servers 60. If the content classifier 82 is classifying mobile content, it may determine that the crawler 76 should continue to crawl and follow any address links contained in an electronic document if the content classifier 82 has determined that the electronic document contains mobile content that can be displayed on a mobile device (such as the mobile device 62). In this case, the links in the document may point to additional documents having mobile content.
- the content classifier 82 determines that the electronic document does not contain mobile content, it may indicate that the crawler 76 should not follow the address links. In another implementation, the content classifier 82 is not used during the crawl, and is instead used after the crawl is completed to determine the documents that should be added to index 72.
- the content classifier 82 may decide not to insert an entry for an electronic document into the index 72, but still request that the crawler 76 follow the links pointing to other electronic documents stored on the servers 60. For example, the content classifier 82 may determine, with a confidence level of 60%, that the electronic document is an XHTML document having mobile content. In this example, the content classifier 82 may decide that an entry for this document should not be included within the index 72 because the confidence level is below a first preconfigured threshold (e.g., 75%). The content classifier 82 may only want to insert entries into the index 72 if it is at least 75% certain that the corresponding documents contain mobile content that can be displayed on a mobile device.
- a first preconfigured threshold e.g., 75%).
- the content classifier 82 may only want to insert entries into the index 72 if it is at least 75% certain that the corresponding documents contain mobile content that can be displayed on a mobile device.
- the content classifier 82 may decide that the crawler 76 should follow any links contained in the document if the confidence level is above a second preconfigured threshold (e.g., 50%).
- the first preconfigured threshold and the second preconfigured threshold may have different values.
- the content classifier may also be implemented as a modular subsystem.
- a central content classifier 82 is provided and includes the necessary functionality for identifying, interacting with, and parsing documents.
- Individual classification modules 80a, 80b, 80c, and 80d may also be provided as plug-ins to the content classifier 82.
- Each module may provide particular rules, such as heuristic rules, for a particular type of document content.
- module 80a may contain rules that operate on a number of document features that are separately identified by content classifier 82, and may generate a displayability parameter for a document based on those features.
- module 80b may contain rules that look to particular structural features of a document, such as boilerplate and tables, and may generate a parameter about the displayability of the document. The parameters may then be passed to the content classifier 82 in a predetermined format so that the document may be passed or not passed to a particular device.
- Content classifier 82 maybe implemented to have a standard application programming interface (API) which programmers may follow in creating additional classification modules.
- API application programming interface
- Modules for the system in the form of plug-ins may perform a variety of tasks. For example, a plug-in could extract document features, while another may analyze the extracted features to determine if the document is in a particular format (e.g., one plug-in for WML, and another for XHTML).
- a separate module may be provided for each device or class of devices, to determine the displayability for the device.
- Each plug-in may also have a separate API. For example, to add a new feature, a developer may add a FeaturePlugin, when they want to recognize a new standard, they may implement a FormatPlugin, and when they want to determine the usability for a new device, they may implement a DevicePlugin.
- the information generated by identifying and processing various document features may be stored in any appropriate format.
- an extensible structured format such as XML may be used.
- the mobile device 62 and the client computer 64 may send search requests to the data processing system 50. These search requests are processed by the request processor 66.
- the requests may include one or more keywords. For example, if a user of the mobile device 62 wants to search for web pages relating to dogs, the user may submit a search request that includes the keyword "dog". Requests other than search queries may also be received, and various modes of providing requests maybe employed. For example, voice input and other appropriate forms of input may be handled.
- the mobile device 62 and the client computer 64 may also provide additional information to the data processing system 50, such as device identification information or display capability information. This additional information may be used by the data processing system 50 when processing search requests sent by the mobile device 62 or the client computer 64.
- the mobile device 62 may provide additional information to the data processing system 50 specifying that the mobile device 62 is a "Brand X Model 1" with browser Z device that is capable of displaying electronic content contained in XHTML or WML documents. This information may be provided to the data processing system 50 when the mobile device 62 first connects to the data processing system 50 through the network 58.
- the request processor 66 processes incoming search requests and provides them to the search engine 70.
- the search engine 70 then accesses the index 72 to search for matching entries.
- the search engine 70 uses information contained in the search requests (such as search terms) to locate matching entries.
- the search engine 70 may also use any additional information that has been provided by the request initiators when locating matching entries. For example, if the mobile device 62 has provided additional information specifying that it is a mobile device capable of displaying electronic content contained in XHTML or WML documents, then the search engine 70 can filter out entries in the index 72 that are associated with document content having different formats.
- the search engine 70 may further rank retrieved entries, or search results, according to criteria specified in search requests, by the additional information provided by the request initiators, or by confidence level, for example.
- the search engine 70 provides the search results to the response processor 68.
- the response processor 68 formats the results and creates response messages that are sent back to the request initiators (such as the mobile device 62 or the client computer 64).
- the request initiators may then analyze or display the search results to a user.
- the user may select one or more of these results to retrieve the corresponding electronic documents from the servers 60 and display their electronic content to the user.
- FIG. 1C is a diagram that shows the processing of electronic content within the system 100 shown in FIG. IB, according to one implementation.
- the system 100 includes four servers 6OA, 6OB, 6OC, and 6OD. Each of these servers 60A-D store various electronic documents having electronic content.
- the crawler 76 is capable of downloading one or more of these electronic documents across the network 58.
- the content classifier 82 is then able to classify the content contained within these electronic documents.
- Each of the servers 60A-D store electronic documents having content of various formats.
- the server 6OA stores HTML documents, such as the documents 102A-C.
- the server 6OB stores XHTML documents, such as the documents 104A-C.
- the server 6OC stores WML documents, such as the documents 106A-C.
- the server 6OD stores cHTML documents, such as the documents 108 A-C.
- any of the given servers 60A-D is capable of storing electronic content of multiple different formats.
- the server 6OB may store both XHTML and WML documents.
- Each of the documents 102A-C, 104A-C, 106 A-C, and 108 A-C includes one or more document features.
- the HTML document For example, the HTML document
- HTML tags may contain various different document features for different HTML tags that are included within the document. These features are used to determine how to display electronic content contained within the document, according to one implementation. Certain document features may include address link information. For example, certain HTML tags may provide information about URL (uniform resource locator) links to other documents stored on separate servers. The crawler 76 may follow these links when searching for content stored in multiple different documents.
- URL uniform resource locator
- FIG. 2A is a flow diagram of a method 200 for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- the flow diagram of FIG. 2 A may employ the system shown in FIG. 1C, as now described.
- the uses of the system shown in FIG. 1C is merely illustrative, however, and any appropriate system may be used.
- the method 200 includes acts 202, 204, 206, and 208.
- the crawler 76 obtains an electronic document from a computing system, such as one of the servers 60A-D.
- the crawler 76 provides the document to the content classifier 82.
- the content classifier 82 parses the electronic document and identifies one or more of the document features contained within the document.
- the content classifier 82 uses a parser framework to achieve multiple potential parses with a single iteration over the document.
- the parser is capable of identifying document features of various different formats, such as XHTML, HTML, cHTML, or WML, in a single pass.
- the identified features may include specific document tags, such as HTML-type tags.
- a generic parser framework may be used that manages separate parsers that are capable of parsing documents of specific formats.
- the generic parser framework may make an estimation of the format of an electronic document.
- the framework may use content types, file extensions, and file names to make estimations.
- the framework may identify a number of different, individual parsers (e.g., a WML parser and a XHTML parser) that may potentially be used to parse a document.
- the framework may determine that a given electronic document is either an XHTML or a WML document.
- the framework may estimate that the document is more likely to be an XHTML document. In this case, the framework may invoke an XHTML parser. If the XHTML parser is not capable of adequately parsing the document, or if it believes that another parser would be more successful, it can notify the framework. At this point, the framework may invoke the WML parser. In this fashion, the framework is capable of invoking parsers in some predetermined order.
- the content classifier 82 analyzes the identified document features of a given electronic document to determine a format (e.g., XHTML, HTML, WML, cHTML, with perhaps even a standard version such as WML 1.2) of the electronic content contained in the document.
- a format e.g., XHTML, HTML, WML, cHTML, with perhaps even a standard version such as WML 1.2
- the content may also be analyzed by many other methods. For example, machine learning may be used to analyze a plurality of documents, so that decisions made with respect to certain documents may improve decisions for later documents. Also, heuristic rales for document classification may also be developed through the analysis of multiple documents, as discussed in more detail above.
- the content classifier 82 specifies whether the electronic content contained in a given document may be displayed on a predetermined type of computing device (such as a mobile device in general, and/or a specific brand or model of device).
- the content classifier 82 may use one or more heuristic rules applied to extracted features to attempt to determine whether the content of the document may be displayed on the predetermined type of computing device.
- Some sample heuristics may include using document size, number and size of images included within a document, number of tables in the document and table properties, and use of legal/illegal tags.
- the content classifier 82 may use these heuristic rules to determine if the document includes mobile content, according to one implementation. These rules may specify, for example, that the repeated existence of specified tags within the document indicate, with a higher degree of confidence, that the document contains mobile content that can be displayed on a mobile device in general (or that can be displayed on specific brands/models of devices as well, according to some implementations).
- the content classifier 82 may track the number of features within the document (e.g., links, images, tables, tag types, etc.) and use the heuristic rules to make a determination as to type of devices that may display the document content.
- the content classifier may look to use or non-use of stylesheets, or to use or non-use of Flash, applets, and scripting.
- the content classifier 82 calculates a confidence rating when making a determination of the types of computing devices (e.g., mobile devices) on which electronic content may be displayed. For example, the content classifier 82 may use patterns and/or heuristics rules to determine that, with an 80% confidence, a given document contains mobile content (such as WML content) that may be displayed on a mobile device. The content classifier 82 may then assign a confidence rating of 0.8 to an entry associated with this document (wherein the entry may also be stored within the index 72 shown in FIG. IB).
- the confidence rating may also relate to specific brands/models of mobile devices.
- the content classifier 82 may determine that, with an 80% confidence, a given document contains content that may be displayed on a "Brand X Model 1" type of mobile device, perhaps with the browser version included.
- FIG. 2B is a flow diagram 212 of another method for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- various documents are identified, such as by the techniques described above, and the displayability of the documents are inferred by analyzing a number of document features.
- an electronic document having electronic content is obtained, and at act 216, a plurality of features for the document are identified.
- the features may include features such as the document type, document size, types of objects in the document (images, tables, boilerplate, etc.), whether the document is a variant of a particular format (e.g., EZWEB XHTML), and other features discussed above.
- the classification rules are updated and the document is displayed if such display is plausible.
- the displayability of one or more documents is determined for one or more devices or types of devices. Such a determination may include, for example, an initial determination of the document type based on various features of the document, as discussed in more detail above. It may then include a determination of displayability that considers the determined document type along with other factors.
- a database may be updated in a manner relating to the document, as shown in act 222 (e.g., so that the displayability may be readily determine if a request for the document is received from a particular device or type of device).
- the rules for determining displayability may also be updated (act 224), such as by machine learning techniques described above.
- a request for a document may be received, as at act 226. If the document has already been located and processed, its ability to be displayed on the requesting device may be determined by checking the database. If the document has not yet been processed, it may be processed as just described to provide a determination of displayability, such as a compound score. If the document is displayable, as determined at act 228, it may be displayed (such as by transmitting the document or a link relating to the document) to a remote device. If the document is not displayable in its native form, the system may determine whether the document may be altered in some way and still achieve adequate displayability, as shown at act 232. For example, particular features that prevent displayability may be removed from the document before it is transmitted.
- the document is displayed (act 234) and if it is not, its display is blocked (act 236).
- a link to the document could be blocked or could be transmitted but in a manner that is displayed on a remote device to indicate its inability to be displayed (e.g., in a special contrasting color).
- a system may be enabled to locate particular features such as tags, by which an author may indicate a desire that the document be displayed only in unaltered form.
- FIG. 2C is a flow diagram 240 of another method for classifying electronic content, according to one implementation.
- classification of an analyzed document involves both explicit and implicit classification, and also allows follow-up changes to be made to the classification of a document.
- an electronic document is obtained, such as by the features discussed above.
- the system checks the document to determine whether it contains any explicit identifiers.
- the document may contain an HTML or other mark-up tag, such as a WML content type header and a WML doctype declaration. If the document has an explicit identifier, the process may move forward, as there is no need to infer the document type. Of course, inference of the document type may also be employed as a check on any explicit document identifier.
- the process at act 246 parses the document features. Of course, the parsing may have occurred as part of the process of determining whether there was an explicit identifier also.
- one or more rule sets may be applied to one or more of the features, as in act 248.
- the document may first be checked to determine the document format, and then to determine the document's displayability on a device or class of devices. For a determination of displayability, for example, the system may look at the document as having a XHTML Basic profile, with no tables or images, a small page size, and the presence of accesskey numeric shortcuts (i.e., that permit simpler operation using the limited keypad of a mobile telephones).
- the displayability of the document may be determined, and the database updated regarding the document's ability to be displayed on particular devices or classes of devices (act 250). Particular features of the document may also be recorded so that the displayability of the device may be determined easily when a device on which the document is to be displayed has been identified.
- a system may enable the classification of documents even for devices that have not yet been developed. At some later time, including after many documents have been classified, a document request may be received, at act 252.
- a document may be classified after the request is received, for example in a realtime classification system or where the particular document simply has not previously been located by the system.
- the system uses information it has received from the request to determine the device on which the request was made, and checks the relevant information for the document to determine if the document is displayable, whether in raw form or in a modified form. If the document is displayable, it is displayed. If it is not displayable, the system may send a message indicating that the document is not displayable or may simply decline to deliver the document or an indicator about the document — effectively blocking display of the document. For example, where a user presents a search request, the displayability of each search result may be checked.
- a document is not displayable, its existence may not be shown to the user at all.
- information about the document e.g., title, snippet, and URL
- the user will be informed that the device may not display the document accurately, but may nonetheless choose to retrieve the document if it looks very relevant. The user may then get to see the document displayed as well as it can be displayed.
- the system may also provide a way for the user to view a modified version of the document that is deliberately altered in order to make it displayable on that device.
- the system may also receive feedback about the document at act 256.
- the feedback may be used to reclassify the displayability of the document. For example, the user may be presented with an icon to identify whether the document displayed properly, and the user's choice may be aggregated with choices of other users regarding a document to reach an inference about the document's displayability.
- the displayability may be inferred also, such as by monitoring the amount of time between the display of the document and a user's moving out of the document. If the many user spend very little time in the document, it can be inferred that the document did not display properly or is not very useful. In either event, the document may be demoted in importance because it has not proven to be useful to users.

- the search engine 70 may have access to information about the specific device (such as the mobile device 62) that has made the request.
- the search engine 70 may obtain search results based only upon the information provided in columns 305 and/or 306.
- the search engine 70 may choose to use the information contained in the column 308 to identify only those matching entries (search results) that are pertinent to the specific device that has initiated the request.
- the mobile device 62 may be a "Model 1" device for "Brand X”. If the search engine 70 has access to this information, it may choose to use the information contained in the column 308 to identify those entries for documents having mobile content compatible with devices for "Model 1" of "Brand X", and perhaps the browser and its particular version.
- the column 310 includes a confidence rating.
- the confidence ratting may be a number between "0.0" (meaning 0% confidence) and "1.0" (meaning 100% confidence).
- the content classifier 82 specifies a confidence with which it is able to determine the content format of a given document (indicated in the column 305) and/or if the document contains mobile content in general (indicated in the column 306).
- the content classifier 82 is able to calculate a confidence rating upon completing its classification of a given document.

- the data processing system 50 may further search for advertisement entries that correspond to advertisements from registered sponsors.
- the data processing system 50 searches for entries associated with advertisements having mobile content, or even specific WML content, according to some implementations. Matching entries are then provided to the user and displayed to the user within a section 422 of the window 400. As shown in the example of FIG. 4, two entries 430 and 432 are displayed to the user within the section 422.
- the data processing system 50 may filter the results displayed in the sections 420 and 422 of the window 400 based upon the specific type of device that the user is using. For example, the data processing system 50 may be informed, or may be able to determine, that the user is using a "Brand X Model 1" type of mobile device. In this case, the search engine 70 may search for those entries in the index 72 associated with mobile content that can be displayed on this particular type of device. In one implementation, the search engine 70 may use a configuration parameter to determine whether to specifically filter search results based on the type of mobile device, or whether to more generally filter search results based only on the type of content (e.g., mobile WML content, mobile XHTML Basic content, etc.).
- the type of content e.g., mobile WML content, mobile XHTML Basic content, etc.
- the results 424, 426, 428, and 430, or the results 430 and 432 may be ranked (e.g., top-down ranking) according to the confidence ratings associated with the result entries.
- the column 310 shown in FIG. 3B includes examples of confidence ratings that may be associated with entries stored in the index 72.
- the search engine 70 If, for example, the search engine 70 is more confident that search results 424 and 426 include mobile (or WML) content than the results 428 and 430, it may specify that the results 424 and 426 should be ranked higher within section 420 than the results 428 and 430.
