Comment is associated with document
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of the example process for comment is associated with document.In one embodiment, the process of Fig. 4 can be carried out by the one or more assemblies in the combination of server 220, client 210 or server 220 and client 210.In another embodiment, this process can be by being independent of or comprising that the one or more assemblies in another equipment or the equipment group of server 220 and/or client 210 carry out.
The comment (piece 410) that the process of Fig. 4 can comprise multiple links from identification.There are the many methods that can identify comment.For example, server 220 can be identified as comment group by the document that comprises link (or part of document) group.In one embodiment, server 220 can be identified the blog or the webpage (or website) that typically comprise about the notes and commentary of other document.In this case, server 220 can from known typical comprise notes and commentary sets of documentation operation.For example, operator can compile the list of websites that comprises these documents.As an alternative, server 220 can use following technology: be that common signal is identified the document that comprises notes and commentary automatically by the document of for example searching comprising notes and commentary.As an alternative, server 220 can be comment by any document recognition that comprises link.Under any circumstance, server 220 can be identified as comment by particular document (or part of document).In one embodiment, server 220 can resolve to identify the comment that document package contains (for example, each paragraph can corresponding to discrete comment) to document.Server 220 can analyze to identify the link that comment comprises to comment.Can abandon those comments that do not comprise link or only comprise single link from all the other processes of Fig. 4.
Can select one (piece 420) in the link in comment.Target at this piece is, selects to comprise linking of being associated about its document of notes and commentary with commenting on.As above-described, comment can comprise multiple links.Comment can not comprise about comprise with comment link in each the notes and commentary of each document being associated.Therefore, server 220 can select with comment on can comprise about its document of notes and commentary corresponding link in one.In one embodiment, server 220 can use one or more because usually selecting in link.
For example, with link in each click-through rate being associated can be included in electing the factor of in linking in comment.(impression) number that flashes that selection (for example, the clicking) number that the click-through rate of link can be defined as receiving receives divided by link, or more simply, can be defined as the selection number that link is obtained.Some not homologies that server 220 can be followed the tracks of User Activity from can the anonymous user of tracking movable or the explicit permission with user are obtained the information about click-through rate.For example, server 220 can be from the polymerizer of can polymerization web feeding (for example, Google's reader), from can follow the tracks of user browser activity browser auxiliary tools hurdle (for example, Google's toolbar), for example, from can generating Traffic Monitor about the statistics of the visitor to website (, Google analyzes) or obtaining click-through rate from another source.In one embodiment, server 220 can be used about the information of click-through rate and select in link.In the time that user selects the link in comment, this user may select the link of the document that points to the theme that is comment.The click-through rate linking by use is selected in link, and server 220 can select to guide to the linking of document having with the content of the content optimum matching of comment.
As an alternative or extraly, specify user feedback and can be included in electing the factor of in the link in comment.When together with representing to user of particular document represented to when comment, can give user the clearly chance of feedback to this comment is provided.For example, user can be meaningful (for example, affirmative vote) or nonsensical (for example, negative vote) for user by selecting suitable ballot button to indicate comment (about particular document).Such feedback can be in the link of selecting to comment on.If the particular document that user represents about comment therewith via suitable ballot indication comment is significant (or nonsensical), this can provide the evidence of commenting on the content that comprises relevant to the content of particular document (or irrelevant).By select in link with clear and definite user feedback, server 220 can select to guide to the linking of document having with the content of the content optimum matching of comment.
As an alternative or extraly, for example, can be included in electing the factor of in the link in comment with each address being associated (, the URL) length in linking.Author is included in the link of the homepage of sensing company or website in comment conventionally.Notes and commentary in the comment that comprises the link of pointing to homepage are not for this homepage conventionally.Homepage typically comprises " short " address (for example, comprising unlike the many a lot of addresses of a domain name).Have that the document of location can be more useful compared with the document of short address than having more longways, and may be more the theme identical with the theme of comment than having compared with the document of short address.Whether in one embodiment, can affect this with the length that links the address being associated links selected.Select in link by using about the information of length of the address of link, server 220 can be selected to guide to be had and the linking of the document of the content of the content optimum matching of comment.
As an alternative or extraly, for example, can be included in electing the factor of in the link in comment about the statistics (, the popularity of document is measured, such as the score value based on link of document) of link document pointed.Some welcome documents (for example, www.Google.com) are linked by many comments.This has reduced the actual possibility comprising about the notes and commentary of these welcome documents of specific comment.Welcome document can be identified as having the document of measuring (for example, the score value based on link) higher than the popularity of popularity threshold value.Therefore, in one embodiment, can affect this with the popularity measurement that links the document being associated and whether selectedly link.Unwelcome document can be more useful than welcome document, and may be more the theme identical with the theme of comment than welcome document.By using the information of measuring about the popularity of link document pointed to select in link, server 220 can be selected to guide to be had and the linking of the document of the content of the content optimum matching of comment.
The subject information that as an alternative or extraly, can comprise the comparison of the theme of document that link in comment is pointed and the theme of comment can be included in electing the factor of in linking in comment.Can obtain subject information by following technology: the word analysis in document is determined the theme that is associated with document, the word analysis in comment is determined the theme being associated with comment and theme is compared to determine whether to exist coupling.As an alternative, can obtain subject information by another kind of technology.Therefore, in one embodiment, whether subject information can affect link selected.By using in selecting to link about the link theme of document pointed and the information of the comparison of the theme of comment, server 220 can be selected to guide to be had and the linking of the document of the content of the content optimum matching of commenting on.
Therefore, being included in the function that link in comment can be used as one or more factors selects.These one or more factors can be included in any factor in above-identified factor, no matter are still used in conjunction with one or more other factorses separately.This function can be represented as: F (f1, f2 ..., fN) (wherein N >=1).The example of the function of the multiple factors in the factor of considering to identify in the above can be represented as: F (click-through rate, user feedback, address size, document popularity, subject information).The example of the function of independent in the factor of considering to identify in the above can be represented as: F (click-through rate).Under any circumstance, function can be for generating the score value of link.Can select link (for example, can select to have for comment the link of highest score) by the score value based on link.
Threshold value can be for helping to link selection.For example, if highest score exceedes threshold value, server 220 can select to have the link of highest score.If highest score does not exceed threshold value, server 220 can not selected the link in comment.
As an alternative or extraly, can use by different way threshold value, whether process comment such as being used to indicate actually.For example, only have the score value of at least subset (or all-links) of link to exceed threshold value, server 220 can just be processed comment (for example, selecting link).
Can be likely, the multiple links in comment have similar score value (for example, the score value in a certain quantity or number percent each other).Therefore, can be useful, in the time that the score value of the highest scoring link is enough different from the score value of next the highest scoring link, select the highest scoring link.In one embodiment, confirmable, between the score value of the highest scoring link and the score value of next the highest scoring link, whether there is at least specified difference distance.For example, if there is at least specified difference distance between highest score and next highest score, server 220 can select to have the link of highest score.If there is not at least specified difference distance between highest score and next highest score, server 220 can not selected the link of comment.
Can be by comment and the selected document pointed be associated (piece 430) that links.For example, server 220 can be stored in storer with document explicitly by comment or for example, about the information (, the address of comment) of comment.In a simple embodiment, can in storer, create (or renewal) identification document and both entries of comment.
Can select in the link in comment although described server 220, needn't be like this.In another embodiment, server 220 can be selected more than one in link, and (comprising these links) comment can be associated with each in a corresponding document pointed in selected link.Two or more obtaining compared with high score in this link in comment, and may these score values to be enough different from the situation of score value (as mentioned above) of next the highest scoring link can be useful.
Can be the process that many comments repeat Fig. 4, and the process that can periodically repeat Fig. 4 for the comment of previously having processed be to upgrade score value and the selection to link possibly.As the result of the process of Fig. 4, can be created in the many associations between comment and document.These associations can be stored in storer as entry.For example, for any one particular document, entry can be identified the one or more comments that have been associated with this particular document.The comment being associated with document can comprise the comment of manually inputting together with document.For example, can represent and allow user that the graphic user interface about the comment of the document is provided to user together with document.The comment of these artificial inputs can stand the process of Fig. 4.
Fig. 5 is the figure with the example of the comment of the link of pointing to multiple documents.As shown in Figure 5, comment (being marked as comment 123) can comprise multiple links (being marked as link 1, link 2 and link 3).Suppose link 1 sensing document A, document B are pointed in link 2 and document C is pointed in link 3.It can be each the generation score value in link.As shown in Figure 5, the score value of link 1 is 0.3, and the score value of link 2 is 0.8, and the score value of link 3 is 0.2.Therefore,, in described link, the score value of link 2 is highest score.Therefore, can select link 2 for comment 123.As shown in Figure 5, comment 123 can be associated with document B, and can be by this association store in storer.The information in storer of being stored in can comprise identification document B and/or comment 123 information (for example, identifier, such as document B and/or comment 123 residing addresses), maybe can comprise document B and/or comment 123 content partly or entirely.
Select comment to represent together with document
Fig. 6 is for select the process flow diagram of comment collection with the example process that represents together with document.In one embodiment, the process of Fig. 6 can be carried out by the one or more assemblies in the combination of server 220, client 210 or server 220 and client 210.In another embodiment, this process can be by being independent of or comprising that the one or more assemblies in another equipment or the equipment group of server 220 and/or client 210 carry out.
The comment (piece 610) that the process of Fig. 6 can be associated with particular document with identification starts.As mentioned above, the process of Fig. 4 can cause the establishment to the many associations between comment and document.These associations can be stored in storer as entry.In one embodiment, the particular document of server 220 in can recognition memory, and the comment that is associated with this particular document of identification.
Can select to treat the comment collection (piece 620) representing together with particular document.Comment collection can comprise one or more comments.Target at this piece is to select best comment to represent together with particular document.In one embodiment, server 220 can generate score value for each in comment, and score value based on generated is selected one or more in comment.For the score value that comment generates can be based on one or more factors.
In one embodiment, the score value based on linking being associated with comment can be used as the factor of comment generation score value.The link number that the score value based on link of comment can be commented on based on sensing (or referring to certainly).Comment can have the score value based on link (for example, having the technology that is used to comment to generate the score value based on link) of himself.As an alternative, the score value based on link that can comment on is set to equal to comment on the score value based on link of the document being positioned at.For example, document can comprise multiple comments, and the score value based on link of each comment can be set to equal to comment on the score value based on link of the document being positioned at.The score value based on link of comment can be the evidence of the quality of comment.Therefore, the score value based on link of commenting on by use is to marking, and server 220 can guarantee to represent together with particular document the comment of better quality.
As an alternative or extraly, specify user feedback and can be used as comment and generate the factor of score value.When representing when comment together with document to user, can give user and provide the clearly chance of feedback for this comment.For example, user can to indicate comment (about particular document) be meaningful (for example, affirmative vote) or nonsensical (for example, negative vote) for user.Such clear and definite user feedback can be used to comment to generate score value.For example, can be to agreeing with poll and negative vote counting number, and in the time generating score value for comment used as factor.If the particular document that user represents about comment therewith via suitable ballot indication comment is significant (or nonsensical), this can provide the evidence of commenting on the content that comprises relevant to the content of particular document (or irrelevant).By coming with clear and definite user feedback for comment generates score value, server 220 can be guaranteed to represent together with particular document the comment having with the content of the content optimum matching of particular document.
As an alternative or extraly, the language using in comment can be used as comment and generate the factor of score value.Can use different speech signals, such as comment text be whether in English (or language of user), whether use appropriate grammer, whether use formal word (with respect to slang), whether use appropriate capitalization (with respect to all capitalizations) etc.One or more can being used in these signals commented on generation score value.For example, the comment of the comment of the comment of not comment in English, improper use grammer, slanguage and/or improper use capitalization may be nonsensical for user.By the language that uses in comment is analyzed, and by the result of this analysis to marking, server 220 can improve user's experience by representing significant comment together with particular document.
As an alternative or extraly, review source from document and/or the author of comment can be used as comment and generate the factor of score value.Can there is the system for the author of the document that comprises comment and/or comment being carried out to rank.The author of the document that comprises comment and/or comment is carried out to rank can be used to comment to generate score value.Can more known documents and/or author produce high quality reviews.Can correspondingly carry out rank to these documents and/or author.By using author's the rank of document to comprising comment and/or comment to marking, server 220 can provide better quality comment together with particular document.
As an alternative or extraly, implicit user feedback can be used as comment and generate the factor of score value.For example, some signal can reflect user's the interest or indifferent to comment.These signals can comprise about user keep information, the user of the time quantum opened of comment whether to ask whole comment or asked document that access comprises comment, the information of time quantum that the document of accessing comment or comprising comment about user spends etc.One or more can being used in these signals commented on generation score value.If the particular document that user represents about comment therewith via its behavior indication comment is significant (or nonsensical) to them, this can provide the evidence of commenting on the content that comprises relevant to the content of particular document (or irrelevant).By coming by implicit user feedback for comment generates score value, server 220 can be guaranteed to represent together with particular document the comment having with the content of the content optimum matching of particular document.
As an alternative or extraly, age information can be used as comment and generate the factor of score value.For example, age information can comprise the information at the age (for example,, about working as the day before yesterday and/or time) about comment.Age information can for identification comment can be considered to outmoded still recently.Outmoded comment can be defined as the comment of (for example, more of a specified duration than month) more for a long time of bit timing area of a room threshold value.Age information can be used to comment to generate score value.In one embodiment, can give the higher score value of comment more recently of comment more recently.Outmoded comment may not provide useful information to user.Therefore,, by using the information at age about comment to marking, server 220 can improve user's experience by representing significant comment together with particular document.
As above-described, server 220 can based in the above identification factor in one or more come be comment generate score value.In another embodiment, other factor can separately or be combined in one or more use the in above-identified factor.
