Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to, among other things, ranking of search results.
- Internet search engines typically operate by storing information about many web pages, which they retrieve from the World Wide Web (WWW) using a Web crawler that follows hyperlinks on pages it encounters. The contents of each page are typically analyzed to determine how the page should be indexed (for example, words are extracted from the titles, headings, or special fields called meta tags). Data about web pages are stored in an index database for use in later queries.
- WWW World Wide Web
- the search engine examines its index and provides a listing of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the document's title and sometimes parts of the text. The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others.
- Some search engines employ techniques to rank the results to provide the “best” results first.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method for providing input to a document ranking process for ranking a plurality of documents, the document ranking process taking as input a quality of result statistic for an individual document in the plurality of documents, the plurality of documents having been identified in response to a query, the quality of results statistic being for the query and the individual document.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can include, for a first document identified as a search result of a user-submitted query, receiving information regarding an anchor contained within the first document, where the anchor is a portion of the first document that provides a link to a second document.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can further include deriving a quality of result statistic for the second document from at least a portion of first data associated with the first document and the user-submitted query, the first data being indicative of user behavior relative to the first document as a search result for the user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can additionally include providing the first quality of result statistic as the quality of result statistic input to the document ranking process for the second document and the user-submitted query.
- the second document can be identified as a search result of the user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can include identifying second data as being indicative of user behavior relative to the second document as a search result for the user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can additionally include determining that the quality of result statistic for the second document is to be derived from at least the portion of the first data associated with the first document and the user-submitted query based upon the first data associated with the first document and the identified second data associated with the second document both being further associated with the user-submitted query.
- the user-submitted query can include a first user-submitted query and the method for providing input to a document ranking process can include identifying the second document as a search result of a second user-submitted query determined to be similar to the first user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can include determining that a first internet domain associated with the first document is different than a second internet domain associated with the second document.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can include determining the anchor is relevant to the user-submitted query. Determining the anchor is relevant to the user-submitted query can include determining that at least a portion of text comprising the anchor matches at least a portion of the user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can additionally include identifying that third data is associated with the anchor and the user-submitted query, the third data being indicative of user behavior relative to the anchor when the first document is a search result for the user-submitted query.
- the method for providing input to a document ranking process can further include combining at least a portion of the first data with second data associated with the second document and the user-submitted query, the second data being indicative of user behavior relative to the second document as a search result for the user-submitted query, where the quality of result statistic for the second document is derived from the combined first data and second data.
- Combining the first data with the second data can include aggregating the first data and the second data.
- Combining the first data with the second data can include combining a percentage of the first data with the second data. The percentage of the first data can be based on a determined degree of relevance for the anchor relative to the user-submitted query.
- Query results are improved by promoting documents that serve as primary sources of information for a given input query.
- user behavior data is appropriately allocated to documents serving as primary sources.
- User behavior data is mapped to more realistic user browsing patterns with regard to users following links to web pages beyond the first document selected from query results.
- FIG. 1A shows a diagram illustrating improvement of query results from a search engine by identifying relevant document anchors for the purpose of borrowing user behavior data.
- FIG. 1B shows an illustration of an example document anchor via which user behavior data can be shared by a query results rank modifier.
- FIG. 1C shows an illustration of example document anchors by which user behavior data can be utilized by a query results rank modifier.
- FIG. 1D shows an illustration of example document anchors that can be determined to be relevant to an input query for the purpose of utilizing user behavior data based upon content associated with each of the document anchors.
- FIG. 2 shows an example information retrieval system in which the relevance of results obtains for submitted search queries can be improved.
- FIG. 3 shows example components of an information retrieval system.
- FIG. 4 shows another example information retrieval system.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart describing an example technique for identifying and utilizing user behavior data via relevant document anchors in providing improved query results in response to received input query.
- FIG. 6A is a flow chart describing an example technique for identifying and utilizing user behavior data through relevant document anchors.
- FIG. 6B is a flow chart describing an example technique for identifying relevant document anchors contained within a document for the purpose of utilizing user behavior data.
- FIGS. 7A-B are flow charts describing example techniques for combining user behavior data for a document with user behavior data that is utilized from another document.
- FIG. 1A shows a diagram 1000 illustrating improvement of query results from a search engine by identifying relevant document anchors for the purpose of borrowing user behavior data.
- user behavior data can provide an indication as to which documents (e.g., web pages) provided as query results responsive to a particular query users have found to be relevant.
- a document with favorable user behavior data e.g., users frequently view the web page and for a “long” period of time
- a particular query can have its rank in a list of query results increased (e.g., the document can be listed closer to the top of the query results).
- user behavior data is limited to data regarding a users' interactions with query results (e.g., which document the user selects from the query results) and does not extend to a user's subsequent interactions outside of the query results (e.g., documents a user views after viewing the selected document from the query results).
- users frequently select a document provided in the query results only to “browse” away from the selected document by selecting a link (e.g., hyperlink) within the document that takes them to another document.
- user behavior data associated with the selected document should possibly be used for the other document to which a user has browsed.
- Secondary sources e.g., WIKIPEDIA, news feeds (e.g., YAHOO! NEWS), blog postings, TWITTER feeds, etc.)—meaning that they provide a summary or synopsis of another web page that is a primary source of information.
- HTML Hyper Text Markup Language
- the query results for the particular query can be improved by allocating at least a portion of the user behavior data for the secondary source to the primary source. Such an allocation can more accurately reflect the primary's document relevance to the query.
- the diagram 1000 illustrates an example of such an improvement to query results by identifying relevant document anchors for the purpose of borrowing user behavior data.
- a client 1002 submits an input query 1004 to a search engine 1006 and the search engine 1006 returns results to the client 1002 .
- the client 1002 submits the query 1004 “Hotel New York.”
- the search engine 1006 produces results 1008 that are an ordered list of documents determined to be responsive to the input query 1004 , with the most relevant documents being provided at the top of the list.
- the search engine 1006 determines relevance based, at least in part, on document content.
- the results 1008 are an ordered list of documents A-D.
- Such an ordering can indicate that the document A has been determined to be more relevant to the query “Hotel New York” than the document D.
- document A can be a web page that provides a list of hotels in New York and document D can be a blog page discussing a music album entitled “Hotel New York.”
- the diagram 1000 shows an example framework for improving the results 1008 produced by the search engine 1006 (e.g., promoting results that are more relevant and demoting results that are less relevant) through the use of a query results rank modifier 1010 module.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can improve the results 1008 by using anchors associated with or contained within documents for the purpose of utilizing (e.g., sharing, borrowing) user behavior data from one document to another.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can alter the order of results based upon quality of result statistics for documents.
- a quality of result statistic for a document is derived from user behavior data associated with the document.
- user behavior data is “click data.” Click data refers to how long a user views or “dwells” on a document after clicking on it in the results for a query. For example, a longer time spent dwelling on a document, termed a “long click”, can indicate that a user found the document to be relevant for their query. A brief period viewing a document, termed a “short click”, can be interpreted as a lack of document relevance.
- Another type of user behavior data is based on tracking eye movements of users as they view search results. Other types of user behavior data are possible.
- the click data is a count of each click type (e.g., long, medium, short) for a document listed as a result for particular input query (a query previously submitted to the search engine 1006 ) and document combination.
- Click data from a historical query (e.g., a previously received query for which click data has been received) for a given document can be used to create a quality of result statistic for that document.
- a quality of result statistic can be a weighted average of the count of long clicks for a given document and query. Other ways of determining a quality of result statistic for a document are possible.
- user behavior data is purchase decision data.
- Such user behavior data can be based on, for example, products searched for by consumers, products viewed by consumers, details regarding the viewing of products, and products purchased by consumers.
- user behavior data is generated by a process that creates a record for documents that are selected by users in response to a specific query.
- Each record (herein referred to as a tuple: ⁇ document, query, data>) comprises a query submitted by users, a document reference indicating the document selected by users in response to the query, and an aggregation of click data for all users or a subset of all users that selected the document reference in response to the query.
- extensions of this tuple-based approach to user behavior data are possible.
- the user behavior data can be extended to include location-specific (e.g. country, state, etc) or language-specific identifier. With such identifiers included, a country-specific tuple would include the country from where the user query originated from in whereas a language-specific tuple would include the language of the user query.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can refine the results 1008 produced by the search engine 1006 based on quality of result statistics associated with the documents listed in the query results 1008 for the input query 1004 . For instance, if the document D is considered very relevant to the query 1004 based on its quality of result statistic (e.g., users frequently click on and view document D for a long period of time when document D is included in the results for the query 1004 ) and the document C is considered less relevant to the query 1004 based on its quality of result statistic (e.g., users click on document C infrequently when document C is included in the results for the query 1004 ), the query results rank modifier 1010 can adjust the ordering of the documents in the results 1008 so that document D is listed before document C (indicating document D is more relevant than document C), for example.
- quality of result statistic e.g., users frequently click on and view document D for a long period of time when document D is included in the results for the query 1004
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can adjust the ordering of the
- Adjustments made to the results 1008 by the query results rank modifier 1010 can be based, at least in part, upon a combination of quality of result statistics and data used by the search engine 1006 to produce the results 1008 (e.g., a score quantifying a document's relevance to a given query).
- Adjustment of the results 1008 based on quality of result statistics for each document can promote documents that are actually less relevant to the query 1004 and demote documents that are more relevant to the query 1004 .
- Such erroneous promotion and demotion of documents can be based upon a variety of factors, such as the manner in which click data is captured.
- click data is generated from a user's click on (e.g., with a mouse) or selection of a document listed in a query result.
- the click data accounts for the time from the user's click to when the user returns to the query results. However, the click data does not account for the actions taken by the user in between the user's click and return, such as a user following links provided by anchors in the selected document to other documents.
- document A contains document anchors that link to other documents (e.g., document A contains a list of links to web pages for specific hotels in New York). If clients routinely select document A and then follow one of the document anchors to another document (e.g., document C), the user behavior data may inaccurately skew in favor of document A—meaning that document A could be promoted in the query results 1008 for the query 1004 even though users found other documents to which document A linked to be more relevant to the query 1004 .
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can resolve any such inconsistencies in user behavior data allocation by identifying relevant document anchors and utilizing (e.g., sharing, borrowing) user behavior data accordingly.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 receives information 1012 regarding document anchors for the received query results 1008 .
- the document A 1014 a has document anchors 1016 a - b .
- the document anchor 1016 a is depicted as having a link to the document C 1014 c and the document anchor 1016 b is depicted as having a link to the document D 1014 d.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 also receives user behavior data for the documents listed in the query results 1008 from a user behavior data repository 1018 .
- a table 1020 provides a simplified example of user behavior data associated with the documents A-D for the query 1004 .
- “high” indicates that there is a significant amount of favorable user behavior data (e.g., user behavior data indicating relevance) and “low” indicates an insignificant amount of favorable user behavior data.
- the document A is depicted as having a “high” amount of user behavior data for the query 1004 , meaning that users frequently click on document A and/or view document A for a long period of time when clicked.
- the documents B and C are shown as having a “low” amount of user behavior data, meaning that users click on these documents less frequently than document A and/or view these documents for a shorter period of time than document A.
- the document D is depicted as having a negligible amount of favorable user behavior data for the query 1004 .
- the query results rank modifier 1010 identifies relevant document anchors to use for sharing data.
- a relevant document anchor is a document anchor for which both the document containing the anchor and the document to which the anchor links have associated user behavior data for the query 1004 .
- the anchor 1016 a from document A 1014 a to document C 1014 c meets this criteria (there is user behavior data associated with both documents A and C) but the anchor 1016 b from document A 1014 a to document D 1014 d does not (there is no user behavior data associated with document D for query 1004 ).
- user behavior data from document A is spread from document A to document C.
- all of the user behavior data from document A is utilized to document C.
- less than all of the user behavior data can be utilized from the document containing the anchor (e.g., document A) to the linked-to document (e.g., document C).
- the query results rank modifier 1010 can update the user behavior data to include the shared data from the step 1022 .
- the user behavior data associated with document C for the query 1004 has increased to “high,” but the user behavior data for the other documents A, B, and D has remained the same as in table 1020 .
- the user behavior data associated with document B for the query 1004 did not change because there was not an anchor via which user behavior data could be utilized for document B.
- the user behavior associated with the document D for the query 1004 did not change because the anchor 1016 b was not deemed relevant to the query 1004 (e.g., users had not previously indicated document D was sufficiently relevant to the query 1004 that it would be likely users were browsing from document A to document D via the anchor 1016 b in response to the query 1004 ).
- the user behavior data associated with the document A did not change (e.g., users browsing away from document A to document C via the anchor 1016 a is only estimated—user behavior data for the document A should not be decreased).
- the user behavior data associated with a document from which user behavior data is utilized is decreased in proportion to an amount of user behavior data utilized for the given query.
- decreasing user behavior data associated with a document from which user behavior data is utilized can be triggered by the existence of user behavior data indicating browsing patterns with regard to the document (e.g., user behavior data showing what, if any, anchors users select when viewing document A in response to the query 1004 ).
- the query results rank modifier 1010 refines the ranking of one or more documents in the query results using the updated user behavior data.
- the user behavior data can be used to create a quality of result statistic for each of the documents, which can in turn be used to refine the query results.
- utilizing user behavior data from the document A for the document C causes the document C to increase in rank above the document B.
- the query results rank modifier 1010 sends refined query results 1034 to the client 1002 .
- FIG. 1B shows an illustration 1040 of an example document anchor via which user behavior data can be shared by a query results rank modifier.
- the example anchor depicted can be used by any implementation of a query results rank modifier, such as the query results rank modifier 1010 .
- the example document anchor is depicted as being part of document A 1042 .
- the document A 1042 is shown as being associated with the web address “www.a.com/index.html.”
- the example document anchor is shown as linking to document B 1044 , which is associated with the web address “www.b.com/index.html.”
- the anchor is depicted as being a selectable text-based hyperlink 1046 for the word “here.”
- the anchor is implemented in the document A 1042 using an HTML anchor tag 1048 , which provides that the anchor links 1055 to the web address for document B 1044 .
- FIG. 1C shows an illustration 1060 of example document anchors by which user behavior data can be utilized by a query results rank modifier (e.g., the query results rank modifier 1010 ).
- a query results rank modifier can share user behavior data by the use of anchors from a variety of document-based media (e.g., text, video, image, etc.).
- the illustration 1060 shows example anchors derived from video, text, and images by which user behavior data can be utilized.
- the illustration 1060 shows a document A 1062 containing a variety of document anchors that link to a document B 1064 .
- the document A 1062 contains a video 1066 , text 1068 , and an image 1070 .
- the document A 1062 contains three anchors 1072 a - c that are contained in the video 1066 , the text 1068 , and the image 1070 , respectively.
- Each of the anchors 1072 a - c provides a link 1074 a - c to the document B 1064 by which user behavior data can be utilized by a query results rank modifier.
- the video 1066 is an embedded or streamed digital video (e.g., a FLASH video) that is included in the document A 1062 and contains anchors that link to other documents.
- the video 1066 can be a video that reviews products and the anchor 1072 a provides links to a web page for each product that is being reviewed, for instance.
- the text 1068 is any variety of text capable of containing a document anchor, such as an HTML file, a FLASH file, a Portable Document Format (PDF), etc.
- the image 1070 is any type of image that is capable of containing an anchor or being associated with an anchor, such as an image associated with an HTML anchor tag, an image associated with an image map, an image contained in a FLASH file and associated with an anchor, etc. Other content types containing anchors are possible.
- FIG. 1D shows an illustration 1080 of example document anchors that can be determined to be relevant to an input query 1082 for the purpose of utilizing user behavior data based upon content associated with each of the document anchors.
- the example document anchors can be analyzed for relevance by any query results rank modifier, such as the query results rank modifier 1010 described above with respect to FIG. 1A .
- the input query 1082 is “Hotel New York.”
- Document A 1084 contains three document anchors 1092 a - c that link to three different documents B-D 1086 - 1090 , respectively.
- document anchor relevance is determined in the example illustration 1080 based upon the relevance of content associated with each document anchor.
- the first anchor 1092 a provides a link 1096 a to a web address “www.b.com/index” 1094 a for the document B 1086 .
- the first anchor 1092 a can be determined to be relevant to the query 1082 based upon the first anchor 1092 a containing and being located nearby text that is related to the query 1082 (e.g., the anchor 1092 a includes the term “hotel” and is within the same sentence as the phrase “New York”).
- a query results rank modifier, or an associated system e.g., a search engine, can determine query to anchor relevance using any variety of content-based relevancy algorithms.
- a query results rank modifier determines that an anchor is less or not relevant to a query if the anchor is associated with content that negatively portrays the subject of the query. For instance, were the anchor 1092 a to be included in the phrase “This hotel is New York is suspected—it should be condemned,” the query results rank modifier could determine that the anchor is not relevant and, thus, not utilize user behavior data from document A 1084 for document B 1086 . By not utilizing user behavior data when the subject matter of the input query is negatively presented, the query results rank modifier can avoid elevating a document that users are less likely to have selected (e.g., users are more likely to find a positive review to be relevant than a negative review). A variety of techniques can be used to determine whether an anchor negatively portrays the target of the link, such as examining the text of the anchor for negative words like “bad,” “terrible,” “horrible,” etc.
- Such a relevancy determination can be limited to certain types of queries where a negative portrayal is less likely to be deemed relevant to an input query by users, such a product or travel related queries.
- the query results rank modifier can make such a determination using a system that analyzes content associated with an anchor for negative treatment of the input query's subject matter.
- Other techniques can also be used to determine the relevance of an anchor to a query. For example, an overlap between a query's terms and the anchor text can indicate that the anchor is more relevant to the query (e.g., a query and an anchor both having the term “baseball” can provide an indication the anchor is relevant to the query).
- terms contained in a query that are determined to be important can indicate that the anchor is less relevant to the query.
- terms contained in an anchor that are determined to be important and that are not contained in the anchor text can indicate that the anchor is less relevant to the query.
- the anchor being part of boilerplate/fixed text for a site can indicate that the anchor is less relevant to a query (e.g., an anchor that provides a link to a legal boilerplate document and that is located at the bottom of every document hosted on a domain can be less relevant to a query than other anchors contained in the documents hosted on the domain).
- the second anchor 1092 b provides a link 1096 b to a web address “www.c.com/index” 1094 b for the document C 1088 .
- a query results rank modifier can determine that the anchor 1092 b is not relevant to the input query 1082 based upon the anchor 1092 b pertaining to “restaurants” in New York instead of hotels. Such a determination can cause the query results rank modifier to not utilize user behavior data from the document A 1084 for the document C 1088 .
- the third anchor 1092 c is an image that provides a link 1096 c to a web address “www.d.com/index” 1094 c for the document D 1090 .
- the anchor 1092 c is associated with metadata providing that the image is of a hotel in New York.
- a query results rank modifier can determine that the anchor 1092 c is relevant to the input query 1082 .
- the query results rank modifier image-based content identification to ascertain the relevance of an image or video based anchor (e.g., the query results rank modifier could compare the image for the anchor 1092 c to a repository of hotel images to identify the hotel). Such a determination can cause the query results rank modifier to utilize user behavior data from the document A 1084 for the document D 1090 .
- FIG. 2 shows an example system 2000 for improving the relevance of results obtained from submitting search queries as can be implemented for the Internet, an intranet, or other client/server environment.
- the system 2000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 2000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a user 2002 can interact with the system 2000 through a client device 2004 ( 2004 a , 2004 b , 2004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 2004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 2004 can be a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone, a mobile computer, a personal desktop assistant, etc.) that is capable of communicating over a LAN, a WAN, or some other network (e.g., a cellular phone network).
- the client device 2004 can include a random access memory (RAM) 2006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 2008 .
- RAM random access memory
- the processor 2008 is structured to process instructions within the system 2000 .
- the processor 2008 is a single-threaded or multi-threaded processor having one or more processing cores.
- the processor 2008 is structured to execute instructions stored in the RAM 2006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 2004 ) to display graphical information for a user interface.
- a user 2002 a can connect to the search engine 2030 within a server system 2014 to submit an input query 2015 .
- a client-side query signal 2010 a is sent into a network 2012 and is forwarded to the server system 2014 as a server-side query signal 2010 b .
- Server system 2014 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- a server device 2014 includes a memory device 2016 , which can include the search engine 2030 loaded therein.
- a processor 2018 is structured to process instructions within the device 2014 . These instructions can implement one or more components of the search engine 2030 .
- the processor 2018 can be a single-threaded processor or a multi-threaded processor, and can include multiple processing cores.
- the processor 2018 can process instructions stored in the memory 2016 related to the search engine 2030 and can send information to the client device 2004 , through the network 2012 , to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 2004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 2010 b is received by the search engine 2030 .
- the search engine 2030 uses the information within the input query 2015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 2030 can include an indexing engine 2020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 2022 .
- This index database 2022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the user query 2015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- a document can be stored in a memory without having first been stored in file.
- the search engine 2030 can include a ranking engine 2052 to rank the documents related to the input query 2015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an IR score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms)
- it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants. Appropriate techniques can also be taken to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- the ranking engine 2052 can receive an additional signal from a rank modifier engine 2056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 2056 provides one or more measures of relevance for the documents, which can be used by the ranking engine 2052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 2002 .
- the rank modifier engine 2056 can perform one or more of the operations described above and below in this document to generate the one or more measures of relevance.

- the tracking component 3050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 3040 that identifies user selections (e.g., mouse clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 3050 is proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client.
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the user.
- the recorded information can be stored in result selection logs 3060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each user selection, the query (Q), the document (D), the user's dwell time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- Other information indicative of user behavior can also be recorded, such as user interactions with a presented ranking, including negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user, but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the user interface, information about the session (e.g., existence and type of previous clicks, and post-click session activity), IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before click, the titles and snippets shown to the user before the click, the user's cookie, cookie age, IP (Internet Protocol) address, user agent of the browser, etc.

- the time (T), also known as “click data”, is measured as the time between the initial click through to the document result until the time the user comes back to the main page and clicks on another document result.
- an assessment is made about the time (T) regarding whether this time indicates a longer view of the document result or a shorter view of the document result, since longer views are generally indicative of quality or relevance for the clicked through result.
- This assessment about the time (T) can further be made in conjunction with various weighting techniques.
- the information retrieval system 3000 can additionally include a results anchor analyzing component 3080 that can analyze and identify relevant anchors contained in results generated by the ranking 3040 .

- FIG. 5 is a flow chart describing an example technique 5000 for identifying and utilizing user behavior data via relevant document anchors in providing improved query results in response to received input query.
- the technique 5000 can be performed by a variety of systems, for example, by the server system 2014 and its rank modifier engine 2056 , as described with reference to FIG. 2 , or by the information retrieval system 3000 and its rank modifier engine 3070 , as described with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the technique 5000 begins at step 5002 by receiving an input query and search engine results for the input query.
- the input query can be submitted over a variety of environments (e.g., Internet, intranet, local machine).
- environments e.g., Internet, intranet, local machine.
- the user 2002 a can submit the input query 2015 over the network 2012 using client 2004 a .
- the search engine results can be generated by components of a search engine (e.g., indexing engine 2020 , scoring engine 3020 , etc.) that rank documents according to content (e.g., rank according to an IR score).
- Information regarding document anchors is received for each of the documents identified in the search engine results (step 5004 ). For example, anchor information such as the anchors 1016 a - b described above with regard to FIG. 1A are received.
- a document from the search engine results and for which an anchor is received is selected (step 5006 ).
- a determination is made as to whether there is at least a threshold amount user behavior data associated with the selected document (step 5008 ). Such a determination can be made based upon a variety of user behavior related data, such as a computed quality of result statistic for the selected document, a quantity of raw user behavior data indicative of relevance to the received input query (e.g., a high ratio of long clicks), etc.
- a threshold against which user behavior data is compared can be based upon a variety of factors, such as empirical analysis of user behavior data for the received query (or for related queries or for all queries), user behavior trends over time with regard to the received query (or for related queries or for all queries), geographic location and/or language of the user submitting the input query in relation to the users from which the user behavior data was generated, etc.
- Document anchor relevance can be determined in a variety of manners, such as those described above with regard to FIGS. 1A and 1D . Additionally, techniques for determining document anchor relevance are described below with regard to FIGS. 6A-B .
- FIG. 6A is a flow chart describing an example technique 6000 for identifying and utilizing user behavior data through relevant document anchors.
- the technique 6000 can be performed by a variety of systems, for example, by the server system 2014 and its rank modifier engine 2056 , as described with reference to FIG. 2 , or by the information retrieval system 3000 and its rank modifier engine 3070 , as described with reference to FIG. 3 .

- the technique 6000 can be performed at step 5010 of the technique 5000 for each selected document having a threshold amount of user behavior data.
- the technique 6000 begins at step 6002 by selecting an anchor contained within a first document that links the first document to a second document.
- a determination can be made as to whether conditions for utilizing user behavior data from the first document for the second document are met (step 6004 ). Such a determination can strive to ascertain whether the selected anchor is relevant to a received input query, for which this analysis is being performed.
- a variety of conditions can be used to determine anchor relevance to a received input query, such as the first document and the second document both having threshold amounts of user behavior data associated with the input query (as described above with regard to FIG. 1A ) or the document anchor being associated with content that is relevant to the input query (as described above with regard to FIG. 1D ). Additional conditions are possible, as described in further detail below with regard to FIG. 6B .
- user behavior data for the second document is adjusted by combining it with utilized user behavior data associated with the first document (step 6006 ).
- user behavior data can be utilized from the first document for the second document in whole or in part. Techniques for combining user behavior data are described in further detail below with regard to FIGS. 7A-B .
- FIG. 6B is a flow chart describing an example technique 6050 for identifying relevant document anchors contained within a document for the purpose of utilizing user behavior data.
- the technique 6050 can be performed by a variety of systems, for example, by the server system 2014 and its rank modifier engine 2056 , as described with reference to FIG. 2 , or by the information retrieval system 3000 and its rank modifier engine 3070 , as described with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the technique 6050 can be performed as part of the technique 5000 , as described above with regard to FIG. 5 , and/or as part of the technique 6000 , as described above with regard to FIG. 6A .
- the technique 6050 can be performed at step 6004 of the technique 6000 for each anchor selected from a document having a threshold amount of user behavior data.
- the technique 6050 contains a number of conditions 6054 - 6064 that are each presented as optional. Any combination of these conditions 6054 - 6064 can be used. In various implementations, all of the depicted conditions 6054 - 6064 are used to determine whether an anchor is relevant to an input query. In other implementations, only one of the depicted conditions 6054 - 6064 is used.
- the conditions 6054 - 6064 that are used can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of query received (e.g., product-related query, news-related query, etc.), processing bandwidth for the computing device performing the technique 6050 (e.g., more bandwidth can signal the use of more conditions), etc.
- the conditions 6054 - 6064 depicted in the technique 6050 are for illustrative purposes and additional conditions not presented are possible.
- the technique 6050 begins at step 6052 by selecting an anchor linking a first document to a second document.
- a determination is made as to whether the second document is a search result for the received input query (step 6054 ). For example, if an anchor for a document A that links to a document B is being analyzed, step 6054 can determine whether both document A and document B are provided as search results (e.g., search results 1008 ) for the input query. In some implementations, such a determination can additionally ascertain whether both documents have received at least a threshold IR score (e.g., both documents have at least a baseline relevance to the input query based upon content alone).
- a threshold IR score e.g., both documents have at least a baseline relevance to the input query based upon content alone.
- a determination of query similarity can be based on a variety of factors, such as similarity of query terms, similarity among the set of search results for both queries, similarity among the set of documents receiving user behavior data for both queries, etc.
- the second document is a search result for the input query or a similar query (or in an implementation where steps 6054 - 6056 are not used)
- Both the first document and the second document having user behavior data associated with the input query can indicate that the anchor linking the two documents together is relevant to the input query.
- the user behavior data analyzed can be raw data (e.g., click data), refined data (e.g., a quality of result statistic), or any combination thereof.
- An example determination of the step 6058 is described and depicted above with regard to FIG. 1A .
- Additional determinations can be made to ascertain whether the presence of user behavior data for the first and second documents provides an indication of anchor relevance. For instance, analysis can be performed regarding a timeframe within which the anchor appeared, user behavior trends for the first and second document regarding the received input query, and how recently updates to the first and second documents were made.
- creation of an anchor for the first document coincided with increased user behavior data for the first document and decreased user behavior data for the second.
- user behavior for the second document had been in steady decline prior to creation of the anchor in the first document, which has not coincided with a boost in user behavior data for the first document.
- the first example scenario can be determined to provide a greater indication of anchor relevance to the input query based upon the coinciding user behavior changes and the anchor creation.
- utilizing user behavior data from one document for another document can be limited to off-domain anchors (e.g., documents originating from different internet domain addresses). Such off-domain anchors can provide a more reliable indication of relevance to an input query based upon the general notion that they are not self-promoting (e.g., not promoting a page within the same domain).
- step 6062 a determination can be made as to whether the text associated with the anchor contained in the first document is relevant to the input query (step 6062 ). An example of such a determination is described above with regard to FIG. 1D .
- the strictness with which step 6062 is performed can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as empirical data regarding previous input queries and user behavior data utilized by anchors, a type of query submitted (e.g., product query, image query, video query, etc.), etc.
- the anchor text is analyzed for a match of the query terms.
- the anchor text as well as surrounding text e.g., text in the same sentence, paragraph, etc.
- the anchor and metadata is analyzed for a match of the query terms.
- Text matching algorithms such as edit-distance, can be used to quantify a similarity between the anchor and the input query, and similarity thresholds can be used to determine whether an anchor sufficiently matches an input query.
- Synonym substitutions and stemming for terms in the anchor and/or input query can additionally be used to provide a greater breadth of comparison.
- the degree of similarity between the anchor (and surrounding text) can determine, at least in part, an amount of user behavior data that is utilized from the first document for the second document.
- user behavior data for anchor e.g., a server hosting the first document provides user behavior data regarding the anchor contained in the first document
- step 6066 the conditions for utilizing data from the first document for the second document are met. As described previously, the step 6066 can be performed depending on the implementation. In some implementations, all conditions 6054 - 6064 are used. In other implementations, only one of the conditions 6054 - 6064 is performed. After the step 6066 , the technique 6050 ends.

- the techniques 7000 and 7050 can be performed at step 6006 of the technique 6000 for each anchor selected from a document having a threshold amount of user behavior data.
- the technique 7000 begins at step 7002 by retrieving user behavior data associated with a first document (containing an anchor by which user behavior data will be utilized for a second document) and user behavior data for the second document.
- the anchor linking the first document to the second document has been identified as relevant to an input query in response to which the first document was identified as a search result.
- the retrieved user behavior data for the first document and the second document is aggregated to form an adjusted level of user behavior data for the second document (step 7004 ).
- the aggregated user behavior data can be raw user behavior data (e.g., click data), refined user behavior data (e.g., quality of result statistic), or any combination thereof.
- the technique 7000 ends.
- the technique 7050 begins at step 7052 by retrieving user behavior data associated with a first document (containing an anchor by which user behavior data will be utilized for a second document) and user behavior data for the second document.
- the anchor linking the first document to the second document has been identified as relevant to an input query in response to which the first document was identified as a search result.
- a degree of relevance in relation to the input query for the anchor linking the first document to the second document is determined (step 7054 ). For example, an anchor that contains the exact input query string will have a greater degree of relevance in relation to the input query than an anchor that contains half of the input query terms.
- a percentage of the user behavior data associated with the first document can be combined (e.g., aggregated) with the user behavior data associated with the second document to form an adjusted level of user behavior data for the second document (step 7056 ).
- the aggregated user behavior data can be raw user behavior data (e.g., click data), refined user behavior data (e.g., quality of result statistic), or any combination thereof.
- the user behavior data associated with the first document can be additionally be reduced. In such implementations, the amount by which the user behavior data for the first document is reduced can range from nothing to the full percentage utilized for the second document, depending on the degree of relevance for the anchor.
