When (for example, the first content project of user's viewing more or less than threshold quantity) is shown to reduce contents list in feed list
Prolong.The condition can be used which content item determined to show in second equipment.Therefore, user be able to can be come with the hysteresis of reduction
The contents list is browsed or promoted in rolling.
After the first insertion content item (step 316) is rendered, in step 318 ' place, the second equipment tracking contents list
Position in the display area.Play the first position of inserted content item when the second equipment recognizes and no longer showing
When in area, the equipment suspends the playback of the content item at some time point.Second equipment also identifies the content item
The accumulation playback duration or cumulative duration that mesh and any associated content item play before pause.Accumulating playback duration can
For each related content items purpose duration total and/or content item duration and prior cumulative playback duration it is total
With.In some embodiments, the feelings of individual threshold value (for example, 2 seconds, 3 seconds etc.) only can be more than in the duration of content item
Viewing time is incrementally accumulated under condition.
Associated content item may include a series of videos of such as content family or predetermined associated video set, but can also wrap
Include based on theme, source, target etc. and there is any other content item series of some relations each other.In some embodiments
In, can be based on the eCPM processes manipulated come for content item groove position selection content item.The process can be based on user
ECPM is adjusted through the accumulation playback duration amount from a series of content item viewings.The process can be based on warp-wise user
The content item number of display adjusts eCPM.The process can be adjusted based on the content item number in the series
eCPM.The process can will be seen that the possibilities of more supplemental content projects in contents list to adjust based on user
eCPM.In some embodiments, the contents list can be merely provided as the project of top ranked (for example, checking most, use
Family scoring it is most high) content item.When contents list shows all such contents, it can show older content.Therefore,
Contents list feeding can be it is limited, and user can be rolled in contents list the content item number browsed can be can be pre-
Survey.
Generally, the groove position in contents list is determined in advance before the content item is selected so as to organic content and push away
The mixture variation of wide content.In some embodiments, the follow-up sudden strain of a muscle of the content item from identical series of content items
Now can be unlike showing that new (that is, unrelated) content item has aggressiveness like that, and therefore, can be added into contents list more
Content item groove position.If a series of several seconds of the first content project that user is watched in content items, can from current location to
Under 1,2 or 3 list-item insertion it is described series in next content item rather than further downwards in position
Inserted at numbering 4.Because complementarity content item (in-feed supplemental content item) is generally not in feeding
It is related to the content that they are mixed with, so other supplemental content item slot positions can rightly be offset.
In some embodiments, the first equipment can be by providing multiple associated content items at different conditions
When (for example, the first content project of user's viewing more or less than threshold quantity) is shown to reduce contents list in feed list
Prolong.The condition can be used which content item determined to show in second equipment.Therefore, user be able to can be come with the hysteresis of reduction
The contents list is browsed or promoted in rolling.
Accumulation playback duration information and content item purpose mark can be sent to the first equipment for further analysis.In step
Rapid 320 ' place, in some embodiments, the first equipment will play a series of related content items purposes accumulation playback durations and the
One threshold value (for example, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute etc.) is compared.In some embodiments, first threshold is referred to alternatively as currency
Change threshold value.If the duration is less than first threshold, the display of the content item can not be directed to creator of content or hair
Cloth person charges.If the duration is more than first threshold, the display of the content item can be directed to creator of content or hair
Cloth person charges.In some embodiments, when a series of certain number of content item from content items has had
More than individual threshold value (for example, 2 seconds, 3 seconds etc.) duration when, can be charged to creator of content or publisher.
At step 322, the second equipment determines that contents list promotes the second identification in the viewing area of contents list
Position, wherein can be inserted into content item in the described second identification opening position.At step 324, the second equipment is by related content items
The accumulation playback duration that mesh plays is compared with predetermined Second Threshold.In some embodiments, Second Threshold can be two seconds,
But in other embodiments, threshold value can be one second, three seconds, ten seconds, 20 seconds or some other value.
If accumulation playback duration is less than or equal to Second Threshold, the second equipment can determine that user has scrolled through institute
The content item of insertion is without watching.If accumulation playback duration is less than Second Threshold, can be at step 326 next
Opening position renders or shown next associated content item.Second equipment is in step 318 ' place continues to track the content item.
If accumulation playback duration is more than Second Threshold, the second equipment can determine that user or start to watch the content item and determine
Fixed its is lost interest in the content, or watches the content item until completing, so as to indicate that it is emerging to the content sense
Interest.If accumulation playback duration is more than Second Threshold, the second equipment can return to step 310 and ask new content item.
Second equipment can also remove the other appearance of related content items purpose from contents list.
Similar to method 300, in some embodiments, even if accumulation playback duration is more than Second Threshold, if accumulation
Playback duration is not more than first threshold, and the second equipment still can play a series of next content item in associated content items.
Therefore, system and method discussed herein provide the dynamic surveillance interacted to user with list of content items,
Including automatic media playing, and the opening position selected in the interaction in response to user inserts paid content item so that institute
The paid content can be more likely to view by stating user.These systems further provide for the paid content and original contents inserted
