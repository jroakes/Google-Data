Video is distributed to the shared average number of the mean time area of a room pass between the video of channel and channel consumed, video, arrives
Average number of the link of video etc..
In frame 307, computing machine adjusts channel score value based on criterion.For example, how old can have based on channel score value, believe
The type of the content that road is provided and channel provides the time of content adjusting channel score value in 1 year.Computing machine can be with root
One or more weights are applied to into separate channel score value according to criterion, to increase or decrease channel score value.For example, criterion can refer to
If fixed channel score value is older than threshold value, weight should be applied to channel score value to reduce channel score value by computing machine
Value.For example, channel can be provided and current incoherent content, and computing machine can reduce channel point using weight
Value.For example, channel can provide the content relevant with the summer Olympics before 3 years, and the original letter that will can be calculated before 3 years
Road score value is adjusted to relatively low value to consider the age of channel score value.
In another example, if criterion can specify channel to provide for the electricity of the current time first broadcast in a year
Depending on program with television program designing (programming) about content, then because the content of channel includes television program designing,
Weight should be applied to channel score value to increase channel score value by computing machine, and because the content of channel with worked as in 1 year
The TV programme of front time first broadcast are relevant, and another weight should be applied to channel score value further to increase letter by computing machine
Road score value.
In another example, if criterion can specify channel to provide certain form of content, computing machine should be by
Weight is applied to channel score value to reduce channel score value.The certain types of content repeatedly consumed is tended in presence.For example, youngster
Child tends to watch the identical video relevant with child again and again.In another example, player user tends to frequency
Game video is simultaneously repeatedly watched in numerous ground.The property of the content type provided by channel can cause channel to have the initial of high level
Channel score value.Because other users may be lost interest in child's video or game video, the high channel of such channel
Score value may inaccurately reflect the bigger user audient for accessing content shared platform.Weight can be applied to by computing machine
The channel score value of channel of child's video or game video is provided to reduce channel score value.
In one embodiment, criterion specifies what the channel before weight to be applied to the channel score value of channel should be provided
The minimum of certain types of content.For example, channel A can provide 50 videos, and two in wherein 50 videos include trip
Play video.If channel provides 50% game content, criterion can specify channel A be classified as provide in game
Hold.Because channel A does not provide 50% game content, weight can not be applied to channel A to reduce the letter of channel A by computer
Road score value.
In frame 309, computing machine is classified to channel by channel score value.Computer can use classified channel point
Value is come to recognize which channel be viscosity channel.
