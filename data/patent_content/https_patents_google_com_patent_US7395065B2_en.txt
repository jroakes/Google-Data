Definitions
- the present invention relates in general to communication units and wireless networks, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for routing and managing calls to effect handover of such calls in networks with multiple controllers.
- WLANs Wireless Local Area Networks
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- the WLAN can be an attractive and inexpensive alternative for typical voice services such as telephony or dispatch services and may provide additional amenities such as high-speed wireless Internet and Intranet access as well as other real-time applications that may be more specific to a given enterprise.
- Wireless wide area networks such as conventional cellular telephone systems are also known.
- Such networks provide the advantage of wide area coverage but may not be economically attractive for routine access to wideband or high speed data capabilities, such as are required for certain Internet or Intranet applications.
- a communication unit that is operating on a WLAN may move beyond the effective service area for the WLAN and thus need support or services from a WAN.
- loosely coupled systems e.g. the WAN is intercoupled to the WLAN only via the PSTN, a communication unit operating on the WAN can experience problems.
- FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 depict, in a simplified and representative form, exemplary system diagrams, where a plurality of network controllers manage an enterprise network;
- FIG. 5 depicts a simplified block diagram of a network controller for facilitating handover of a call
- communication unit may be used interchangeably herein with wireless subscriber device or unit and each of these terms denotes a device ordinarily associated with a user and typically a wireless communication unit that may be used with a public network in accordance, for example with a service agreement, or within a private or enterprise network.
- Examples of such units include personal digital assistants, personal computers equipped for wireless operation, cellular handsets or devices, or equivalents thereof provided such units are arranged and constructed for operation in these different networks and advantageously in accordance with the concepts and principles discussed and disclosed herein.
- the communication systems and communication units that are of particular interest are those that may provide or facilitate voice communication services or data or messaging services over cellular wide area networks (WANs), such as conventional two way systems and devices, various cellular phone systems including analog and digital cellular, CDMA (code division multiple access) and variants thereof, GSM, GPRS (General Packet Radio System), 2.5G and 3G systems such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service) systems, 4G OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed) systems, integrated digital enhanced networks and variants or evolutions thereof.

- inventive principles and combinations thereof are advantageously employed to facilitate resolving or identifying a unique network controller out of a plurality of network controllers, where the unique network controller can be used to effect a handover of a call or ongoing communication or communication link from a first wireless communication network (first network) to a second wireless communication network (second network) or vice-a-versa.
- This resolution or determination of a unique network controller in some embodiments comprises requiring that a wireless communication unit uses a known network controller for setting up or handing over calls. This can be accomplished in certain embodiments by providing the communication unit with an address and telephone number that specify or terminate on a given network controller and thus this controller will be either controlling or at least informed of a call that is being setup or handed over.
- Other approaches can also be used as will be further described below and include for example having the enterprise network or relevant network controller determine or identify the unique network controller for call set up or handover.
- 111 - 117 connected to additional sites (not shown) that are, respectively, managed and controlled by a plurality of network controllers A-D 119 - 125 , where the multiple sites or network controllers are inter coupled by, for example, high capacity links (T 1 , etc as is known) via the PSTN/PSDN 103 or via another proprietary or leased network of the enterprise.
- network controllers A-D 119 - 125 where the multiple sites or network controllers are inter coupled by, for example, high capacity links (T 1 , etc as is known) via the PSTN/PSDN 103 or via another proprietary or leased network of the enterprise.
- Each of the network controllers is responsible for controlling calls within its respective local area network.
- network controller A 119 for the local area network or site A 111 is also a visited site for communication unit 1 (CU 1 ) 129
- network controller B 121 is the controller for site B 113 which is the home site for CU 1
- network controller C 123 is responsible for site C 115 and this is the home site for CU 2 131
- network controller D 125 is in charge of site D 117 which is the visited site for CU 2 .
- CU 1 129 and CU 2 131 are dual mode units or devices that are capable of operating in a wireless local area network (WLAN or LAN) using for example IEEE 802.11 protocols to support an air interface as well as operating in wireless wide area or cellular network (WAN) using known cellular protocols for the air interface.
- WLAN wireless local area network
- WAN wireless wide area or cellular network
- the communication units (two shown) are arranged and capable of operating on any of the sites comprising the enterprise network as well as various cellular networks using one or more cellular protocols and each of the CUs will have two phone numbers, e.g. an enterprise number, Ex, and cellular number, Cx, where x denotes the particular CU.
- a plain old telephone set (POTS) 133 operating on the PSTN and a registrar 127 for determining the present location of wireless communication units is also depicted.
- the home site of a communication unit CU x can then be defined as the site that is controlled by the home network controller of CU x.
- the home network controller of CU x can be defined as the network controller 119 - 125 on which the cellular number Cx of CU x terminates.
- the loosely coupled network is characterized by the notion that the two constituent networks, enterprise network 101 and cellular networks 105 , 107 are coupled to each other via the PSTN and do not have any means for exchanging proprietary call control signaling. Providing a handover of a call from one of the constituent networks to another without an undue interruption in an ongoing communication is thus problematic.
- One approach that has been contemplated for doing an acceptable handover (seamless or near seamless) of a call from one, present network to another, new network amounts to establishing a call leg or path on the new network prior to or concurrently with breaking the path on the present network.
- the network controller that is controlling the call couples at least the bearer (payload or traffic) path from one party to the new path for the other party, e.g. party that is being handed over.
- the cellular network coverage area ordinarily overlaps the coverage area on the local area networks.
- Doing handovers is desired since the coverage area of any one of the local area networks or sites is limited typically to the area of the site (building) and nearby locations and thus a handover to the wide area network or cellular network may be required when the coverage from the local area network fails.
- Doing a handover from cellular to the local area network is desirable because the local area networks are typically privately held and economics indicate that calls should be handled by the enterprise network as much as possible. Furthermore additional or expanded services can be available via the enterprise network.
- FIG. 2 depicts another exemplary situation.
- CU 1 is the call originator 203 via the network controller B 121 for its home site.
- the network controller B 121 establishes a control and bearer path 205 to the target unit, CU 2 131 , within the visited site, site D 117 . If CU 2 then moves 207 to the cellular network 107 it will not know that it needs to call a handover number that terminates on the network controller B 121 and the call can be dropped. Thus successful hand over of calls can require determining a unique one of a plurality of network controllers. Using the inventive concepts and principles described below in the system of FIG. 1 will facilitate identifying the proper network controller.
- the first network 304 is or includes a wireless local area network (WLAN) using packet data based methodologies including VoIP (Voice Over IP) and the second network 305 is, in one embodiment, a WAN, such as a cellular voice or packet data network or other cellular or cellular like network otherwise referred to as a wireless or cellular WAN or simply WAN.
- WLAN wireless local area network
- VoIP Voice Over IP
- the second network 305 is, in one embodiment, a WAN, such as a cellular voice or packet data network or other cellular or cellular like network otherwise referred to as a wireless or cellular WAN or simply WAN.
- arrow 302 and alternative locations for wireless communication unit designated 301 , 301 ′ suggest physical movement, this may not be the case since the WAN likely has overlapping coverage with the wireless LAN.
- the arrow may simply denote a change in which network the communication unit is operating or registered on for a variety of reasons.
- the first communication network or wireless LAN is inter coupled to the second communication network as well
- the mobility manager 313 includes, in the SIP embodiment, a known SIP Registrar, SIP Proxy, etc.
- the mobility manager 313 is responsible for maintaining network contact information (sometimes referred to as location information) for the various wireless communication units and thus is utilized by network entities as a central point for setting up connections or sessions with other network entities.
- the network controller 312 and mobility manager will be described in further detail below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the second network or wireless WAN similarly typically includes a plurality of base transmitters and antenna towers as well as base site controllers that all serve to provide a radio access network for communication units as well as the various registrars, billing servers and so forth.
- first and second networks 304 , 305 are referred to as wireless networks, much of these networks or the respective elements thereof are inter coupled using terrestrial based links, e.g. cables or wires.
- the controller functions 312 , 321 are normally coupled to the balance of their respective networks using known cables or wires.
- the WLAN 304 can include and support voice services for stationary or static communications units that are coupled to the network using conventional cabling or wires.
- Calls 331 originating in the LAN or terminating at the LAN, network controller 312 can be forwarded 335 to the cellular network and then coupled 331 to the communication unit 301 ′.
- the transceiver 403 is composed of at least one transmitter/receiver but may, as depicted, be comprised of one or more WAN transceivers 411 (one shown) and one or more additional wireless LAN transceivers 409 (one shown).
- one transmitter/receiver 411 is for communicating over a wide area network (WAN) (second wireless communication network) while another transmitter/receiver 409 is for communicating over a wireless LAN (first wireless communication network).
- WAN wide area network
- second wireless communication network second wireless communication network
- a wireless LAN first wireless communication network
- nc 123 could be used to form nc123@wlan.net for example and thus provide an address for network controller 123 .
- the information can be an index that when followed to a table of, for example, addresses, phone numbers, or the like allows an appropriate one, e.g. one pointing to the enterprise controller to be selected by the controller.
- connection from the wireless communication unit via an access point 315 is a packet data connection and the connection from the peer communication unit will depend on the particulars for the peer unit. For example if the peer communication unit is another static or wireless communication unit within the WLAN or LAN (not shown) the connection will also be a packet data based connection, while if the peer unit is an ordinary phone, such as POTS 133 , or from a wireless communication unit 301 ′, outside the LAN or WLAN 304 the connection to/from the wireless LAN is often a circuit switched voice connection.
- the server 509 is included and operates as a memory associated with the controller 505 or mobility manager 507 for storing a look up table of information suitable for facilitating hand over of calls as will be discussed below.
- the server 509 may be a separate entity and available to multiple network controllers in an enterprise or be part of the mobility manager or each call controller.
- the switching function 503 , call controller 505 , mobility manager 507 , and server 509 are all inter coupled or networked via the LAN as depicted. Note that one or more or all of these entities may be co-located in one or more common computing platforms according to the practitioner's desires and thus may be viewed as largely logically distinct entities.
- FIG. 7 generally depicts an approach of providing a unique network controller for a target communication unit 131 . It is further noted that not all of the approaches discussed below are compatible with all of the approaches noted above, however one of ordinary skill will appreciate this given the discussions herein.
- Providing a unique network controller for a target communication unit is not always straightforward since originating unit 129 can not always determine the unique network controller (e.g. controlling network controller or contact network controller) for the target. This network controller will alternately be referred to as the target's handover PBX.
- One solution is to make all calls to the target's enterprise number, when calling from the PSTN.
- the call will then be routed to the target's home PBX or network controller C 123 .
- Calls from the WLAN would have to be made to ⁇ tel:enterprise number> using SIP constructs and this would force the originating PBX to route the call to the target's home PBX, likely via the PSTN, although this can be expensive.
- FIG. 7 Another approach specifically depicted in FIG. 7 relies on provisioning or programming the target communication unit with a network address and phone number that will be used by the target unit for setting up any call handovers.
- the target CU is provisioned or programmed with an enterprise network address (IP address or URI) and an external PSTN number that terminate on the same PBX, e.g. defines the unique network controller for effecting handovers for the target unit.
- IP address or URI enterprise network address
- PBX e.g. defines the unique network controller for effecting handovers for the target unit.
- the CU will use the address/number to request handover of any call for which it is the target.
- the originating and target CUs can use other PBXs for call setup requests.
- the enterprise infrastructure e.g. all of the network controllers are configured and arranged or programmed to determine which predetermined PBX or unique network controller will be used for handover requests by the target CU 131 (database lookup, derive from CU enterprise or PSTN number of the target, etc.).
- a network controller such as network controller A 119 or PBX receives a call setup request 703 for that target CU 131
- the receiving network controller can route 705 the setup request to the unique or predetermined network controller, such as B 121 for the originating CU 1 129 .
- the unique network controller B 121 can then determine the predetermined handover network controller or PBX of the target CU and, if it is not the network controller B or PBX itself, the network controller B can route 707 the call setup request to the target handover PBX, such as home network controller 123 or the visited network controller 125 for the target CU. If the home network controller C is not the unique or predetermined network controller the home network controller for the target CU can forward 709 the setup request to the visited network controller D. Alternatively the receiving network controller A 119 can determine the predetermined handover network controller or PBX of the target CU and, if it is not the receiving network controller or PBX itself, the receiving network controller can route the call setup request to the target handover PBX.
- the target CU's handover PBX shown as the visited network controller D 125 will be involved in the call and can do a handover, i.e. after the target CU moves to cellular 713 and if so requested later by the target CU 717 .
- the handover PBX of a target will likely be the target CU's home PBX or the PBX of its visited enterprise site. In the later case, each CU must be provisioned when it enters the WLAN of the visited site with its target handover PBX information.
- a variation allows the target CU to automate the forwarding of the setup request to a predefined PBX, so that the requesting PBX does not need to go to an additional database.
- Normally a CU would register contacts into the SIP registrar 127 that are of the form:
- the receiving PBX does not route the setup request to the predetermined handover PBX of the target, but sets up the call itself and informs the target's handover PBX of the start and the end of the call and of its own identity, so that the handover PBX can later contact the receiving PBX.
- the predetermined handover PBX forwards the request to the PBX that is controlling the call.
- FIG. 8 a flow chart of a method embodiment of call routing in an enterprise network to facilitate a hand over of the call will be discussed and described. Note that this method can be practiced using the communication units, network controllers, etc discussed above or other similar apparatus with similar functionality. None-the-less much of this discussion will as required reference the above figures and will be provided in an overview form in order to avoid undue duplication of some of the above discussions and descriptions.
- FIG. 8 shows a method in a wireless communication unit or similar device, where the method is directed to routing a call that is being originated to facilitate a subsequent handover. The method begins at 801 and then at 803 receiving at a network controller a call setup request from a call originating unit for a call to a call target unit is shown.
- the call is setup such that the unique network controller is aware of the call.
- Various approaches are depicted.
- One approach shows at 809 setting up the call at the network controller that received the call request or some network controller other than the unique network controller.
- the method notifies the unique network controller when the call is being setup by the network controller at 809 as well as when the call ends. This notification will need to include identification information, such as a network address and the like of the network controller that is handling the call setup.
- the unique network controller will be informed of the call setup and since it is the controller that will receive any handover requests 813 it can send and the network controller handling the call can receive a request for the handover of the call from the unique network controller and thus handle the handover setup 815 .
- the call request can be forwarded to the unique network controller for setting up the call.
- the unique network controller may receive any handover requests and handle or setup such handover requests 823 .
- the method ends at 817 but may repeat as necessary.
- the receiving the call request can include receiving at a first visited network controller the call setup request from a wireless communication unit that is visiting an enterprise site managed by the first visited network controller; and the determining the unique network controller can result in, for example determining a first home network controller associated with the wireless communication unit and forwarding the call setup request to the first home network controller associated with the wireless communication unit for setting up the call.
- the determination of the unique network controller may comprise determining a second visited network controller for another enterprise site managed by the second visited network controller where the target wireless communication unit is operating and forwarding the call setup request to the second visited network controller for setting up the call.
Abstract
Description
- Contact: <tel:target_phone_numer>and/or
- <sip: target_name@target_host_address>
Instead, for this variation, the target will use contacts of the form: - Contact: <sip: tel:target_phone_numer@predefined_handover_PBX_address>and/or
- <sip: target_name %40target_host_address@predefined_handover_PBX_address>.
This will result in the routing of each SIP INVITE to the target CU via the predefined PBX. That PBX then removes its host name ‘predefined_handover_PBX_address’, replaces the ‘%40’ with a ‘@’ or a ‘:’ as appropriate and sets up the call to the remaining URI.
-
- The moving CU puts the peer on the old side of the ongoing call on Hold (if the CU is in cellular, this can done using Supplementary Services, in the WLAN it can use SIP). This results in a call leg that is being held by the infrastructure (cellular switch, PBX, or PSTN switch).
- The CU initiates a new call from the old side to itself on the new side (if the CU is in cellular, it dials its enterprise number, if it is in the WLAN, it requests a call to its cellular number.
- After the new call connects, the CU requests, via the old side that the held leg be transferred to the new call. (In cellular this is called an Explicit Call Transfer. It is standardized in GSM 04.91. In the WLAN, the CU uses the SIP REFER method).
- The CU now connects its audio to the new leg. The end-user will be talking to the peer via the new side.
- If needed, the CU can tear down the call on the old side (ECT will tear it down automatically).
