Detailed Description
The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for determining a complete product response and a related product response for a content item. The attribution model (attribution model) may be used to measure the impact of presentation of one or more content items on one or more resources (e.g., web pages, mobile applications, video, smart assistants). In some embodiments, the third party attribution model may attribute a single product to a single content item, but not an associated product or a hybrid product (e.g., more than a single product) to a single content item. That is, the attribution model may be trained to attribute credits (or attribution values) to content providers when product responses occur for individual products associated with individual content items. However, content items associated with different products that provide user responses may not be attributed (e.g., discarded and/or ignored) even though they may be related (e.g., headset responses after selection of content items associated with the phone). Furthermore, a hybrid response comprising multiple products may be underestimated or overestimated based on content items of a single product. Accordingly, the systems and methods described herein relate to accurately attributing related and hybrid product responses based on user interactions with content items.
In many systems, content providers may develop active recommendations (initiative) in which they frequently employ content items associated with an entity's products between content networks. The attribution model may be used to estimate the effect of the content item on the response (e.g., based on causality (causation)). However, when receiving a product response from a different product than the product associated with the content item, it is challenging to accurately assign attribution credits to the content item based on the different product. Thus, attribution of related products or mixed product bundles (bundles) such that attribution credits may be accurately allocated without underestimating, overestimating, or not evaluating the ability of responses provides an attribution model with enhanced performance and efficiency while reducing the amount of responses that are not evaluated. This causal approach allows the attribution model to provide significant improvements to the predictions, resulting in improved accuracy of the predictions and performance of the attribution model, enabling content providers to make informed decisions about their active recommendations. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure address problems in attribution modeling architecture by designing an attribution model that utilizes a correlation graph (RELATEDNESS GRAPH) to generate a correlation index for use in assigning attribution credits to content providers of content items.
Accordingly, the present disclosure includes systems and methods for determining relevant product responses and complete product responses from user interactions with content items. In some implementations, the described systems and methods relate to utilizing a correlation graph. The correlation graph may be represented by a series of vectors between nodes (e.g., products), each vector having its own correlation weights, which may be aggregated and normalized to establish a correlation index between two or more nodes. In various embodiments, the weight of the correlation may be based on a number of factors, such as, but not limited to, computational linguistics and probabilities, taxonomies, product data, user customizations, behavioral data, financial data, and the like. Further, the relevance index may be used to calculate attribution credits for relevant product responses and complete product responses. Thus, the systems and methods described herein enable attribution models to improve the accuracy of predictions without discarding and/or evaluating portions of mixed product bundles of different products or products associated with content items that may be relevant. In particular, the solution provides a significant improvement to the attribution modeling architecture that calculates attribution credits for a response. In some implementations, the attribution model may also update and/or modify attribution credits for the relevant product response and the complete product response after the entity provides the attribution credits to users of the relevant product response and the complete product response.
Furthermore, by using an improved attribution modeling architecture, aspects of the solution can reduce the amount of data discarded, which is a significant improvement over other attribution modeling architectures. That is, by using a correlation map, the solution may provide an accurate estimate of the relevant product response and the complete product response without transmitting queries and/or requests for protected information or private information (e.g., financial information, internet history, identifiers, etc.) of users and/or entities to determine the impact of content items on the user response. This protects not only the attribution model and the databases associated with them from exposing the protected or private information of the users and/or entities, but also protects the client devices from exposing their protected or private information, which is a significant improvement in the security of the networked system.
Where the systems discussed herein collect or may utilize personal information about a user and/or entity, the user and/or entity is provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information and/or entity information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user's preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user and/or entity. Additionally, or alternatively, certain data may be processed in one or more ways such that personally identifiable information is removed prior to storage or use thereof. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be summarized as where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user and/or entity may control how the content server gathers and uses information about the user and/or entity.
Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of an analysis system 110 and associated environment 100 is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. One or more user devices 140 (e.g., smart phones, tablets, computers, etc.) may be used by the user to perform various actions and/or access various types of content, some of which may be provided over a network 130 (e.g., the internet, LAN, WAN, etc.). As used herein, a "user" or "entity" may refer to an individual operating the user device 140, interacting with a resource or content item via the user device 140, or the like. The user device 140 may be used to send data to the analysis system 110, or may be used to access websites (e.g., using an internet browser), access mobile applications, access videos (e.g., television, live streaming), media files, communicate with a smart assistant, and/or any other type of content. In some implementations, the user device 140 has enabled location services that may be tracked through the network 130. The location service may use GPS or other technology to determine the location of the user device 140.
The content provider device 150 may specify an input (e.g., a spending amount), a set of one or more content items (e.g., some or all items associated with an activity that includes a product), and one or more product listings associated with one or more third parties. The analysis system 110 may be configured to generate a correlation map based on information received from the content provider device 150 and/or with other information from other devices/systems described herein.
The content management system 170 may be configured to select content for display to a user within a resource (e.g., web page, mobile application (e.g., google Chrome, google clip, google Pay), video (e.g., video on YouTube, google Play), etc.), and provide content items to the user device 140 over the network 130 for display within the resource. The content from which the content management system 170 selects items may be provided by one or more content providers using one or more content provider devices 150 via the network 130. In some implementations, the content management system 170 can select (e.g., via a website, mobile application, and/or video, etc.) content items from the content provider device 150 to be displayed on the user device 140. In such an embodiment, the content management system 170 may determine content to publish in one or more content interfaces of a resource (e.g., web page, mobile application, video, etc.).
The content management system 170 may be communicatively and operatively coupled to a content database 172, and the content database 172 may be configured to store various information related to content items and content item slots. For example, information may be received from analysis system 110, user device 140, content provider device 150, and/or data source 160. The content management system 170 may be configured to query the content database 172 for information and store the information in the content database 172. In various embodiments, content database 172 includes various transitory and/or non-transitory storage media. The storage medium may include, but is not limited to, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, flash memory, RAM, and the like. The content database 172 and/or the content management system 170 may use various APIs to perform database functions (i.e., manage data stored in the content items 174). The API may be, but is not limited to SQL, noSQL, newSQL, ODBC, JDBC, etc.
The third party system 180 may be a computing device associated with an entity that provides input (e.g., content spending) to the content provider device 150 in an attempt to receive responses associated with one or more products of the entity. Third party system 180 may be an internet commerce system (or "e-commerce system", for example, business-to-business (B2B), business-to-customer (B2C), customer-to-customer (C2C), or customer-to-business (C2B)), configured to provide an interface (e.g., a Graphical User Interface (GUI)) to user device 140 via a website (e.g., using an internet browser), via a mobile application (e.g., google Chrome, google Maps, gmail), via video (e.g., television, live streaming), via a smart Assistant (e.g., google onstate)). In some embodiments, the third party system 180 may host the custom interface at a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) by a host device (e.g., a computing device), as well as host a collection of files defining the custom interface and stored on the host device (e.g., in a database). Each third party system may host one or more websites, mobile applications, or a combination of videos that may present digital content.
In various embodiments, the third party system 180 may host the custom interface on a mobile application stored on the user device 140 and downloaded in the application store. As such, each third party system (e.g., 180) may include a shopping experience for the user. The user may be redirected to provide a response (e.g., purchase of a product or service) based on selecting a content item in a content item slot hosted by the content provider device 150 and/or the content management system 170. For example, after selecting a content item, a mobile application on the user device may present a response opportunity to the customer. In another example, upon selection of a content item in the video, the user device may be redirected to a website of the third party system to complete the response. Redirection (e.g., based on clicking or selection) may include interaction data associated with the content item. The interaction data may be delivered or provided to the third party system 180 as a packet of data, and any additional interactions on the third party system 180 may also be recorded and stored as a packet of interaction data. In some embodiments, after the product response, packets of interaction data including the product response and the activity log may be sent to the analysis system 110 for analysis (e.g., to determine a relevant product response and/or a complete product response). Further, the analytics system 110 and the third party system 180 may be communicatively coupled using various APIs to exchange data (i.e., manage product responses and interaction data stored in the analytics database 120). The API may be, but is not limited to SQL, noSQL, newSQL, ODBC, JDBC, etc.
The analysis system 110 may be used by the content provider device 150 to attempt to quantify the impact (e.g., input, response) of the content item. Analysis system 110 may include one or more processors (e.g., any general-purpose or special-purpose processor) and may include and/or be operably coupled to one or more temporary and/or non-temporary storage media and/or memory devices (e.g., any computer-readable storage media such as magnetic storage, optical storage, flash memory, RAM, etc.). In various embodiments, the analysis system 110 and the content management system 170 may be implemented as separate systems or integrated within a single system (e.g., the content management system 170 may be configured to combine some or all of the functions/capabilities of the analysis system 110). The analytics system 110 may be configured to communicate over the network 130 via various architectures (e.g., client/server architecture, peer-to-peer architecture, etc.). The analysis system 110 may be configured to provide various interfaces for analyzing attribution credits, monitoring product responses, and performing pingback corrections.
The analysis system 110 may be communicatively and operatively coupled to an analysis database 120, and the analysis database 120 may be configured to store various information related to the determined correlations and attribution credits performed by the analysis system 110. For example, information may be received from user device 140, content provider device 150, data source 160, and/or content management system 170. Analysis system 110 may be configured to query analysis database 120 for information and store the information in analysis database 120. In various embodiments, analysis database 120 includes various transitory and/or non-transitory storage media. The storage medium may include, but is not limited to, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, flash memory, RAM, and the like. Analysis database 120 and/or analysis system 110 may use various APIs to perform database functions (i.e., manage data stored in analysis database 120). The API may be, but is not limited to SQL, noSQL, newSQL, ODBC, JDBC, etc.
In some implementations, the third party system 180 can transmit the response of the product and provide information (e.g., interaction data) about the response and/or the product, which can be stored in the analytics database 120 (e.g., interaction data set 122). Further, the analytics system 110 may be configured to retrieve data (e.g., user activity data, content activity data, etc.) via the network 130, which may be stored in the interaction data set 122 of the analytics database 120. In various implementations, the interaction dataset 122 may include interactions (such as, but not limited to, last click, last view, play (playthrough), history data, etc.), product response information, content item information (such as, but not limited to, associated products, placements, arrangements, timing information, etc.), product identifiers, purchase information (such as, but not limited to, customer financial information, purchase prices, discounts, etc.), user information (such as, but not limited to, browser information, user device data, operating system, history information, user identifiers, etc.), third party information, content provider information, virtual assistant information (such as, but not limited to questions, user voice data, settings, notifications, etc.).
Analysis system 110 may be configured to communicate with any device or system shown in environment 100 via network 130. Analysis system 110 may be configured to receive information from network 130. The information may include browsing history, cookie logs, television content data, printed publication content data, broadcast content data, and/or online content campaign data. The analysis system 110 may also be configured to receive and/or collect interactions of the user device 140 over the network 130. This information may be stored as content data in the interaction data set 122.
The data sources 160 may include data collected by the analytics system 110 by receiving interaction data from the content provider device 150, the user device 140, and/or the third party system 180. The data may be content input (e.g., content spending), content response (e.g., content revenue), product response (e.g., product purchase) at one or more points in time for a particular media channel (e.g., television, internet content, broadcast, billboard, printed publication). The content input may include costs (e.g., search content costs or display content costs, etc.) on television content, billboard content, internet content. The data may be data input by a particular entity or user (e.g., patient, customer purchase, internet content item) at one or more points in time. The content input may include data associated with a plurality of entities, a plurality of users, a particular entity, a particular user, and the like. The data sources 160 may also include various data aggregation systems and/or entities that collect content data. Analysis system 110 may receive product response data from data sources 160 via network 130. This information may be stored as product response data in interaction data set 122.
The analysis system 110 may be configured to send information and/or notifications to the content provider device 150 regarding the various metrics (e.g., predictions) or models that it determines, generates, or fits. This may allow a user of one of the content provider devices 150 to view various metrics or models determined by the analysis system 110. In addition, the analysis system 110 may use various metrics to identify a favorable opportunity to contact the user or an appropriate amount of input (e.g., best mixed media input) on various media channels (e.g., television advertisements, internet advertisements, broadcast advertisements, etc.). The analysis system 110 may cause a message to be sent to the content management system 170 and/or the content provider device 150 to indicate that the content management system 170 should contact a particular user at a particular time and/or a content campaign operator having particular parameters.
The analysis system 110 may include one or more systems (i.e., computer readable instructions executable by a processor) and/or circuitry (i.e., ASIC, processor memory combinations, logic circuits, etc.) configured to perform various functions of the analysis system 110. In some implementations, the system may be or include a credit scoring system 112, a pingback system 114, a modeler 116, and a data manager 118. It should be understood that the various embodiments may include more, fewer, or different systems than shown in fig. 1, and all such modifications are considered to be within the scope of the present disclosure.
The data manager 118 may be configured to generate various data structures stored in the analytics database 120. For example, the data manager 118 may be configured to generate a dependency graph. In some implementations, the correlation graph may be represented by a series of vectors between nodes, each vector having its own correlation weight (sometimes referred to herein as a "correlation index"). For example, one node may be a pair of headphones associated with company X, another node may be a telephone associated with company X, and yet another node may be a smart speaker associated with company Y. In particular, the correlation graph may be a data structure included in the correlation data set 124 and indicates various relationships between items and/or products of one or more third parties. For example, a relevance graph may include a plurality of products associated with a plurality of third parties, which may include relevance indices between various nodes (e.g., items and/or products) within the relevance graph. The relevance graph may be generated by the data manager 118 based on receiving and collecting data from multiple sources to determine relevance between one or more items and/or products. In various implementations, the plurality of sources may include, but are not limited to, data sources 160 (e.g., n-grams based on product descriptions (sometimes referred to as "Ngrams"), n-grams based on third party (or merchant) descriptions, n-grams based on comments, articles and other collected public/private data, financial institutions), user devices 140 (e.g., user customization, user co-response behavior, purchase history), content provider devices 150, third party systems 180, and so forth. In some implementations, the data manager 118 can continuously update the correlation graph in real-time based on receiving and collecting data from multiple sources. Further, new and/or additional data sources (e.g., new n-gram data, additional user data, additional interaction data) may be used to update the dependency graph (e.g., update the dependency index, add new products, and determine dependencies with other products in the dependency graph, etc.) on a continuous basis (e.g., autonomously, after scanning the new/additional sources).
The data manager 118 may also be configured to receive a plurality of product responses from the plurality of user devices 140, the content provider device 150, the data source 160, and/or the third party system 180. For example, after a customer completes a purchase (e.g., a product response) at the online store of seller J (e.g., third party system 180), the data manager 118 may receive a product response that includes interaction data indicating user interactions with the content item of the particular product. In another example, upon a customer of the service provider K (e.g., 180) initiating a service (e.g., streaming service, investment service, tutorial service, etc.), the data manager 118 may receive a product response that includes interaction data indicating user interactions with content items of a particular service. In yet another example, after the customer completes the transaction personally at company L, data manager 118 may receive a product response that includes interaction data indicative of the transaction. However, in the examples below, the data manager 118 may infer content items with which the user interacted based on various other interaction data (e.g., user device data, financial information, content provider information, etc.).
The data manager 118 may be configured to receive interaction data (e.g., stored in the interaction data set 122). In some embodiments, the data manager 118 may be configured to receive interaction data from the plurality of responses from the third party system 180, the user device 140, and/or the content provider device 150, rather than data specific to a particular customer. In addition, to protect specific customer information, the interaction data may be stripped and/or anonymized by the data manager 118 to remove the customer's identifying information. In various embodiments, the received data received by the data manager 118 may be aggregated data by the analytics system 110 and/or data received by the analytics system 110 from the data source 160.
The data manager 118 may also be configured to communicate with the content management system 170 via the network 130 to determine a set of one or more content items associated with a content provider to be analyzed after receiving the product response. Further, the data manager 118 may be configured to determine one or more characteristics associated with one or more content items. The characteristics may include associated keywords used in the search query, website views, video views (e.g., via YouTube), content views, content clicks, mobile application views (e.g., via Google Chrome, google Maps, gmail), and so forth. For example, the data manager 118 may be configured to determine (e.g., via an activity ID or other identifier) a content item associated with a content activity of the new restaurant. In this example, the data manager 118 may also determine that a set of content items is presented based on a set of target keywords (e.g., restaurants, new restaurants, restaurants in a geographic location, etc.). The data manager 118 may also be configured to initiate a change in the input level associated with the collection of content items based on the modeler 116 analyzing the product response.
The data manager 118 may also be configured to retrieve and analyze user interaction data, including actions performed by the user device 140 over the network 130. In some implementations, the data manager 118 retrieves interaction data and creates an activity log having one or more log entries. The activity log may span any specified period of time (e.g., a month in the past, a week in the past, etc.), and may be unique to the user based on any constraint (e.g., a user in los angeles, an android user in boston, a user with a product response to a pair of headphones, etc.). The data manager 118 may be configured to use the filtered activity log to determine a subset of users (i.e., a subset of users associated with the original activity log). The subset of users may be users that are likely to be exposed to the content item being analyzed. Further, the data manager 118 may be configured to retrieve user activity data related to a response indicator (e.g., a product response).
The interaction data set 122 may include a subset of data, each of which includes response data, content input data (e.g., input data), content type, control variable, and/or provider identifier associated with the content item. The data may be data for one or more points in time over an interval (e.g., data for each hour of the day, data for each day of the year, data for each month of the decade, etc.). The content type may indicate a particular media channel of the collection of data, such as television, radio, internet content, newspaper or magazine content, etc. The response data may be the result of an action associated with the input data. That is, the response data may indicate (e.g., one or more products) a particular revenue amount at a particular time. In some embodiments, the response is one or more conversions, one or more sales, one or more purchases, one or more account registrations, one or more subscriptions, one or more product activations, and the like. The input data may indicate a particular amount of content input (e.g., legal currency) for the content type at a particular time. The input data may also indicate the number of content runs. The interaction data set 122 may include a time-series data structure that indicates the amount of input data, response data over time for various media channels and/or various geographic areas.
The modeler 116 may be configured to determine the relevant product response and the complete product response based on the attribution model. In general, the attribution model may be configured to determine relevance of a product response based on summing weights of a degree metric between a first node (e.g., product a associated with the product response) and a second node (e.g., product B associated with the content item) and normalizing the summed weights to generate a relevance index. As described above, the data manager 118 may be configured to maintain a dependency graph stored in the dependency data set 124. Modeler 116 may utilize the correlation map to subsequently determine how correlated one product is to another product such that correlations may be calculated and potential attribution credits may be awarded (e.g., by credit scoring system 112). In some embodiments, the attribution model may be a trained model stored in the analytics database 120, and may provide output predictions (e.g., relevance index) based on input variables (e.g., products of the product response). Further, the attribution model may quantify the relevance of particular product responses to content items presented to the user (e.g., across media channels). This causal approach allows the attribution model to provide significant improvements in the prediction of product response relevance, such that the accuracy of the attribution model's predictions and the allocation of attribution credits are improved, and as a result, content providers are enabled to make informed decisions about their active recommendations. In some implementations, one or more machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, linear regression models, sparse vector machines, or any other algorithm known to one of ordinary skill in the art) may be utilized to infer input data, response data.
The modeler 116 may also be configured to identify trends in product responses based on analysis of interaction data and historical interaction data of previous product responses. That is, each product response may be compared to an associated attribution credit, historical product responses may be tracked, and trends (or patterns) over time may be established. Trend and pattern recognition operations may be performed to identify trends and/or patterns in various product responses. In particular, based on evaluating the product responses and/or other interaction data in the interaction data set 122, the one or more processing circuits of the modeler 116 may identify trends and/or patterns (e.g., linear, exponential, seasonal, random, damping window, stationary, AI, and/or cyclical trends and/or patterns) of various products, content items, and/or product responses. In some embodiments, the data manager 118 may update the correlation graph based on identifying trends in the product responses. That is, in response to analyzing the historical product responses and/or receiving the product responses, the content management system 170 may be notified to update content item slots (e.g., website content item slots, video content item slots, mobile application content item slots, etc.) of the content items. For example, multiple users may have recently responded to (e.g., purchased) a newly released television model. In the following example, modeler 116 may determine a trend indicating that a newly released television model was purchased more than a previously released television model, and may provide an indication to content management system 170 to update the content item slots with content items associated with the newly released television model. In some implementations, the modeler 116 may directly update the content item slots based on retrieving or generating content items for presentation (from the content item 174). In addition, the data manager 118 may also update the dependency graph including newly released television models and/or update weights between previously released television model nodes and other nodes in the dependency graph (e.g., reduce dependencies, remove edges, etc.).
Using the correlation map, the modeler 116 may attribute one or more product responses of a first product to content items in a content campaign associated with a second product that may be relevant. In addition, the modeler may further attribute one or more product responses of the first product and the second product to content items in a content campaign associated with the second product to capture a complete product response. In some embodiments, modeler 116 may also attribute the response to related products for which modeler 116 otherwise has no response indicators. In some implementations, the modeler 116 may combine the correlation graphs to determine a combined correlation index. For example, for particular content items displayed on different resources, a relevance index may be determined based on a combination of interactions associated with multiple content items, and attribution credits may be divided (e.g., equally, weighted, etc.) based on a number of combinations of interactions. Furthermore, as described in more detail above, the modeler 116 may be used to adjust content activities of content providers. For example, based on the relevance index, a cost per action (cost per action) index may be adjusted for content items in the content campaign. The cost per action indicator generally represents the cost of the content provider to obtain the response (or conversion). By adjusting the cost per action indicator, the content provider may choose to offer more or less payment for the content item for display on the resource, thereby adjusting the parameters of the content provider's content campaign. In other words, the content provider (e.g., 150) may adjust its policy for providing various content items in the content campaign based on a more accurate representation of the performance of the product response.
In another example, multiple users may have not responded to the smartphone for an extended period of time (e.g., 7 days, 1 month, etc.). In the following example, modeler 116 may determine a trend indicative of smart phone outages, and content item slots may be updated (e.g., by modeler 116 and/or content management system 170) and a correlation graph may be updated (e.g., by data manager 118). In yet another example, multiple users may have responded to content items associated with a dryer, but purchased a washing machine. In the following example, modeler 116 may determine that more washing machines than dryers are purchased, and may update the content items in the content item slots to include the washing machines, and may update the relevance graph (e.g., modify weights, add nodes, etc.).
The credit scoring system (CREDITING SYSTEM) 112 may be configured to calculate an attribution credit for each of the plurality of product responses based on the relevance index generated by the modeler 116. In other words, the credit scoring system 112 may be configured to score the relevant responses and the complete product responses (e.g., the overall shopping cart value) so that accurate credits may be provided to the content provider (e.g., 150). In some embodiments, attribution credits may be calculated differently based on the relevance index (e.g., more relevant may be equal to higher credits and less relevant may be equal to lower credits). In particular, the computation may utilize various mathematical operations (e.g., algebra, calculus, boolean algebra) configured by one or more of the systems described herein such that the attribution credits may be unique to a particular entity, user, and/or content provider. For example, entity X may have a higher threshold (e.g., a correlation greater than 0.70) and calculate attribution credits using equation X (e.g., a correlation index X (100 ++edge) =attribution credits), while entity Y may have a lower threshold (e.g., a correlation greater than 0.50) and calculate attribution credits using equation Y (e.g., a correlation index X100 (if a correlation index > 0.90), a correlation index X75 (if a correlation index > 0.80), or a correlation index X50 (if a correlation index < 0.80) =attribution credits). As shown, each attribution credit calculation may be unique such that the credit scoring system 112 may utilize different calculations based on the entity, user, and/or content provider.
The pingback system 114 may be configured to receive pingback corrections from the user device 140, the content provider device 150 and/or the third party system 180 all over the network 130. The pingback correction may include a returned product response based on the returned (remittance) product (e.g., return, refund, replacement, recall, etc.). In some embodiments, after attribution credits are assigned to content provider device 150, the pingback system 114 may establish a communication channel with user device 140, content provider device 150, data source 160, and/or third party system 180 (e.g., a card provider entity including, for example, a financial institution and/or credit card entity) to receive the pingback correction. The established communication channel may be over the network 130 and may be established for a particular time (e.g., 30 days, 3 months, 3 years, etc.). The facility for communication may be implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API) (e.g., REST API, web API, custom API), batch file, and/or query. In various arrangements, the pingback system 114 may also be configured to control access to resources of the user device 140, the content provider device 150, the data source 160, and/or the third party system 180. Further, the pingback system 114 may receive the pingback correction over the network 130 via the API, and the pingback system 114 may update the assigned attribution credit associated with the product response of the returned product. In various embodiments, the updated attribution credit may reevaluate the attribution credit as if the product was not responded to. In some embodiments, the data manager 118 may also update the interaction data set 122 (e.g., historical data) and the dependency data set 124 (e.g., dependency graph) based on the pingback correction. For example, attribution credits may be reduced since the impact of content items responded with one or more products may be less influential. Furthermore, modeler 116 may retrain the attribution model stored in analytics database 120 based on the pingback correction.
Referring now to FIG. 2, a flowchart of a method 200 of determining a relevant product response is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The analysis system 110 and the associated environment 100 may be configured to perform the method 200. Further, any of the computing devices described herein may be configured to perform the method 200.
In an overview of the method 200, at block 210, one or more processing circuits may receive a product response for a first product. At block 220, the one or more processing circuits may identify a correlation map. At block 230, the one or more processing circuits may aggregate the weights of the degree measures of correlation. At block 240, the one or more processing circuits may generate a relevance index. At block 250, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a attribution credit. At block 260, the one or more processing circuits may provide attribution credits to the content provider. Additional, fewer, or different operations may be performed depending on the particular arrangement. In some arrangements, some or all of the operations of method 200 may be performed by one or more processors executing on one or more computing devices, systems, or servers. In various arrangements, each operation may be reordered, added, removed, or repeated.
Referring in more detail to the method 200, at block 210, one or more processing circuits may receive a product response (e.g., an event) for a first product, the product response including interaction data indicating a user interaction with a content item of a second product, wherein the content item is associated with a content provider. In some embodiments, the product response may be received by the data manager 118 from a third party system (e.g., third party system 180) over the network 130. For example, after purchasing an HDMI cable television from a third party system, the third party system (e.g., website, in-store, mobile application, phone call, etc.) may provide interaction data (e.g., purchase information, user information, content item information) to the data manager 118. In various embodiments, the interaction data may be associated with a product response (or event) that may indicate purchase of a product and/or service. The purchase may be linked to the content item based on information collected during the shopping experience (e.g., click on the content item, play information, last click, search information, etc.). In particular, the content item is an advertisement in a content item slot associated with a second product (e.g., a smart television).
At block 220, the one or more processing circuits may identify a correlation graph for a plurality of products. In various embodiments, the correlation map may be stored in the correlation data set 124 and may be generated and/or updated by the data manager 118 based on receiving additional interaction data and analyzing the interaction data set 122. In particular, the generation and updating of the correlation graph may include modifying the weights of the degree metric between two nodes. Each node in the relevance graph (e.g., associated with a product of the plurality of products) may be related to one or more nodes based on the weight of the degree metric. Additional details regarding the correlation diagram are described in detail with reference to fig. 4. Further, multiple relevance maps may be stored in relevance dataset 124, and each map may be associated with a particular entity (e.g., company a), a group of entities (e.g., company a and company B), an entity type (e.g., hardware, technology, venues, etc.), a product type (e.g., telephone, television, clothing, etc.), and/or any characteristics of multiple products, but are not limited thereto.
At blocks 230 and 240, the one or more processing circuits may aggregate weights of the degree measures of relevance of the first node of the first product to the second node of the second product in the relevance graph and generate a relevance index based on normalizing the aggregate of the weights of the degree measures. In some embodiments, a path between the first node and the second node is determined based on the modeler 116 traversing the entire correlation graph from the first node associated with the first product. The traversal of the entire relevance graph may be based on a traversal algorithm (e.g., breadth First Search (BFS), depth First Search (DFS)), which may determine a best path between a first product (e.g., a first node) and a second product (e.g., a second node), where the best path is the path with the lowest aggregate weight of the degree metrics of relevance. For example, after traversal, the weight of the degree measure of correlation between the first product (node 1) and the second product (node 4) may be (table 1):
Traversing path (node) | Weighting of | Aggregate weight | |
1 | 1,3,7,8,4 | 0.71,0.75,0.23,0.93 | 2.62 |
2 | 1,5,6,4 | 0.19,0.56,0.78 | 1.53 |
3 | 1,9,4 | 0.82,0.56 | 1.38 |
In some embodiments, modeler 116 may aggregate the weights of the degree measures of correlation and normalize the traversal path weights. Normalization may modify the aggregate weights within the natural range to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1.0). For example, modeler 116 may normalize the traversal path weights based on the number of edges traversed (Table 2):
Traversing path (node) | Edge(s) | Normalization (correlation index) | |
1 | 1,3,7,8,4 | 4 | 2.62/4＝0.655 |
2 | 1,5,6,4 | 3 | 1.53/3＝0.51 |
3 | 1,9,4 | 2 | 1.38/2＝0.69 |
As shown above, the correlation index of path 1 may be 0.655, the correlation index of path 2 may be 0.51, and the correlation index of path 3 may be 0.69. Further, the modeler 116 may select a highest correlation index of the plurality of correlation indexes. However, in some implementations, modeler 116 may select a different relevance index (e.g., closest to a value, lowest relevance index, least edges traversed, etc.) based on, but not limited to, user customization, content provider customization, and/or third party customization, or a determination of modeler 116 based on historical data. In some embodiments, normalization may be performed using various normalization techniques, such as, but not limited to, linear scaling, logarithmic scaling, clipping, z-scoring. In various embodiments, modeler 116 may traverse a plurality of relevance graphs associated with the first product and the second product. For example, the correlation graph a may be associated with a particular entity selling a first product and a second product, while the correlation graph B may be associated with multiple entities selling the first product and the second product. In the following example, modeler 116 may traverse the graphs in each of the correlation graphs and select the correlation index having the greatest correlation (e.g., closest to 1.0). In some embodiments, one correlation map may be weighted over another correlation map such that one correlation map may be favored and/or more accurate than another correlation map. In particular, some correlation graphs may be constructed with more information (e.g., with more accurate weights) than another correlation graph, and modeler 116 may weight the correlation graphs accordingly. For example, the correlation map a may be weighted such that each correlation index may be a weight ratio of 1 to 1 (e.g., a calculated correlation index equal to 0.94 will be weighted and will be equal to 0.94), but the correlation map B may be weighted to a weight of 1 to 1/2 (e.g., a calculated correlation index equal to 0.94 will be weighted and will be equal to 0.94/2 or 0.47).
In response to the relevance index exceeding the threshold, the one or more processing circuits may calculate an attribution credit assigned to the product response based on the relevance index and provide the attribution credit to the content provider of the content item at blocks 250 and 260. In some embodiments, the threshold may be based on at least one of a first sensitivity set by the entity, a second sensitivity set by the content provider, the content item, the first product, or the second product. That is, the threshold may be a sensitivity based on one or more factors, and if the relevance index exceeds the threshold, attribution credits may be calculated to attribute the relevant product response to the content item of the content provider. For example, a user may purchase a pair of headphones after interacting (e.g., viewing, selecting) with a content item of a new phone. In the examples below, a user (sometimes referred to herein as a "customer") may purchase a pair of headphones instead of purchasing a phone after being redirected to a third-party website and/or mobile application (e.g., google Shopping, google Play). In this example, the relevance index may be above a threshold (e.g., 0.75>0.5 (threshold)), and the attribution credit may be calculated and provided to the content provider. In some embodiments, the attribution credits may be normalized between two values (e.g., 0-1, 0-10, 0-100) and may be weighted based on the relevance index. For example, attribution credits may be calculated based on responses (e.g., $100, $2500) and relevance indices (e.g., 0.76, 0.32). For example, a related-product response of $100 may be attributed with a credit score of $100x0.76=76 to credit, and a related-product response of $2500 may be attributed with a credit score of $2,500x0.32=800 to credit. In another example, a full product response of $100 (e.g., more than one product) may be scored by credit as $100/0.76= 131.58 due credit (or $100+ (100×0.76) =176 due credit), and a related product response of $2500 may be scored by credit as 2500 due credit because the relevance index is not above the threshold. As shown in the examples below, various calculations (e.g., operations and/or algebra (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide, square, sum), calculus (e.g., derivative), calculation logic (e.g., boolean algebra). In some embodiments, the analysis system 110, the user device 140, the content provider device 150, and/or any other system described herein may be configured to set parameters, configurations, and/or preferences for calculating attribution credits.
In some embodiments, the methods 200 and 300 may further include one or more processing circuits receiving a pingback correction indicating that the product response was sent back (e.g., returned) from the entity computing system associated with the first product. Further, the one or more processing circuits may update attribution credits reflecting the returned product responses and provide the updated attribution credits to the content provider. That is, if the product response is sent back, the one or more processing circuits may correct the previously calculated attribution credit so that attribution credit may also be attributed based on the product being responded to (excluding the returned product).
Using the relevance graph and relevance index in this way allows attribution credits to content items related to one product to be awarded in a simple and computationally efficient manner based on product responses (e.g. purchases) for different products. In particular, it allows relationships between many products to be recorded with their relevance metrics in a way that can be quickly and easily investigated by computationally traversing the graph. This helps to accurately and quickly provide attribution credits for a large number of products that are complex in relation to each other.
In various embodiments, the methods 200 and 300 may also include identifying trends and/or patterns of product responses (e.g., increased product responses to one or more products, increased bundled product responses (e.g., multi-product or full-product), decreased product responses to one or more products, updates to content item slots, increased content input, recent news (e.g., articles, world Health Organization (WHO) reports, epidemic guides, natural disasters, events (e.g., sports, music)), software updates, virtual assistant information (e.g., questions asked, commands of a user), search queries, user clicks, geographic location of one or more users, etc.) based on analyzing the interaction data and historical interaction data of previous product responses (e.g., stored in the interaction data set 122). In particular, in response to identifying the trend, the one or more processing circuits may determine a different content item associated with the first product and modify a content item slot of the content item with the different content item. Alternatively or additionally, in response to identifying the trend, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a new weight of the degree metric between the first node and the second node and update the correlation graph with the new weight of the degree metric between the first node and the second node. Accordingly, the attribution model described herein may continually update and modify the relevance graphs and content item slots based on identifying trends.
Referring now to FIG. 3, a flowchart of a method 300 of determining a complete product response is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The analysis system 110 and the associated environment 100 may be configured to perform the method 300. Further, any of the computing devices described herein may be configured to perform the method 300.
In an overview of the method 300, at block 310, one or more processing circuits may receive product responses for a first product and a second product. At block 320, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a first attribution credit. At block 330, the one or more processing circuits may identify a correlation map. At block 340, the weights of the degree measures of correlation are aggregated. At block 350, one or more processing circuits may generate a relevance index. At block 360, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a second attribution credit. At block 370, the one or more processing circuits may provide the first attribution credit and the second attribution credit to the content provider. Additional, fewer, or different operations may be performed depending on the particular arrangement. In some arrangements, some or all of the operations of method 300 may be performed by one or more processors executing on one or more computing devices, systems, or servers. In various arrangements, each operation may be reordered, added, removed, or repeated.
Referring in more detail to the method 300, at block 310, one or more processing circuits may receive a product response for a first product and a second product, the product response including interaction data indicating a user interaction with a content item of the second product, wherein the content item is associated with a content provider. In some embodiments, the product response may be received by the data manager 118 from a third party system (e.g., third party system 180) over the network 130. For example, after purchasing a dishwasher and warranty from a third-party system (e.g., website, in-store, mobile application), the third-party system may provide interaction data (e.g., purchase information, user information, content item information) to the data manager 118. In various embodiments, the interaction data may be associated with a product response (or event) that may indicate one or more purchases of a plurality of products and/or services. The purchase may be linked to the content item based on information (e.g., activity data) collected during the shopping experience. In particular, the content item is an advertisement in a content item slot associated with a second product (e.g., a dishwasher).
In some embodiments, at block 310, the one or more processing circuits may receive a plurality of product responses associated with at least a first product and a second product over a period of time. The plurality of product responses may include a plurality of interaction data, and the one or more processing circuits may associate the plurality of responses as a bundle based on the similar interaction data. For example, a user may purchase a cell phone from company X at day 3, 14 of 2021 and purchase a charging cable from company X at day 3, 15 of 2021. In the examples below, one or more processing circuits (e.g., analysis system 110) may receive interaction data from two responses (e.g., purchases) and may bundle them based on financial information (e.g., interaction data) used in the responses. In another example, a user may purchase a phone at a store of Y company at day 14, 3, 2021, and purchase cloud services online via a website of Z company, a mobile application of Z company, and/or a smart Assistant (e.g., google assant, smart speaker, etc.) at day 16, 3, 2021. In the examples below, interaction data may be received by one or more processing circuits from both responses, and they may be bundled based on the user having viewed the content item (e.g., interaction data) from their user device. As shown below, the second attribution credit may interpret telephony and cloud services as a complete product response. Further, at block 310, the one or more product responses may include a plurality of products (e.g., 20 products in one response, 10 products between three responses), and the one or more processing circuits may perform the following blocks (320-370) for each of the plurality of products, and/or the following blocks (320-370) for the plurality of products bundled as products.
At block 320, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a first attribution credit assigned to the product response. In various embodiments, the first attribution credit may be based on a product response of a second product (e.g., dishwasher) of the plurality of products in the product response. As shown, the first attribution credit may underestimate (e.g., attributing a dishwasher purchase), overestimate (e.g., attributing an entire purchase price to one product), or not evaluate (e.g., not attributing a warranty purchase) an entire product response (e.g., purchasing more than one product and/or service). In some embodiments, the analysis system 110 (e.g., the credit scoring system 112) may skip calculating the first attribution credit.
At blocks 330, 340, and 350, the one or more processing circuits may identify a relevance graph of the plurality of products, aggregate weights of a degree measure of relevance of a first node of a first product to a second node of a second product in the relevance graph, and generate a relevance index based on normalizing the aggregate of the weights of the degree measure. Blocks 330-350 are similar to similar features and functions described in detail above with reference to blocks 220-240 of fig. 2.
In response to the relevance index exceeding the threshold, the one or more processing circuits may calculate a second attribution credit assigned to the complete product response based on the relevance index and provide the first attribution credit and the second attribution credit to the content provider of the content item at blocks 360 and 370. Blocks 360-370 are similar to similar features and functions described in detail above with reference to blocks 250-260 of fig. 2. However, as shown, instead of assigning attribution credits to content items with which the user interacts (e.g., the first attribution credits), the second attribution credits may be assigned to full product responses (e.g., dishwashers and warranties). In some embodiments, the second attribution credit may be an accurate attribution credit without underestimating, overestimating, or not evaluating the response. As shown, the attribution model may provide enhanced performance and efficiency while reducing the amount of response that is not evaluated. As shown, using the attribution model, the one or more processing circuits may determine a complete product response and attribution credits accordingly without underestimating, overestimating, or not evaluating product responses of a plurality of products related to the products in the content item. For example, if the user interacts with a content item associated with a laptop, but the response also includes a laptop mouse and docking station, the attribution credit may be evaluated so that the purchased additional product (or complete product response) may be accurately credit scored (e.g., attribution credit increased). In another example, if the user interacts with a content item associated with a laptop, but the response also includes a vegetable seed for gardening, the attribution credit may be evaluated such that the purchased additional product (or complete product response) may be accurately credit scored (e.g., the vegetable seed relevance index may not reach a relevance threshold for modifying the attribution credit). However, in the following example, if the user continues to purchase vegetable seeds with the purchase of the laptop, the modeler 116 may update the content item in the content item slot to include the vegetable seeds on the screen of the laptop as an example user interface displayed on the laptop.
Referring now to FIG. 4, an example representation of a correlation graph is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In some implementations, the correlation graph can include a plurality of nodes (e.g., 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470) having a plurality of weight vectors (or degree metrics). For example, product 1 (e.g., 410) may include a correlation vector of 0.65 to product 4 (e.g., 440), 0.78 to product 5 (e.g., 450), 0.35 to product 6 (e.g., 460), and 0.75 to product 7 (e.g., 470). As shown, product 1 may not have a vector to product 2 (e.g., 420), but multiple vectors (e.g., the vector of product 1 to product 5, and the vector of product 5 to product 2) may be aggregated using modeler 116 of the attribution model, and the aggregation normalized to obtain a relevance index. Further, in some embodiments, the relevance vector may have a different relevance index based on direction (e.g., a relevance index from 440 to 420 is 0.80, and a relevance index from 420 to 440 is 0.21). In this example shown, each node may be a product, service, or combination thereof associated with one or more entities, and the relevance vector may indicate a relevance index. Thus, in this particular example, the correlation graph may provide insight into product/product, product/service, and/or service/service relationships. One insight may include a particular relevance of the first product (e.g., 410) to the second product (e.g., 440).
Fig. 5 shows a diagram of a computing system 500, which computing system 500 may be used, for example, to implement illustrative user device 140, illustrative content provider device 150, illustrative analysis system 110, and/or various other illustrative systems described in this disclosure.

Implementations of the subject matter and operations described in this specification can be implemented using digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware embodied on tangible media, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs (i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions) encoded on one or more computer storage media for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or additionally, the program instructions may be encoded on a manually-generated propagated signal (e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal) that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by data processing apparatus. The computer readable storage medium may be or be included in a computer readable storage device, a computer readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Furthermore, while the computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, the computer storage medium may be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. Computer storage media may also be or be included in one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, discs, or other storage devices). Accordingly, computer storage media are both tangible and non-transitory.

A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. The computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Typically, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, the computer need not have such devices. Furthermore, the computer may be embedded in another device, such as a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive), to name a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example: semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disk; CD-ROM and DVD-ROM discs.

The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include local area networks ("LANs") and wide area networks ("WANs"), internetworks (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks, distributed ledger networks).
The computing system may include clients and servers. The client and server are typically remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, the server transmits data (e.g., HTML pages) to the client device (e.g., for the purpose of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., results of the user interaction) may be received at the server from the client device.
