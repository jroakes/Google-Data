- The following detailed description of implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the claims.
- This subject matter described herein relates generally to scheduling a communication between a content provider, such as an online advertiser, and a potential customer of the online advertiser (“user”). Specifically, the methods and systems described herein enable the receiving of at least one content provider availability period associated with at least one online content and of at least one customer availability period from a customer computing device, the determining of at least one communication schedule option based upon the content provider availability period and the customer availability period, the transmitting of at least one communication schedule option to the customer computing device along with the online content, the receiving of a communication selection from the customer computing device, and the transmitting of the communication selection to the content provider.
- At least one content provider availability is received by an online content server from a computer device associated with a content provider. The content provider availability is associated with at least one online content including, for example, at least one online advertisement. The content provider availability represents at least one time period when the content provider is available for a communication with a customer including, for example, a user. The communication may be conducted using a telephone or, alternately, a chat service such as a voice chat service. The content provider availability may include, for example, a list of time intervals when the content provider is available for communication.
- The online content server may additionally receive, from the computer device associated with the content provider, call volumes associated with a plurality of time intervals, non-operational time intervals, and call durations associated with a plurality of time intervals. Such information may be beneficial in determining preferable times for communication with the content provider.
- At least one customer availability period is also received by the online content server from a customer computing device associated with a customer. The customer availability period represents at least one time period when the customer is available for communication with the content provider. The customer availability period may include, for example, a list of time intervals when the customer is available for communication. The customer availability period may be received from a scheduling software including, for example, an online scheduling tool, a file or program at the customer computing device, or scheduling services associated with the customer on the online content server. Along with the customer availability period, a customer contact identifier is received by the online content server from the customer computing device. The customer contact identifier includes at least one of a telephone number and an identifier for a voice chat service.
- Using the content provider availability period and the customer availability period, along with other information such as content provider data (e.g., call volumes associated with a plurality of time intervals, non-operational time intervals, and call durations associated with a plurality of time intervals) and customer data (e.g., customer schedule data and customer preferences), the online content server determines at least one communication schedule option. The at least one communication schedule option represents at least one time interval when communication may be made between a customer and a content provider, considering the respective restrictions in the schedules of each. In cases where multiple communication schedule options are determined, the online content server may additionally determine a preferred schedule option based upon at least one of a customer preference and a content provider preference. The customer preference and the content provider preference may be reflected in the content provider data and the customer data.
- The at least one communication schedule option is transmitted by the online content server to the customer computing device along with the online content. In other words, online content such as an online advertisement is presented with the communication schedule options so that a customer can view time intervals when communication with the content provider may be scheduled. The customer may then select a particular time interval in order to schedule such communication. If the online content server determines a preferred schedule option, the online content server may additionally transmit the preferred schedule option and display the preferred schedule option with an indication such as highlighting, textual indicators, and graphical indicators. The online content server additionally creates a callback extension associated with the online content to display the communication schedule options. The call back extension is a customer module configured to receive customer interaction to associated with the communication selection.
- The online content server receives a communication selection from the customer computing device. The communication selection represents the selection of a time interval by the customer from the communication schedule options. In other words, the customer selects a particular time interval to communicate with the content provider and the selection is transmitted to the online content server. The customer makes the communication selection by interacting with the online content presented to the customer including, for example, clicking on a particular time interval in a schedule.
- The online content server transmits the communication selection to the computing device associated with the content provider. This allows the content provider to schedule the communication and ultimately communicate with the customer. The online content server also receives an acknowledgement from the content provider indicating that the content provider can facilitate the call as scheduled. The online content server transmits a confirmation to the customer computing device indicating that the call has been successfully scheduled. The communication can additionally be facilitated using an automated system. The call or communication between the customer and the content provider may be automatically initiated using such an automated system at the time represented by the communication selection.
- As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the word “a” or “an” should be understood as not excluding plural elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to “one embodiment” of the subject matter disclosed herein are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing one of the following steps: (a) receiving, at the online content server, at least one content provider availability period associated with at least one online content; (b) receiving, at the online content server, at least one customer availability period from a customer computing device; (c) determining, based upon the content provider availability period and the customer availability period, at least one communication schedule option; (d) transmitting the at least one communication schedule option to the customer computing device along with the online content; (e) receiving a communication selection from the customer computing device; (f) transmitting the communication selection to the content provider; (g) receiving an acknowledgement from the content provider; (h) transmitting a confirmation to the customer computing device (i) receiving at least one of call volumes associated with a plurality of time intervals, non-operational time intervals, and call durations associated with a plurality of time intervals; (j) receiving a list of time intervals when the content provider is available for communication; (k) receiving a contact identifier for a customer wherein the contact identifier includes at least one telephone number; (l) receiving a schedule from a customer from a scheduling software stored on at least one of the customer computing device, the online content server, and a scheduling server; (m) automatically initiating a call between the customer and the content provider during the time period associated with the communication selection using an automated phone system; (n) determining, from the at least one communication schedule option, a preferred schedule option based upon at least one of a customer preference and a content provider preference; (o) transmitting the at least one communication schedule option to the customer computing device wherein the preferred schedule option is displayed as a preferred option; (p) receiving a customer interaction associated with the online content items presented to the customer; (q) creating a callback extension associated with the online content, wherein the callback extension represents a customer module configured to receive customer interaction to associated with the communication selection and displaying the callback extension with the online content.

FIG. 3 is anexample process flowchart 300 of scheduling a communication between acontent provider 102 and a customer, such as customer 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ), using the computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ) in the advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ).Flowchart 300 illustratescontent provider 102, via content providerdata processing system 112, andcustomer 154, viacustomer computing device 108, interacting with a content management server,AMS 106, via a content managementdata processing system 116 to schedule communication betweencontent provider 102 andcustomer 154. - In operation,
content provider 102 uses content providerdata processing system 112 to provide a contentprovider availability period 310 toAMS 106 vianetwork 110. Contentprovider availability period 310 represents at least one time period whencontent provider 102 is available for a communication with a customer including, for example,customer 154. The communication may be conducted using a telephone or, alternately, a chat service such as a voice chat service. Contentprovider availability period 310 may include, for example, a list of time intervals whencontent provider 102 is available for communication. The time intervals may be of fixed lengths (e.g., blocks of fifteen minutes) or variable lengths. In some examples, the time intervals may reflect the typical communication duration associated withcontent provider 102. For example, if a typical telephone call with acontent provider 102 is eight minutes, contentprovider availability period 310 may be provided in blocks of eight minutes. Contentprovider availability period 310 is associated with at least oneonline content 335 including, for example, at least one online advertisement.Online content 335 may be sent toAMS 106 vianetwork 110 contemporaneously with contentprovider availability period 310. Alternately,online content 335 may be sent before or after contentprovider availability period 310. Additionally, contentprovider availability period 310 may be updated to reflect changing availability periods forcontent provider 102. Accordingly, contentprovider availability period 310 may be sent multiple times for a particularonline content 335 wherein each new contentprovider availability period 310 replaces a prior version. - Content
provider availability period 310 may additionally be obtained byAMS 106 ifcontent provider 102 participates in a content provider scheduling service (not shown) offered by a system associated withAMS 106. Ifcontent provider 102 participates in the content provider scheduling service,content provider 102 provides communication information for a scheduling server or scheduling data source associated withcontent provider 310. The scheduling server or scheduling data source includes data associated withcontent provider availability 310 and may transmit schedule information to AMS 106 (or a system associated with AMS 106) upon request. In other words,content provider 102 can provide data toAMS 106 in a dynamic fashion by participating in the content provider scheduling service and associating at least one scheduling server with the content provider scheduling service. -
Content provider 102 additionally uses content providerdata processing system 112 to provide a contentprovider communication data 312 toAMS 106 vianetwork 110. Contentprovider communication data 312 may include, for example, preferred times to contactcontent provider 102, contact information associated withcontent provider 102, call volumes associated with a plurality of time intervals, non-operational time intervals, and call durations associated with a plurality of time intervals. Non-operational time intervals represent time periods whencontent provider 102 is unavailable for communication. For example, a non-operational time interval may include the hours in which acontent provider 102 is closed for business. Contentprovider communication data 312 may be beneficial in determining preferable times for communication withcontent provider 102. - Content
provider communication data 312 may also include, for example, typical call durations and hold durations associated with communications. Call durations and hold durations may be obtained by using the content provider scheduling service. In other words,content provider 102 may track hold durations and call durations and store such information in a server in communication with the content provider scheduling service. In other examples, call durations and hold durations may be obtained by a system associated withAMS 106 tracking wait times to estimate an average wait time. -
Content provider 102 may additionally perform multiple varieties of customer service. In one example,content provider 102 is an airline.Content provider 102 may include services for “New Reservations”, “Existing Reservations”, and “Loyalty Program Reservations.” Accordingly,content provider 102 may provide different contentprovider availability periods 310 and contentprovider communication data 312 for each period. -
Customer 154 usescustomer computing device 108 including, for example, a laptop computer, a mobile computing device, or a desktop computer, to provide acustomer availability period 320 toAMS 106 vianetwork 110.Customer availability period 320 represents at least one time period whencustomer 154 is available for communication withcontent provider 102.Customer availability period 320 may include, for example, a list of time intervals whencustomer 154 is available for communication.Customer availability period 320 may be received from a scheduling software including, for example, an online scheduling tool, a file or program atcustomer computing device 108, or scheduling services associated withcustomer 154 on, or otherwise available to,AMS 106. Along withcustomer availability period 320,customer 154 usescustomer computing device 108 to providecustomer communication data 322 toAMS 106 vianetwork 110.Customer communication data 322 may include, for example, preferred times to contactcustomer 154, telephone contact identifiers including phone numbers, chat contact identifiers including user information for chatting, voice chat contact identifiers including user information for voice chatting, and preferred methods of contact withcustomer 154. In some examples, nocustomer availability periods 320 may be provided becausecustomer 154 is not signed into scheduling software or data from such software is unavailable. In other examples, nocustomer availability periods 320 may be provided becausecustomer 154 does not have any available time intervals indicated in their schedule. If nocustomer availability periods 320 are provided, determinations ofcommunication schedule options 330 can be determined using contentprovider availability periods 310. -
AMS 106 uses contentprovider availability period 310,customer availability period 320, contentprovider communication data 312, andcustomer communication data 322 to determine at least onecommunication schedule option 330 associated withonline content 335.Communication schedule option 330 represents at least one time interval when communication may be made betweencustomer 154 andcontent provider 102, considering the respective restrictions in the schedules of each. In cases where multiplecommunication schedule options 330 are determined,AMS 106 may additionally determine a preferred schedule option based upon at least one of a customer preference and a content provider preference. The customer preference and the content provider preference may be reflected in contentprovider communication data 312 andcustomer communication data 322. In cases where nocustomer availability periods 320 are received,communication schedule options 330 are determined using contentprovider availability periods 310. If no time intervals exist when communication may be made betweencustomer 154 andcontent provider 102, considering the respective restrictions in the schedules of each, an indication will be provided tocustomer 154 that no options exist. Accordinglycustomer 154 may alternately change their schedule or attempt to schedule in a different time period. -
Communication schedule option 330 is transmitted byAMS 106 tocustomer computing device 108 along withonline content 335. In other words,online content 335 such as an online advertisement is presented with thecommunication schedule options 330 so thatcustomer 154 can view time intervals when communication with thecontent provider 102 may be scheduled.Customer 154 selects a particular time interval in order to schedule such communication. IfAMS 106 determines a preferred schedule option,AMS 106 may additionally transmit the preferred schedule option (not shown inFIG. 3 ) and display the preferred schedule option with an indication such as highlighting, textual indicators, and graphical indicators.AMS 106 additionally creates a callback extension (not shown inFIG. 3 ) associated withonline content 335 to displaycommunication schedule options 330. The call back extension is a customer module configured to receive customer interaction associated withcommunication schedule selection 340. -
AMS 106 receivescommunication schedule selection 340 fromcustomer computing device 108.Communication schedule selection 340 represents the selection of a time interval bycustomer 154 fromcommunication schedule options 330. In other words,customer 154 interacts withonline content 335 using, for example, the callback extension, to select a particular time interval to communicate withcontent provider 102.Communication schedule selection 340 is transmitted toAMS 106.Customer 154 makescommunication schedule selection 340 by interacting withonline content 335 presented tocustomer 154 including, for example, clicking on a particular time interval in a schedule. -
AMS 106 transmitscommunication schedule selection 340 to content providerdata processing system 112. This allowscontent provider 102 to schedule the communication and ultimately communicate withcustomer 154. The communication can additionally be facilitated using an automated system. The call or communication betweencustomer 154 andcontent provider 102 may be automatically initiated using such an automated system at the time represented by the communication selection. -
AMS 106 receivescommunication schedule acknowledgment 350 from content providerdata processing system 112.Communication schedule acknowledgment 350 indicates thatcontent provider 102 can complete the communication withcustomer 154 at the time indicated incommunication schedule selection 340.Communication schedule acknowledgement 350 may be useful in examples wheremultiple customers 154 attempt to schedule in the same time period simultaneously. Therefore, allowingcontent provider 102 the opportunity to providecommunication schedule acknowledgment 350 reduces risks associated with overscheduling. -
AMS 106 transmitscommunication schedule confirmation 360 tocustomer computing device 108.Communication schedule confirmation 360 indicates thatcontent provider 102 has providedcommunication schedule acknowledgment 350 and, more specifically, that the communication can occur as scheduled. -
