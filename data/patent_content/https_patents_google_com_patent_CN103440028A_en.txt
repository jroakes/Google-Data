Suppose to have the system of n processor, and single heat core is wherein arranged, in order to prevent from violating thermal confinement, its power will reduce according to the β factor (that is, be multiplied by β, its can between 0 to 1).The deceleration that measuring system is total, as the weighted sum of the deceleration of each processor.For example, if in 4 cores has reduced by 20%, the effective frequency factor can be confirmed as (3+0.8)/4 or 95% so.
In an embodiment, the deceleration of different thermal management algorithms (S wherein
dvsrefer to the deceleration of DVS, S
ftrefer to the deceleration of frequency control) can determine according to following:
With reference to figure 2, according to embodiment, the example of pure throttling for the relative gain of DVS has been described.As discussed herein, " pure " throttling only refers to the situation that reduces the power consumption in processor with one of following: frequency throttling (it is often referred to DVS only in the projection of frequency domain), Clock gating are (for example, it relates to forbids that trigger does not wherein change the part of the circuit of state) and/or the microstructure throttling is (for example, wherein, on sheet, binding site (junction) temperature of heat monitoring units processor is also dynamically adjusted processor operating voltage and/or frequency under the ambient condition changing, to provide maximum performance).
More particularly, pure throttling can be by formula S for the relation between DVS
ft/ S
dvs-1 describes.By reference to Fig. 2, can find out, gain increases along with the increase of the quantity of core.It should be noted that for two cores, for the reasonable β value of some embodiment, DVS still can have superiority.In an embodiment, this paper will further discuss, and for example, with reference to Fig. 3, DVS and/or throttling can selectively be applied to the core of processor.
In certain embodiments, can the quantity based on core determine whether to use one or more DVS and/or throttling.For example, these technology can be applied to have the processor more than 2 cores.Yet these technology also can be for having the processor that is less than 3 cores.
Fig. 3 has illustrated for the technology by one or more selections and has been applied to the block diagram of a plurality of cores of processor with the embodiment of the method 300 of managing power.In an embodiment, can use the various parts with reference to Fig. 1-2 and 6-7 discussion, carry out one or more operations of discussing with reference to figure 3.
With reference to figure 1-3, in operation 302, can determine which or which (and/or quantity of the core) core in multi-core processor has caused heat problem (for example, thermal stress or too high working temperature).For example, logical one 40 can be from the sensor 150 reception information of immediate core 106.Alternatively, for example, in conjunction with reading via (a plurality of) energy monitoring device 145 of (a plurality of) thermal sensor 150, by estimating power consumption, determine.
In operation 304, can determine in processor that how many cores are arranged is active and be cold (for example, that detect by (a plurality of) sensor 150, lower than the temperature value of too high threshold temperature value).For example, logical one 40 can consider the statistics (for example, self being provided by (a plurality of) monitor 145, (a plurality of) sensor 150 and/or core 106) of the duty of core 106 determine which core 106 be enliven and be cold.In operation 306, can consider to operate 302 and/or 304 information and (comprise various punishment, for example, these punishment of discussing with reference to Fig. 2, for example comprise, the voltage transition punishment of DVS etc.), and possible constraint (for example, can expect not reduce the frequency of too many heat core to safeguard the smooth working of crucial application) which kind of uses to determine in multi-core processor (or which) technology is managed power consumption.In operation 308, (multiple) technology that can application choice is carried out throttling or is revised the running parameter (for example, the operating voltage of processor core 106 and/or frequency of operation) of one or more cores 106.For example, logical one 40 can be considered DVS, pure throttling technology or its some combine the energy consumption of control processor 102.In addition, in one embodiment, operate 308 can application technology combination, for example, wherein DVS reduces to a certain energy state (P state) by all cores, in pure throttling technology one of heat core is slowed down quickly.
In an embodiment, the operation of method 300 continuously (or periodically) repeat, for example, after operation 308, can for example, in the situation that do not postpone to continue operation 302(or elapsed time section (, being set by the timer logic) afterwards).In certain embodiments, method 300 can allow processor to reduce the heat management performance punishment in the thermal limit application, so that a plurality of core is shared identical bus plane.
Yet, for the processor with a plurality of bus planes, also have the problem of other power management.For example, if occur to share a plurality of bus planes of same power supplies 120 in system 100, power management may need the constraint that not only meets the independent constraint of each bus plane but also meet the overall situation of each encapsulation so.By like this, can share the budget of common encapsulation power/energy and for example allow to use when processor resource not fully during use better graphical effect (GFX) performance of the workload that untapped processor core power can be intensive for GFX.Yet the technology that this paper discusses with reference to a plurality of bus planes can also be applied in the realization that can use single bus plane.
Some current Managed Solutions based on power are not considered the time aspect of power management, because they only process current time point usually.Therefore, in certain embodiments, can use its permission of energy budget of each bus plane: (1) (had for example both defined independent parts to consider time-related mode, independent processor core) constraint defines again shared constraint (for example, sharing between a plurality of parts or processor core); (2) mean the operative constraint corresponding to the different time constraint; (3) process the situation in approximately intrafascicular online variation.In an embodiment, can between different bus planes and according to the definition based on energy, come managing power to distribute.
In certain embodiments, can the management energy budget and/or can carry out power setting (for example, voltage and/or frequency shift) according to current budget.Power management based on energy can be carried out by controlling the following energy budget of definition iteratively:
E
n+1=αE
n+(TDP
n-P
n)Δt
n （1）
TDP wherein
nit is thermal design power (TDP) Power Limitation at step n; P
nat time Δ t
nthe upper power consumed of interior, step n, α is attenuation components.For example, use α=0.999 is corresponding to the window size of second, and use α=0.9 is corresponding to less window size.E
nexpression formula corresponding to energy " surplus " (it is also not by the energy of system consumption).The value of attenuation components is that the requirement by the time window size defines.In addition, in certain embodiments, the TDP value can be provided by software application or user.
This energy budget is corresponding on the difference between the power that index mask (exponential mask) is applied at each to TDP constantly and consumes, that is: this moment
Therefore, system (for example, logical one 40) can by the TDP constraint separation be arranged on each power layer, or/and constraint is arranged in whole IC encapsulation.According to the constraint applied, in certain embodiments, can safeguard a plurality of budgets, for example the shared constraint of the independent constraint of each power layer and/or each encapsulation.In addition, can safeguard the different budget power of each window size (being meaned by α) and/or each TDP constraint.Notice that for example, when TDP changes rapidly (, by software application or user), this framework is processed this situation reposefully in certain embodiments.In an embodiment, can safeguard the energy budget group
In an embodiment, can define controller budget (for example, being realized by logical one 40).For each bus plane i, definition controller function, by f
i(E) mean, it is mapped to energy budget the discrete group of power rating.In one embodiment, controller (it requires as nondecreasing function) is by scope
According to an embodiment, figure 4 illustrates the example of controller function.Concrete controller can be considered the requirement (this punishment changed between the P state) of specific bus plane.

With reference to figure 1-5, in operation 502, can determine the energy budget surplus of each constraint
operation 504, can determine the energy budget surplus of each bus plane
operation 506, can determine that the controller of each bus plane is recommended
