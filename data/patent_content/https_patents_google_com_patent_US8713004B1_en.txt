Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to location based services and, in particular, to the display of point of interest (POI) listings in a mapping interface.
- POI point of interest
- POI listings may be displayed on a mapping interface in order to help a user to identify a POI or to find directions to a POI.
- a mapping interface may display POI listings in order to help a user visualize a route from one location to another.
- a user may use online search services to find POIs near a certain location. These POIs may be displayed in a map interface to help a user identify or visualize the POIs' location.
- a system for prioritizing points of interest for display in a map may include a logging module, a category module, and a ranking module.
- the logging module may be configured to obtain a plurality of user interactions associated with a one or more categories.
- the category module may be configured to increment a category count for each category associated with the user interaction for each user interaction of the plurality of user interactions and calculate a category score for the each category of one or more categories based on the category count for each category of the one or more categories.
- the ranking module may be configured to calculate a priority score for the POI listing based on category scores for the one or more categories associated with the POI listing.
- a method for prioritizing points of interest for display in a map may include detecting a plurality of user interactions associated with one or more categories in a set of categories and, for each category in the set of categories, calculating a number of user interactions associated with the category and determining a category score for the category based on the number of user interactions associated with the category.
- the method may further include prioritizing, using a processor, the listing for display in the map based on the category scores for the one or more categories associated with the listing.
- a machine-readable medium including instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations for prioritizing points of interest for display in a map.
- the operations may include obtaining a set of POI listings, each POI listing of the set of POI listings associated with one or more categories, calculating a category score for each category of the one or more categories based on a number of user interactions for each category, and prioritizing each POI listing for display on a map based on the category score of each category associated with the POI listing.
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a POI listing, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- FIG. 2 is a user interface displaying a map, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- FIG. 3 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a network environment for prioritizing points of interest for display on a map, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a process for prioritizing points of interest for display in a map, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 5 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a computer system with which each of the clients and servers of FIG. 1 may be implemented.
- systems and methods for prioritizing point of interest (POI) listings for display in a map are disclosed.
- a mapping service may display the most useful POI listings while hiding others.
- the map may be less cluttered and improve readability.
- Many factors or signals may be used to prioritize POI listings for display in a map. For example, the location of a POI, the distance of the POI to a reference location, review ratings, and the web presence of the POI may all be considered in prioritizing a POI listing.
- a mapping system may be configured to prioritize the display of listings belonging to more useful categories over listings belonging to less useful categories.
- the mapping system may also be able to determine which categories are more useful to users by monitoring user interactions on a mapping interface and identifying which categories are more popular to users based on the user interactions.
- a user interaction may be any signal received from a user or user device that is associated with a POI listing.
- a user interaction may include a selection of a POI listing on a mapping interface or a selection of a POI listing on search result interface.
- Usefulness or popularity of a category may be represented by a category score that is calculated based on the number of user interactions detected that are associated with a particular category. For example, a category associated with 1,000,000 user interactions detected in the span of a day may be more popular than a category associated with 200 user interactions in that same time period. In one aspect, however, the mapping system may also consider the size of the categories. For example, a category with 1,000 listings will most likely have more user interactions than another category with only 5 listings, even if the 5 listings were more popular on average than the 1,000 listings. As a result, the category score may be calculated based on the average number of user interactions per listing in a particular category, detected during a given time period.
- a point of interest (POI) listing may be any data structure used to store information about a specific POI (e.g., a business, a park, an airport, an office, a school, etc.).
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a POI listing 100 in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- a POI listing 100 may include data about a POI such as the name of the POI, a location of the POI (e.g., longitude and latitude coordinates), a unique identifier for the POI, or other information about the POI.
- the POI listing 100 may also include one or more categories that the POI may belong to or be associated with.
- the categories may represent a characteristic of the POI or a type of POI.
- Some example categories may include, but are not limited to, “business,” “restaurant,” “pizza restaurant,” “restaurant chain,” “shopping center,” “retail store,” “landmark,” “park,” “university,” or some other category that may be used to group POIs.
- the categories may be organized into a hierarchical graph in which a category may have one or more parent categories and one or more child categories. For example, the “business” category may have the “restaurant” and “retail store” categories as child categories and the “restaurant” category may have “pizza restaurant” and “restaurant chain” as child categories.
- FIG. 2 is a user interface 200 (e.g., a mapping interface) displaying a map, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- the map in the user interface 200 may be generated by a mapping service and may contain a variety of POI listings.
- the POI listings displayed in the map may include businesses, government buildings, landmarks, churches, hospitals, neighborhoods, districts, etc. Each POI listing may be identified on the map using an icon, a label, or both.
- the user interface 200 may also include controls that enable a user on a client device to control a zoom level of the map or to scroll the map in one or more directions.
- the mapping service may update the map and the POI listings displayed on the map. For example, if a user activates a scroll control, the map may scroll in a direction to reveal newly displayed portions of the map and new POI listings may be displayed for the entire map or just for the newly displayed portions of the map.
- the area displayed in the map may be viewed from a closer perspective and, according to some aspects, new POI listings previously not shown may be displayed on the map. If, on the other hand, a user activates a zoom-out control, the area displayed in the map may viewed from a wider angle revealing newly displayed portions of the map. Furthermore, according to some aspects, POI listings previously shown may become hidden and new POI listings may be displayed on the newly displayed portions of the map.
- the mapping service may determine which listings are shown on the map based on various factors such as, but not limited to, the zoom level, the number of listings located within the area shown in the map, the number of listings located within a portion of the area shown in the map (e.g., how densely populated with listings a portion of the area shown in the map is), user profile information, and search query parameters. In one aspect, the mapping service may also determine which listings are shown on the may based on one or more categories associated with each listing.
- FIG. 3 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a network environment 300 for prioritizing points of interest for display on a map, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a client-server network environment 300

- client device 305 may be a desktop computer, a server, a set top box, a video game console, a thin client, a mobile device (e.g., a phone, tablet, personal digital assistant (PDA), a global positioning system (GPS) device, etc.), or any other machine with a processor, memory, and communications capabilities.
- a mobile device e.g., a phone, tablet, personal digital assistant (PDA), a global positioning system (GPS) device, etc.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- GPS global positioning system
- the client device 305 may include one or more client applications 310 configured to generate and transmit user interactions to a server.
- web browsers or other applications on the client device 305 may be configured to provide local search capabilities or mapping capabilities.
- the web browsers or other applications may be configured to receive local search interfaces, local search results, and mapping interfaces, generate various user interactions, and transmit user interactions to one or more servers 315 .
- users of a client device 305 may generate a local search query and receive local search results displayed as POI listings in a mapping interface. The user may select one or more of the POI listings and transmit the user interaction to the server 315 .
- the network 350 can include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, the network 350 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
- PAN personal area network
- LAN local area network
- CAN campus area network
- MAN metropolitan area network
- WAN wide area network
- BBN broadband network
- the Internet and the like.
- the network 350 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
- the server 315 may be any system or device having a processor, a memory, and communications capability configured to prioritize points of interest for display on a map.
- a server 315 may be a virtual entity that might refer to a cluster or even multiple clusters of servers.
- the server 315 may include an interface module 320 , a logging module 325 , a category module 330 , a ranking module 340 , and a map module 345 .
- the modules illustrated in FIG. 3 may include software instructions encoded in a medium and executed by a processor, computer hardware components, or a combination of both.
- the modules may each include one or more processors or memories that are used to perform the functions described below.
- the various systems and modules may share one or more processors or memories.
- the interface module 320 may be configured to communicate with other systems (e.g., client devices), servers, and other modules.
- the interface module may receive user interactions from client devices 305 .
- user interactions may be any type of signal received from a user or client device 305 that is associated with a POI listing.
- a user interaction may include a selection of a POI listing on a mapping interface or a selection of a POI listing on search result interface.
- the user interactions received by the interface module 320 may be stored in the logging module 325 .
- the logging module 325 may be configured to obtain user interactions received from client devices 305 and anonymously log them. These user interactions may be of various types (e.g., selections of POI listings on a mapping interface, selections of POI listings on a search result interface, search queries associated with the POI listing, etc.) received by the interface module 320 from a number of users and client devices 305 via the network 350 . In one aspect, in order to conserve computing resources, the logging module 325 may not log every user interaction received by the interface module 320 . Instead, the logging module 325 may log a smaller sampling of user interactions for a period of time. The smaller sampling may, in some cases, be a random or near random selection of user interactions.
- the smaller sampling may, in some cases, be a random or near random selection of user interactions.
- the logging module 325 may also be configured to determine which categories are associated with each logged user interaction. For example, a user interaction may be associated with a particular POI listing (e.g., the user interaction is a selection of a POI listing on a mapping interface). The logging module 325 may map the user interaction to one or more categories associated with the user interaction by locating the POI listing stored in a database and identifying one or more categories that the POI listing is associated with.
- the category module 330 may be configured to monitor a number of categories and calculate the number of user interactions associated with each of the categories. In one aspect, the category module 330 may maintain a counter for each category that is monitored and may increment the counter for one of the categories when the logging module 325 determines that a received user interaction is associated with that category. The category module 330 may also be configured to determine a category score for each category based on the number of interactions associated with the category (e.g., the category's counter value). The category score may be used to represent how popular or how useful a category is.
- the ranking module 340 may be configured to prioritize a POI listing for display on a map based on the category scores associated with the POI listing. For example, a priority score may be calculated for the POI listing based on a variety of factors or signals that include the category scores associated with the POI listing. If the POI listing belongs to more than one category, the average category score of all the categories that the POI listing belongs to may be used in the formula to calculate the priority score of the POI listing. In another aspect, the maximum category score of all the categories that the POI listing belongs to may be used in the formula to calculate the priority score of the POI listing.
- the map module 345 may be configured to generate a map for display on a client device 305 .
- the map module 345 may identify a number of POI listings that are located within the mapped area and designate one or more POI listings to be displayed on the map.
- the map module 345 may designate those POI listings located within the mapped area with a priority score that exceeds a certain threshold may be designated for display.
- only a predetermined number of POI listings located within the mapped area that have the highest priority scores for display e.g., the POI listings with the top 10 or 20 priority scores).
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a process 400 for prioritizing points of interest for display in a map, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Although the operations in process 400 are shown in a particular order, certain operations may be performed in different orders or at the same time.
- the process 400 may begin at operation 405 , where the logging module 325 detects user interactions received by the interface module 320 over a period of time. Each user interaction may be associated with a POI listing which is further associated with one or more categories. For example, a user interaction may be a user click or selection of a POI listing in a mapping interface or a search result interface and the POI listing may belong to one or more categories.
- the category module 330 may calculate the number of user interactions detected by the logging module 325 for each category. For example, each category tracked by the category module 330 may have a counter that is incremented for each user interaction detected that is associated with that particular category. As mentioned above, each user interaction may be associated with a POI listing that belongs to more than one category. As a result, more than one counter may be incremented for each user interaction detected. The counters for the categories may be incremented as the user interactions are detected or in a batch at the end of a period of time.
- the categories monitored by the category module 330 may be organized into a hierarchical graph in which a category may have one or more parent categories and one or more child categories.
- the count for the category may be incremented as well as the category counts for all parent or other ancestor categories.
- the category module 330 may also determine a category score for each category based on the number of user interactions associated with the category at operation 415 .
- the category score may represent how popular a category is to users, as a result, it may be desirable in some cases to factor in the size of a category (e.g., the number of listings that belong to the category).
- the category score for a category may be calculated based on the average number of user interactions for a listing in that category. The average number of user interactions detected for listings in that category may be determined by dividing the total number of user interactions associated with the category (e.g., the count for the category) by the total number of listings in that category.
- a particular geographic area may have 100 listings that are associated with a “hotel” category. Over a specific period of time, a two week period for example, 1500 user interaction associated with those 100 listings may have been received and logged by the system. As a result, the average number of user interactions detected for the listings in the “hotel” category may be 15 per listing. In one aspect, the category score may simply be this average number of interactions per listing in the category value. In another aspect, however, the category module 330 may convert this average number into another format (e.g., a value between 0 and 1) so that the converted number may be used to determine the priority score of a listing.
- another format e.g., a value between 0 and 1
- the category module 330 may cap the category score of certain categories that are determined to have low display importance (e.g., not be useful to a user if it is displayed on a map). For example, the category module 330 may determine that a particular category (e.g., a “fire station” or a “hotel” category) has low display importance even if the category receives a large number of user interactions. Instead of calculating the category score in the typical manner, the category module 330 may cap the category score of that category if it exceeds a predetermined threshold. For example, taking the illustrative scenario discussed above, the category score for the “hotel” category would have been 15.
- the category module may cap the category score at 5 because the category score for “hotel” would have exceeded the predetermined threshold of 5.
- the ranking module 340 may prioritize one or more POI listings for display on a map based on the category scores of the categories the listing is associated with. If the POI listing belongs to more than one category, the average category score of all the categories that the POI listing belongs to may be used in the formula to calculate the priority score of the POI listing. In another aspect, the maximum category score of all the categories that the POI listing belongs to may be used in the formula to calculate the priority score of the POI listing.
- the ranking module 340 may calculate the priority score by using a formula that assigns various weights to various factors or signals.
- the category scores may be first converted into a number between 0 and 1 before they are used in the formula to calculate the priority score.
- the map module 345 may use the priority scores of the POI listings to designate one or more POI listings to be displayed on the map. For example, the map module 345 may generate a map to transmit to a client device 305 . In generating the map, the map module 345 may identify a set of POI listings from a database. The set of POI listings may include all listings that are located within the area to be displayed on the map or a subset of all the listings. The map module may then designate which listings in the set of listings to display on the map. In one aspect of the subject technology, the map module 345 may designate a predetermined number of POI listings with the highest priority scores for display (e.g., the 20 POI listings with the highest priority scores). According to another aspect, the map module 345 may designate a POI listing for display in the map if the priority score of the POI listing exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- the user interaction data may be normalized first before determining the category score so that the category score is not affected too much by a small sample data set.
- the number of listings for a category may be adjusted by adding a predetermined number of listings.
- the click count for the category may also be adjusted by adding the number of click counts expected for the predetermined number of listings across all categories.
- the category score for each category may then be calculated based on the adjusted click count divided by the adjusted number of listings for the category. In this way, categories with fewer listings or with fewer or no recorded user interactions (e.g., clicks) will not be punished too harshly.
- a “restaurant” category may have a million listings in a geographic area while a smaller category such as “city hall” might only have 5 listings in the same geographic area. If only a small portion of user interactions are logged and used to determine the category score, it is more likely that the “city hall” category may be more greatly affected by variations in the sample data set. These variations may be stabilized by injecting average data into the data set. For example, 100 listings may be added to every category such that the “restaurant” category will have 1,000,100 listings and the “city hall” category will have 105 listings. If the average number of user interactions for a listing of any category is 1.5 per listing, the expected number of user interactions for the 100 listings added would be 150 user interactions.
- the user interaction data and category data being monitored in one market may be distinguished from user interaction data and category data from another market.
- categories in different markets may have different category scores.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a computer system with which any of the clients and servers of FIG. 1 may be implemented.
- the computer system 500 may be implemented using hardware or a combination of software and hardware, either in a dedicated server, or integrated into another entity, or distributed across multiple entities.
