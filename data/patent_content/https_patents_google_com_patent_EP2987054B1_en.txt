Definitions
- Some computing devices may provide a graphical keyboard as part of a graphical user interface for composing text (e.g., using a presence-sensitive input device and/or display, such as a touchscreen).
- the graphical keyboard may enable a user of the computing device to enter text (e.g., an e-mail, a text message, or a document, etc.).
- a display device of a computing device may output a graphical (or "soft") keyboard that enables the user to enter data by indicating (e.g., by tapping) keys displayed at a presence-sensitive input device.
- Some computing devices may determine one or more candidate character strings (e.g., candidate words included in a lexicon, such as a dictionary) based on data entered using the graphical keyboard.
- a computing device may output a set of the candidate character strings for display at a plurality of text suggestion regions that enable the user to select (e.g., auto-complete) a character string by indicating (e.g., tapping or gesturing over) a text suggestion region of a display that displays a desired character string.
- each of the text suggestion regions may be associated with a rank, each rank corresponding to a relative probability of a candidate character string displayed within the text suggestion region.
- the computing device may output candidate character strings for display within the text suggestion regions based on a correspondence between a probability that the candidate character string represents a word included in the lexicon and the rank of a respective text suggestion region. For instance, the computing device may output a highest-probability candidate character string for display within a highest-ranked text suggestion region of the display, a second-highest probability candidate character string for display within a second-highest ranked text suggestion region, etc.
- the text suggestion region within which a particular candidate character string is displayed may change due to, for example, different lexical contexts of the candidate character string (e.g., different preceding words).
- a user may not be able to predict within which text suggestion region a particular candidate character string will be displayed in response to particular gesture input.
- such techniques may require a user to attend to (e.g., view) each of the plurality of text suggestion regions to determine within which text suggestion region a desired candidate character string is displayed, thereby reducing the speed at which the user is able to interact with the computing device to enter text.
- US 2005/0210402 A1 discloses data entry for personal computing devices in which a user can rapidly enter and search for text using a data entry system through a combination of entering one or more characters on a digitally displayed keyboard with a pointing device and using a search list to obtain a list of completion candidates.”
- the present invention provides a method as set out at claim 1, a computer-readable storage medium as set out at claim 14, and a device as set out at claim 15.
- this disclosure is directed to techniques that may improve the ease with which a user may enter text using text suggestion regions by consistently outputting a particular candidate character string for display within a same text suggestion region each time a computing device receives gesture input to select one or more characters of the particular candidate character string.
- a computing device may output, for display (e.g., at a presence-sensitive display), a graphical user interface including a graphical keyboard and a plurality of text suggestion regions (e.g., two, three, five, or more text suggestion regions).
- the computing device may determine a plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., candidate words included in a lexicon, such as a dictionary) based on characters associated with the selected keys.
- the computing device may output a set of the candidate character strings for display within the text suggestion regions that enable the user to select (e.g., auto-complete) a candidate character string by indicating (e.g., by tapping) one of the text suggestion regions.
- a computing device implementing techniques of this disclosure may consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within a same text suggestion region each time the computing device receives gesture input to select one or more characters of the particular candidate character string. For instance, the computing device may output a candidate character string for display within a particular text suggestion region based at least in part on determining that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region.
- techniques of this disclosure may enable a user to predict within which text suggestion region the particular candidate character string will be displayed, thereby enabling the user to select the particular candidate character string from the particular text suggestion region without requiring the user to attend to (e.g., view) others of the text suggestion regions.
- techniques described herein may enable a computing device to increase the rate at which a user may enter text, thereby improving usability of the computing device.

- UI device 4 may output GUIs 10 including graphical keyboard 12 for display at UI device 4.
- UI device 4 e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive display
- UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 as a first selected key of graphical keyboard 12, such as by determining that location 18 corresponds to a location of graphical keyboard 12 that displays "T" key 22.
- UI module 6 may select "H" key 24 as a second selected key of graphical keyboard 12, such as by determining that location 20 corresponds to a location of graphical keyboard 12 that displays "H” key 24. While illustrated in FIG. 1 with respect to multiple gesture inputs detected at locations 18 and 20 to select "T" key 22 and "H” key 24, aspects of this disclosure are not so limited.
- UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 and "H” key 24 in response to receiving an indication of a single continuous gesture input detected from location 18 to location 20 such that UI device 4 detects the presence of an input unit (e.g., a finger, pen, stylus, and the like) from location 18 to location 20 of graphical keyboard 12.
- an input unit e.g., a finger, pen, stylus, and the like
- Text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings in response to selecting "T" key 22 and "H” key 24 as selected keys of graphical keyboard 12. Each respective candidate character string may include a group of predicted characters that includes characters associated with the selected keys. For instance, in the example of FIG. 1 , text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings for which the characters "T" and "H", corresponding to "T" key 22 and "H” key 24 respectively, are a prefix. As illustrated in FIG.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings including character string 26 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "this"), character string 28 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "the"), character string 30 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "that"), and character string 32 (i.e., the character string character string including the plurality of characters "than”). While illustrated with respect to four candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32, text suggestion module 8 may determine other numbers of candidate character strings, such as two candidate character strings, five candidate character strings, fifty candidate character strings, or other numbers of candidate character strings.
- Text suggestion module 8 may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on a probability of each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings. For instance, as described in further detail below, text suggestion module 8 may compare each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character stings with a language model to determine a probability of each respective candidate character string, such as a probability that each respective candidate character string represents a word included in a lexicon (e.g., the English language) or a probability that each respective character string represents a next word of a multi-word phrase. As illustrated in the example of FIG. 1 , text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32.
- text suggestion module 8 may associate each of the plurality of candidate character strings with a respective rank, such that ranked ordering 34 represents an ordered arrangement of the plurality of candidate character strings according to a probability of each respective candidate character string.
- ranked ordering 34 includes first rank 36, second rank 38, third rank 40, and fourth rank 42.
- ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 each correspond to a probability that an associated candidate character string represents a next word of a multi-word phrase included in text display region 14.
- FIG. 1 ranked ordering 34 represents an ordered arrangement of the plurality of candidate character strings according to a probability of each respective candidate character string.
- ranked ordering 34 includes first rank 36, second rank 38, third rank 40, and fourth rank 42.
- ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 each correspond to a probability that an associated candidate character string represents a next word of a multi-word phrase included in text display region 14.
- ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 are arranged in descending order of probability, such that rank 36 is associated with a candidate character string corresponding to a highest relative probability that the candidate character string represents a next word of the multi-word phrase included in text display region 14, and rank 42 is associated with a candidate character string corresponding to a lowest relative probability that the candidate character string represents a next word of the multi-word phrase included in text display region 14.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 such that ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 are arranged in ascending order of probability.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 as including more than four ranks or fewer than four ranks. In certain examples, text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 as including a number of ranks equal to the number of candidate character strings included in the plurality of candidate character strings, such that each of the plurality of candidate character strings is associated with a rank within ranked ordering 34. In some examples, a rank of candidate character strings included within a ranked ordering (e.g., ranked ordering 34) may be implicit in the ordering the candidate character strings included within the list of candidate character strings, and actual ranking values need not necessarily be stored in associated with candidate character strings.
- text suggestion module 8 may associate each of text suggestion regions 16A-16C with a respective rank corresponding to a probability of a candidate character string that is displayed within the respective one of text suggestion regions 16. In this way, text suggestion module 8 may determine a ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16, such that each of text suggestion regions 16 is associated with a rank corresponding to a respective rank of an associated candidate character string (e.g., a rank stored in a data structure associated with the candidate character strings, an ordering or cardinality of the plurality of candidate character strings that corresponds with an ordering or cardinality of the rankings of text suggestion regions 16, etc. For instance, in the example of FIG.
- text suggestion module 8 determines a ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16 such that text suggestion region 16A corresponds to a highest probability candidate character string, text suggestion region 16B corresponds to a second-highest probability candidate character string, and text suggestion region 16C corresponds to a third-highest probability candidate character string.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine different ranked orderings of text suggestion regions 16, such as a ranked ordering that associates text suggestion region 16B with a highest probability candidate character string.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine any ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16, such that each respective one of text suggestion regions 16 corresponds to a different rank that associates the respective one of text suggestion regions 16 with a respective rank within the plurality of candidate character strings.
- Text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to output a set of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 for display at GUI 10A within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34.
- text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to output candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30 for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34. That is, in this example, text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 26 is associated with rank 36 (i.e., a highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated with text suggestion region 16A (i.e., a highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16).
- text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to output candidate character string 26 for display within text suggestion region 16A.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 28 is associated with rank 38 (i.e., a second-highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated with text suggestion region 16B (i.e., a second-highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16), and may cause UI device 4 to output candidate character string 28 for display within text suggestion region 16B.
- rank 38 i.e., a second-highest rank of ranked ordering 34
- a rank associated with text suggestion region 16B i.e., a second-highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16
- text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 30 is associated with rank 40 (i.e., a third-highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated with text suggestion region 16C (i.e., a third-highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16), and may cause UI device 4 to output candidate character string 30 for display within text suggestion region 16C. In this way, text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to output a set of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 (i.e., the set of the plurality of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30) for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34.
- rank 40 i.e., a third-highest rank of ranked ordering 34
- text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to output a set of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 (i.e., the set of the plurality of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30) for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34.
- UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at a location of UI device 4 to select a candidate character string displayed within one of text suggestion regions 16. For example, UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at location 44 of GUI 10A. In response, UI module 6 may select candidate character string 26 (i.e., the candidate character string displayed within text suggestion region 16A), such as by determining that location 44 corresponds to a location of UI device 4 that displays text suggestion region 16A. UI module 6 may cause UI device 4 to output candidate character string 26 (i.e., the candidate character string including the characters "this") for display within text display region 14.
- candidate character string 26 i.e., the candidate character string including the characters "this
- computing device 2 may enable a user of computing device 2 to select (e.g., auto-complete) a character string for display within text display region 14 without requiring the user to provide gesture input to select keys of graphical keyboard 12 associated with each of the characters included in the character string.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine a context of the gesture input responsive to which text suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings.
- context 33 may include a representation of character "T” corresponding to the selected "T” key 22 and a representation of character "H” corresponding to the selected "H” key 24 (e.g., character string "th” in this example).
- the context of the gesture input may include a representation of one or more the keys of graphical keyboard 12, such as "T" key 22 and "H” key 24.
- the context of the gesture input may include a representation of location 18 and a representation of location 20 of graphical keyboard 12, such as a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to a touch point of location 18 of UI device 4 (e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive device, such as a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive screen) and a centroid of a group of pixels of corresponding to a touch point of location 20 of UI device 4.
- a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to a touch point of location 18 of UI device 4 e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive device, such as a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive screen
- the context of the gesture input may include a representation of a relative location of GUI 10A corresponding to location 18 of graphical keyboard 12 and a relative location of GUI 10A corresponding to location 20 of graphical keyboard 12, such as an X-Y coordinate pair of each of a locations 18 and 20 as determined from a predefined reference point of GUI 10A, such as an upper-left corner of GUI 10A.
- the context may include previous and/or subsequent words and/or characters relative to one or more selected characters.
- the context may include information such as a type and/or version of an application used to input characters, a type of input field used to input characters (e.g., text input field, password field, date field, or other types of fields), a time of day at which computing device 2 receives the indication of the gesture input, a geographical location of computing device 2 while computing device 2 receives the indication of the gesture input, etc.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine the context of the gesture input as any characteristic of the gesture input that identifies, characterizes, and/or accompanies the gesture input responsive to which text suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings.
- the context may uniquely identify the gesture input.
- text suggestion module 8 continuously determines the context of the gesture input as UI module 6 receives indications of gesture input to select one or more keys of graphical keyboard 12. In some examples, text suggestion module 8 initiates and/or restarts the determination of the context of the gesture input in response to receiving gesture input to select a next word or sentence, such as gesture input to select a delimiter key (e.g., a space key, a punctuation key, or other delimiter key) of graphical keyboard 12.
- a delimiter key e.g., a space key, a punctuation key, or other delimiter key
- text suggestion module 8 generates a data structure that associates the context of the gesture input with a selected candidate character string and the particular text suggestion region within which the selected candidate character string was displayed while selected. For instance, in the example of FIG. 1 , text suggestion module 8 may determine context 33 of candidate character string 26 as the character string "th" (i.e., a character string including characters associated with "T" key 22 and "H" key 24).
- text suggestion module 8 may generate and/or maintain a data structure that associates the character string "th" (i.e., context 33 in this example) with candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this") and text suggestion region 16A (i.e., the particular text suggestion region within which candidate character string was displayed while selected).
- text suggestion module 8 may associate context 33, candidate character string 26, and a location of text suggestion region 16A (e.g., x-y coordinates of UI device 4 corresponding to text suggestion region 16A).
- Text suggestion module 8 may similarly maintain the data structure to associate other candidate character strings (i.e., candidate character strings other than candidate character string 26) with a context of gesture input and a particular text suggestion region. In this way, text suggestion module 8 may generate and/or maintain a data structure that associates multiple candidate character strings (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands, or other numbers of candidate character strings) with an associated with context of gesture input and a particular text suggestion region.
- candidate character strings i.e., candidate character strings other than candidate character string 26
- text suggestion module 8 may generate and/or maintain a data structure that associates multiple candidate character strings (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands, or other numbers of candidate character strings) with an associated with context of gesture input and a particular text suggestion region.
- text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure as UI module 6 receives subsequent gesture input to select one or more keys of graphical keyboard 12 (i.e., gesture input received after UI module 6 selects the candidate character string and causes UI module 4 to output the candidate character string for display within text display region 14).
- text suggestion module 8 determines that the received gesture input corresponds to a context included in the data structure (e.g., context 33)
- text suggestion module 8 causes UI device 4 to output the candidate character string associated with the context for display within the particular text suggestion region associated with the context.
- text suggestion module 8 may cause UI device 4 to consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within a same text display region each time UI module 6 receives an indication of gesture input that corresponds to the context of gesture input associated with the particular candidate character string.
- GUI 10B represents an example of GUIs 10 output by UI module 6 for display subsequent to receiving the indication of gesture input detected at location 44 and selecting candidate character string 26 for display within text display region 14. That is, in the example of FIG.
- GUIs 10A and 10B when taken together, illustrate an example where computing device 2 outputs GUI 10A and receives an indication of gesture input to select candidate character string 26 displayed within text suggestion region 16A at a first time, then subsequently outputs GUI 10B at a second time (e.g., during a subsequent power-cycle of computing device 2, during a separate instance of a particular application executing on one or more processors of computing device 2, or during an instance of a separate application executing on one or more processors of computing device 2).
- a second time e.g., during a subsequent power-cycle of computing device 2, during a separate instance of a particular application executing on one or more processors of computing device 2, or during an instance of a separate application executing on one or more processors of computing device 2.
- UI module 6 may cause UI device 4 to output GUI 10B including graphical keyboard 12, text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16.
- graphical keyboard 12, text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16 of GUI 10B may be substantially similar to graphical keyboard 12, text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16 of GUI 10A.
- UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at locations 19 and 21 of graphical keyboard 12. In response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected at location 19, UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 as a first selected key of graphical keyboard 12. Similarly, in response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected at location 21, UI module 6 may select "H" key 24 as a second selected key of graphical keyboard 12.
- text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings for which the character string "th" is a prefix. For instance, as was similarly described with respect to the example of GUI 10A, text suggestion module 8 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32.
- Text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 46 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32, such as by comparing each of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 to a language model to determine a probability of each of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. For instance, text suggestion module 8 may compare each of candidate characters 26, 28, 30, and 32 to a language model, such as an n-gram language model, to determine a probability that each of the candidate character strings follows the character string "Better" displayed within text display region 14.
- a language model such as an n-gram language model
- text suggestion module 8 determines that candidate character string 32 (i.e., the candidate character string "than”) is associated with a highest relative probability (e.g., a highest probability within the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32) that the candidate character string represents the next word of a multi-word phrase displayed within text display region 14. That is, in this example, text suggestion module 8 determines that the multi-word phrase "Better than” is associated with a higher probability than each of the multi-word phrases “Better this,” “Better the,” and “Better that” corresponding to candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30, respectively.
- a highest relative probability e.g., a highest probability within the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32
- text suggestion module 8 determines that candidate character string 26 is associated with second rank 38 indicating a second-highest probability candidate character string, candidate character string 28 is associated with third rank 40 indicating a third-highest probability candidate character string, and candidate character string 30 is associated with fourth rank 42 indicating a fourth-highest probability candidate character string.
- Text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 32 (i.e., the character string "than”), associated with first rank 36, corresponds to text suggestion region 16A (i.e., the text suggestion region associated with a rank corresponding to a highest probability candidate character string). Similarly, text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this"), associated with second rank 38, corresponds to text suggestion region 16B.
- candidate character string 32 i.e., the character string "than”
- text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this"), associated with second rank 38, corresponds to text suggestion region 16B.
- Text suggestion module 8 may determine a context of the gesture input responsive to which text suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. For example, text suggestion module 8 may determine context 33 of the gesture input as the character string "th" corresponding to characters associated with selected "T" key 22 and selected "H” key 24, respectively. Text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure that associates a context of received gesture input with candidate character strings and text display regions to determine whether the determined context of the gesture input (e.g., context 33 in this example) corresponds to a context included within the data structure.
- text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure to determine that context 33 (e.g., character string "th") corresponds to candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this") and text suggestion region 16A (i.e., a particular text suggestion region within which candidate character string 26 was previously displayed while selected).
- context 33 e.g., character string "th”
- candidate character string 26 i.e., the character string "this”
- text suggestion region 16A i.e., a particular text suggestion region within which candidate character string 26 was previously displayed while selected.
- text suggestion module 8 may cause UI module 6 to output candidate character string 26 for display within text suggestion 16A. That is, as discussed above, text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 26 is associated with second rank 38 corresponding to text suggestion region 16B and candidate character string 32 is associated with first rank 36 corresponding to text suggestion region 16A. Rather than output candidate character string 26 for display within text suggestion region 16B, text suggestion module 8 may output, based at least in part on determining that candidate character string 26 was previously selected while being displayed within text suggestion region 16A, candidate character string 26 for display within text suggestion region 16A.
- text suggestion module 8 may output, based at least in part on determining that candidate character string 26 was previously selected while being displayed within text suggestion region 16A, candidate character string 32 for display within text suggestion region 16B.
- computing device 2 may consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within the same text suggestion region each time the computing device outputs the candidate character string for display within a plurality of text suggestion regions.
- computing device 2 may enable a user to predict within which of a plurality of text suggestion regions a particular candidate character string will be displayed in response to particular gesture input, and thereby increase the rate at which a user may use the text suggestion regions to enter text.

For example, candidate character string module 64 may traverse context data structure 72 to determine whether the context of the gesture input, responsive to which candidate character string module 64 determined the plurality of candidate character strings, is included within context data structure 72. In some examples, candidate character string module 64 may determine that the context of the gesture input is not included within context data structure 72.
- candidate character string module 64 may insert within context data structure 72 a representation of each of the context, candidate character string, and the particular text suggestion region within which the candidate character string was displayed while selected.

In certain examples, context data structure 72 may not include a counter.
- UI module 6 may receive an indication of subsequent gesture input to select one or more keys of graphical keyboard 12. For instance, UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at locations 19 and 21 of graphical keyboard 12. In response, UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 (e.g., corresponding to gesture input detected at location 19) and "H” key 24 (e.g., corresponding to gesture input detected at location 21) as selected keys of graphical keyboard 12.

For example, ordering module 66 may determine ranked ordering 46 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32.
- the ranked order may associate each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings with a respective rank (e.g., ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42), such that the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings includes an ordered arrangement of the plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on the determined probability of each respective candidate character string.
- a respective rank e.g., ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42
- Suggest region association module 68 may associate at least one of the candidate character strings with a text suggestion region based at least in part on a determination, by suggestion region association module 68, that the at least one candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region. For example, suggestion region association module 68 may traverse the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., ranked ordering 46) to determine whether a representation of at least one of the plurality of candidate character strings are included within context data structure 72. In some examples, suggestion region association module 68 may determine that a representation of a particular candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings is included within context data structure 72.
- suggestion region association module 68 may determine whether the context of the gesture input, responsive to which candidate character string module 64 determined the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., the context "th" associated with gesture input detected at locations 19 and 21 of graphical keyboard 12) corresponds to the particular candidate character string within context data structure 72. In examples where suggestion region association module 68 determines that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string, suggestion region association module 68 may associate the particular candidate character string with the particular text suggestion region associated with the particular candidate character string within context data structure 72, and may output the particular candidate character string for display within the particular text suggestion region.
- candidate character string module 64 determined the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., the context "th" associated with gesture input detected at locations 19 and 21 of graphical keyboard 12) corresponds to the particular candidate character string within context data structure 72.
- suggestion region association module 68 may associate the particular candidate character string with the particular text suggestion region associated with the particular candidate character string within context data structure 72, and may output the particular candidate character string for display within the particular text suggestion
- suggestion region association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when suggestion region association module 68 determines that the context of the gesture input matches the context of gesture input as indicated within context data structure 72. For instance, suggestion region may determine that the context of gesture input including the character string "th" matches the context of gesture input including the character string "th” indicated within context data structure 72. In certain examples, suggestion region association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when the context of the gesture input as compared to the context of gesture input as indicated within context data structure 72 satisfies a threshold.
- suggestion region association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when each centroid is less than (or equal to) a threshold distance from the corresponding centroid as indicated by the context within context data structure 72.
- suggestion region association module 68 may associate a particular candidate character string with a particular text suggestion region based on a determination, by suggestion region association module 68, that the particular character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region.
- the association of the particular candidate character string with the particular text suggestion region may not correspond to the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings with respect to the ranked ordering of the plurality of text suggestion regions.
- suggestion region association module 68 may determine that a rank of particular candidate character string (e.g., candidate character string 26), as determined based on the probability of the particular candidate character string within the plurality of candidate character strings, corresponds to a first text suggestion region (e.g., text suggestion region 16B).
- suggestion region association module 68 may output the particular candidate character string (e.g., candidate character string 26) for display within a second text suggestion region (e.g., text suggestion region 16A) based on a determination that the particular candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the second text suggestion region.
- suggestion region association module 68 may, in certain examples, override techniques of outputting candidate character strings for display within text suggestion regions in accordance with a correspondence between a probability of each of the plurality of candidate character strings and a rank of each of the plurality of text suggestion regions. Rather, in some examples, suggestion region association module 68 may output a particular candidate character string for display within a particular text suggestion region based at least in part on a determination that the particular candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region. Accordingly, computing device 2 may enable a user to predict within which of the plurality of text suggestion regions the particular candidate character string will be displayed, thereby possibly enabling the user to select the particular candidate character string from the particular text suggestion region without attending to others of the text suggestion regions.
- techniques described herein may enable a user to develop a set of skills that allows the user to utilize the suggestion interface as a natural extension of the keyboard. That is, because the techniques may enable a user to predict that a particular sequence of keys will yield a particular suggestion in a particular location, the techniques may enable the user to enter those keys and select the suggestion without attending to the other presented suggestions. Moreover, the techniques may help improve a user's confidence in the suggestion system to produce useful results, thereby encouraging the user to utilize the suggestion system as a text input accelerator. In this way, according to techniques described herein, computing device 2 may increase the rate at which the user may enter text, thereby increasing usability of computing device 2.

Description
- Some computing devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablet computers, etc.) may provide a graphical keyboard as part of a graphical user interface for composing text (e.g., using a presence-sensitive input device and/or display, such as a touchscreen). The graphical keyboard may enable a user of the computing device to enter text (e.g., an e-mail, a text message, or a document, etc.). For instance, a display device of a computing device may output a graphical (or "soft") keyboard that enables the user to enter data by indicating (e.g., by tapping) keys displayed at a presence-sensitive input device.
- Some computing devices may determine one or more candidate character strings (e.g., candidate words included in a lexicon, such as a dictionary) based on data entered using the graphical keyboard. In some examples, a computing device may output a set of the candidate character strings for display at a plurality of text suggestion regions that enable the user to select (e.g., auto-complete) a character string by indicating (e.g., tapping or gesturing over) a text suggestion region of a display that displays a desired character string. In certain examples, each of the text suggestion regions may be associated with a rank, each rank corresponding to a relative probability of a candidate character string displayed within the text suggestion region. According to certain techniques, the computing device may output candidate character strings for display within the text suggestion regions based on a correspondence between a probability that the candidate character string represents a word included in the lexicon and the rank of a respective text suggestion region. For instance, the computing device may output a highest-probability candidate character string for display within a highest-ranked text suggestion region of the display, a second-highest probability candidate character string for display within a second-highest ranked text suggestion region, etc.
- However, such techniques may have certain drawbacks. For example the text suggestion region within which a particular candidate character string is displayed may change due to, for example, different lexical contexts of the candidate character string (e.g., different preceding words). As such, a user may not be able to predict within which text suggestion region a particular candidate character string will be displayed in response to particular gesture input. Accordingly, such techniques may require a user to attend to (e.g., view) each of the plurality of text suggestion regions to determine within which text suggestion region a desired candidate character string is displayed, thereby reducing the speed at which the user is able to interact with the computing device to enter text.

FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of a computing device that may be used to output a candidate character string within a particular text suggestion region, in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure. - In general, this disclosure is directed to techniques that may improve the ease with which a user may enter text using text suggestion regions by consistently outputting a particular candidate character string for display within a same text suggestion region each time a computing device receives gesture input to select one or more characters of the particular candidate character string. For example, a computing device may output, for display (e.g., at a presence-sensitive display), a graphical user interface including a graphical keyboard and a plurality of text suggestion regions (e.g., two, three, five, or more text suggestion regions). In response to receiving an indication of user input to select one or more keys of the graphical keyboard, the computing device may determine a plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., candidate words included in a lexicon, such as a dictionary) based on characters associated with the selected keys. The computing device may output a set of the candidate character strings for display within the text suggestion regions that enable the user to select (e.g., auto-complete) a candidate character string by indicating (e.g., by tapping) one of the text suggestion regions.
- Rather than output a particular candidate character string for display within any one of a plurality of text suggestion regions based on a probability of the candidate character string that may change between instances of outputting the candidate character string, a computing device implementing techniques of this disclosure may consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within a same text suggestion region each time the computing device receives gesture input to select one or more characters of the particular candidate character string. For instance, the computing device may output a candidate character string for display within a particular text suggestion region based at least in part on determining that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region. As such, techniques of this disclosure may enable a user to predict within which text suggestion region the particular candidate character string will be displayed, thereby enabling the user to select the particular candidate character string from the particular text suggestion region without requiring the user to attend to (e.g., view) others of the text suggestion regions. In this way, techniques described herein may enable a computing device to increase the rate at which a user may enter text, thereby improving usability of the computing device.

Keys may represent a single character from a character set (e.g., letters of the English alphabet), or may represent combinations of characters. One example of a graphical keyboard may include a traditional "QWERTY" keyboard layout. Other examples may contain characters for different languages, different character sets, or different character layouts. As shown in the example ofFIG. 1 ,graphical keyboard 12 includes a version of the traditional "QWERTY" keyboard layout for the English language providing character keys as well as various keys (e.g., the "123" key) providing other functionality. - In some examples,
text display region 14 may include characters or other graphical content that are included in, for example, a text-message, a document, an e-mail message, a web browser, and the like. For instance,text display region 14 may include characters or other graphical content that are selected by a user via gestures performed atUI device 4. In some examples, text suggestion regions 16 may each display a candidate character string, such as a candidate word included in a lexicon (e.g., the English language). As illustrated in the example ofFIG. 1 , text suggestion regions 16 may be different regions of GUIs 10 thantext display region 14. In other examples, text suggestion regions 16 may be a single region of GUIs 10, and may include one or more regions of GUIs 10 that are the same astext display region 14. Similarly, while illustrated as separate regions in the example ofFIG. 1 , text suggestion regions 16, in some examples, may be a single region of GUIs 10. -
UI module 6 may causeUI device 4 to displaygraphical keyboard 12 and detect gesture input, such as gesture input detected at one or more locations ofUI device 4 that display one or more keys ofgraphical keyboard 12, and one or more locations ofUI device 4 that display text suggestion regions 16. Additionally,text suggestion module 8 may determine one or more candidate character strings based at least in part on one or more characters associated with selected keys ofgraphical keyboard 12.Text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to display one or more of the candidate character strings within one or more of text suggestion regions 16, in accordance with techniques described herein. - According to techniques of the present disclosure,
computing device 2 may improve the ease with which a user may enter text (e.g., within text display region 14) using text suggestion regions (e.g., text suggestion regions 16) by consistently outputting a particular candidate character string at a same text suggestion region eachtime computing device 2 receives gesture input to select one or more characters of the particular candidate character string. For example, using techniques of this disclosure, a computing device may output a candidate character string for display within a particular text suggestion region based at least in part on a determination, by computingdevice 2, that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed at the particular text suggestion region. As such, techniques of this disclosure may enable a user to predict within which text suggestion region the particular candidate character string will be displayed, thereby increasing the rate at which the user provide gesture input to select the particular candidate character string. - As illustrated in
FIG. 1 ,UI device 4 may output GUIs 10 includinggraphical keyboard 12 for display atUI device 4. UI device 4 (e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive display) may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12. In response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected at location 18 (e.g., an indication of a touch input detected at location 18),UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 as a first selected key ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as by determining thatlocation 18 corresponds to a location ofgraphical keyboard 12 that displays "T"key 22. Similarly, in response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected at location 20 (e.g., an indication of a touch input detected at location 20),UI module 6 may select "H" key 24 as a second selected key ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as by determining thatlocation 20 corresponds to a location ofgraphical keyboard 12 that displays "H" key 24. While illustrated inFIG. 1 with respect to multiple gesture inputs detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12 includes functionality of a gesture keyboard,UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 and "H" key 24 in response to receiving an indication of a single continuous gesture input detected fromlocation 18 tolocation 20 such thatUI device 4 detects the presence of an input unit (e.g., a finger, pen, stylus, and the like) fromlocation 18 tolocation 20 ofgraphical keyboard 12. -
Text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings in response to selecting "T" key 22 and "H" key 24 as selected keys ofgraphical keyboard 12. Each respective candidate character string may include a group of predicted characters that includes characters associated with the selected keys. For instance, in the example ofFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings for which the characters "T" and "H", corresponding to "T" key 22 and "H" key 24 respectively, are a prefix. As illustrated inFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings including character string 26 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "this"), character string 28 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "the"), character string 30 (i.e., the character string including the plurality of characters "that"), and character string 32 (i.e., the character string character string including the plurality of characters "than"). While illustrated with respect to four candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32,text suggestion module 8 may determine other numbers of candidate character strings, such as two candidate character strings, five candidate character strings, fifty candidate character strings, or other numbers of candidate character strings. -
Text suggestion module 8 may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on a probability of each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings. For instance, as described in further detail below,text suggestion module 8 may compare each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character stings with a language model to determine a probability of each respective candidate character string, such as a probability that each respective candidate character string represents a word included in a lexicon (e.g., the English language) or a probability that each respective character string represents a next word of a multi-word phrase. As illustrated in the example ofFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. - As illustrated,
text suggestion module 8 may associate each of the plurality of candidate character strings with a respective rank, such that ranked ordering 34 represents an ordered arrangement of the plurality of candidate character strings according to a probability of each respective candidate character string. For instance, in the example ofFIG. 1 , ranked ordering 34 includesfirst rank 36,second rank 38,third rank 40, andfourth rank 42. In this example, ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 each correspond to a probability that an associated candidate character string represents a next word of a multi-word phrase included intext display region 14. In addition, in the example ofFIG. 1 , ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 are arranged in descending order of probability, such thatrank 36 is associated with a candidate character string corresponding to a highest relative probability that the candidate character string represents a next word of the multi-word phrase included intext display region 14, and rank 42 is associated with a candidate character string corresponding to a lowest relative probability that the candidate character string represents a next word of the multi-word phrase included intext display region 14. In other examples,text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 such that ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42 are arranged in ascending order of probability. Similarly, in some examples, such as when the plurality of candidate character strings includes more than four candidate character strings or fewer than four candidate character strings,text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 as including more than four ranks or fewer than four ranks. In certain examples,text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 34 as including a number of ranks equal to the number of candidate character strings included in the plurality of candidate character strings, such that each of the plurality of candidate character strings is associated with a rank within ranked ordering 34. In some examples, a rank of candidate character strings included within a ranked ordering (e.g., ranked ordering 34) may be implicit in the ordering the candidate character strings included within the list of candidate character strings, and actual ranking values need not necessarily be stored in associated with candidate character strings. - In addition,
text suggestion module 8 may associate each oftext suggestion regions 16A-16C with a respective rank corresponding to a probability of a candidate character string that is displayed within the respective one of text suggestion regions 16. In this way,text suggestion module 8 may determine a ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16, such that each of text suggestion regions 16 is associated with a rank corresponding to a respective rank of an associated candidate character string (e.g., a rank stored in a data structure associated with the candidate character strings, an ordering or cardinality of the plurality of candidate character strings that corresponds with an ordering or cardinality of the rankings of text suggestion regions 16, etc. For instance, in the example ofFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 determines a ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16 such thattext suggestion region 16A corresponds to a highest probability candidate character string,text suggestion region 16B corresponds to a second-highest probability candidate character string, andtext suggestion region 16C corresponds to a third-highest probability candidate character string. In other examples,text suggestion module 8 may determine different ranked orderings of text suggestion regions 16, such as a ranked ordering that associatestext suggestion region 16B with a highest probability candidate character string. In general,text suggestion module 8 may determine any ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16, such that each respective one of text suggestion regions 16 corresponds to a different rank that associates the respective one of text suggestion regions 16 with a respective rank within the plurality of candidate character strings. -
Text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to output a set of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 for display atGUI 10A within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to output candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30 for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34. That is, in this example,text suggestion module 8 may determine thatcandidate character string 26 is associated with rank 36 (i.e., a highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated withtext suggestion region 16A (i.e., a highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16). In response,text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to outputcandidate character string 26 for display withintext suggestion region 16A. Similarly,text suggestion module 8 may determine thatcandidate character string 28 is associated with rank 38 (i.e., a second-highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated withtext suggestion region 16B (i.e., a second-highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16), and may causeUI device 4 to outputcandidate character string 28 for display withintext suggestion region 16B. Finally,text suggestion module 8 may determine thatcandidate character string 30 is associated with rank 40 (i.e., a third-highest rank of ranked ordering 34) that matches a rank associated withtext suggestion region 16C (i.e., a third-highest rank of the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16), and may causeUI device 4 to outputcandidate character string 30 for display withintext suggestion region 16C. In this way,text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to output a set of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 (i.e., the set of the plurality of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30) for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with ranked ordering 34. -
UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at a location ofUI device 4 to select a candidate character string displayed within one of text suggestion regions 16. For example,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocation 44 ofGUI 10A. In response,UI module 6 may select candidate character string 26 (i.e., the candidate character string displayed withintext suggestion region 16A), such as by determining thatlocation 44 corresponds to a location ofUI device 4 that displaystext suggestion region 16A.UI module 6 may causeUI device 4 to output candidate character string 26 (i.e., the candidate character string including the characters "this") for display withintext display region 14. In this way,computing device 2 may enable a user ofcomputing device 2 to select (e.g., auto-complete) a character string for display withintext display region 14 without requiring the user to provide gesture input to select keys ofgraphical keyboard 12 associated with each of the characters included in the character string. - In addition, as
UI module 6 receives indications of gesture input to select one or more keys of graphical keyboard 12 (e.g., indications of gesture input detected atlocations text suggestion module 8 may determine a context of the gesture input responsive to whichtext suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings. As illustrated inFIG. 1 ,context 33 may include a representation of character "T" corresponding to the selected "T" key 22 and a representation of character "H" corresponding to the selected "H" key 24 (e.g., character string "th" in this example). As another example, the context of the gesture input may include a representation of one or more the keys ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as "T" key 22 and "H" key 24. As another example, the context of the gesture input may include a representation oflocation 18 and a representation oflocation 20 ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to a touch point oflocation 18 of UI device 4 (e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive device, such as a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive screen) and a centroid of a group of pixels of corresponding to a touch point oflocation 20 ofUI device 4. As yet another example, the context of the gesture input may include a representation of a relative location ofGUI 10A corresponding tolocation 18 ofgraphical keyboard 12 and a relative location ofGUI 10A corresponding tolocation 20 ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as an X-Y coordinate pair of each of alocations GUI 10A, such as an upper-left corner ofGUI 10A. In some examples, the context may include previous and/or subsequent words and/or characters relative to one or more selected characters. In certain examples, the context may include information such as a type and/or version of an application used to input characters, a type of input field used to input characters (e.g., text input field, password field, date field, or other types of fields), a time of day at whichcomputing device 2 receives the indication of the gesture input, a geographical location of computingdevice 2 while computingdevice 2 receives the indication of the gesture input, etc. In general,text suggestion module 8 may determine the context of the gesture input as any characteristic of the gesture input that identifies, characterizes, and/or accompanies the gesture input responsive to whichtext suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings. In some examples, the context may uniquely identify the gesture input. - In certain examples,
text suggestion module 8 continuously determines the context of the gesture input asUI module 6 receives indications of gesture input to select one or more keys ofgraphical keyboard 12. In some examples,text suggestion module 8 initiates and/or restarts the determination of the context of the gesture input in response to receiving gesture input to select a next word or sentence, such as gesture input to select a delimiter key (e.g., a space key, a punctuation key, or other delimiter key) ofgraphical keyboard 12. - In some examples,
text suggestion module 8 generates a data structure that associates the context of the gesture input with a selected candidate character string and the particular text suggestion region within which the selected candidate character string was displayed while selected. For instance, in the example ofFIG. 1 ,text suggestion module 8 may determinecontext 33 ofcandidate character string 26 as the character string "th" (i.e., a character string including characters associated with "T" key 22 and "H" key 24). In response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected atlocation 44 ofGUI 10A to selectcandidate character string 26 displayed withintext suggestion region 16A,text suggestion module 8 may generate and/or maintain a data structure that associates the character string "th" (i.e.,context 33 in this example) with candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this") andtext suggestion region 16A (i.e., the particular text suggestion region within which candidate character string was displayed while selected). In some examples,text suggestion module 8 may associatecontext 33,candidate character string 26, and a location oftext suggestion region 16A (e.g., x-y coordinates ofUI device 4 corresponding to textsuggestion region 16A).Text suggestion module 8 may similarly maintain the data structure to associate other candidate character strings (i.e., candidate character strings other than candidate character string 26) with a context of gesture input and a particular text suggestion region. In this way,text suggestion module 8 may generate and/or maintain a data structure that associates multiple candidate character strings (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands, or other numbers of candidate character strings) with an associated with context of gesture input and a particular text suggestion region. - According to techniques described herein,
text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure asUI module 6 receives subsequent gesture input to select one or more keys of graphical keyboard 12 (i.e., gesture input received afterUI module 6 selects the candidate character string and causesUI module 4 to output the candidate character string for display within text display region 14). In examples wheretext suggestion module 8 determines that the received gesture input corresponds to a context included in the data structure (e.g., context 33),text suggestion module 8 causesUI device 4 to output the candidate character string associated with the context for display within the particular text suggestion region associated with the context. Accordingly,text suggestion module 8 may causeUI device 4 to consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within a same text display region eachtime UI module 6 receives an indication of gesture input that corresponds to the context of gesture input associated with the particular candidate character string. - For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 1 ,UI module 6 may causeUI device 4 tooutput GUI 10B for display (e.g., at a presence-sensitive display). In the example ofFIG. 1 ,GUI 10B represents an example of GUIs 10 output byUI module 6 for display subsequent to receiving the indication of gesture input detected atlocation 44 and selectingcandidate character string 26 for display withintext display region 14. That is, in the example ofFIG. 1 ,GUIs computing device 2outputs GUI 10A and receives an indication of gesture input to selectcandidate character string 26 displayed withintext suggestion region 16A at a first time, then subsequently outputsGUI 10B at a second time (e.g., during a subsequent power-cycle ofcomputing device 2, during a separate instance of a particular application executing on one or more processors ofcomputing device 2, or during an instance of a separate application executing on one or more processors of computing device 2). - As illustrated in
FIG. 1 ,UI module 6 may causeUI device 4 tooutput GUI 10B includinggraphical keyboard 12,text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16. As illustrated by like numerals,graphical keyboard 12,text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16 ofGUI 10B may be substantially similar tographical keyboard 12,text display region 14, and text suggestion regions 16 ofGUI 10A. As illustrated,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12. In response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected atlocation 19,UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 as a first selected key ofgraphical keyboard 12. Similarly, in response to receiving the indication of gesture input detected atlocation 21,UI module 6 may select "H" key 24 as a second selected key ofgraphical keyboard 12. - In response to selecting "T" key 22 and "H" key 24 as selected keys of
graphical keyboard 12,text suggestion module 8 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings for which the character string "th" is a prefix. For instance, as was similarly described with respect to the example ofGUI 10A,text suggestion module 8 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. -
Text suggestion module 8 may determine ranked ordering 46 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32, such as by comparing each of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32 to a language model to determine a probability of each of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. For instance,text suggestion module 8 may compare each ofcandidate characters text display region 14. In this example,text suggestion module 8 determines that candidate character string 32 (i.e., the candidate character string "than") is associated with a highest relative probability (e.g., a highest probability within the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32) that the candidate character string represents the next word of a multi-word phrase displayed withintext display region 14. That is, in this example,text suggestion module 8 determines that the multi-word phrase "Better than" is associated with a higher probability than each of the multi-word phrases "Better this," "Better the," and "Better that" corresponding to candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30, respectively. Similarly, in this example,text suggestion module 8 determines thatcandidate character string 26 is associated withsecond rank 38 indicating a second-highest probability candidate character string,candidate character string 28 is associated withthird rank 40 indicating a third-highest probability candidate character string, andcandidate character string 30 is associated withfourth rank 42 indicating a fourth-highest probability candidate character string. -
Text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 32 (i.e., the character string "than"), associated withfirst rank 36, corresponds to textsuggestion region 16A (i.e., the text suggestion region associated with a rank corresponding to a highest probability candidate character string). Similarly,text suggestion module 8 may determine that candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this"), associated withsecond rank 38, corresponds to textsuggestion region 16B. -
Text suggestion module 8 may determine a context of the gesture input responsive to whichtext suggestion module 8 determines the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. For example,text suggestion module 8 may determinecontext 33 of the gesture input as the character string "th" corresponding to characters associated with selected "T" key 22 and selected "H" key 24, respectively.Text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure that associates a context of received gesture input with candidate character strings and text display regions to determine whether the determined context of the gesture input (e.g.,context 33 in this example) corresponds to a context included within the data structure. For instance,text suggestion module 8 may traverse the data structure to determine that context 33 (e.g., character string "th") corresponds to candidate character string 26 (i.e., the character string "this") andtext suggestion region 16A (i.e., a particular text suggestion region within whichcandidate character string 26 was previously displayed while selected). - In response to determining that the
context 33 corresponds tocandidate character string 26 andtext suggestion region 16A,text suggestion module 8 may causeUI module 6 to outputcandidate character string 26 for display withintext suggestion 16A. That is, as discussed above,text suggestion module 8 may determine thatcandidate character string 26 is associated withsecond rank 38 corresponding to textsuggestion region 16B andcandidate character string 32 is associated withfirst rank 36 corresponding to textsuggestion region 16A. Rather than outputcandidate character string 26 for display withintext suggestion region 16B,text suggestion module 8 may output, based at least in part on determining thatcandidate character string 26 was previously selected while being displayed withintext suggestion region 16A,candidate character string 26 for display withintext suggestion region 16A. Similarly, rather than outputcandidate character string 32 for display withintext suggestion region 16A,text suggestion module 8 may output, based at least in part on determining thatcandidate character string 26 was previously selected while being displayed withintext suggestion region 16A,candidate character string 32 for display withintext suggestion region 16B. - In this way,
computing device 2 may consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within the same text suggestion region each time the computing device outputs the candidate character string for display within a plurality of text suggestion regions. As such, according to techniques described herein,computing device 2 may enable a user to predict within which of a plurality of text suggestion regions a particular candidate character string will be displayed in response to particular gesture input, and thereby increase the rate at which a user may use the text suggestion regions to enter text. -

Examples ofprocessors 50 may include any one or more of a microprocessor, a controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry. - One or
more storage devices 58 may be configured to store information withincomputing device 2 during operation.Storage device 58, in some examples, is described as a computer-readable storage medium. In some examples,storage device 58 is a temporary memory, meaning that a primary purpose ofstorage device 58 is not long-term storage.Storage device 58, in some examples, is described as a volatile memory, meaning thatstorage device 58 does not maintain stored contents when the computer is turned off. Examples of volatile memories include random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memories known in the art. In some examples,storage device 58 is used to store program instructions for execution byprocessors 50.Storage device 58, in one example, is used by software or applications running on computing device 2 (e.g., text suggestion module 8) to temporarily store information during program execution. -

In the example ofFIG. 2 ,UI device 4 may be a presence-sensitive display. In some examples, a presence sensitive display may detect an object, such as an input unit (e.g., user's finger, pen, stylus, etc.) at and/or near the screen of the presence-sensitive display. As one example range, a presence-sensitive display may detect an input unit that is within 2 inches or less of the physical screen of the presence-sensitive display. The presence-sensitive display may determine one or more locations (e.g., (x,y) coordinates) of the presence-sensitive display at which the input unit was detected. In another example range, a presence-sensitive display may detect anobject 6 inches or less from the physical screen of the presence-sensitive display and other exemplary ranges are also possible. The presence-sensitive display may determine the location of the display selected by an input unit using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques.

A lexicon may be represented by one or more data structures, such as by one or more of an array, a list, a tree, or other data structures. For example,language model 70 may include a lexicon stored in a trie data structure. In some examples,language model 70 may be a default dictionary installed oncomputing device 2. In certain examples,language model 70 may include a group of predefined phrases installed oncomputing device 2. In other examples,language model 70 may include multiple sources of lexicons, which may be stored atcomputing device 2 or stored at one or more remote computing devices that are accessible tocomputing device 2 via one or more communication channels. In some examples,language model 70 may be implemented in the firmware ofcomputing device 2. -
Language model 70 may include language model frequency information such as n-gram language models. An n-gram language model may provide a probability distribution for an item xi (letter, word, punctuation character or other delimiter) in a contiguous sequence of items based on the previous items in the sequence (i.e., P(xi | xi-(n-1),... ,xi-1 )). For instance, a bigram language model (an n-gram model where n=2), may provide a probability that the letter "i" follows the sequence of letters "th". As another example, a bigram language model may provide a probability that the word "this" follows the word "better". In some examples,language model 70 includes a lexicon trie with integrated language model frequency information. For instance, each node of the lexicon trie may include a representation of a letter and a probability value. -
Computing device 2 may includecontext data structure 72 that associates a representation of a context of a gesture input, a candidate character string, and a text suggestion region. For instance,context data structure 72 may associate a context of a gesture input, such as one or more selected characters associated with the gesture input, a candidate character string that includes the one or more selected characters, and a particular text suggestion region of a GUI within which the candidate character string was previously displayed while selected. Examples ofcontext data structure 72 may include, but are not limited to, an array, a table, a list, a tree, a hash table, or other data structures capable of associating a representation of a context of gesture input, a candidate character string, and a text suggestion region. In some examples,context data structure 72 andlanguage model 70 may be represented as a single data structure. - Techniques of the present disclosure may improve the speed with which a user can enter text into a computing device. Using techniques of this disclosure, a computing device may consistently output a particular candidate character string for display within the same text suggestion region each time the computing device outputs the candidate character string for display in response to receiving particular gesture input. As such, according to techniques described herein, the computing device may enable a user to predict within which of a plurality of text suggestion regions a candidate character string will be displayed in response to a particular gesture input, thereby enabling the user to quickly and efficiently select the candidate character string.

UI module 6 may output for display at UI device 4 a graphical user interface including a plurality of text suggestion regions. For instance,UI module 6 may output the plurality of text suggestion regions 16 for display within GUIs 10. In some examples,UI module 6 may output a graphical keyboard, such asgraphical keyboard 12, for display atUI device 4 within GUIs 10. In response to receiving an indication of gesture input detected at a location ofUI device 4 that displaysgraphical keyboard 12,UI module 6 may select one or more keys ofgraphical keyboard 12 as selected keys. For example, in response to receiving indications of gesture input detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12,UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 and "H" key 24 as selected keys ofgraphical keyboard 12. - Candidate
character string module 64 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on one or more characters associated with the one or more selected keys. For instance, candidatecharacter string module 64 may accesslanguage model 70 to determine a plurality of candidate character strings, such as a plurality of candidate words included in a lexicon (e.g., the English language). As an example, candidatecharacter string module 64 may accesslanguage model 70 to determine the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. In some examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings for which the one or more characters associated with the one or more selected keys are a prefix. - Candidate
character string module 64 may determine a context of the gesture input, responsive to which candidatecharacter string module 64 determines the plurality of candidate character strings. For example, the context may include a representation of one or more keys ofgraphical keyboard 12, such as "T" key 22 and "H" key 24. As another example, the context of the gesture input may include a representation of one or more characters associated with selected keys, such as a representation of the character "T" corresponding to the selected "T" key 22 and a representation of the character "H" corresponding to the selected "H" key 24. As another example, the context may include a representation of the location ofUI device 4 that detects the gesture input, such as a representation oflocation 18 and a representation oflocation 20 of graphical keyboard 12 (e.g., a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to each of the touch points oflocations 18 and 20). - In some examples, candidate
character string module 64 may include within context data structure 72 a numerical indication (e.g., a counter or other numerical representation) of a number of times that a particular candidate character string is selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region. For instance, candidatecharacter string module 64 may increment and/or decrement a counter that represents the number of timescandidate character string 26 is selected while being displayed withintext suggestion region 16A. - As one example, candidate
character string module 64 may increment the counter in response to receiving user input to select the candidate character string while the candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region. Similarly, candidatecharacter string module 64 may decrement the counter in response to determining that no user input is received to select the candidate character string while the candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region. For instance, candidatecharacter string module 64 may decrement the counter in response to receiving subsequent indications of gesture input to select keys ofgraphical keyboard 12 when the candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region (e.g., the user continues to type). - As another example, candidate
character string module 64 may decrement the counter in response to receiving an indication of gesture input to select a different candidate character string displayed within a different text suggestion region while the particular candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region. In certain examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may decrement the counter by a first amount (e.g., by a value of one) in response to determining that no user input is received to select the candidate character string while the candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region, and may decrement the counter by a second, different amount (e.g., by a value of two) in response to receiving an indication of gesture input to select a different candidate character string displayed within a different text suggestion region while the particular candidate character string is displayed within the particular text suggestion region. - In certain examples, candidate
character string module 64 may compare the counter associated with a particular context to a threshold value, such as a value of one, three, five, ten, or other threshold values. In some examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may remove the data associated with the particular context and particular candidate character string in response to determining that the counter satisfies the threshold value (e.g., is less than and/or equal to the threshold value). -
Ordering module 66 may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings. For example, orderingmodule 66 may compare each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings tolanguage model 70 to determine a probability of each respective candidate character string, such as a probability that each respective candidate character string represents a word included in a lexicon, a next word of a multi-word phrase, and the like.Ordering module 66 may associate each of the plurality of candidate character strings with a respective rank, such that the plurality of candidate character strings are ranked in an ordered arrangement based at least in part on the determined probability of each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings. - In some examples, suggestion
region association module 68 may associate a set of the plurality of candidate character strings with the plurality of text suggestion regions (e.g., text suggestion regions 16) based at least in part on the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings. For example, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of text suggestion regions, such that each respective text suggestion region from the plurality of text suggestion regions is associated with a respective rank that corresponds to one of the ranks within the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings. Suggestionregion association module 68 may, in certain examples, each candidate character string that is associated with a rank that matches a rank of the plurality of text suggestion regions with the text suggestion region corresponding to the matching rank. Suggestionregion association module 68 may output the set of the plurality of candidate character strings for display within the associated text suggestion region. - In certain examples,
UI module 6 may receive an indication of a selection of a candidate character string. For instance,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at a location ofUI device 4 corresponding to one of the text suggestion regions. In response,UI module 6 may select the candidate character string associated with the text suggestion region (e.g., the candidate character string displayed within the selected text suggestion region). As another example,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at delimiter key (e.g., a space key, a punctuation key, etc.) ofgraphical keyboard 12 and may select one of the candidate character strings and associated text suggestion regions in response (e.g., the candidate character string and/or text suggestion region associated with the highest probability). - In response to receiving the indication of the selection of a particular candidate character string (e.g., candidate character string 26) while the particular candidate character string is displayed within a particular text suggestion region (e.g.,
text suggestion region 16A), candidatecharacter string module 64 may maintaincontext data structure 72 to reflect the selection. For example, candidatecharacter string module 64 may traversecontext data structure 72 to determine whether the context of the gesture input, responsive to which candidatecharacter string module 64 determined the plurality of candidate character strings, is included withincontext data structure 72. In some examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may determine that the context of the gesture input is not included withincontext data structure 72. In such examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may insert within context data structure 72 a representation of each of the context, candidate character string, and the particular text suggestion region within which the candidate character string was displayed while selected. In other examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may determine that the context of the gesture input is included withincontext data structure 72. In such examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may update (e.g., increment) a counter associated with the context to indicate that the candidate character string was again selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region. In certain examples,context data structure 72 may not include a counter. -
UI module 6 may receive an indication of subsequent gesture input to select one or more keys ofgraphical keyboard 12. For instance,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12. In response,UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 (e.g., corresponding to gesture input detected at location 19) and "H" key 24 (e.g., corresponding to gesture input detected at location 21) as selected keys ofgraphical keyboard 12. - Candidate
character string module 64 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on one or more characters associated with the selected keys (e.g., the character "T" associated with "T" key 22 and character "H" associated with "H" key 24).Ordering module 66 may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings. For example, orderingmodule 66 may determine ranked ordering 46 of the plurality of candidate character strings 26, 28, 30, and 32. The ranked order may associate each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings with a respective rank (e.g., ranks 36, 38, 40, and 42), such that the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings includes an ordered arrangement of the plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on the determined probability of each respective candidate character string. - Suggest
region association module 68 may associate at least one of the candidate character strings with a text suggestion region based at least in part on a determination, by suggestionregion association module 68, that the at least one candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region. For example, suggestionregion association module 68 may traverse the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., ranked ordering 46) to determine whether a representation of at least one of the plurality of candidate character strings are included withincontext data structure 72. In some examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine that a representation of a particular candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings is included withincontext data structure 72. In such examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine whether the context of the gesture input, responsive to which candidatecharacter string module 64 determined the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., the context "th" associated with gesture input detected atlocations context data structure 72. In examples where suggestionregion association module 68 determines that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string, suggestionregion association module 68 may associate the particular candidate character string with the particular text suggestion region associated with the particular candidate character string withincontext data structure 72, and may output the particular candidate character string for display within the particular text suggestion region. - In some examples, suggestion
region association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when suggestionregion association module 68 determines that the context of the gesture input matches the context of gesture input as indicated withincontext data structure 72. For instance, suggestion region may determine that the context of gesture input including the character string "th" matches the context of gesture input including the character string "th" indicated withincontext data structure 72. In certain examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when the context of the gesture input as compared to the context of gesture input as indicated withincontext data structure 72 satisfies a threshold. For example, in examples where the context of gesture input is represented as a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to one or more touch points of the gesture input, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine that the context of the gesture input corresponds to the particular candidate character string when each centroid is less than (or equal to) a threshold distance from the corresponding centroid as indicated by the context withincontext data structure 72. - In this way, suggestion
region association module 68 may associate a particular candidate character string with a particular text suggestion region based on a determination, by suggestionregion association module 68, that the particular character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region. In some examples, the association of the particular candidate character string with the particular text suggestion region may not correspond to the ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings with respect to the ranked ordering of the plurality of text suggestion regions. For instance, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine that a rank of particular candidate character string (e.g., candidate character string 26), as determined based on the probability of the particular candidate character string within the plurality of candidate character strings, corresponds to a first text suggestion region (e.g.,text suggestion region 16B). Rather than output the particular candidate character string for display within the first text suggestion region (e.g.,text suggestion region 16B), suggestionregion association module 68 may output the particular candidate character string (e.g., candidate character string 26) for display within a second text suggestion region (e.g.,text suggestion region 16A) based on a determination that the particular candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the second text suggestion region. - In this way, suggestion
region association module 68 may, in certain examples, override techniques of outputting candidate character strings for display within text suggestion regions in accordance with a correspondence between a probability of each of the plurality of candidate character strings and a rank of each of the plurality of text suggestion regions. Rather, in some examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may output a particular candidate character string for display within a particular text suggestion region based at least in part on a determination that the particular candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within the particular text suggestion region. Accordingly,computing device 2 may enable a user to predict within which of the plurality of text suggestion regions the particular candidate character string will be displayed, thereby possibly enabling the user to select the particular candidate character string from the particular text suggestion region without attending to others of the text suggestion regions. In this way, techniques described herein may enable a user to develop a set of skills that allows the user to utilize the suggestion interface as a natural extension of the keyboard. That is, because the techniques may enable a user to predict that a particular sequence of keys will yield a particular suggestion in a particular location, the techniques may enable the user to enter those keys and select the suggestion without attending to the other presented suggestions. Moreover, the techniques may help improve a user's confidence in the suggestion system to produce useful results, thereby encouraging the user to utilize the suggestion system as a text input accelerator. In this way, according to techniques described herein,computing device 2 may increase the rate at which the user may enter text, thereby increasing usability ofcomputing device 2. -

In some examples, presence-sensitive input device 85 may be physically positioned on top ofdisplay device 83 such that, when a user positions an input unit over a graphical element displayed bydisplay device 83, the location at which presence-sensitive input device 85 corresponds to the location ofdisplay device 83 at which the graphical element is displayed. - As shown in

In some examples,projector 96 may determine one or more user inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at projector screen using optical recognition or other suitable techniques and send indications of such user input using one or more communication units tocomputing device 80. -
Projector screen 98, in some examples, may include a presence-sensitive display 100. Presence-sensitive display 100 may include a subset of functionality or all of the functionality ofUI device 4 as described in this disclosure. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 100 may include additional functionality. Projector screen 98 (e.g., an electronic whiteboard), may receive data from computingdevice 80 and display the graphical content. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 100 may determine one or more user inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) atprojector screen 98 using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques and send indications of such user input using one or more communication units tocomputing device 80. -

In this way,processor 102 may output the graphical content for display at one or more of the remote devices. In some examples, one or more of the remote devices may output the graphical content at a presence-sensitive display that is included in and/or operatively coupled to the respective remote devices. - In some examples,
computing device 80 may not output graphical content at presence-sensitive display 82 that is operatively coupled tocomputing device 80. In other examples,computing device 80 may output graphical content for display at both a presence-sensitive display 82 that is coupled tocomputing device 80 bycommunication channel 86A, and at one or more remote devices. In such examples, the graphical content may be displayed substantially contemporaneously at each respective device. For instance, some delay may be introduced by the communication latency to send the data that includes the graphical content to the remote device. In some examples, graphical content generated by computingdevice 80 and output for display at presence-sensitive display 82 may be different than graphical content display output for display at one or more remote devices. -

Upon receiving the data,visual display device 106 may cause presence-sensitive display 108 to display the candidate character string within the particular text suggestion region of the graphical user interface. In this way,processor 102 may output the candidate character string for display at presence-sensitive screen 108, in accordance with techniques of this disclosure. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of a computing device that may be used to output a candidate character string within a particular text suggestion region, in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure. For purposes of illustration only, the example operations are described below within the context ofcomputing device 2, as shown inFIGS. 1 and2 . -
Computing device 2 may output, for display, a graphical user interface including a graphical keyboard and a plurality of text suggestion regions (110). For example,UI module 6, executing on one ormore processors 50 ofcomputing device 2, may output, for display at UI device 4 (e.g., a presence-sensitive and/or touch-sensitive display),GUI 10A includinggraphical keyboard 12 and text suggestion regions 16.Computing device 2 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at a presence-sensitive display to select one or more keys of the graphical keyboard (112). For instance,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocations graphical keyboard 12. In response,UI module 6 may select "T" key 22 (e.g., corresponding to the indication of gesture input detected at location 18) and "H" key 24 (e.g., corresponding to the indication of gesture input detected at location 20). -
Computing device 2 may determine a context of the received gesture input (114). For instance, candidatecharacter string module 64, executing on one ormore processors 50, may determine a context of the indication of the received gesture input. As an example, the context may include an indication of one or more selected keys of graphical keyboard 12 (e.g., "T" key 22 and "H" key 24), an indication of one or more characters associated with the one or more selected keys of graphical keyboard 12 (e.g., character "T" associated with "T" key 22 and character "H" associated with "H" key 24), an indication of one or more locations ofUI device 4 corresponding to the received gesture input (e.g., a centroid of a group of pixels corresponding to touch inputs detected atlocations 18 and 20), and the like. -
Computing device 2 may determine a plurality of candidate character strings based at least in part on the received indication of the gesture input (116). For example, candidatecharacter string module 66 may accesslanguage model 70 to determine a plurality of candidate words included in a lexicon (e.g., the English language) for which the one or more characters associated with the received gesture input are a prefix. For instance, candidatecharacter string module 66 may determine the plurality of candidate character strings 26 (i.e., the character string "this"), 28 (i.e., the character string "the"), 30 (i.e., the character string "that"), and 32 (i.e., the character string "than") for which the character string "th", associated with selectedkeys -
Computing device 2 may output one or more of the plurality of candidate character strings for display within the plurality of text suggestion regions (118). For instance, in some examples, orderingmodule 66, executing on one ormore processors 50, may determine a ranked ordering of the plurality of candidate character strings.Ordering module 66 may determine the ranked ordering based at least in part on a probability of each respective candidate character string from the plurality of candidate character strings, such as by comparing each respective candidate character string withlanguage model 70 to determine the respective probability. In certain examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may associate one or more of the plurality of candidate character strings with the plurality of text suggestion regions based on a correspondence between a rank associated with a respective candidate character string and a rank associated with a particular text suggestion region. For instance, suggestionregion association module 68 may associatecandidate character string 26 withtext suggestion region 16A based on a correspondence betweenrank 36 associated withcandidate character string 26 within ranked ordering 34 and a rank associated withtext suggestion region 16A within a ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16 (e.g., a highest rank within the ranked ordering of text suggestion regions 16). Similarly, suggestionregion association module 68 may associatecandidate character string 28 withtext suggestion region 16B andcandidate character string 30 withtext suggestion region 16C. Suggestionregion association module 68 may output a set of the plurality of candidate character strings (e.g., the set of candidate character strings including candidate character strings 26, 28, and 30) for display within text suggestion regions 16 in accordance with the associations. -
Computing device 2 may receive an indication to select one of the candidate character strings (120). For example,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocation 44 to selectcandidate character string 26 displayed withintext suggestion region 16A.Computing device 2 may maintain a data structure to associate the context of the gesture input, the candidate character string, and the text suggestion region within which the candidate character string was displayed while computingdevice 2 received the indication of gesture input to select the candidate character string (122). For instance, suggestionregion association module 68 may updatecontext data structure 72 to associate the context of gesture input "th",text suggestion region 16A, andcandidate character string 26. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of a computing device that may be used to output a candidate character string within a particular text suggestion region, in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure. For purposes of illustration only, the example operations are described below within the context ofcomputing device 2, as shown inFIGS. 1 and2 . -
Computing device 2 may output, for display, a graphical user interface including a plurality of text suggestion regions (130). For instance,UI module 6 may output, for display at UI device 4 (e.g., a presence-sensitive display),GUI 10B including the plurality of text suggestion regions 16.Computing device 2 may receive an indication of gesture input detected at a presence-sensitive input device (132). For example,UI module 6 may receive an indication of gesture input detected atlocations UI device 4.Computing device 2 may select, based at least in part on the indication of the gesture input, a candidate character string from a plurality of candidate character strings (134). For instance, candidatecharacter string module 64 may accesslanguage model 70 to determine a plurality of candidate words included in a lexicon for which one or more characters associated with the gesture input are a prefix. In some examples, candidatecharacter string module 64 may traverse the plurality of candidate character strings and may select one of the plurality of candidate character strings. -
Computing device 2 may determine that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region from the plurality of text suggestion regions (136). For example, suggestionregion association module 68 may traversecontext data structure 72 to determine whethercontext data structure 72 associates the candidate character string with a context of the gesture input and a particular text suggestion region from the plurality of text suggestion regions. In certain examples, suggestionregion association module 68 may determine that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region in response to determining thatcontext data structure 72 associates the candidate character string with a context of the gesture input and a particular text suggestion region. When suggestionregion association module 68 determines that the candidate character string was previously selected while being displayed within a particular text suggestion region, suggestionregion association module 68 may output the candidate character string for display within the particular text suggestion region. - The techniques described in this disclosure may be implemented, at least in part, in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.
