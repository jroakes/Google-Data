Abstract
Disclosed are methods for disambiguating an input phrase or group of words. An implementation may include receiving a phrase as an input to a processor. The received phrase may be presented on a display device. The received phrase may be determined to be ambiguous based on a threshold uncertainty in either a definition or a pronunciation related to the phrase. An indication may be provided that a word in the phrase is the cause of the ambiguity. A menu of words with each word incorporating at least one diacritic mark to a word in the received phrase to disambiguate the received phrase may be presented. A word from the menu of words may be selected and presented on the display device.
Description
- There are languages that allow phrases to be written with the short vowel sounds removed and replaced with diacritic marks to alert the user of a proper pronunciation or definition. However, often times because an author is familiar with the subject matter of the material that they are writing, the author may not enter the diacritic marks to a word that may be ambiguous in view of the context of the surrounding text. As a result, a reader may not completely understand the written material.
- According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a method may include receiving a phrase as an input to a processor. The phrase may include a group of symbols representing words. The received phrase may be presented on a display device. The received phrase may be determined to be ambiguous based on a presence or absence of diacritic marks in individual symbols in the received phrase. An indication may be presented that the phrase is ambiguous. A menu of phrases that incorporate at least one diacritic mark to at least one word in the received phrase to disambiguate the received phrase may be presented.
- According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a method may include determining, by a processor, that a textual input received from an input device is ambiguous. The textual input may include at least one word. A repository of unambiguous words containing words similar to the received textual input may be assessed. The unambiguous words may include at least one diacritic mark that eliminates the ambiguity associated with the received textual input. Words from the repository that eliminate the ambiguity associated with the received textual input may be selected. Each of the selected words may correspond to a respective word in the received textual input. A menu containing the selected respective word for the corresponding words in the received textual input may be populated. The menu containing the unambiguous word may be associated with the corresponding ambiguous word in the textual input.
- Advantageously, the presently disclosed subject matter may provide more concise content that is more easily understood by a reader. This provides the benefit of an improved user experience when viewing the content. Additionally, the various described training methods may allow for increased user input and influence over proper grammatical form and pronunciation of the respective languages.
- Additional features, advantages, and implementations of the disclosed subject matter may be set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description include examples and are intended to provide further explanation without limiting the scope of the claims.
- The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosed subject matter, are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification. The drawings also illustrate implementations of the disclosed subject matter and together with the detailed description serve to explain the principles of implementations of the disclosed subject matter. No attempt is made to show structural details in more detail than may be necessary for a fundamental understanding of the disclosed subject matter and various ways in which it may be practiced.

FIG. 5 shows a computer according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. - Disclosed is an input method editor (IME) that may automatically detect ambiguous phrases in a textual message (for example, a web site dialog, e-mail editor, word processing application, a blog editor or the like), highlight the ambiguous phrase in the editor presentation, and present options to disambiguate the ambiguous phrase.
- Diacritization is the insertion of markings to a letter in a word to signal to a reader the sound that the letter is to make when pronounced. In some languages, the pronunciation may also affect the meaning of the word or phrase that includes the word. Languages particularly susceptible to the generation of ambiguous phrases without diacritization include Arabic, Aramaic, Farsi and Hebrew (although the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to any specific language or script). These languages include phrases that can be written with the short vowel sounds removed and replaced with diacritic marks to alert the user of a proper pronunciation or definition. As used herein, a phrase may be a word or a plurality of words. For example, in Arabic
- could mean both “carrots” and “islands”, but the meaning is usually clear from the context. For example, a discussion of a garden would tend to imply the “carrots” usage, so no diacritic marks may be needed. However, the Arabic phrase
could mean: “I drank”, “She drank” or “It was drunk.” A review of the sentence or passage context may be needed to understand which meaning the writer intended, or in some cases it may not be completely possible to determine a specific intended meaning, so diacritics are helpful to make the sentence more precise. For example, if the writer intended the meaning to be “I drank” the writer may write
or if the writer meant “She drank” may write
or, if the writer intended “It was drunk” may write
using the appropriate diacritic marks. These different words may be selected based on the determined intended meaning of the sentence. -
FIG. 1 shows a flowchart of a process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Theprocess 100 may present an approach to alert a writer that a phrase in a sentence may be ambiguous to a reader. For example, a system may analyze inputted text to determine whether any phrases are ambiguous. The inputted text may be parsed to identify phrases and compare the phrases to a dictionary of phrases (obtained, for example, through training) In more detail, a phrase may be received as an input by a processor (110), and the phrase may include a group of symbols representing words. A symbol may be a word, letter or character. The received phrase may be in any language. For example, the phrase may be in a language selected from a group of languages consisting of Arabic, Aramaic, Farsi and Hebrew. Alternatively, the phrases may be symbols such as characters used in languages, such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and the like. The received phrase may be presented on a display device. With reference toFIG. 3A , thepresentation 300 may include, for example, acursor 310 and the receivedphrase 320, which, in this example, is an Arabic phrase. A processor may determine that the received phrase is ambiguous (120). The determination of ambiguity may be based, for example, on a threshold uncertainty in either a definition or a pronunciation related to the phrase or on the presence or absence of diacritic marks in the individual symbols in the received phrase. For example, a determination that a received phrase is ambiguous may be made by comparing the received phrase to a plurality of unambiguous phrases. In which case, the threshold uncertainty may be a binary unambiguous or ambiguous threshold. These phrases may be previously determined to be disambiguated and may be stored in a database. A result of the comparison may be a match between at least one of the plurality of unambiguous phrases and the received phrase. In response to the comparison result, words in the matching phrase may be selected that are different from words in the received phrase. In some implementations, a numerical threshold uncertainty value may be determined for a particular based on certain weightings assigned based on particular words used in the phrase or a word order of the phrase. For example, a probability of uncertainty, such as 50%-70% may be used as a minimum threshold uncertainty value for determining that an input is ambiguous, or the meaning is uncertain. - An indication that a word in the phrase is ambiguous may be provided on the display device (130). The ambiguous word may be highlighted, for example, by changing the color of the text, the color of the background, bolding the text, changing the font, or some other indication that the word may be ambiguous. See, for example,
element 325 inFIG. 3B . A menu of words that incorporate at least one diacritic mark to a word in the received phrase to disambiguate the received phrase may be presented on the display device (140). A menu may be generated for each word that contributes, or, in other words, causes or leads to the ambiguity in the ambiguous phrase. For example, the menu may be populated for each of the respective selected words from the matching phrase. The menu of words may be a single word with a diacritic mark. A menu may be presented in response to an input associated with the indicated ambiguous word; for example, when a user places an input device, such as a mouse, a finger, stylus or the like, near or over the indicated ambiguous word, as shown inFIG. 3C , amenu 330 may be presented. - An example of how a received phrase may be determined to be ambiguous may be by comparing the received phrase to a plurality of unambiguous phrases. In response to a comparison result that provides a match from the plurality of phrases to the received phrase, words in the matching phrase that are different from words in the received phrase may be selected. A menu for each of the respective selected words from the matching phrase may be populated, and may be presented on a display device adjacent to the ambiguous word.
- Another example of how a received phrase may be determined to be ambiguous may be based on the context of the phrase. The phrase context may be determined based on for example, a definition of the subject word in the received phrase. The determined context of the received phrase may be compared to a context list. One or more matching contexts from the context list may be selected. Context lists are discussed in more detail below. A list of known unambiguous phrases associated with the matching contexts may be retrieved from the matching context list stored in data storage. A menu may be populated with words from the list of unambiguous phrases.

FIG. 2 shows a flowchart of a process according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Aprocess 200 may respond to a textual input received from an input device, or from another source, such as another remote device, user device, server or other device that may transmit text. The textual input may, for example, include at least one word. With reference toFIG. 3A , thepresentation 300 may include, for example, acursor 310 and the receivedphrase 320, which is an Arabic phrase. In response to the received textual input, a processor may determine that the received textual input may be ambiguous (210). A repository of unambiguous phrases containing words similar to the received textual input may be accessed (220). The phrases or words from the repository that eliminate the ambiguity associated with the received textual input may be selected (230). Each of the selected words or phrase may correspond to a respective word or phrase in the received textual input, and may include at least one diacritic mark that eliminates the ambiguity associated with the received textual input. A menu containing the respective selected unambiguous word or phrase for the corresponding words in the received textual input may be populated (240). The menu containing the unambiguous word or phrase may be associated with the corresponding ambiguous word in the textual input (250). In response to the determination that the received textual input is ambiguous, a visual indication may be provided on a display device of a word in the plurality of words or phrase contributing the ambiguity of the received textual input (260). With reference toFIG. 3B , thepresentation 300 may include, for example, acursor 310 and the visual indication of theword 325 contributing to the ambiguity. Theword 325 may be a phrase that may contain one or more words. A menu may be presented adjacent to the corresponding ambiguous word. For example, amenu 330 as shown inFIG. 3C may be presented below the ambiguous word. Of course, themenu 330 may alternatively be presented above or beside the ambiguous word. In response to a selection of a word or phrase presented in the menu, the ambiguous word or phrase may be replaced with an unambiguous word from the presented menu (280). The replacedword 326 may be shown in a disambiguated receivedtextual input 320′. - In an example, a received textual input may be determined to be ambiguous by comparing a respective word or phrase in the received textual input to a list of unambiguous words or phrases. The respective word in the received textual input may be determined to be ambiguous, if none of the unambiguous words are an exact match to the respective word. Individual unambiguous words from the list of unambiguous words that correspond to the respective word may be selected for populating a menu of words. Alternatively, unambiguous phrases from the list of unambiguous phrases that correspond to the respective phrase may be selected for populating a menu of phrases. Unambiguous words may be considered to correspond to the respective ambiguous word, if the unambiguous word has a substantially similar letter or symbol order as the respective ambiguous word. For example, 5 of 8 of the letters are in the same order in the words under consideration. Alternatively, an ambiguous phrase may have a similar number of words as an unambiguous phrase, and individual words or symbols in the respective phrase may be analyzed based on the presence or absence of diacritic marks.
- In another alternative, data storage may contain a set of context categories, such as sports, movies, feminine, masculine, asexual, dance, music, literature, electronics, business, personal matters, formal matters, and the like. A context of the received textual input may be identified. For example, the context of the received textual input may be determined based on a historical use of the received textual input by a user. Alternatively, the context of the received textual input may be determined using on a contributor database. A contributor may be an arbitrary, random user that provides examples of ambiguous textual inputs. The contributor data base may contain a contextual explanation of the received textual input.
- Using the identified context, a list of context-related symbols, words or phrases may be retrieved from data storage. A symbol, word or phrase in the received textual input may be compared to words in the list of context-related words. A symbol, word or phrase in the received textual input may be identified as ambiguous in response to the comparison failing to find a matching symbol, word or phrase in the list of the context-related symbols, words or phrases. A match may relate to letters and/or diacritic marks in the compared symbols, words or phrases.
- Once a phrase is determined to be ambiguous, the editor may highlight the ambiguous phrase to alert the user of the potentially ambiguous phrase. The alert may take the form of highlighting the text using either a different text color, a different font, surrounding the word with some sort of box or the like. For example, when a phrase is detected as ambiguous, the ambiguous phrase may be highlighted, and a menu of the options the system determines should replace the inputted phrase may be presented. The options may be a list of diacritized phrases that are determined to be likely appropriate for the context and to be unambiguous. A user may select the appropriate diacritization to disambiguate the phrase.
- The list of options may be refined based on the context of the previously entered text or subject matter, and may be adjusted based on user interaction with the menu. For example, the system may dynamically adjust the number of suggestions based on the user's usage of the drop down windows. The options presented may change as some pronunciations or phrases become obsolete. Alternatively, the system may highlight ambiguous text, but also allow a user to manually enter the appropriate diacritization to disambiguate the phrase.
- Training of the context dictionaries, ambiguous phrases, unambiguous phrases and the like may be performed according to a number of techniques. A dictionary may be generated, for example, by training a recognizer that may analyze usage of the phrases by other writers, such as usage in web sites, blogs, comments, ratings, electronically published documents and other publically available sources, using inputs to a game generated for the purpose of obtaining ambiguous terms, log-in dialogs that accept ambiguous phrases. For example, a web site or document may be scanned to determine if the phrase is used with diacritic marks. The system may determine that phrases with which diacritic marks are more frequently used may indicate that the phrase without the diacritic marks may be ambiguous. For example, if through training, a phrase is found to have diacritic marks approximately 70% of the time and the same phrase is input by a user of the IME without any diacritic marks, the system may indicate that the user's phrase may be ambiguous. In other words, it may be inferred that more frequently diacritized words are more often considered ambiguous without the diacritic marks.
- Alternatively, the system may determine a phrase's ambiguity based on the context in which the phrase is used, and a list of context-related words may be retrieved from data storage. For example, a system may analyze the phrase and the context in which it is being used. The system may compare the context and the phrase to determine how many different diacritizations have been noted for the particular phrase in this specific context. The system may only count those instances in which diacritics were noted for the phrase.
