Description
§ 1. backgrounds of the present invention
§ 1.1 technical fields
The present invention relates to advertising network, for example the online advertisement network.
§ 1.2 background technologies
The traditional media such as TV, wireless device, newspaper and magazine is used in known advertisement.Unfortunately, even when possessing about the demography research of the typical audience of various medium (media outlet) with fully reasonably during hypothesis, the advertiser thinks that still their many advertising budgets only are to be wasted.In addition, it is very difficult discerning and eliminate such waste.
Recently, the advertisement of the medium by having more interactivity catches on.For example, along with the number of using the Internet is increased sharply, the potential strong mode for advertisement is taken in medium that the advertiser will provide by the Internet gradually and service as.
Interactive Advertising is directed to the chance that receives spectators for the advertiser provides the advertisement that makes them.That is to say, because targeted ads may be relevant (for example with the needs of inferring from some User Activities, content in the document relevant to the search inquiry of search engine with the user, that asked with the user is relevant etc.), so targeted ads more may be useful to the final user.Search engine has used the key word of the inquiry orientation to transmit relevant advertisement.For example, the AdWords of the Google company (being called " Google ") of California mountain scene city (Mountain View)
TMThe ad system transmission is directed to the advertisement from the key word of search inquiry.Similarly, the targeted content advertisement transferring system has been proposed.For example, the title of submitting on Dec 6th, 2002 is " METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANTADVERTISEMENTS " and with the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number of Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and PaulBuchheit classify as the inventor: 10/314,427 (its full content is incorporated herein by reference, and be called " ' 427 application "); And the title submitted to is " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTS BASED ONCONTENT " and with Darrell Anderson on February 26th, 2003, Paul Buchheit, Alex Carobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number of Deepak Jindal and NarayananShivakumar classify as the inventor: 10/375,900 (its full content is incorporated herein by reference, and be called " ' 900 application ") have been described and have been used to distribute (serve) and method and apparatus such as the relevant advertisement of the content of the document of webpage.For example, used AdSense such as Google
TMThe advertisement transferring system of the targeted content of ad system comes serve ads on webpage.
As can be from above recognizing because the advertisement relevant with content of text in the text document and with key word in the search inquiry relevant advertisement consider active user's interest potentially, be useful so distribute such advertisement.Therefore, such online advertisement increased popularity get up.
No matter whether or how targeted ads, the advertiser compensates content owner's (more generally being called " document publisher " or " Web publisher ") usually, and may distribute entity by make-good.Such compensation just takes place when serve ads (flashing), perhaps such compensation may be subjected to the constraint such as condition precedents such as selection, conversions at every turn.Each compensation of selecting (so-called " pay-per-click (pay per click) ") is current to catch on.For example, when the user selected advertisement, they were brought to (for example, their browser load) usually from the correspondent advertisement landing page that this advertisement linked.The advertiser selects to compensate Web publisher for this.
Though AdSense such as Google
TMService made Web publishing person can obtain advertising income, but the publisher often can't estimate effectively that how many advertisement funds storing in their medium can obtain or what content their user is finally seeking.That is to say that the publisher attracts under obtainable advertisement fund and the client's interested target through being everlasting, come content creating based on interest supposition or demonstration from the advertiser.Yet, the publisher can with the estimation advertiser and the technology of client's interest be inaccurate, may cause the relevant suboptimum decision of the content type created with the publisher.

As another example, on the contrary, tour site may not know that aqualung apparatus company wishes to be used to pay extra-pay by remaining money in their market budget, to obtain the interested reader of aqualung apparatus.Therefore, if when the publisher entrusts the free-lancer to write just may to serve publisher and publisher's client better about the article of rebreather apparatus, tour site just may be write the article about hotel, Paris in addition.
In each of foregoing example, suppose for the readership of two types of content identical, because the imperfection information relevant with advertiser demand, thus the publisher on advertising income, obtained than can obtain still less, and the client of publication has received the advertisement of not too being correlated with.
In view of the above problems, auxiliary publisher such as Web publisher understands advertiser's demand better, and especially excess advertiser demand is useful.

§ 4.4 is according to the operation example in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention
As the illustrated examples of the operation in the foundation embodiments of the invention,, suppose known three advertisers' typical expenditure rate and budget as describing on Fig. 7.
Determining the amount of " surplus " advertiser budget and should measuring to assemble becomes vertical classification (notion).Then, based on such as in AdSense they history expenditure and " the expectation unspent advertiser budgets " of flashing, the amount of " surplus " advertiser budget being converted into every vertical classification at the total amount of selecting and/or directed notion transforms.
Advertiser Joe ' s Plumbing720 is ready to come the come $100/ month (hurdle 710) via content-targeted, and directed key word is such as " drainpipe blocks (drain clog) " and " plumber (plumbers) " (hurdle 711).Past they only can the can $50/ month (hurdle 713).These advertisements (use vertical classification) are classified as " pipework (Plumbing) " vertical classification (hurdle 712).The result estimates every month surplus.
Advertiser Bill ' s Pipe Fitters 721 is ready to come the come $50/ month (hurdle 710) via content-targeted, but expenditure rate (hurdle 713) that only can the Sheng Cheng $40/ month.Bill ' s Pipe Fitters721 is the directed notion such as " (toilet clog) blocked in the lavatory " and " spilling water (overflow) " (hurdle 711).This vertical classification also is " pipework " (hurdle 712), and produces the unspent amount (hurdle 714) of every Yue $10.
At last, advertiser Wallpaper City 722 is ready to come the come $75/ month (hurdle 710) via content-targeted, and pays its whole budgets (hurdle 713) before every month the 3rd week routinely.Therefore, their every month unspent amount (hurdle 714) be.(in fact, unspent amount may be a negative value, the indication location advertising exceed the quata provide.) they use the key word (hurdle 711) such as " (redecorating) repaiied in refitting " and " family increase build (home additions) ", and are sorted in " wallpaper (Wallpaper) " vertical classification (hurdle 712).
The total price of " possible surplus " may be converged into and be content type or vertical classification." possible surplus " that " pipework " has from two advertiser's De $60 is worth (hurdle 714 in the row 720 and 721)." possible surplus " that " wallpaper " has from advertiser's De $0 is worth (hurdle 714 in the row 722).
Next can determine " maximum value chance ".Use is at the advertiser's of content type bid CPC (clicking the cost of their advertisement) and page CTR (click-through rate of shown every advertisement) at every turn, determines the eCPM expected cost of per thousand advertisements (with location advertising thus) (shown in) at each of " possible surplus " classification (vertical classification).Should be noted that " cost " to the advertiser is generally equal to publisher " income ".
Because the CTR of the bid of every click average unit cost (CPC) of known " pipework " vertical classification Ju You $1 and 2%, will generation $20 (to publisher's gross income, to advertiser's " cost ") so expect that 1000 advertisements are flashed.For example, though the eCPM of the calculating of " wallpaper " vertical classification Ju You $30, because " the possible surplus " of plan is not worth, so the estimation of this $30 may be devalued or ignore.
If for example another vertical classification of " furniture (Furniture) " is calculated as " possible surplus " amount of Ju You $90, but the eCPM of Ju You $15, then it may come " pipework " afterwards aspect publisher's demand property.Opposite, if " window (Windows) " vertical classification is calculated as " possible surplus " amount with plan De $25, but the eCPM of Ju You $35, then it may rank the first aspect publisher's demand property.Do not having under the situation of eCPM input, may be only total amount by " possible surplus " in each vertical classification notion that sorts.Therefore, can provide or not provide eCPM alternatively, produce different publisher's decisions to the publisher.In addition, in the decision of the notion in making the content that relevant publisher will issue, the publisher can use " possible surplus " ratio to eCPM.
Another kind of optional method can be, allow the publisher (for example to provide default eCPM threshold value or scope,＜,,＞etc.), so that to be used for any given vertical classification or the eCPM of classification be and so under the situation not studying in great detail, filter the chance that they are presented.
After watching the vertical classification zone with maximum ad potentiality, the content that the publisher can select it to be about to issue is pointed to those fields, so that maximize the investment repayment of their advertising space.For example, home decor publisher can sign in in the ad serve system front end (ASFE), and find that " pipework " is this month advertiser close friend's content type in " family and garden (Home and Gardon) " vertical classification, and " wallpaper " not.Use this information, home decor publisher can be write the article of title for " 10Easy Plumbing Fixes "." pipework " advertisement may automatically be matched this new available inventory via the ad serve system that the advertisement relevant with content is provided.Each new click in advertiser's advertisement all can feed back to the calculating of their " possible surplus " budget.At last, the advertisement vertical classification as " possible surplus " may fall from the chance tabulation along with the increase of distribution and ad click.
§ 4.5 conclusions
Owing to lack suitable medium inventory, the advertiser often can't pay its whole marketing budgets.For example, aqualung apparatus company may attempt attempt $1000 and put their advertisement on the website of relevant aqualung apparatus, but only find that the webpage of enough being correlated with comes Zhi Fangjiazhi $750 advertisement--Qi Yude $250 becomes surplus.Give the publisher by (for example, online and/or off-line) generality of unsatisfied advertiser demand is understood, embodiment according to the invention allows them more effectively with its content creating or obtain and point to the inventory that is suitable for advertisement available.This has increased publisher's income, helps the advertiser to reach its marketing target, and provides the advertisement more relevant with publisher's content for publisher's client.
