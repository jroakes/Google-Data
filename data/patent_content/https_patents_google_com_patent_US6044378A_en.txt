Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and system for recording and managing relationships between elements of collections which may include previously stored elements.
- the invention further relates to a method and system for managing document descriptors and relationships of documents relative to one another.
- Information in many organizations is held in digital form in repositories which are not part of the same data library, the same computing systems or even the same administrative domain. This has hampered access to the information held in those separate repositories, even though the information held separately may be related.
- an organization may have information residing in completely different data processing systems. These different data processing systems may be in place as a result of combining previous projects, or because of mergers or acquisitions of companies having different data processing systems. It is a common occurrence that valuable data resides and is used in separate and distinct libraries, computing systems or administrative domains.
- a problem with conventional access control methods for file systems in such environments is that they fail to provide sufficient flexibility or scalability for these types of complex enterprises.
- service organizations providing aircraft maintenance to both military and commercial customers need to administer authorization policies which differ for different customers, which must persist over decades, and which may evolve over the years.
- Such requirements cannot be satisfied with subsystems like IBM's program product RACF or with any of the access control mechanisms that have evolved for UNIX-like file systems.
- Cabrera et al. employs a table 60, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, in the database 16 which relates a file 19 in the file system 17 to attributes about the file held in the database table 60.
- One column 63 in the Cabrera et al. database table is a column for an "external file reference" (efr) data type.
- the efr data type contains information identifying a server (e.g., server i) that controls the file (e.g., 70 and 72).
- the efr data type binds the database tuple 61 to the file via the server name and file name 70.
- FIG. 1 shows a Cabrera et al.
- FIG. 2 shows a structure in which the table 60 and its associated database management system 15, are coupled to various file servers 17.
- Cabrera et al. can safely bind information in file systems into object instances conforming to formal object models, and can provide referential integrity for those files.
- Cabrera et al. is limited to safely binding only files in the file systems.
- Organizations having heterogeneous data stores need more than just referential integrity for collections of files. They also need to provide flexible yet rigorous access control for the data elements, or targets, in the heterogeneous data stores.
- They need to support data models conducive to an enterprise system, such as information which is represented in a directed acyclical graph (dag) form.
- a document model for example, is a natural model for information held in heterogeneous stores. Documents can be readily handled by a library service subsystem executable on one or more electronic digital computers, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,185 to Antognini et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.
- Access Control for Large Collections A generalized access control method for large collections is disclosed in H. M. Gladney, Access Control For Large Collections, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (April 1997), hereinafter "Access Control for Large Collections," which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the Access Control for Large Collections reference describes a robust document access control method within the limits of a single library subsystem. This access control method improves over known access control methods, as discussed in section 4.6 of Access Control for Large Collections. However, more is needed than this conventional access control method to support access control for information stored in the heterogenous enterprise-wide data storage environment described above, which typically span more than one library system.
- an object of the present invention is to provide robust and flexible control of relationships between objects held outside a single digital library.
- Another object of the present invention is to allow existing document collections to be used as if the present invention were not in place, while relating meta-data with elements in the collection designated to receive the enhanced relationship control.
- Still another object of the invention is to allow existing resource managers, such as existing file systems, to be used without modification, or with very little modification, and to require no change to data stored in existing collections.
- Yet another object of the invention is, generally, to provide a method and system for extending digital library services offered within a digital library to elements external to that library, such as storing relationships between those elements and providing access to those stored relationships.
- Still yet another objective of the invention is to provide for a repository holding a protected element to detect that the protected is related to another protected element and to find the relationship and other attribute records, with a high degree of efficiency.
- the present invention provides the ability to maintain these relationships with referential integrity.
- a method of associating a first element, a second element and meta-data related to the first element, wherein the first element is a protected element and is within a first protected resource, the second element is a protected element and the meta-data is within a relationship resource, and the first and second elements are bound to first and second index elements, respectively.
- the method comprises identifying the relationship resource in response to a request for the meta-data; sending a message to the relationship resource for return of the meta-data; locating the meta-data in response to the message; and sending the located meta-data to the protected resource, wherein the first protected resource and the relationship resource are in a distributed arrangement, and the relationship resource indicates a relationship between the first element the second element and the meta-data.
- the invention is also directed to a method of determining a relationship between a first protected element and a second protected element by using a relationship element, wherein the first and second protected elements are associated with first and second index elements, respectively.
- the method comprises reading the relationship element in response to a request for information related to the first protected element; and identifying the second protected element based on information read from the relationship element, wherein the relationship element is in a different data collection than at least one of the first protected element.
- the invention further relates to a system for providing relationship information for a first element.
- the system comprises a protected resource including a data manager and the first element, wherein the first element is a protected element bound to a first index; a second element which is a protected element bound to a second index; a relationship resource including a relationship resource manager and a relationship element; and a client which sends a request to the protected resource for information related to a relationship of the first element.
- the data manager In response to the request from the client, the data manager identifies the relationship resource manager based on the request for relationship information and based on the first index and sends a request to the relationship resource, and in response to the request from the data manager the relationship resource manager locates the requested relationship element and retrieves the requested relationship information for the protected element based on the relationship element.
- the relationship information identifies the second protected element bound to a second index, and the protected resource and the relationship resource are in a distributed arrangement.
- the invention further still relates to a method of creating a relationship element.
- the method comprises searching for a resource containing a first element having a reference to a second element; and automatically building a relationship element linking the first and second elements in response to finding the first element.
- the first and second elements are protected elements bound to first and second indicies, respectively, and at least one of the first and second elements is in a different data collection than the relationship element.
- the resource can be connected to the World-Wide Web (WWW), and the first element is an on-line document on the WWW and the reference in the first element is a citation link string identifying the second element as an on-line document on the WWW.
- the relationship element can be a link table in a digital library, the building being performed by recording in a row of the link table an identifier for the first element, an identifier for the second element and meta-data for facilitating library services.

- the object-oriented access control method and system, and method and system for managing relationships of elements, according to the present invention is described below using terms intended to conform with accepted international standards relating to access control. Specifically, the terms used herein generally conform, unless otherwise specified, with the definitions set forth in ISO 10181-3, Information Technology-Open Systems Interconnection-Security Frameworks for Open Systems: Access Control Framework (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the inventors of the present invention have found that the burdens associated with creating digital libraries according to the conventional methods described above, can be avoided by combining the ideas and structures inherent in two prior technologies.
- the first is taught by Cabrera et al., in the patent application entitled “Method and Means for Linking a Database System With a System for Filing Data” (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/449,600 filed May 24, 1995), which describes a tool for maintaining referential integrity between a relational database and external files.
- the second is taught by H. M. Gladney in A Storage Subsystem for Image and Records Management, IBM Systems Journal 32(3), pp. 512-40 (1993), whose essentials are implemented in IBM's DIGITAL LIBRARY products.
- FIG. 3 An object-oriented access control system according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 3.
- a client process 100 which acts as a surrogate for a subject S, is connected to a protected resource 200, and the protected resource 200 is connected via a communications channel 400 to a protecting resource 300.
- the protected resource 200 is a collection of procedures and data elements that is encapsulated so that the internal structure of a data element is accessible only to the procedures of the protected resource, and the procedures may be called only at designated domain entry points.
- the protected resource includes a data manager 210.
- the data manager 210 is a set of procedures which defines the sole external interface to what is stored. Those procedures are responsive to commands passed from outside the data manager.
- the data manager 210 includes an access control enforcement function (AEF) 211, which is coupled to a protected element store 220.
- the AEF 211 provides the only paths to protected elements in the protected element store 220, and constrains access as intended by proper authorities, getting information about these intentions from one or more access control decision functions (ADF) or protecting authorities, as indicated in a local catalog 230.
- the ADF is part of a protecting resource 300 which may be either local or remote with respect to the protected resource.
- the data manager 210 is an existing software entity, such as a file manager, which is used "as is", except for adding an extension or making some small modifications which are discussed below.
- the protected element store 220 contains protected elements such as protected element -- 1 (221) shown in FIG. 3.
- the protected element 221 is synonymous with the object "o" whose access is controlled, preferably according to the discretionary permission function B discussed in Access Control For Large Collections.
- the permission function B would conform to the Department of Defense (DoD) "Orange Book” (see DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, Department of Defense, National Computer Security Center DOD 5200.28 STD (Dec. 1985)) and possibly to the Bell-Lapadula model (see D. E. Bell and L. J. LaPadula, Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation, MTR 2997, MITRE Corporation, Bedford, Mass. (July 1975)).
- the local catalog 230 binds a protected element within the protected resource to a protecting resource which contains access control information for that protected element.
- the local catalog 230 is similar to the Cabrera et al. database table, in that the local catalog 230 points to, either directly or indirectly, an element outside the database.
- the element external to the database is a file in a file system.
- the local catalog 230 can refer not only to a file but can also refer to other types of elements.
- the elements referred to by the local catalog 230 of the present invention need not be part of the same protected resource or library, or even in the same computing system or administrative domain.
- the local catalog 230 must be protected and itself subject to access control, preferably being accorded access control according to the present invention.
- the local catalog 230 is a pre-existing structure having space to add a small amount of information.
- An example of a local catalog is a volume table of contents (VTOC) in an existing operating system, such as IBM's MVS operating system.
- VTOC volume table of contents
- an entry in the VTOC for the protected element a small amount of information, such as a single existing bit in an entry in the VTOC, is defined to indicate whether the protected element is to be handled according to the access control method linking of the present invention. For purposes of discussion, this bit will be referred to as the "enhanced access control method bit.” If the enhanced access control method bit is set, for instance, then the access control of the present invention is to be performed.
- the enhanced access control method bit is not set then the enhanced access control is not to be performed and the protected element is to be accessed as it normally would by a conventional data manager via its conventional access control process. That is, the choice indicated by the enhanced access control bit is between the enhanced access control process of the present invention and the conventional access process provided by the data manager.
- An exit routine for example, can be provided in the data manager 210 which is executed when the protected element is to be accessed. The exit routine checks the enhanced access control method bit in the VTOC entry for the requested protected element. If the enhanced access control method bit is not set, control is immediately returned to the accessing routine so as to minimize delays in obtaining access to the protected element, and access to the protected element is provided in the conventional manner.
- the present invention's enhanced access control method would be virtually imperceivable to a client process since control is immediately relinquished by the exit routine. By immediately returning to the accessing routine, a performance impact is avoided for elements in which the enhanced protection is not to be provided. In the typical situation this case is expected to occur more frequently than providing the enhanced protection.
- the exit routine would refer to another data structure which binds the protected element to a protecting resource, and ultimately to an access control element. Access control for the protected element would then proceed as discussed below in detail.
- the present invention is used with existing data collections, it is believed that many, if not initially all, elements in the collection will not be provided with enhanced access control. Accordingly, by providing an indicator that enhanced access control is not to be performed, such as when the enhanced access control method bit is not set, the existing data collections can be used without interruption by the present invention. Moreover, by immediately returning control to the existing data manager when it is determined that enhanced access control is not to be provided, virtually no performance penalty is incurred by having the enhanced access control in place.
- an existing VTOC could be altered to include all the information necessary to bind the protected element to the access control element, in which case it would be unnecessary to refer to a separate data structure.
- a local catalog would be a UNIX file system directory.
- Other instances of a local catalog will be readily recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the art.
- the local catalog contains a identifier for the protecting resource 300.
- the protecting resource 300 would provide the mapping between the protected elements and the access control elements.
- the protecting resource 300 is a library, as described in Antognini et al.
- the protected element ID can be an item/reptype/partnum triple.
- the local catalog entry identifies the item/part that represents the protected element.
- An item/part structure includes both optional part descriptors and optional item descriptors, any one of which can allude to arbitrarily complex library objects.
- the access control element identifier is held in the item record in the library database and is part of the item descriptor for the protected element. Accordingly, since the access control element is identified in the item descriptor, all parts which comprise that item will receive the same access control. In other words, if the protected element is a document comprised of a plurality of parts (e.g. a plurality of pages in a book), each page is provided the same access control, since the entire document (the book) has its access controlled by one access control element, namely, the access control element set forth in the item descriptor.
- the local catalog can also contain, as an extension of the identifier for the protecting resource 300, an identifier for the access control element which relates to the protected element.
- the local catalog itself must be provided access control. More particularly, each row in the local database must be protected and the subject of access control (either discretionary access control or mandatory access control). That is, a row in the local catalog should be accessible only via one or more new operations for maintaining such rows, which should permit change only by the owner of the protected row via discretionary or mandatory controls as the case may be, as provided for the protected element itself according to the present invention.
- the protected resource and client can each be comprised of software programs and/or data recorded on a computer-readable medium, and run on computing devices.
- a protecting resource such as protecting resource A (300) shown in FIG. 3, is similar to the protected resource, except that its data elements relate to protecting-elements rather than protected-elements. More specifically, a protecting resource 300 includes a protecting resource manager 310. The protecting resource manager 310 includes an access control decision function (ADF) 312 which performs an access control decision as described in detail in Access Control for Large Collections. Coupled to the ADF 312 is access control information (ACI) 320. The ACI 320 includes one or more access control elements, such as access control element -- 1 (321) and access control element -- 2 (322).
- ADF access control decision function
- ACI access control information
- the ACI 320 includes one or more access control elements, such as access control element -- 1 (321) and access control element -- 2 (322).
- Each access control element can describe one, or more likely a plurality of protected elements, as discussed in Access Control for Large Collections.
- the protecting resource 300 is a library, as described in Antognini et al.
- the access control element is an item within that library, or in other words is an access control item.
- the access control item includes parts, identified within the access control item, which can be, for instance, access control lists as described in Access Controlfor Large Collections.
- the protecting resource 300 can also contain pointers which point back to the protected resource 200 and the protected element 221, which may improve performance.
- the protecting resource can be comprised of software programs and/or data recorded on a computer-readable medium, and run on computing devices.
- the preferred embodiment of an object-oriented access control method and system of the present invention operates in an environment in which certain preparatory steps have been taken.
- the preparatory steps are themselves well known generically and include the following.
- a protected element 221, shown in FIG. 3, is created and resides within a protected element store 220 of the protected resource 200.
- An example of a protected element is a conventional file
- an example of the protected resource 200 is a conventional file system.
- protected elements and protected resources of the present invention are not limited to conventional files and file systems, respectively, and can include other structures as discussed later in more detail.
- the protected resource 200 indicates, via the information stored in the local catalog 230, that access control information 320 for the protected element is to be sought in some specific protecting resource 300.
- the protecting resource 300 includes an access control element, such as access control element 321 or 322.
- the access control element corresponds to one or more of the protected elements.
- Information held in an access control element is bound to the ID of the protected resource 200 and the ID of the protected element 221 getting the protection by the pointer just mentioned.
- Such information may include an arbitrary number of descriptors useful in search, and may further include links which represent relationships of the protected elements to other data objects, which individually may or may not be under access control according to the present invention. As a part of this, there will be a link to an access control element as described in Access Control For Large Collections. Also, permissions are recorded in the access control elements, as described in Access Control for Large Collection.
- a human user (hereinafter called the subject S) will login to the system to establish an authenticated identity and representative control blocks which are trustworthy within well-known limits.
- this can be done with well-known means.
- the product "Kerberos” is such a means. See, for example, S. J. Lunt, "Experiences with Kerberos (Authentication System),” Proceedings of USENIX Workshop, UNIX Security II, pp. 113-119 (March 1990), and also S. M. Bellovin and M. Merritt, "Limitations of the Kerberos Authentication System," Computer Communications Review 20(5), pp. 119-132 (October 1990).
- the access control system described in Access Control for Large Collection presumes that the access control element is part of the same library system as the protected element.
- Antognini et al. describes a library service subsystem which includes a library server connected to a catalog store.
- the catalog store includes a database used as a control point for access to anything in that library.
- An administrative table is used by the library server to validate a request from any library client within the library containing the library server.
- An administrative table entry includes privileges accorded to a specific patron of that library.
- the administrative table used in providing access control must be part of the library it services.
- the protected resource 200 and the protecting resource 300 are distributed with respect to one another.
- the protected resource 200 and protecting resource 300 in terms of Antognini et al., need not be part of the same library, or in the same computing system, or even in the same administrative domain.
- a communications channel 400 (hereinafter "channel") is required for connecting the two.
- the channel connecting protected resource 200 and protecting resource 300 is established by a well-known means for securing and otherwise managing interprocess communications, either locally or between processes executing remotely from each other.
- Interprocess messages include structure sufficient so that receivers can validate the content and provenance of these messages, and means for doing this are well-known.
- the channel is initially established using a method for sending a secure cryptogram over an insecure communication channel without prearrangement of a cipher key, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,770 to Diffie and Hellman.
- the security of the link can be maintained according to other more efficient methods, such as the encryption method according to the Data Encryption Standard (hereinafter "DES"), as set forth in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 46-1-1988, National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. (January 1977).
- DES Data Encryption Standard
- FIPS Federal Information Processing Standard
- the channel can be maintained indefinitely, or alternatively can be established as discussed above, each time a set of messages must be transferred between the protected and protecting resources.
- Some request by an application programming executing in some client process 100 on behalf of a subject S occurs. That is, the client process 100 sends a request for a specific operation to be performed on a specific protected element 221, for example.
- the request is sent to the data manager 210 of the specified protected resource which contains the protected element 221 (S100).
- the request contains an authenticated identifier of the requesting subject S, together with whatever descriptors of this subject S and the operating environment might be required for authorization, but which are not otherwise available to the protected resource and/or protecting resource.
- An example of a request from the client process 100 is an OPEN request to open a file, such a File -- 1, stored in the protected file system (i.e., protected resource 220).
- the portion of the data manager 210 which must act on the request (e.g., an OPEN subroutine which is part of the file subsystem) optionally augments the request with additional information which may be needed by the protecting resource 300, and sends to the protecting resource manager 310 whatever subset of this enlarged request the protecting resource manager 310 requires (S110).
- the enlarged request is received by the protecting resource manager 310, which provides that message to an access control decision function (ADF) 312 in the protecting resource manager 310.
- ADF access control decision function
- the ADF 312 decides whether or not access is to be granted by combining the request information with previously-stored access control information 320 as described in Access Control for Large Collections (S120). Based on the decision by ADF 312, the protecting resource manager 310 returns to the data manager 210 either in affirmation or denial for the request (e.g., YES/NO), optionally augmented with whatever additional information might be useful to the data manager 210 for executing the request (S130).
- an access control enforcement function (AEF) 211 in the data manager 210 executes the request (i.e., OPEN), returning to the client 100 whatever information the request calls for, optionally augmented by a success return code (S140, S150). If ADF 312 returns a NO, the data manager 210 returns a failure return code to the client 100, optionally augmented by additional information deemed useful to the client 100 (S140).
- AEF access control enforcement function
- the data manager 210 consults a local catalog 230, such as a VTOC within the file subsystem.
- a local catalog 230 such as a VTOC within the file subsystem.
- the table 240 containing an identifier for the requested protected element 221.
- the protected element 221 is File -- 1.
- File -- 1 is located in table 240 and an associated protecting resource is identified for File -- 1 within the VTOC. That is, the VTOC contains an entry associating File -- 1 with a specific one of one or more protecting resources.
- the VTOC can contain only a minimal field, such as a single bit, which indicates whether or not enhanced access control according to the present invention is provided. If so, a separate table is read containing a entry associating File -- 1 with a protecting resource. Accordingly, the local catalog 230 (i.e., VTOC) identifies the protecting resource associated with the protected element.
- protecting resource A is associated with File -- 1, and hence, is identified via the VTOC as the protecting resource for File -- 1. That is, within protected resource 200 the entry in the VTOC for File -- 1 identifies protecting resource A as containing the access control information 320 for File -- 1.
- access control element 321 is associated with File -- 1 in the VTOC.
- An example of an identifier for identifying the protecting resource is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- Data manager 210 upon determining that protecting resource A is the protecting resource for File -- 1, sends a message over the secure channel 400 to protecting resource A.
- the secure channel 400 is established prior to sending the message in order to provide for secure communications of the interprocess messages, although it could be established in response to a request to send the message.
- the message sent by data manager 210 is information identifying the requested protected element, File -- 1.
- Also included in the message is any information needed by ADF 312 for evaluating whether or not client 100 is to be given access to File -- 1.
- Protecting resource manager 310 provides to ADF 312 the required information from the message received from data manager 210.
- ADF 312 uses access control information (ACI) 320, and in particular uses access control element 321 corresponding to File -- 1, which contains privilege information for that protected element.
- ADF 312 evaluates the access control decision function based on the information contained in the received message and the access control element 321, as described in Access Control for Large Collections.
- ADF 312 returns either an affirmation or denial for the permission requested of the protected element (File -- 1) by client process 100. Accordingly, protecting resource manager 310 returns, over secure channel 400, a response indicating a YES or NO as to whether client process 100 is to be granted the permission requested with respect to File -- 1, along with other optional information protecting resource manager 310 may provide.
- Data manager 210 passes the request from client process 100 along with the YES/NO response from protecting resource manager 310 to access control enforcement function (AEF) 211. If and only if access is permitted, the AEF 211 performs the requested service and provides client 100 with access to the protected element.
- AEF 211 opens File -- 1 for client 100, if the response from protecting resource manager 310 is YES. However, if the response from protecting resource manager 310 is NO, then data manager 210 responds to the request of client process 100 by denying the request, and optionally returns other useful information to client 100.
- a specific permission can be requested with respect to the protected resource, and a YES/NO response returned for that specific permission.
- the request to the protecting resource 300 can just indicate the protected element, subject and environmental conditions, and the protecting resource 300 can return a table of operations/permissions, with the protected resource choosing the right permission from that table.
- the present invention allows application programs residing at the client 100 to access protected elements, without requiring modification to those application programs. Moreover, the protected elements (e.g., existing files) need not be copied or moved.
- the local catalog 230 By providing in the local catalog 230 a mapping between a protected element and one of one or more protecting resources, a highly flexible access control system is achieved without requiring any change to existing application programs or to protected elements (i.e., data) which may already exist. Moreover, only extensions to, or slight modifications to existing data managers are needed for the invention.
- the access control system and method of the present invention provides flexibility in implementing access control by allowing access to a protected element to be controlled according to one of a plurality protecting resources. Simply by changing the association between protected element ID and protecting resource ID in the local catalog 230, the protecting resource, and hence the access control attributes of the protected element can be changed.
- the present invention applies to local resources as well as remote resources within local and several remote resource pools being protected within a single assemblage.
- protected elements include, but are not limited to the following:
- a hierarchical data base such as a database managed by IBM's IMS
- data collections each connected by links in the structure of a directed acyclic graph.
- Directories such as a UNIX directory, for example.
- Ephemeral resources such as dynamic objects within Smalltalk or C++. These are processes running in local or remote computing systems, and can obtain similar protection to that provided for the kinds of objects already mentioned, except that for such dynamic processes referential integrity is not considered, rather the discussion of the present invention is directed to access control protections and to providing relationships for such protected elements. Such objects can themselves be distributed, with the stubs running in client machines and operative pieces in server machines.
- the interprocess protocols start with a client process being reliably bound to a user.
- This protocol has the client 100 send a request to a protected resource 200 which in turn sends an authorization checking request to a protecting resource 300 and receives a YES/NO answer.
- other satisfactory protocols can be used, and the present invention is not limited to the above-described interprocess protocol.
- the client-server isolation provides the separation which must otherwise be provided by operating system services (such as a supervisor state) to achieve full-proof protection.
- An alternative configuration is where the protecting resource is implemented so that it is arranged to run in the protected resource and the channel 400 is embedded therein.
- FIG. 5 shows another embodiment of the invention in which the client process 100 queries the protecting resource manager 310 for the ID of the data manager having the protected element and for the ID(s) of the protected element(s) of interest (S80).
- the protecting resource manager 310 sends to the client process 100, the ID of data manager 210, and optionally sends other data related to the protected element 221 (S90).
- client process 100 sends a request to data manager 210 for a specific operation to be performed on the protected element 221 contained in the protected resource 200 (S100).
- data manager 210 Upon receiving the request, data manager 210 sends a request to the protecting resource manager 310 (S110).
- Protecting resource manager 310 determines whether the client process 100 is to be given access to the protected element for the requested operation, by combining the request information with previously-stored access control information for the protected element (S120). The protecting resource manager 310 sends a response to data manager 210 indicating whether or not access for the requested operation is to be given to the requesting client process 100 (S130). Data manager 210 sends a response to requesting client process 100, either granting or denying the requested access to the protected element (S140). The client process 100 is provided access to the protected element for the requested operation if the response from protecting resource manager 310 indicates access for that operation is granted (S150).
- the client process 100 queries the protecting resource manager 310 for the ID of the data manager 210 having the protected element and for the ID(s) of the protected element(s) of interest (S80).
- the protecting resource manager determines whether the client is to be given access to the protected element for this and no other resource element access, and generates a difficult-to-guess token if the client is authorized to be provided access to the protected element (S85).
- the difficult-to-guess token must also have the properties of a signature, that is, being difficult to forge, and may optionally contain encrypted information that only the protecting element can decrypt. Further, by table lookup or other means, such as decryption, the protecting manager can determine whether it was the source of the token and for what element(s) it is a ticket. Security management by tickets and certificates are generally well-known technologies which are used here as conventionally intended.
- the protecting resource manager 310 sends to the client process 100 the ID of the data manager 210, and optionally sends other data related to the protected element and the difficult-to-guess token (S90). Based on the ID, client 100 sends a request to data manager 210 for a specific operation on a protected element contained by the protected resource 200 and includes in the request the ID and the token received from protecting resource manager 310 (S100). Data manager 210 sends a request to the protecting resource manager 310 which determines whether client 100 is to be granted access to the protected element (S110). Along with the message the token from the client is sent. The token can contain all the information needed to make the determination.
- the token can contain access bit patterns and further conditions such as time-of-check-to-time-of-use constraints, as well as the expected nonce and process identifiers.
- the determination is made by matching the received token with the protecting resource manager's stored token (S120). Alternatively, the determination can be made by combining the request information with previously-stored access control information for the protected element.
- the protecting resource manager 310 sends a response to data manager 210 indicating whether or not access is to be granted to the requesting client 100 (S130).
- Data manager 210 sends a response to the requesting client 100 either granting or denying access to the protected element based on the response from the protecting resource manager (S140).
- the client 100 is provided access to the protected element if the response from protecting resource manager 310 indicates access is granted (S150).
- protection can be extended by including with the token, signature and certification packaging, via well-known techniques, in those embodiments which do not permit token passing to a third party.
- the signature and certification packaging can be used by the protecting resource to double-check that the client has not passed the token to some third party which is now masquerading as the client.
- a first client process queries the protecting resource manager 310 for the ID of the protected resource 200 having the protected element of interest, sending additional subject authentication information and environmental information to the protecting resource manager 310 (S80).
- the protecting resource manager 310 determines whether access to the protected element is to be given for this and no other resource element access, and generates a difficult-to-guess token if Client -- 1 is authorized to access the protected element (S85).
- the protecting resource manager 310 sends Client -- 1 the IID of the protected resource, the difficult-to-guess token, and optionally sends other data related to the protected element (S90).
- Client -- 1 then sends the ID and token to Client -- 2 101 (S95).
- Client -- 2 sends a request to data manager 210 for a specific operation on a protected element contained by the data manager 210, and includes in the request the ID and token received from Client -- 1 (S100).
- the data manager 210 sends a request to the protecting resource manager 310, and includes the token received from Client -- 2 (S110).
- Protecting resource manager 310 determines whether Client -- 2 is to be given access to the protected element, by combining the request information with previously-stored access control information for the protected element, and by matching the received token with its stored token (S120).
- the protecting resource manager 310 Based on the access determination and if and only if the tokens match, the protecting resource manager 310 sends a response to data manager 210 indicating whether or not access is to be given to Client -- 2 (S130). Data manager 210 sends a response to Client -- 2 either granting or denying access to the protected element, based on the response from protecting resource manager 310 (S140). Client -- 2 is provided access to the protected element if the response from protecting resource manager 310 grants access (S150).
- step S90 the protecting resource 300 can return a set of responses, each identifying what is currently represented in the protecting resource 300. Accordingly, in a subsequent step the client can select some of the members of the set of responses based on the other data optionally sent, and for each selected member execute the steps following step S90.
- the handshaking between the client 100 and the protecting resource 300 might alternatively have the protecting resource mention only the subject ID and the protected element ID and receive a vector of permissions accompanied by a vector of reason codes associated with denials, and itself select the currently appropriate vector component(s).
- a good representation of the response here would be a vector of integers rather than a vector of bits, with "0" indicating permission and every other value indicating a reason for denying permission.
- the protecting resource would cache such vectors, thereby saving steps S90 and S100 in subsequent queries. This strategy is worthwhile if and only if the probability of use is conditionally increased by the occurrence of use for the subject and element in question.
- a structure similar to that described above for providing access control, can be used in a more general sense to provide for creating a federation of digital libraries by relating meta-data to an existing element, such as a protected element in protected resource 200, shown in FIG. 9, via managed links.
- meta-data refers to data describing an element.
- the table schema described in H. M. Gladney, External Design of a Document Storage Subsystem, IBM Research Report RJ 8267 (1991), which is incorporated herein by reference, are examples of usefutl meta-data.
- the meta-data structures described in that reference are essentially implemented in IBM's DIGITAL LIBRARY products.
- the meta-data describes a document in the library. For example, the name of a document can be meta-data for that document, as can the date of its creation.
- a special case of such meta-data is a relationship element, residing in a relationship resource, which relates information residing in heterogenous data stores that have been related only in the minds of people within the organization, or in ad files and databases which have little or no managed relationship to the document element representations of interest, and little or no commonality one to another.
- Information stored in various protected resources such as protected resource 200 shown in FIG. 9, can be related to other information stored in either the same or another protected store through a mechanism similar to that described above for providing access control. This information of interest can also be stored in an unprotected resource or in the relationship resource.
- At least one of the items referred to in the relationship element can reside in either an unprotected resource or in the protecting resource such as the library subsystem of Antognini et al.
- the preferred system for implementing this method replaces the protecting resource 300, of FIG. 1, with a relationship resource 600, as shown in FIG. 9.
- the relationship resource 600 includes a relationship resource manager 610 which receives and responds to messages from the data manager 210.
- relationship information 620 which contains relationship elements, such as relationship element -- 1 (621) and relationship element -- 2 (622).
- the relationship resource 600 preferably is a library as described in Antognini et al., and the relationship elements are items in that library. Since the relationship elements 621 and 622 are items in the library, they can contain parts. Such a structure readily provides for operating on a document-based data model, including representations of folders, filing cabinets and other common office constructs.
- the local catalog 530 in the protected resource 200 includes, at least logically, a table 540 mapping protected elements to relationship resources, much as in the case for access control where the local catalog maps a protected element to a protecting resource.
- the local catalog must include sufficient space in a set of fields, either directly in the table 540, or through indirection to a different structure, which can be profitably used. That is the fields must be sufficient to identify a relationship resource and optionally a relationship element within that relationship resource. Further optimization information can also be recorded in those fields, such as a data type with a union of data types. An example of the data type is a type of a specific relationship resource or relationship element. A conceptual view of this is shown in FIG. 10.
- table 540 is part of the local catalog 530.
- Table 540 may be a VTOC in a file system, or an item table in a library system.
- Table 540 directly binds a protected element to a specific relationship resource.
- FIG. 10 shows a conceptual view of protected elements, in this case documents 221-223, stored in an airframe manufacturer's protected resource, which in this case is a library, denoted as Library A.
- document 222 is a complex element, having a plurality of parts, which describes the wing of an airframe.
- Another document 223 describes a wing strut, which is connected to the wing.
- Yet another document in the library is an assembly manual 221 which itself is a complex element comprising a plurality of parts, and which describes among other things, how the wing strut is to be connected to the wing.
- Such documents may be related only in the minds of individuals within the manufacturer's organization, or in ad hoc databases or files which have little or no managed relationship to the document element representations of interest, and little or no commonality to one another.
- the present invention provides for binding the protected elements, or in this case documents, by extending a conventional table, such as an item table in Library A, to associate with the protected element a relationship resource which may hold meta-data for the protected element.
- That meta-data may be a relationship element defining a relationship between the protected element and existing data, any of another protected element, unprotected external data, or even with a physical object (such as a book on a bookshelf).
- the data manager 210 when a client requests meta-data for a protected element, such as for the wing document 222, the data manager 210 refers to table 540 to determine if a relationship resource is bound to that document. If so, data manager 540 sends a message to the relationship resource bound to the document of interest.
- relationship resource B (600) is bound to "wing”.
- Data manager 210 sends a message to relationship resource B along with an indicator (Input -- Ind) of the protected element of interest, namely, document "wing" 222.
- a relationship resource manager 610 receives the message and using an identifier map 621, determines a local identifier (ID) for the protected element of interest based on Input -- Ind.
- the local ID for the "wing” document is "Airframe -- Wing".
- the relationship resource includes a link table, as described in H. M. Gladney, A Storage Subsystem for Image and Records Management, IBM Systems Journal 32(3), pp. 512-40 (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the link table includes Parent, Child and LinkNote columns, each of which can refer to an item in a library.
- the link table also includes a Linkind column for defining the type of link represented.
- a link table 623 of relationship resource B includes a row linking Airframe -- Wing with Airframe -- Wing Strut, and indicating that the kind of relationship is "connected to" meaning that one is connected to the other.
- the same row also relates the Airframe -- Wing to another, possibly complex, item, namely, Airframe -- Assbly -- Man.
- the relationship information corresponding to "Wing" i.e., Wing -- Strut and Assbly -- Man. item IDs
- protecting resource 200 e.g., Library A
- the data manager 210 can return the relationship information to the requesting client, which can than attempt to obtain access to the related documents since they have been identified to the client.
- the protected elements in protected resource may be any other type of persistent data, in addition to documents.
- the relationship elements in a relationship resource are not limited to documents in a library.
- the meta-data held in relationship elements can be data other than relationship data. That is, the elements in the relationship resource can contain information other than relationship information, such as descriptive information about the subject protected element.
- the protected resource may be library containing a map document and a lease document for a building on land encompassed by the map.
- the link table can also contain a parent location field and a child location field.
- the parent location field holds position information, such as grid coordinates on the map.
- the child location field also holds position information relating to a position within the element in the child field.
- map coordinates for the location of the building which is the subject of the lease document identified in the child field is held in the parent location field.
- the child location field optionally, can specify a location in the child document.
- the child location field can specify a certain paragraph in the lease relating to the location of the property.
- Yet another example of using the federated digital libraries of the present invention relates to using the structures described here to build relationship information for elements located in various collections. That information describes existing relationships between that located element and other elements in the same or different collections.
- a program can be used for crawling a web of connected resources to find protected resources and resources worthy of protection.
- the World-Wide Web (hereinafter, "WWW") is an example of such a web of connected resources.
- the program can inspect those resources to discover elements or documents (e.g., pages) which can be identified as images of periodical articles which contain citations to other elements. Based on those links that are inspected, the program builds links and other meta-data for the located elements, in a relationship element, together with appropriate additions to the local directories associated with the located elements.
- the program determines whether or not the cited element is itself part of a protected resource.
- a script element which is a computer program consisting of commands, is used to convert the unprotected element into a protected resource.
- the script element which if issued by the originator of the crawl or of a suitably authorized other user, adds to the data manager of the unprotected element a virtual object manager (for cases like Unix file systems) or exit routines (for cases like MVS file systems).
- the script further converts the unprotected element into a protected element, linked into the protecting resource to which the source element belonged, together with whatever additional pointers, links, and attributes are deemed helpful to normal library services and to the protection and relationship services as described herein.
- Extracting links from WWW documents has been just treated by S. Hitchcock, L. Carr, S. Harris, J. M. N. Hey, and W. Hall, Citation Linking: Improving Access to OnLine Journals, Proc. 2nd ACM Intl. Conf. on Digital Libraries, 115-122, (July 1997). This proceeds using heuristics to discover citation strings in existing WWW documents, with the usual difficulties of such approaches, and the major problem that most cited documents are outside the domain of the WWW.
- the protected resource, client and relationship resource can each be comprised of software programs and/or data recorded on a computer-readable medium, and run on computing devices arranged in a distributed manner.
- the present invention while described in terms of the client, protected resource and protecting resource being implemented in a client-server arrangement, can also be implemented where one or more of those entities run in the same machine.
- the present invention provides for a robust, flexible means for relating information present in existing data collections while requiring very few changes to existing software components, and no changes to the existing stored data. Moreover, the invention allows for conventional access to, and processing of that data with virtually no impact on performance.
