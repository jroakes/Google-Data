Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to the field of the search engine in computer network system, particularly generate profile and use this profile to come the system and method for the rank of customization of search results in response to the search inquiry of submitting to from the website for the website.
Background technology
Search engine is (or Intranet) location and the powerful tool of search file from the Internet.Many websites comprise at least one search box on its webpage.The search box on the particular webpage typically make the user can submit to search inquiry with website that this webpage is associated on searching documents or in searching documents on the Internet.Yet most of website does not have exclusive, the special-purpose search engine system that is used to handle these search inquiries.If search box makes it possible to whole Internet search relevant documentation, and is then particularly like this.On the contrary, search inquiry (for example, is redirected to third party's search engine
Www.google.com) and by its processing.Third party's search engine response generates Search Results in search inquiry (for example, by the database of searching documents), and returns Search Results to the request user.
Tritionally, the Search Results of third party's search engine generation is independent of the website of submitting search inquiry to.For example, no matter search inquiry is the website of the online retail e-shop asked from Apple computer user frequentation or from the online shopping site of grocery store's trustship, search engine all generates identical Search Results for search inquiry " apple ".Significantly, the visitor to these two websites has different interest and should receive different Search Results.As a result, the Search Results that returns for search inquiry " apple " may comprise there is not the result of much interest to the visitor of these each websites.
For the website that comprises a plurality of search boxes that are associated with different webpages, similar problem may appear.For example, the sports news website can have a webpage containing home news and another webpage that is exclusively used in world news.The user of input word " football " may be interested in the news relevant with rugby in the search box on the news web page at home, and the user of the same word of input " football " may be to interested about the news of Association football (it is considered to " football " beyond the U.S.) in the search box on the world news webpage.If the sports news website has the different web pages of the news that contains different motion, and in each of these pages, have search box, then similar problem may occur.Therefore, when search engine was ignored the webpage of submitting search inquiry to, the user can not receive the Search Results of suitable its unique interest.
In view of aforementioned, desirable is to have following search engine: can customize its Search Results according to the website (or webpage) of submitting corresponding search inquiry to, so that give prominence to item of information in the interested Search Results of most probable concerning the user who submits search inquiry to.In addition, desirable is such system: need not therefore to make the user not worry exposing personal information from the operating about user's the individual preference and the clearly input of interest of user.
Summary of the invention
In the method for being filed in the website, information server receives a plurality of search inquiries that different user is submitted to from the website.Provide different Search Results in response to search inquiry to the request user.Information server monitors the user behavior on Search Results, and uses search inquiry and user behavior to generate profile as the website.
In the method that the Search Results that depends on the website is provided, information server receives a plurality of items of information that identical inquiry and identification are associated with search inquiry from two websites.Information server uses the profile of two websites that item of information is customized to two kinds of different order and with these two kinds of different order item of information is distributed two websites.Two website profile bases are relevant with the search history of two websites.
Comprise that website profile bases is created and the present invention of Search Results rearrangement and/or scoring can realize on the client-side of client-server network environment or server are distolateral.

Embodiment
For illustrative purpose, the embodiment that is discussed below only comprises based on the search history that is associated with the website and generates website profile bases, and uses this website profile bases to come Search Results is carried out the system and method for rank in response to the search inquiry of submitting to from this website then.Yet, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the ultimate principle that is discussed below can easily be expanded to create the webpage profile and use this webpage profile to generate the Search Results that depends on webpage.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram that is used to realize the example context 100 of some embodiments of the present invention.One or more websites 102 and client 103 can be connected to communication network 104.Communication network 104 can be connected to information server 106.Information server 106 can comprise front-end server 120, search engine 122, document file device 125, website file device 129, search result rank device 126, document profile database 123, content data base 124, search history database 127 and website profile bases database 128.
In certain embodiments, information server 106 comprises the subclass or the superset of the element shown in Fig. 1.Although Fig. 1 is depicted as a plurality of discrete items with information server 106, this figure more is intended to as the functional descriptions of the various features that can represent in information server 106 but not the structural synoptic diagram of various embodiment.In fact, it is such that the those of ordinary skill in the field of the system design will be recognized, the item shown in separating can be combined and some can further be separated.For example, four the different databases 123,124,127 and 128 shown in the separation can be realized by individual data storehouse server in the drawings.The distribution of the actual quantity of the computing machine of configuration information server 106 and the feature in computing machine will be according to embodiment and different, and can part according to information server 106 on the peak between the operating period and the flow that between mea life, must handle.
The set of the webpage that website 102 is associated with domain name on the Internet typically.Each website (or webpage) has the URL(uniform resource locator) (URL) in the position of this website of unique identification (or webpage) on the Internet.Any visitor can visit this website by the URL of input website in browser window.The website can be by the proprietary web server of the owner of domain name or wherein ISP's trustship of a plurality of websites of being associated of its web server admin and different domain names.For illustrative purpose, website 102 comprises two webpages 114 and 116, and each has the search box 115 and 117 that is associated respectively.By search box 115 (or 117), can come in the search box website 102 or whole Internet search relevant information by search inquiry is input to the visitor of webpage 114 (or 116).Based on context, be meant by the logical place (for example, the Internet or Intranet position) of URL identification or its as employed term " website " in the document and be meant the web server of the website that trustship is represented by URL or refer to the two.
In order to receive the Search Results that depends on the website, the request that at first sends webpage from the user of client 103 to website 102.The webpage that the website is asked by identification responds, and the webpage of being discerned is turned back to requesting client 103.Webpage can comprise user's interested documents (for example, newspaper article).Webpage also can comprise search box (for example, or near the top of webpage).When the content of browsing page or after the content at browsing page, the user may be interested in the acquisition more information.In order to do like this, the user can be input to search inquiry in the search box, and search inquiry is submitted to website 102.Search inquiry can comprise one or more query terms.
As mentioned above, many websites do not have special-purpose search engine.In fact its searching request is handled by third party's search engine.In certain embodiments, after receiving search inquiry, website 102 generates searching request and sends it to information server 106.Among other the embodiment, client 103 generates searching request and it is directly sent to information server 106 and need not pass through website 102 route requests at some.In either case, searching request comprises the unique identifier of search inquiry and request website 102 and requesting client 103.
In information server 106, front-end server 120 be configured to handle via website 102 and client 103 and communication network 104 separately be connected and from the various requests of website 102 and client 103.As shown in fig. 1, respectively, front-end server 120 is connected to search engine 122 and search engine 122 is connected to content data base 124.Content data base 124 storages are from a large amount of index files of different retrieved webs.As an alternative, or additionally, content data base 124 is stored in the index of the document of storing on the various websites.In one embodiment, the link structure according to document distributes a page rank to each index file.Page rank is as the measurement that does not rely on inquiry of the importance of document.
Front-end server 120 is delivered to searching request on the search engine 122.Search engine 122 communicates in response to searching request and content data base 124 then and selects a plurality of documents.Search engine 122 distributes common rank score value based on the page rank of document, the text that is associated with document and search inquiry to each document.
The connection of existence from search engine 122 to search result rank device 126.Connect by this, search engine 122 sends to search result rank device 126 with document and its document profile that is associated of being discerned.Search result rank device 126 has to the connection of website profile bases database 128.As document profile database 123,128 storages of website profile bases database comprise a large amount of website profile bases of the profile of asking website 102.Use the profile of request website 102, search result rank device 126 is converted to the rank score value that depends on the website with the common rank score value of each document of discerning.According to the document rank score value that depends on the website separately document is resequenced then.Then, search result rank device 126 is created Search Results according to the renewal order of document, and Search Results comprises a plurality of document links, link of each document.The part of Search Results or Search Results (for example, preceding 10,15 or 20 results' of identification information) is returned to requesting client 103 and shows to the user by client application 132.After having browsed Search Results, one or more documents of being discerned by Search Results are downloaded and checked to one or more document links that the user can click in the Search Results.
Though top description in a particular manner with task division in search engine 122, search result rank device 126 and front-end server 120, but this particular division of task is exemplary, and can use other division in other embodiments of the invention.For example, the website of search inquiry (receive) website profile bases can be sent to search engine 122 with search inquiry, and search engine 122 can use this information to calculate website particular document score value, be used for search result rank.In fact, this can integrate with search result rank device 126 in the search engine 122.In going back some other embodiment, can use other division of task.
The importance of distributing the process of the Search Results that depends on the website is generation and the maintenance that is stored in the website profile bases in the website profile bases database 128.Website profile bases should reflect the user's of the website that is associated interest, and in many examples, website profile bases will be unique to its website that is associated.For example, the consumer electronics website should have the website profile bases that promotes the webpage relevant with electronic product, and website, online grocery store should have the website profile bases of the webpage relevant with agricultural product of promoting to a higher rank.
In most of embodiment, website profile bases is not static, because static website profile bases unlikely causes information server 106 maximally related Search Results to be distributed to the user of the website that is associated.Alternatively, upgrade website profile bases (for example periodically) often, rearrange website profile bases with the user's that uses the website current interest.Though some website profile bases can (for example keep static state basically in a very long time, for a little, the website of static subscriber group service, described user from have only the described website of the theme of close limit to submit search to very much), but many website profile bases will be passed in time along with the user of website changes and changes, and along with the user's of website interest is passed in time and changed and change.
Between website profile bases and user profiles, there is similarity.Two kinds of profiles can be used to the Search Results that trickle adjustment search engine generates.The both need be relevant with at least one user's search history information so that catch user's News Search interest.But between two types profile, also there is marked difference.Typical user profiles is that the search history by the analyzing personal user generates.This user profiles only is used to the search inquiry of submitting in response to same user and regulates Search Results.For identical search inquiry, if two different users have different user profiles, then it can receive different Search Results from same search engine.By contrast, website profile bases is to generate by analyzing the search history of a plurality of users when visiting this website, to characterize a plurality of users' interest.This website profile bases can be used to the search inquiry of submitting to from same website in response to Any user and regulate Search Results, and described user comprises that it had not before made the new user of the website of " contribution " to website profile bases.Therefore, if two websites have different website profile bases, then submit to the same user of identical search inquiry can receive different Search Results from described two different websites.
Aspect protection user's privacy, website profile bases also has considerable advantage with respect to user profiles.User profiles is associated with the personal user.In order to create user profiles, personal user clearly or implicitly (for example, by monitoring or other online behavior of record searching inquiry and user) need finish the investigation of its people's preference.This investigation indication user may be interested in which item of information.In addition, the user must be in the website or search engine system have account, and the user must login into its account and makes the Search Results personalization with the invoke user profile.By contrast, the establishment of website profile bases and use need be from any personal information of Any user.Website profile bases is associated with website rather than personal user.The behavior of any personal user on the website is by all users owing to the website.The user need not login in order to use website profile bases into its account in the website.As long as submitted search inquiry to from the website, information server just makes corresponding Search Results " personalization " according to website profile bases automatically.
As shown in Figure 1, file in the website, and device 129 is responsible for generating and the renewal website profile bases.In order to catch the active user's interest that is associated with specific website, the website device 129 of filing need have the access right in the user search history at place, website.User search history comprises search inquiry that the user submits to, in response to the Search Results of search inquiry and the user behavior on Search Results (for example when access websites, to the selection of document links, be sometimes referred to as) " click " of Search Results or the mouse-over time on document links.
For example, when front end server 120 received search inquiry from the website, it submitted to the copy of search inquiry to require Search Results to search engine 122.In addition, front-end server 120 sends to search history database 127 with another copy of search inquiry.Search history database 127 generates record then, and this record comprises search inquiry at least and receives the identifier of the website of search inquiry.
In response to search inquiry, search result rank device 126 is prepared Search Results.Search Results (that is the information of at least a portion of expression Search Results) is sent out to return hospitality by front-end server 120 asks client.The copy of the part of Search Results or Search Results also is stored in the search history database 127 with the search inquiry record.Monitor the behavior of the request users on Search Results in the client assistant 134 of requesting client, for example, record was selected the user of the document links in the Search Results and/or in mouse-over time that different document chains.In certain embodiments, device 129 is filed by determining to select corresponding document links and the user time quantum between withdrawing from from the document to determine document " residence time " for the document that the user selects the user in client assistant 134 or website.In certain embodiments, client assistant 134 comprises the executable instruction that is stored in the webpage that comprises Search Results, and described instruction monitors about user's action of Search Results and will send back information server 106 with the user who the is monitored relevant information of taking action.Information server 106 and then storage passed on write in reply breath server 106 and being stored in be used in the search history database 127 after the information relevant of use with these user behaviors.
For example, file the moment (t0) of device 129 recording users submission search inquiry, the moment (t1) of first document links of user's click in corresponding Search Results and moment (t2) of second document links of user's click in Search Results or the like in the website.Two poor (for example, t1-t0 or t2-t1) between continuously constantly are that cost checks that the user has selected the reasonable approximation of the time quantum of the Search Results of its link or document.In certain embodiments, the website file device 129 not with Search Results that the user selects to check in the relevant information of user's residence time of last document.At some among other the embodiment (for example, wherein at least some users " select add " collect the version of the client assistant of the additional information relevant with the user's online behavior), the website device 129 of filing is finished click and the timestamp information that also receives user's action after checking from the document of Search Results the user.Example above continuing, website are filed the moment (t3), user that device 129 further recording users submit second inquiry to from moment (t4) of second Search Results selection document or the like.In addition, when the website device 129 of filing can recording user cuts out the browser window of the document that is used to check Search Results and lists or the navigation moment (t5) away from the website that receives inquiry in Search Results.This additional information makes the website device 129 of filing determine user's residence time for all search result documents (that is, the document of listing) that the user checks in Search Results, itself so that to make the website device 129 of filing can be that the website generates more accurate website profile bases.
Based on the search history information of website, file device 129 of website generates website profile bases.Fig. 2 be according to some embodiments of the present invention be used to use the search history of website to generate the process flow diagram of the process of website profile bases.Initially, the website search inquiry (210) that device 129 identification is submitted to from the website of filing.Though under most of situation, this will comprise all search inquiries of submitting to from the website, under the situation of very popular or busy website, the search inquiry of being discerned can comprise the subclass or the sampling of the search inquiry of being submitted to.The search inquiry of submitting to from the website is represented the user's who uses this website general interest roughly in the given time.Search inquiry is especially relevant with the time dependent dynamic subscriber's interest of seizure.Combine the website device 129 identification corresponding Search Results (215) of filing with search inquiry.In certain embodiments, Search Results is dispatched to the request user with embedded client assistant 134, and this client assistant 134 sends to the website device 127 of filing with the information relevant with the user behavior on the Search Results.File information that device uses client assistant to send of website is identified in user behavior (230) on the Search Results.The user that the user behavior of being discerned can be included on the document links in the Search Results clicks.In another example, the user behavior of being discerned can be included in the mouse-over time on the document links.Generally speaking, if the user is interested in the content of document, this user just clicks document links.Similarly, mouse moves to that particular document chains and stops fact indication the document of plenty of time there relevant with user's interest.In certain embodiments, possibly can't be used the information about the mouse-over time.
The website device 129 of filing can be discerned the selected document of website user according to the user behavior on different Search Results.In certain embodiments, the website profile (235) of device 129 accessed content databases 124 of filing to retrieve corresponding document.As mentioned above, each document of discerning can have the profile (for example, classification profile) of previous generation.If any document of discerning does not also have profile, then can ignore those documents or the website device of filing and to call the document device 125 of filing and come to be that those documents produce document profile.Generate website profile bases (240) from the document profile of being retrieved then.Website profile bases can comprise following one or more: the relevant information (be sometimes referred to as and link profile) that links of the weight list of classification or vector (being sometimes referred to as the classification profile), the document of visiting from the keyword (being sometimes referred to as the word profile) of search inquiry and/or the document that the user visited and with directed towards user.This website profile bases is stored in the website profile bases database 128.Search result rank device 126 can be retrieved website profile bases with the rank rearrangement to the document in the Search Results.
At some among other the embodiment, substitute operation 235 and 240 with cluster operation, the fact of clicking the link that is associated of document based on same user fully in described cluster operation is come the user-selected document of cluster.As an alternative, file one group of known URL that device contrast is associated with particular category of website directly mates the URL of document.Under any situation, the website file device 129 need be in order not generate website profile bases the content of access document.
In going back some other embodiment, substitute operation 230 to 240 to other process of a category with the query mappings that will submit to from the website.Can be based on the word in the inquiry self, or (for example by visit top n Search Results, preceding 5,10,15 or 20 Search Results) profile, those document profile are merged be that each inquiry produces query profiles and merges query profiles, the frequency of coming the inquiry that the user according to the search box of website submits to is weighted to generate website profile bases the classification of inquiry.As discussing with reference to figure 4 below, this process can get rid of be considered to can not with the user's of website the relevant inquiry of main interest.
As mentioned above, upgrade website profile bases often so that follow the tracks of the user's of access websites current interest (245).In certain embodiments, preset time at interval (for example, weekly or every day) upgrade website profile bases.Among other the embodiment, reach threshold value in the quantity of the new search inquiry at place, website at some, just upgrade website profile bases whenever upgrading the back from last (that is, nearest).Whenever it's time to upgrade website profile bases, the website device 129 of filing repeats aforementioned process and upgrades website profile bases.
In certain embodiments, different websites attracts the flow of a great difference value, and therefore should difference treat aspect the profile renewal.For example, popular website can receive the ten of thousands click every day, and so unpopular website can have much lower clicking rate.Search history database 126 can be different website memory allocated amount of spaces.As a result, before next profile that is ranked of website was upgraded, the amount of the search history that is associated with popular website can not use up the space of its appointment and too many space is not wasted in so unpopular website.
It is unpractical that the too popular so that purpose that upgrade for profile in some website is stored in all search histories in the search history database 127.For example, online bookstore can have significantly a large amount of visitor when issuing new best seller.There are two problems in the website that has remarkable flow in short time period.The first, this flow peak can make the profile of website that deviation is arranged.May need specific treatment to guarantee that website profile bases has appropriate balance between website user's short-term and long-term interest.The second, search history database 127 may not have the space to store all search histories.A method that addresses this problem is some that ignore wittingly in search inquiry, Search Results and the user behavior.This can finish by search inquiry, Search Results and/or user behavior are taken a sample, so that produce the sample that does not have deviation of search history.Though the range of sampling can be according to embodiment and different, but test shows that the search history of the user behavior that comprises some months will have enough data and generate reliable website profile bases, for most of website, as long as (A) finish sampling in the mode of avoiding remarkable deviation, and (B) it comprises and the corresponding user behavior data of representational search history of several weeks.
As an alternative, the insufficient space problem can be by generating a series of increases for the different piece of search history (incremental) website profile bases and the website profile bases that increases is integrated with website profile bases solve.As shown in Figure 3, the website device 129 of filing at first generates the profile 311 that increases for search history part 301.Each search history part 301,303,305 can comprise the search history information of predefine amount, or it (for example can comprise the predefine duration, hour) search history information, or it can comprise the part of the search history of selecting according to predefined choice criteria.The process that generates the website profile bases that increases is similar to and combines the process of discussing in the above with Fig. 2.Aspect the interest that characterizes the website user, the profile 311 of increase is equal to search history part 301.In case created the profile 311 that increases, corresponding search history part 301 can be entered the new clauses and subclauses coverings (overwrite) of database in the database.Similarly, search history part 303 can be capped after generating the profile 313 that increases.After the profile 315 that create to increase, the website device 129 of filing can be created new website profile bases 337 by the profile 311,313 and 315 that increases is integrated with old website profile bases 331.In brief, by being the website profile bases that create to increase of search history part 301,303 and 305 and by profile 311,313 and 315 merging with existing website profile bases and increase, the website device 129 of filing can be considered whole search histories.
Website profile bases is used to make Search Results " personalization " or " local flavorization (flavoring) " in response to the search inquiry of submitting to from specific website.The theme that to be these search inquiries contain with the website of basic assumption in this manual is more or less relevant.For example, for the golf website, search inquiry " Tiger Woods (Tag 5 now) " is rationally relevant, and search inquiry " BritneySpears (Blanc girl Britney Jean Spears) " may wide of the mark.It is very possible that but the user will be input in the search box on the golf website as the popular word of " BritneySpears ".This especially may if search box can be used to search for whole the Internet.If carefully do not filter out, then popular with these but search history that incoherent word is associated is " pollution " website profile bases and Search Results distorted beyond thought direction seriously.Although another source of the pollution of website profile bases is to be correlated with, still to have low-down epidemic query terms.Special treatment may be necessary, to guarantee can not make Search Results that deviation is arranged significantly about the user behavior of low-down popular query terms.
Fig. 4 is the example plot 400 that characterizes the popularity distribution of the search inquiry of submitting to from the website.By two threshold values 415 and 425 all search inquiries are divided into three classifications.Leftmost classification 410 comprise " unusually " popular but with less those the relevant search inquiries in website.The search inquiry of submitting to by the search window of golf website " Britney Spears " is the example of the search inquiry in this classification.Device 129 is filed in the website should be by giving that their low relatively weights are eliminated or reducing the influence to website profile bases of the search history that is associated with these inquiries at least.Middle classification 420 comprises those popular and relevant with website search inquiries rationally.Search history corresponding to these search inquiries should be awarded higher weight website profile bases is made main contribution.At last, rightmost classification 430 is included in those inquiries that only occur once in a while in the search box of website.Should treat these inquiries in the mode that is similar to the inquiry in the Far Left classification 410.
Search inquiry (or corresponding Search Results) in the middle of existence is determined in the classification 420 is to the multiple factor of the contribution of website profile bases.For example, the number affects search inquiry of the popular and user behavior on Search Results of search inquiry and Search Results are to the contribution of website profile bases.Time is another key factor.In certain embodiments, in the formation of website profile bases, recently search history is than not so recently the more significant effect of search history performance.Those skilled in the art can easily be applied to similar principles the others of the search history that is associated with the website.
Fig. 5 shows the block diagram that is divided into a plurality of subprocess according to the process that how will create website profile bases of some embodiments of the present invention.As mentioned above, using the search history of website to come to create profile 530 for this website is processes of non-trivial (non-trivial).Search history comprises from the different kinds of information of homology not, the search inquiry of submitting to from the website such as the user 501, Search Results 503 and the user behavior on Search Results 505 that search engine response generates in search inquiry.In certain embodiments, this process further is divided into a plurality of subprocess.Each subprocess produces from the website profile bases of the particular type of certain viewing angles sign website user's interest.They are:
Make search history and one group of predefined classification interrelated based on profile 531-this profile of classification, it can be organized in the mode of level, and each classification is given the weight of correlativity of indication classification and website user's interest;
Profile 533-this profile based on word is summarized search history with a plurality of words, and wherein each word is given the weight of the correlativity of the interest of indicating word and website user; And
Based on the profile 535 that links-this profile identification and direct or indirect relevant a plurality of link of search history, and each link is given, and indication links and the weight of the correlativity of website user's interest.
In certain embodiments, website profile bases 530 only comprises the subclass of profile 531,533,535.For example, website profile bases 530 can comprise based on the profile 533 of word with based on the profile 531 of classification, but do not comprise the profile 535 based on link.In certain embodiments, website profile bases 530 comprises a plurality of profiles, and at least one in described a plurality of profiles is two or more combination of aforementioned profile 531,533,535.At some among other the embodiment, further handle and generate (or based on the cluster) profile based on classification of refining based on classification, based on word and/or based on the profile of link.In other other embodiment, what this was refined occurs to characterize the different aspect of website based on (or based on cluster) profile of classification form with a plurality of (or based on cluster) sub-profiles based on classification.
For example, by search history item (for example, search inquiry, content item and/or user-selected document) is mapped to classification, assemble consequent classification group then and, can make up profile 531 based on classification to class weights.Can come class weights based on its frequency that in the search history item, occurs.In addition, can come class weights based on the correlativity of search history item and classification.The search history item of accumulating in a period of time can be regarded as being used to be mapped to the group of weighting classification.Also can use other the suitable mode that search history is mapped to the weighting classification.
Fig. 6 A shows the level classification Figure 60 0 according to Open Directory Project (open directory project) (http://dmoz.org/).From the root rank of Figure 60 0, come organizes documents according to several main theme such as " art ", " news ", " physical culture " or the like.These main themes are usually too wide in range so that can not describe website user's special interests.They further are divided into a plurality of sub-topicses more specifically.For example, theme " art " can comprise the sub-topics as " film ", " music " and " literature ", and sub-topics " music " may further include the sub-sub-topics as " lyrics ", " news " and " comment ".Notice that each theme (or sub-topics) accords with unique classification logotype and being associated, described identifier as be used for " art " 1.1, the 1.6.1 that is used for the 1.4.2.3 of " talk show " and is used for " basketball ".
Only be used for illustrative purpose in the classification shown in Fig. 6 A.It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that many alternate manners that existence is sorted out document.For example, can be from the contents extraction of document different notion and according to of the different classes of grouping of these notions with relevant information.The user's of specific website interest can be associated with a plurality of classifications at different stage, and each has the weight of the correlativity of the interest of indicating classification and user.Can determine classification and its weight that is associated by analyzing the search history that is associated with the website.
Fig. 6 B is the block diagram that can be used to store the sample data structure (based on the website profile bases table 650 of classification) based on the website profile bases of classification according to some embodiments of the present invention.Profile 650 based on classification comprises the table 640 with a plurality of records 642, and each record comprises the pointer of WEBSITE_ID, FLAVOR_ID and sensing such as another data structure of table 660-1.The website can have one or more local flavors to serve different user's groups better.For example, website " WEBSITE_1 " has at least two different local flavors " FLAVOR_1 " and " FLAVOR_2 ".These two different " local flavors " can be corresponding with the different search boxes on the different web pages.In other words, the differently flavoured introducing of website website user's the interest of having refined.This popular website for the client of service broad range is particularly useful.Table 660-1 comprises two row CATEGORY_ID and WEIGHT.The CATEGORY_ID row comprise the identifier of the classification as shown in Fig. 6 A, and the correlativity of value indication classification in the WEIGHT row and website user's interest.
In certain embodiments, automatically the search history item is categorized as different clusters.Cluster is dynamic than classification usually.As mentioned above, classification is typically generated in advance.Contrast the search history item that identical classification group is classified and is associated with different web sites.By contrast, can there be the predefined cluster group that is used for specific website.The search history item that is associated with the website falls into the cluster group of automatic generation.Therefore, cluster can be more suitable for characterizing the user's of website interest and preference.For facility, many argumentations of the present invention are used as example with classification.But be clear that to those skilled in the art rudimentary algorithm also can be without adjusting or being applied to cluster through a little adjustment.
Website profile bases based on classification Figure 60 0 is the embodiment of subject-oriented.Also can organize based on the item in the profile of classification in other mode.In one embodiment, website user's interest can be sorted out based on the form of the document that the website user discerned, described form such as HTML, plain text, PDF, Microsoft Word or the like.Different forms can have different weights.In another embodiment, website user's interest can be sorted out according to the type of the document of being discerned, the homepage that described type is for example organized, individual's homepage, research paper or newsgroup's model, and each type has the weight that is associated.Document also can be originated by document and be sorted out, for example the country that is associated with the main frame of each document.In yet another embodiment, discerned in the above based on two or more can the coexistence in the profile of classification, and each reflection website user's the aspect separately of interest.
Fig. 7 is the block diagram that can be used to store the sample data structure (based on the profile 700 of word) based on the website profile bases of word according to some embodiments of the present invention.Table 700 comprises a plurality of records 710, and each record is corresponding with the profile based on word of website.Profile record 710 based on word comprises multiple row, and described row comprise WEBSITE_ID row 720 and multiple row, and (TERM is WEIGHT) to 740.WEBSITE_ID row store website identifier.(TERM WEIGHT) comprises word that typically is one to three word that is considered to relevant with website user's interest and the weight that is associated with word of indicating the correlativity of word to 740 for each.The weight of word not necessarily on the occasion of.Negative weight hint website user dislikes the document that comprises this word in Search Results.
Except that based on word and the profile based on classification, the website profile bases of another kind of type is called as the profile based on link.As mentioned above, the page rank of document is based on the link structure that the document is connected to other document on the Internet.Have its linked document of more sensings be endowed usually higher page rank and therefore search engine think that it is more popular.The link information of the user-selected document of website can be used to infer the user's of website interest.In one embodiment, come to discern the tabulation of preferred URL for the website user by the clicking rate of analyzing these URL.Can according to the website user mouse-over time at URL place to the further weighting of each preferred URL.In another embodiment, the tabulation that comes to discern preferred web main frame of the rate of people logging in by the user that analyzes at different web main frames place for the website user.When two or more preferred URL were relevant with same web main frame, the weight of these two or more URL can be combined into the weight of this web main frame.
Fig. 8 can be used to store the block diagram of sample data structure based on the website profile bases of link according to some embodiments of the present invention.Profile 800 based on link comprises table 810, and table 810 comprises a plurality of records 820, and each record comprises the pointer of WEBSITE_ID and sensing such as another data structure of table 810-1.Table 810-1 can comprise two row LINK_ID 830 and WEIGHT 840.LINK_ID 830 can be associated with preferred URL or main frame.Actual URL/ main frame can be stored among table rather than the LINK_ID, yet preferably, storage LINK_ID is to save storage space.
The tabulation of preferred URL and/or main frame comprises the website user URL and/or the main frame of Direct Recognition.The tabulation of preferred URL and/or main frame can further expand to use such as coming the URL and/or the main frame of indirect identification for the method for collaborative filtering known to a person of ordinary skill in the art or document metering (bibliometric) analysis.In one embodiment, the URL of indirect identification and/or main frame comprise have to/from the URL or the main frame of the link of the URL of Direct Recognition and/or main frame.By come URL and/or main frame weighting in the URL of the URL of indirect identification and/or main frame and Direct Recognition or the distance between the main frame to these indirect identification.For example, URL or main frame that when the URL of Direct Recognition or main frame had weight 1, URL or the main frame that differs a link can have weight 0.5, differ two links can have weight 0.25 or the like.By reducing and the incoherent weight that links of the theme of original URL or main frame this process of can further refining, the linking of web browser software that colophon maybe can be used to check the document that is associated with user-selected URL or main frame for example pointed in described link.Incoherent link can be distributed based on its context or its to be discerned.For example, particular words (for example, " copyright " and " keeping all copyrights " is the word that often uses in the anchor text of copyright link) is used in the copyright link usually; And the link of pointing to the website from many incoherent websites can hint that this website is not theme relevant (for example, the link of sensing Internet Explorer website is included in the incoherent website usually).Also can come indirect link classification, and can get rid of link or give low weight it with very different themes according to one group of theme.
Three types the website profile bases of Lun Shuing replenishes generally mutually in the above, because different profiles characterizes website user's interest from different advantage points.Yet this does not mean one type website profile bases, for example based on the profile of classification, can not bring into play typically the effect by the website profile bases performance of another kind of type.In the mode of example, usually be associated based on preferred URL or main frame in the profile of link with particular topic, for example, finance.yahoo.com is the URL that focuses on financial and economic news.Therefore, by comprise preferred URL or Host List based on link profile realized acts on to small part and also can realize by having other profile based on classification of a category that contains the same subject that preferred URL or main frame contain.
Fig. 9 be according to some embodiments of the present invention be used to use various types of website profile bases to generate the process flow diagram of the process of the Search Results that depends on the website.Initially, search engine 122 search inquiry (910) that 102 reception users submit to by client 103 from the website.In response, search engine 122 generated query strategy (915) alternatively.For example, make the search inquiry standardization so that be in suitable form and be used for further processing, and/or can be according to predefined standard modification search inquiry so that enlarge or dwindle the scope of search inquiry automatically.Then, search engine 122 is submitted to content data base 124 with search inquiry (or query strategy, if generated query strategy).One group of document (920) of content data base 124 identification and matching search inquiries, each document have the page rank that depends on document and the common rank score value of search inquiry.All three operations (910,915 and 920) are typically handled by search engine 122.
In certain embodiments, in search inquiry, embed the identifier of request website.Based on web site identifier, search result rank device 126 is discerned the profile (925) of website in website profile bases database 128.Then, search result rank device 126 is analyzed common rank score value and the next rank score value (940) that depends on the website that distributes to document of lifting factor that each document of discerning is determined one or more lifting factors (935) with the use website profile bases and used document then.Search result rank device 126 repeats this process (942) for each document of discerning.At last, search result rank device 126 according to the rank score value that depends on the website of lists of documents to the document tabulation rearrangement (945) and will comprise that the Search Results of the link of pointing to the document tabulation sends to requesting client 103.
In certain embodiments, the analysis of the document discerned is comprised the mutual relationship of determining between the profile of the content of document and website at 935 places.In addition, in certain embodiments, this operation comprise visit be used for document previous calculating document profile and determine mutual relationship between the profile of document profile and website then.In certain embodiments, determine that mutual relationship is included as one or more operations that " dot product " calculates, if exist overlappingly, it determines the overlapping degree between the profile of document profile and website.
Figure 10 is the block diagram according to the sample data structure of some embodiments of the present invention, described sample data structure can be used to store the document that is used for Search Results based on classification, based on word and based on the lifting factor of link.For each candidate documents, each is discerned by DOC_ID separately, document information table 1010 based on classification comprises a plurality of classifications of discerning and the weight that is associated, comprise manyly based on the document information table 1030 of word, and comprise one group of link and corresponding weight based on linked document information table 1050 to correlation word and the weight that is associated.
When the website profile bases that uses a kind of particular type is estimated document, the lifting factor (that is the score value that is calculated) of rightmost column storage the document of each of these three tables (1010,1030 and 1050).The lifting factor of document can be determined by the weight that makes up the item that is associated with document.For example, based on classification or can be as the calculating of getting off based on the lifting factor of word.The user of website may like and the relevant document of science with weight of 0.6, and dislikes and the relevant document of commerce with weight of-0.2.Therefore, when the scientific documents match search is inquired about, it will be thus lifted on the business document.Usually, the document subject matter classification can not be unique.The business document that candidate documents can be classified as the scientific documents with probability of 0.8 and have 0.4 probability.Lifting factor based on link can calculated based on the preferred URL in the profile of link or the associated weight of main frame based on distributing to.In one embodiment, can use such as the known technology of word frequency-reverse document frequency (TF-IDF) based on the profile rank of word and determine.The word frequency of word is the function of the number of times that occurs in document of word.Reverse document frequency is the inverse function of the quantity of the document that word occurs therein in the set of document.For example, in many documents, occur and therefore be endowed relatively low reverse document frequency as the very common word of " word (word) ", and as the so uncommon word of " photograph (photo) " and " microprocessor (microprocessor) " be endowed relative higher reverse document frequency.
In certain embodiments, when search engine response when search inquiry generates Search Results, distribute inquiry score value QueryScore according to search inquiry to the candidate documents D that satisfies search inquiry.Page rank PageRank by document D adjusts this inquiry score value to generate common rank score value GenericScore then, and it is represented as:
GenericScore＝QueryScore*PageRank。
If user's interest is significantly different with the interest of the random user of search engine, then this common rank score value can not suitably reflect correlativity document D and user specific website.Based on the content of document D and website based on the mutual relationship between the profile of word (being called TermBoostFactor herein), one or more classifications that are associated with document D and website based on the mutual relationship between the profile of classification (being called CategoryBoostFactor herein), and the URL of document D and/or main frame and website based on the mutual relationship (being called LinkBoostFactor herein) between the profile of link, document D and website user's correlativity can accurately be characterized by one group of lifting factor.Therefore, document D can be assigned with the rank score value that depends on the website, and it is the common rank score value of document and the function of various lifting factors based on website profile bases.In one embodiment, this rank score value that depends on the website can be represented as: WebsiteScore=GenericScore* (TermBoostFactor+CategoryBoostFactor+LinkBoostFactor).
In another embodiment, wherein website profile bases is single profile, and the rank score value that depends on the website can be represented as:
WebsiteScore＝GenericScore*BoostFactor
Wherein " BoostFactor " is based on the mutual relationship between the profile of the content of document D and website.
Figure 11 is the process flow diagram of another process of Search Results that is used to use website profile bases to generate to depend on the website according to some embodiments of the present invention.Different with the embodiment that discusses in conjunction with Fig. 9 in the above, adjust common query strategy depends on the website with establishment query strategy (1125,1165) by the profile of website.For example, the correlation word from website profile bases can be added to search inquiry with the weight that is associated.In various embodiments, create the query strategy that depends on the website by search engine 122, front-end server 120 or search result rank device 126 respectively.At some among other the embodiment, request website 102 has the file copy of its profile that device 129 generates and the query strategy that depends on the website of website and is created by request website 102.Then, search engine 122 uses the query strategy searching for content data storehouse 124 (1170) that depends on the website.As a result, the rank score value that depends on the website that is associated of the document by content data base 124 identification comes the document implicit expression ordering (1175) to 124 identifications of this content data base.
With reference to Figure 12, example information server 1200 typically comprises one or more processing units (CPU) 1202, one or more network or other communication interface 1210, storer 1212 and the one or more communication buss 1014 that are used to make these assembly interconnects.Communication bus 1014 can comprise the circuit (being sometimes referred to as chipset) of the communication between interconnection and Control System Component.System 1200 can comprise user interface, for example display and keyboard alternatively.Storer 1212 can comprise high-speed random access memory and also can comprise nonvolatile memory, such as one or more disk storage devices.Storer 1212 can comprise the massage storage that is positioned at away from the position of CPU1202.In certain embodiments, storer 1212 storage follow procedure, module and data structures, or its subclass or superset:
The website device 129 of filing is used to handle search history and establishment that is associated with the website and one or more profiles of upgrading the interest that characterizes the website user;
Website profile bases database 123 is used to store the website profile bases that is associated with different web sites on the Internet;
The document device 125 of filing is used for the content of analytical documentation and context and is the document creation profile;
Search result rank device 126, be used to use website profile bases to generate the rank score value that depends on the website, and the document in the Search Results resequenced according to the rank score value that depends on the website of the document in the Search Results as each document of search engine 122 identifications.
In certain embodiments, information server 106 can be visited all search histories that are associated with the website.For example, about can there be agreement in 102 search inquiries of submitting between website 102 and information server 106 from the website.According to this agreement, when the user of access websites 1027 when information server 106 is submitted search inquiries to, information server 106 is required to send corresponding Search Results to website 102 rather than the request user of client 103.Search Results can be revised in website 102, for example advertisement or out of Memory is attached in the Search Results, then the request user that is distributed in client 103 of the Search Results that will revise.
In this case, information server 106 may not discerned the information of request user and client 103, and also may not monitor the user behavior on Search Results.For example, information server 106 cannot receive identification user any information of the document links in the search results clicked.Similarly, information server 106 cannot receive the identification user on move its link of mouse linked document and any information of corresponding mouse-over time.In other words, 106 couples of website users' on Search Results of information server behavior is known little about it or is not known fully.Therefore, information server 106 has to rely on the user behavior from the Search Results in other place to generate website profile bases.
In certain embodiments, by checking the search inquiry of submitting to from different websites, information server 106 can recognition category be similar to another website of the website of just discussing.If the predefine amount or the percent of the search inquiry of submitting to from two websites are identical, think that then two websites are similar.It also is rational doing following deduction: the user of two similar websites can have similar interest and the user behavior that therefore is associated with a website is the reasonable agency of the user behavior that is associated with another website.If information server 106 can visit with these two websites in a user behavior that is associated (for example, do not have the agreement of sending Search Results to the website), then information server 106 can use identical user behavior to create profile for another website.
When the website that does not exist and just discussing similarly during other website, information server 106 can utilize the user behavior that has monitored that is associated with the search inquiry that directly is submitted to search engine (for example, using the toolbar search box that is associated with information server 106 or the search inquiry of the webpage submission) agency as specific website.Yet " group of domestic consumer " information only in this way is only the search inquiry that is used to the inquiry of submitting to from the website of just discussing.For example, search inquiry " golf course in the mountain scene city " both can be submitted to the website that focuses on golf, can be submitted to the search engine of general applications again.Be used to by for the inquiry combination that receives from each website or to assemble domestic consumer's statistical information be that each website generates profile from the profile information of clicking (and the common group of use on the Search Results of other search inquiry of submitting to from the website of just discussing with from other users of search engine clicks) development the group of domestic consumer on the Search Results of this search inquiry.The website profile bases that obtains by this way is will be typically significantly different with one group of profile of the whole user group of search engine, therefore and the website profile bases that generates by this way will be the rationally approximate of following website profile bases: if the Search Results user behavior information that search engine response is returned in the search inquiry of submitting to from the website can be used, then will generate this website profile bases.
In certain embodiments, website profile bases also can be utilized for the search inquiry of submitting to from different websites and select advertisement.Handle different advertisements to be similar to the mode of handling different document.For example, advertisement can have one group of keyword.Mutual relationship between this group keyword and the profile based on word that is associated with the website (or based on the profile of classification or both) produces the lifting factor that is used for advertisement.In response to the search inquiry of submitting to from the website, this lifting factor can be used to make particular advertisement to promote to a higher rank or demote.For example, when information server 106 from the website that is exclusively used in Association football news or webpage when having received search inquiry " world cup 2006 ", it can make the admission ticket of containing Association football equipment, 2006FIFA Germany world cup sell and promote to a higher rank in those advertisements of hotel reservation of the German city of holding the Association football match or the like.
For the purpose of explaining, the description of front has been described with reference to certain embodiments.Yet top illustrative is discussed and is not intended to exhaustive or limits the present invention to disclosed precise forms.In view of above-mentioned instruction can be carried out many modifications and changes.Select also to describe embodiment, thereby enable those skilled in the art to use the present invention best and have the various embodiment of the various modifications that are fit to the special-purpose of expecting so that explain principle of the present invention best and its practical application.
