Keysheet module 22 can be with language model 28 button based on corresponding to touch event be sequentially identified for the language model score value of one or more character strings.For example, each button of keyboard can represent character or keyboard operation.Keysheet module 22 can be determined by one or more buttons and select the specific character representing based on keystroke sequence.Character such as numeral or lowercase may need single character keys to select (for example < letter key >, < numerical key > etc.), and may need two buttons to select (for example < switch key >+< letter key > etc.) such as uppercase character.
Keysheet module 22 can access computation equipment 10 language model 28, with the keystroke sequence based on corresponding to attitude, be identified for the language model score value of one group of one or more character string.That is, Keysheet module 22 can carry out increment with language model 28 in response to receiving the indication of one or more attitudes and generates one group of one or more character string.Character string can be to be included in character string or the prefix of OOV character string or the one group of character of a part that language model 28 comprises.In some instances, character string can be to be included in complete character that language model 28 comprises or one group of character of complete OOV character string.When Keysheet module 22 receives the indication of one or more attitudes, Keysheet module 22 can be determined space and the language model score value corresponding to character string increment.Usage space and language model score value, the combination score value that the space that Keysheet module 22 can be based on for each respective symbols string and language model score value are identified for each character string.When Keysheet module 22 is determined the follow-up indication of attitude, Keysheet module 22 can upgrade space, language and/or combination score value in increment ground.For example, Keysheet module 22 can be when being received in a plurality of indications that have one or more attitudes that responsive screen place detects, based on language context, upgrade dictionary outer language model score value, wherein, language context response in a plurality of indications of one or more attitudes at least one and change.For example, the language model score value being associated with character string in language model 28 can change in response to inputted character string.Due to dictionary outer language model score value can be based on being included in language model 28 language model score value, Keysheet module 22 can upgrade dictionary outer language model score value by the language context based on changing.Because combination score value can pointing character string corresponding to appearance probability of state, therefore, Keysheet module 22 can be by their corresponding combination score values to character string rank, as described in the disclosure further.Then, Keysheet module 22 can output string and/or is determined that based on character string other character strings are with output.
Conventionally, the language model 28 of computing equipment 10 can comprise the character string list in writing language dictionary, for example word.In some instances, language model 28 can based on and/or comprise the string assemble of the dictionary (dictionary that for example comprises word) based in computing equipment 10 or the remote computing device place storage that can be accessed by computing equipment 10.In some instances, dictionary can comprise the vocabulary of word.The vocabulary of word can be used in write and/or spoken language in the main body of word.Dictionary can be implemented as the data structure with one or more words of structured way storage vocabulary.Language model 28 can be indicated the probability of each respective symbols string of the frequency based on this character string occurs in given language context.For example, character string in English " door " can be used after the character string " the " more continually, and therefore, the character string " run " of ratio after as character string " the " is associated with larger probability.
Keysheet module 22 can be carried out and search to identify one or more character strings in language model 28, the word in language model 28 for example, and it comprises part or all in the character group that the button corresponding with attitude be associated.Language model 28 can be realized first (n-gram) language model of one or more n.N-gram language model can the first preceding paragraph based in sequence be the item x in neighbouring entry sequence
i(letter, word, punctuation mark or other separators) provides probability distribution (that is, P (x
i| x
i-(n-1)..., x
i-1)).For example, character level double base language model (n-gram model, wherein n=2) can provide letter " w " at alphabetical sequence " no " probability afterwards.In another example, word level three gram language model can provide " fox " probability after word sequence " the quick brown ".
Keysheet module 22 can be with language model 28 based on for example including but not limited to that the language context corresponding to the character of the indication of the attitude of being carried out by user, character string in dictionary and/or character string of previously input etc. is identified for the language model score value of character string.For example, Keysheet module 22 can be determined the character group being associated with button corresponding to attitude.Character group can be prefix or a part for character string.It can be maybe the outer character string of dictionary that character string can be included in language model 28.The one or more character strings that correspond respectively to this prefix of determining in language model 28 can be searched for or be pre-estimated to Keysheet module 22.For example, suppose character string s-a-t, Keysheet module 22 can be used language model 28 to determine the probability of character string satin.Keysheet module 22 can be determined language model score value based on this probability.In this way, the character string in given language context with high probability in language model 28 can have higher language model score value.
In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can be carried out searching of a plurality of kinds of characters groups that the button with corresponding to attitude is associated, and for example, wherein each character group can be prefix or a part for character string.It can be one or more character strings of part or all character in the prefix of character string or the character group of a part that Keysheet module 22 can carry out comprising in identifiable language model 28 with language model 28.As shown in Figure 1, user can carry out at UID12 place the attitude 30 through button s-a-r-t.Therefore, Keysheet module 22 can be carried out the next character group of determining with s-a-r beginning of searching of prefix s-a-r.Similarly, Keysheet module 22 can be carried out the one group of character string determining with s-a-t beginning of searching to prefix s-a-t.
In some instances, the corresponding space based on for each respective symbols string and language model score value are determined the combination score value of each character string to Keysheet module 22 at least in part.Therefore, the combined probability of character string can represent that probability based on the contextual character string of language and attitude are for the accuracy of given button set.Keysheet module 22 can be with the descending from most probable character string to the most impossible character string by combination score value to each character string sorting one group of character string.In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can the one or more character strings based on having maximum probability be determined one or more character strings.UID12 can export the character string such as proposes character string in proposes character string district 38A-38C.In other examples, can in editing area 16A, export one or more candidate character strings with maximum probability.
Not if computing equipment 10 determines that language model 28 does not comprise this character string, automatic calibration or inhibition output string, computing equipment 10 can be determined the dictionary outer language model score value that can for example, be associated with the character string (OOV character string) not being included in language model 28.; although (therefore the outer character string of dictionary may not be included in language model 28; can not obtain from language model 28 the language model score value of character string this dictionary), but Keysheet module 22 can determine that dictionary outer language model score value comes to be associated with the outer character string of this dictionary.Therefore, computing equipment 10 can be determined combination score value based on dictionary outer language model score value and spatial model score value.In this way, computing equipment 10 is used the dictionary outer language model score value that is not included in the character string in dictionary, still can export OOV character string to show, the outer character string of the dictionary of even now may not be included in language model 28.
For example object, with reference to figure 1, these technology are described in further detail.In the example of Fig. 1, computing equipment 10 outputs comprise that the graphic keyboard 16B of a plurality of buttons is to show.For example, Keysheet module 22 can generate the data of the expression that comprises graphic keyboard 16B.UI module 20 can generate user interface 14, and the data based on presentation graphic keyboard 16B comprise graphic keyboard 16B in user interface 14.UI module 20 can show that the information of the instruction of user interface 14 sends to UID12 by comprising for the responsive screen display of the existence at UID12.UID12 can receive this information and make the responsive screen of existence of UID12 present the user interface 14 that comprises editing area 16A, graphic keyboard 16B and proposes character string district 38A-38C.Graphic keyboard 16B can comprise a plurality of buttons.
Computing equipment 10 can, in response to the indication that has the attitude 30 that sensitive display place detects receiving at UID12, be determined the one or more selection in a plurality of buttons.For example, when UID12 is when existing responsive screen to present user interface 14, the position that user can present the responsive screen of existence of graphic keyboard 16B at UID12 provides attitude user to input for 30 (or being called for short " attitudes " 30).Fig. 1 diagram comprises the path of attitude 30 of the part 34A-34J (general designation " part " 34) in the path of the part in the path that represents respectively attitude 30 or the attitude of subdivision 30.For example, part 34A represents the beginning of attitude 30, and part 34J represents the latter end of attitude 30, and part 34B-34I represents respectively the center section of attitude 30.For example object, the broken circle in Fig. 1 is delimited each in part 34, although UID12 can not export such broken circle in some instances, and these parts can be larger and/or less in each different examples.
Attitude module 24 can receive the information of indication attitude 30 and the touch event sequence (for example, each touch event comprises location components, time component and motion components) that information assemble is become to sequential sequence from UID.Attitude module 24 can send to touch event Keysheet module 22.The information (for example position, time, action etc.) that Keysheet module 22 can receive touch event sequence and be associated with each touch event from UI module 20.Keysheet module 22 location components of each touch event in touch event sequence and each key position can be compared determine share with touch event sequence in one or more buttons of apparent position of the identical UID12 in the position of touch event.For example, Keysheet module 22 can determine that the one or more touch events of indication are corresponding to the spatial model score value to the probability of the selection of button by usage space model 26.
Keysheet module 22 can be determined the character string based on one or more characters from a plurality of buttons.For example, the select progressively of Keysheet module 22 can be based on to graphic keyboard 16B <S key >, <A key >, <T key >, <O key > and <K key > determines that key sequence represents character string satok.In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can be determined the character string that other are possible, such as sartik, satyok etc.Using satokas as example, Keysheet module 22 can be with language model 28 the character group s-a-t-o-k based on corresponding to the selection of the button of being indicated by attitude, determine character string.Similarly, Keysheet module 22 can also be with language model 28 character group s-a-t-i-n-g and the s-a-r-i-n based on corresponding respectively to the selection that the difference of being indicated by attitude may button group, determine one or more character strings.
In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can be determined that one or more character strings are not included in by computing equipment 10 and is used in the dictionary of identification string.; in some instances; language model 28 can modeling and/or is comprised the character string of one or more dictionaries; and Keysheet module 22 can determine whether the character string comprising corresponding to the character group of the selection of the button of being indicated by attitude is included in language model 28; therefore whether be included in by (dictionary that for example, comprises word) in dictionary.For example, Keysheet module 22 can determine that satok is not included in language model 28.Therefore, can determine that this character string satok is outer (OOV) character string of dictionary.Yet Keysheet module 22 can determine that " satin " and " sarin " is the character string being included in language model 28.Character string " satin " shares the prefix identical with satok with " sarin " and joins with similar attitude path coherence.Therefore, Keysheet module 22 can be determined the language model score value of " satin " and " sarin ", and it indicates the given corresponding probability that comprises the contextual character string of language of inputted character string satok.As mentioned above, Keysheet module 22 also can be determined the spatial model score value of " satin " and " sarin ", indicates the corresponding probability of these character strings of the given button by attitude 30 processes.
According to technology of the present disclosure, not abandon satok because language model 28 does not comprise satok, Keysheet module 22 can be associated this character string satok with dictionary outer language model score value.Dictionary outer language model score value can represent not to be included in the alternative language model score value of the character string (it can comprise the character string from one or more dictionaries) in language model 28.In some instances, dictionary outer language model score value can be predetermined value.In other examples, the Keysheet module 22 at least in part probability of the least possibility character string based in language model 28 is determined dictionary outer language model score value.For example, as shown in Fig. 4 further, each character string in language model 28 can be associated with indicating the value of the probability of the character string in given context.Keysheet module 22 can be defined as dictionary outer language model score value the language model score value of the least possibility character string in language model 28.In either case, Keysheet module 22 can be associated character string satok with dictionary outer language model score value.In addition, as mentioned above, Keysheet module 22 can be determined based on button s-a-t-o-k and attitude 30 the spatial model score value of satok.
Keysheet module 22 can be determined the combination score value of one or more character strings (for example OOV character string) that can comprise character string satok.Keysheet module 22 can be based on character string corresponding space and the language model score value combination score value of determining each character string.Combination score value can pointing character string corresponding to appearance probability of state.In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can advise that in district 38A-38C, exporting one or more character strings advises (for example, candidate and/or OOV character string) in character string.For example, as shown in Figure 1, can in proposes character string district 38A-38C, export there is the highest combination score value three character strings to show.In the example of Fig. 1, the combination score value being associated with character string satok can be the highest combination score value.Dictionary outer language model score value may be low for satok, but the spatial model score value being associated with satok may be high with respect to the spatial model score value of other candidate character strings, because due to user view input OOV character string satok, s-a-t-o-k button is passed through in attitude path 30 more accurately.Therefore, the combination score value of satok can remain and in candidate character strings, have in the highest combination score value.Therefore, Keysheet module 22 can advise exporting in district 38A OOV character string satok to show in character string, as one that has in the candidate character strings being determined by Keysheet module 22 in three character strings of the highest combination score value.
Keysheet module 22 can output to UI module 20 by one or more candidate character strings or phrase and the rank being associated, to be included in the editing area 16A of user interface 14, or as the individual proposes character string 38 in the proposes character string district 38A-38C of user interface 14.UI module 20 can receive from Keysheet module 22 rank of one or more candidate character strings or phrase (comprising original character string) and one or more candidate character strings or phrase.UI module 20 can be upgraded proposes character string district 38A-38C by three rank character strings the highest are included as to proposes character string.As shown in fig. 1, in user view, by attitude 30 input OOV character strings or phrase in the situation that, UI module 20 can comprise original character string, and OOV character string for example, as shown in character string suggestion district 38A.From user interface 14, user can be knocked or be provided input to select in proposes character string 38 by the position of the UID12 at UID12 output proposes character string district 38A-38C.For example, user for example presents at UID12, on the position of UID12 of proposes character string (satok) and knocks.On proposes character string district 38A, knock and can make more new user interface 14 and OOV character string satok is included in editing area 16A of UI module 20.
In this way, technology of the present disclosure can make computing equipment the attitude input based in graphic keyboard input receive OOV character string or phrase.Technology of the present disclosure can make computing equipment can determine more accurately character string and output OOV character string.These technology can further make the user can be more quickly at computing equipment input of character string because user can provide less input come correction calculation equipment or individually key tap input OOV character string.All so computing equipments can be processed less user's input, carry out less operation, therefore consume less electric power.

Fig. 4 is that diagram is according to the concept map of the example data for the outer character string of definite dictionary of one or more aspects of the present disclosure.Fig. 4 comprises as front at for example computing equipment described in Fig. 1-2 10.Computing equipment 10 comprises UID12, Keysheet module 22, space module 26 and language model 28, as previously mentioned.Although in the row of Fig. 4 between illustrated value be associated in table in character string, space score value, language score value and combination score value have been shown, can be with in the proper data structure storing value of any suitable data structure and arbitrary number one or more.As an alternative, one or more in can calculated value, and it is not further stored in data structure.Although use logarithm value to illustrate some values, can use any appropriate value that represents probability and/or score value in Fig. 4.
As shown in Figure 4, Keysheet module 22 can be determined character string, such as " satok ", " satin ", " sarin " and " satire ".Keysheet module 22 can be determined character string continuously in response to receiving the indication of one or more attitudes of carrying out at input equipment place increment.For example, in response to user, at UID12, carry out the continuous attitude through the position of the UID12 of display graphics button, Keysheet module 22 may be received in the indication of attitude of the diverse location of UID12.
In some instances, computing equipment 10 can be identified in response to receiving the indication of attitude the spatial model score value of one or more buttons.For example, in response to the one or more indications that receive corresponding to the attitude 30 of part 34B (as shown in Figure 1), Keysheet module 22 can be determined spatial model score value for the button of the graphic keyboard 16B corresponding to " A " key, " S " key, " W " key and " Z " key.Keysheet module 22 can be determined spatial model score value to these respective keys, because they are respectively in the threshold distance of the position of part 34B.For example, for the indication of the attitude of part 34B, can comprise the touch event corresponding to the indicating positions of the UID12 in the attitude path of attitude 30.Keysheet module 22 can be determined from the position corresponding to 34B to the distance of the position of " A " key, " S " key, " W " key and " Z " key and is less than respectively threshold distance.
As previously, described in Fig. 1, Keysheet module 30 can be used the one or more spatial models corresponding to one or more buttons, and for example spatial model 26, was identified for the spatial model score value of each button of being determined by Keysheet module 30.In some instances, character string can comprise a plurality of characters corresponding to the different key of graphic keyboard 16B.For example, character string 100 (" satok ") can comprise character " s ", " a ", " t ", " o " and " k " of the button that corresponds respectively to the graphic keyboard 16B that comprises " S " key, " A " key, " T " key, " O " key and " K " key.Therefore, each spatial model score value of each in can the respective keys based on graphic keyboard 16B of the spatial model score value 102 of character string 100.For example, the spatial model score value 102 of character string 100 can be corresponding to each the product of each spatial model score value near determined these buttons of Keysheet module 22 when user carries out continuous attitude graphic keyboard 16B " S " key, " A " key, " T " key, " O " key and " K " key.
As shown in Figure 4, computing equipment 10 comprises language model 28.As previously, described in Fig. 1, language model 28 can be indicated the probability of each respective symbols string of the frequency occurring based on character string in given language context.For example, character string " the " may be used in the current language context that can comprise one or more characters, character string and/or phrase more continually than character string " satin ".Therefore, in language context, compare with for example character string " satin ", " the " can be associated with larger probability.
In some instances, language model 28 can comprise the quantity of the character string of the quantity of writing the word in dictionary that equals language.In other examples, language model 28 can comprise be less than language write in dictionary the quantity of the character string of word likely.For example, language model 28 can comprise from comprise be less than write dictionary the character string of the dictionary of character string likely.For example, language can comprise 150,000 possibility words, but dictionary can only comprise 50,000 the most frequently used words.In such example, language model 28 can comprise 50,000 the most frequently used words.Example character string in Fig. 4 comprises character string 108A-108N.Character string 108A (" the ") can be that most probable character string and character string 108N (" stingN ") can comprise least possibility character string.
When user's increment (for example carry out attitude, one or more continuously and/or knock attitude), Keysheet module 22 can be carried out searching character string in the language model 28 of part or all character that comprises the character string that comprises the character being associated with button corresponding to attitude increment.For example, when Keysheet module 22 receives the indication from " S " and " A " key of graphic keyboard 16B to the attitude of " T " key of graphic keyboard, UID12 is passed through in the attitude path that Keysheet module 22 can be determined attitude 30 near graphic keyboard 16B " R " key and " T " key.Therefore, Keysheet module 22 can be determined and comprises near other of character of the button attitude path of attitude 30 character string " SAT " and " SAR " in may character strings.
For carry out searching character string in language model 28 increment, Keysheet module 22 can pointing character string for the data structure of the probability of prefix in character string modeling to language model 28, described prefix for example with the attitude path of attitude near the corresponding one or more groups that may characters of button.For example, language model 28 can comprise setting the dictionary of (trie) data structure storage.Lexicographic tree data structure can comprise a plurality of nodes, and each node can represent to be included in the letter of the character string in dictionary.First node in lexicographic tree can be called and can not correspond to alphabetical Ingress node.In other examples, Ingress node can be corresponding to letter.Each node can have one or more child nodes.For example, Ingress node can have 26 child nodes, corresponds respectively to the letter of the English alphabet.
The subset of the node in lexicographic tree can comprise respectively that this node of indication is the sign of terminal node.Each terminal node of lexicographic tree can be indicated whole character string (for example writing the word in dictionary).The letter being represented by node along the node path from Ingress node to terminal node can spell out the character string of being indicated by terminal node.For example, the node in the node path of lexicographic tree can correspond respectively to " s ", " a ", " t ", " i ", " n ", wherein, corresponding to the node of " n ", is terminal node.
As shown in Figure 4, language model 28 can comprise language model frequency information, such as n-gram language model.N-gram language model can the first preceding paragraph based in sequence be provided for the item x in neighbouring entry sequence
ithe probability distribution of (letter or word) (that is, P (x
i| x
i-(n-1)..., x
i-1)).For example, (n-gram model wherein, n=2) can provide the probability of letter " t " after sequence " sa " to double base language model.In some instances, language model 28 comprises the language model frequency information in lexicographic tree.For example, each node in lexicographic tree can comprise that alphabetical expression and indication letter are the probable values of next the alphabetical possibility after the prefix of character of the ancestor node in the path corresponding to lexicographic tree.As shown in Figure 4, can be based on frequency 110A corresponding to the corresponding probability node in the lexicographic tree of " t ", " h ", " e ".For example, frequency 100A can indicate the probability of character string " the " in given language context.As an example, if language context comprises two previously character strings of input, frequency 110 can represent that " the " is with respect to the probability of two character strings of previously having inputted.Be included in corresponding to the probability in each in the node of " t ", " h ", " e " and can jointly equal frequency 110A.For example, the product and/or the summation that correspond respectively to for the probability of the node of " t ", " h " and " e " can equal frequency 110A.
For the one or more indications in response to knocking and/or continuously attitude and searching character string in increment ground effective language model 28, Keysheet module 22 can, by determining one or more node paths of lexicographic tree, be determined one or more character strings based on example prefix " SAR " and " SAT ".Sequence node in the path of finishing with terminal node can be corresponding to the character string in language model 26.Keysheet module 22 can be determined the one or more paths that comprise corresponding to the node of the respective symbols of prefix.In one example, for example, in order only (partly to complete attitude user, prefix only comprises " sat ") situation under export one or more proposes character strings, Keysheet module 22 can determine that the node corresponding to " t " in node path " s ", " a ", " t " is not terminal node, and Keysheet module 22 can be searched for the one or more paths from the node corresponding to " t " to terminal node.Each respective paths can be corresponding to the kinds of characters string that comprises the character being associated with node in respective paths in language model.Therefore, Keysheet module 22 can have by selection the path of the highest language model score value, for example based on being included in, comprising one or more nodes and corresponding to the probability in each respective nodes in the path of selected character string, use language model 28 to select character strings.
As previously, described in Fig. 1, Keysheet module 22 can be associated the combination score value based on language model score value and spatial model score value and character string the word of language model 28 (for example, from).Keysheet module 22 can select to have one or more character strings of the highest combination score value.Keysheet module 22 can be exported such character string to show or otherwise to select such character string.In some instances, however user may wish that input is not included in the character string in language model 28.For example, the outer character string " satok " of dictionary may not be included in language model 28.In other words, the lexicographic tree of language model 28 may not comprise the path corresponding to the node of " s ", " a ", " t ", " o ", " k ".Be not not export it because the character string " satok " of expection is not included in language model 28, Keysheet module 22 can be associated character string " satok " with dictionary outer language model score value.Dictionary outer language model score value can be not included in that character string in dictionary is associated and in the situation that lack the language model score value based on language model 28, can be as substituting score value.In this way, Keysheet module 22 can be determined the combination score value based on dictionary outer language model score value and spatial model score value, makes to combine score value and is associated with " satok ".Then, Keysheet module 22 can compare the combination score value of " satok ", if it is included in the group of the character string with the highest combination score value, Keysheet module 22 can be selected " satok " (for example exporting to show).
In some instances, dictionary outer language model score value can be the minimum language model score value being associated with character string in language model 28.For example, Keysheet module 22 can be determined a plurality of character strings that are for example included in, in language model 28 (character string that, comprises dictionary).As shown in Figure 4, each character string in a plurality of character strings in language model 28 can be associated with corresponding probability (such as frequency 110A, 110N etc.).Keysheet module 22 can be determined and in language model 28, is included in the minimum probability in a plurality of probability.For example, Keysheet module 22 can determine that at language model 28 medium frequency 110N are minimum probability, for example, with respect to the minimum probability of other probability that are associated with character string.Keysheet module 22 can be determined dictionary outer language model score value based on minimum probability at least in part.For example, the minimum probability that Keysheet module 22 can be associated the character string with language model 28 is as dictionary outer language model score value.In other examples, Keysheet module 22 can be applied to minimum probability by weight, and the minimum probability of weighting is used as to dictionary outer language model score value.In either case, when definite dictionary outer language model score value, Keysheet module 22 can spatial model score value and dictionary outer language model score value based on being associated with this character string be determined combination score value.
In some instances, Keysheet module 22 can be by predetermined value as dictionary outer language model score value.For example, Keysheet module 22 can be stored and/or definite predetermined value by user and/or slip-stick artist's configuration.Predetermined value can be steady state value.For example, predetermined value can be nonzero value.In some instances, the probability that predetermined value can the character string based on language model 28 be associated.In other examples again, Keysheet module 28 can be applied to predetermined value by weight, makes the predetermined value of weighting as dictionary outer language model score value.In some instances, weight can be at least in part based on Keysheet module 22 by the spatial model score value of dictionary outer language model score value character string associated therewith.
In some instances, Keysheet module 28 can be applied to penalty value at least one in combination score value, spatial model score value and the dictionary outer language model score value of character string.For example, Keysheet module 28 can be in response to determining that combining score value applies penalty value based on dictionary outer language model score value at least in part.Keysheet module 28 can be applied this penalty value, because the high spatial model score value being associated due to the button with corresponding to being included in the character in character string, the outer character string of dictionary can have very high combination score value.In some instances, penalty value can be steady state value.Can configure penalty value by user and/or slip-stick artist.In some instances, weight value of being applied to (for example penalty value, predetermined value, score value etc.) can be comprised this value and weight are added or are multiplied each other.
In some instances, Keysheet module 28 can be in response to determining that the spatial model score value being associated with character string meets threshold value and dictionary outer language model score value is associated with character string.In some instances, when score value is greater than this threshold value, spatial model score value can meet this threshold value.In other examples, when score value is less than this threshold value, spatial model score value can meet this threshold value.Therefore, in some instances, Keysheet module 28 can not be associated dictionary outer language model score value with the character string with the spatial model score value that does not meet threshold value.Therefore, in some instances, only have the spatial model score value being associated with this character string to meet threshold value, Keysheet module 28 can be associated dictionary outer language model score value with character string.
