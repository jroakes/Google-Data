With reference now to Fig. 4, the amplitude limit function is described in further detail.At first, we discuss some clear and definite materials, so that provide the better understanding of reader to amplitude limiting processing.The crest factor of signal is defined as the ratio of peak power and average power.Although know that the peak value/mean value of signal is useful than (PAR), cumulative distribution function (CDF) provides the better understanding about the envelope power true statistical nature.CDF and additional cumulative distribution function CCDF are defined by following equation.
CCDF＝1-F(x)
Say that in essence CCDF is the curve of PAR from 0 to 100%.Because peak level and the time quantum of flower on crest factor is a lot, therefore work is very easily about distribution function.Briefly, the shape of CCDF is very important.For the disclosure content, crest factor is defined as 0.01% PAR.For example, the PAR of 10dB just means that signal power is 0.01% than the probability of the big 10dB of average power.
Expectation amplitude limit function can restricting signal peak value, produce the signal power of the least possible noise, interference or non-expectation simultaneously.In order to produce the low limitation of interference elimination measuring, it is very important that the interruption in the waveform minimizes.Window type amplitude limit algorithm is a kind of outstanding method that satisfies these purposes.Amplitude limit is Digital Implementation in Base-Band Processing, so data can be handled by non real-time.The various forms of window type amplitude limit algorithm all is fit to this purpose.With reference to figure 4, a kind of algorithm that utilizes two threshold value restricting signal 401 peak values has been described.The soft limiting threshold marker is Tclp, and hard clip threshold is labeled as Tsat.The user determines the value of these threshold values by experience according to specific system configuration.The first step of window amplitude limit algorithm is the input waveform that the scanning peak value surpasses limiting threshold.In case it is identified to surpass the signal peak of threshold value, then uses hard-limiting or soft limiting.Peak value index marker among Fig. 4 is t
Max407.Under the situation of soft limiting, the peak value of waveform part is twisted in the reverse Hanning window mouth 403.Can realize that as those of ordinary skills the window of various other types also will correctly be worked.Following equation shows Hanning window mouth h

Calculation window amplitude limit function makes t after window and signal are rolled up
MaxPeak value equal the Tclp level, this illustrates 405.Therefore, surpass Tclp but, will have a custom window to be calculated and use, for any so that local maximum is dropped to the Tclp level less than the peak value of Tsat.Following weights are replaced to the window function that above-mentioned equation will calculate expectation.
Owing to have only that part of signal filtered, therefore around peak region, will have some to be interrupted, but they should be less than the interruption relevant with hard-limiting basically.
Certain a bit on, people may find that the work of window amplitude limiter gets very and make great efforts, to such an extent as to it has produced and the as many interference of hard-limiting.If situation is like this, then utilizing constant amplitude limit weights rather than variable amplitude limit weights will be best bet.Following equation has been described the amplitude limit weights of this situation.
Under the situation of hard-limiting, signal value will be changed with the Tclp threshold value and be complementary.
Filter 303 is realized so that have following feature in the DSP type.Filter should have flat passband, so that keep the feature of last channel or pulse finishing filter.In addition, also need steep transition band and suitable decay, can satisfy channel specifications so that guarantee filtered waveform.
With reference to figure 5, show the power spectrum density of the point that is labeled as 1-4 among Fig. 3.Recall and in the device 201 of Fig. 3, used two amplitude limit functions 301,305.The threshold value of the first amplitude limit function is set as low level, so that produce heavy amplitude limit.The output of first amplitude limiter is filtered, so that eliminate because the interference that heavy amplitude limit function produces.After filtering, the consequential signal quilt is amplitude limit once more.The threshold value of the second amplitude limit function is set as very slightly carries out amplitude limit to signal.To have some owing to the spectral re-growth that the second time, amplitude limit caused, but because amplitude limit is very slight, so this should be an acceptable.It is the reduction that cost increases peak value/mean value ratio with the adjacent channel power (ACP) that reduces each input of power amplifier a little that this method allows the user.But if power amplifier is operated in its rated power, then very possible generation of the nonlinear characteristic of power amplifier surpasses the adjacent-channel interference that each input signal disturbs.Therefore, by comprising the second amplitude limit function, the actual ACP performance of seeing in antenna output may can not reduce fully.On the contrary, even the ACP of power amplifier input reduces, because the PAR that the second amplitude limit function causes reduces the ACP that also might cause antenna output to improve.
As a reference, utilize the input of the first window amplitude limiter, be labeled as 1 waveform, the standard I S-95 channel model that people can see 3dB corner frequency with 590KHz and 45dB decay is how at any window amplitude limit or further form frequency spectrum before the filtering.The PAR of primary signal 0.01% is 9.75dB.As shown, utilize amplitude limit function 301 signal to be carried out the increase that amplitude limit will cause energy outside the frequency band from the 0.01%PAR that 9.75dB drops to 4.57dB by the waveform that is labeled as 2.The limitation signal utilization is carried out filtering by the shown frequency spectrum as a result of the waveform that is labeled as 3 then.Although ACP is later on good in filtering, peak value/mean value is than being increased to 5.62dB 0.01%.For the second time signal limiter is recovered 0.01% PAR to be reduced to 4.66dB, but produced by the shown interference of the waveform that is labeled as 4.Should be pointed out that interference still is lower than the original intrinsic noise level of being set up by channel model.
Fig. 6 shows and runs through entire process chain peak value/mean value and such as what change.See the summary of the following table pair various information relevant with Fig. 6 waveform.As shown in the table, the variation of peak value/mean value ratio can be resolved into the variation of peak power and the variation of average power.Utilize waveform 1 as a reference, we can see the peak power of the amplitude limit operation the reduction to a great extent signal of being carried out by the amplitude limit function described in the waveform 2 301, and also less simultaneously degree ground has reduced average power.After signal is filtered, and since the decay in the filter passbands, waveform 3, i.e. mean value, some descends a little, but because the variation of signal in the complex plane, peak value has increased.In the process that the PAR that attempts to recover some losses reduces, signal is limited for the second time, though be slight.Consequently another of peak power time dB reduces, and average power keeps not becoming relatively, shown in waveform 4.

Utilize the input of waveform that peak value reduces, can measure following improvement as power amplifier.At rated output power, limiting waveform has 6 to the better ACP performance of 7dB, can also keep simultaneously and the identical efficient of limiting waveform not.Utilization causes with the extra 3dB operate power amplifier that surpasses rated power as the limiting waveform of input and utilizes not limiting waveform at the identical ACP of the power amplifier of rated power operation.With 3dB more important place driving power amplifier cause efficient to improve 50%.These results are typical, but may rely on power amplifier compensation what and change.
