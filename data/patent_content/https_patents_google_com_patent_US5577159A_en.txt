Definitions
- the present invention relates to a new method for high quality speech coding at low coding rates.
- the invention relates to processing voiced speech based on representing and interpolating the speech signal in the time-frequency domain.
- Telecommunication Industry Association is actively pushing towards establishing a new "half-rate” digital mobile communication standard even before the current North-American “full rate” digital system (IS54) has been fully deployed. Similar activities are taking place in Europe and Japan.
- the demand in general, is to advance the technology to a point of achieving or exceeding the performance of the current standard systems while cutting the transmission rate by half.
- CELP code-excited linear prediction
- M. R. Schroeder and B. S. Atal "Code-Excited Linear Predictive (CELP): High Quality Speech at Very Low Bit Rates," Proc. IEEE ICASSP'85, Vol. 3, pp. 937-940, March 1985; P. Kroon and E. F. Deprettere, "A Class of Analysis-by-Synthesis Predictive Coders for High Quality Speech Coding at Rates Between 4.8 and 16 Kb/s," IEEE J. on Sel. Areas in Comm., SAC-6(2), pp. 353-363, February 1988.
- Current CELP coders deliver fairly high-quality coded speech at rates of about 8 Kbps and above. However, the performance deteriorates quickly as the rate goes down to around 4 Kbps and below.
- the present invention provides a method and apparatus for the high-quality compression of speech while avoiding many of the costs and restrictions associated with prior methods.
- the present invention is illustratively based on a technique called Time-Frequency Interpolation ("TFI").
- TFI illustratively forms a plurality of Linear Predictive Coding parameters characterizing a speech signal.
- TFI generates a per-sample discrete spectrum for points in the speech signal and then decimates the sequence of discrete spectra.
- TFI interpolates the discrete spectra and generates a smooth speech signal based on the Linear Predictive Coding parameters.

- FIG. 1 presents an illustrative embodiment of the present invention which encodes speech.
- Analog speech signal is digitized by sampler 101 by techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.
- the digitized speech signal is then encoded by encoder 103 according to a prescribed rule illustratively described herein.
- Encoder 103 advantageously further operates on the encoded speech signal to prepare the speech signal for the storage or transmission channel 105.
- the received encoded sequence is decoded by decoder 107.
- a reconstructed version of the original input analog speech signal is obtained by passing the decoded speech signal through a D/A converter 109 by techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.
- the encoding/decoding operations in the present invention advantageously use a technique called Time-Frequency Interpolation.
- a technique called Time-Frequency Interpolation An overview of an illustrative Time-Frequency Interpolation technique will be discussed in Section II before the detailed discussion of the illustrative embodiments are presented in Section III.
- Time-Frequency Representation is based on the concept of short-time per-sample discrete spectrum sequence.
- Each time n on a discrete-time axis is associated with an M(n)-point discrete spectrum.
- DFT discrete Fourier transform
- M(n) n 2 (n)-n 1 (n)+1.
- the segments may not be equal in size and may overlap.
- n lies in its segment, namely, n 1 (n) ⁇ n ⁇ n 2 (n).
- the n-th spectrum is conventionally given by: ##EQU1##
- the time series x(n) may be over-specified by the sequence X (n,K) since, depending on the amount of segment overlapping, there may be several different ways of reconstructing x(n) from X(n,K). Exact reconstruction, however, is not the main objective in using TFR. Depending on application, the "over-specifying" feature may, in fact, be useful in synthesizing signals with certain desired properties.
- the spectrum assigned to time n may be generated in various ways to achieve various desired effects.
- the general-case spectrum sequence is denoted by Y(n,K) to distinguish between the straightforward case of Eq. (1) and more general transform operations that may utilize linear and non-linear techniques like decimation, interpolation, shifts, time (frequency) scale modification, phase manipulations and others.
- the TFR process is illustrated in FIG. 2 which shows a typical sequence of spectra in a discrete time-frequency domain (n,K). Each spectrum is derived from one time-domain segment. The segments usually overlap and need not be of the same size.
- the figure also shows the corresponding signals y(n,m) in the time-time domain (n,m).
- the window functions w(n,m) are shown vertically along the n-axis and the weighted-sum signal z(m) is shown along the m-axis.
- TFR time limits
- TFR The TFR framework, as defined above is general enough to apply in many different applications.
- a few examples are signal (speech) enhancement, pre- and postfiltering, time scale modification and data compression.
- speech speech
- pre- and postfiltering pre- and postfiltering
- time scale modification time scale modification
- data compression data compression
- TFR for low-rate speech coding.
- TFR is used here as a basic framework for spectral decimation, interpolation and vector quantization in an LPC-based speech coding algorithm.
- the next section defines the decimation-interpolation process withing the TFR framework.
- Time-frequency interpolation refers here to the process of first decimating the TFR spectra Y(n,K) along the time axis n and then interpolating missing spectra from the survivor neighbors.
- TFI refers to interpolation of the frequency spacings of the spectral components.
- TFR For the coding of voiced speech, i.e. where the vocal tract is excited by quasi periodic pulses of air, see L. R. Rabiner and R. W. Schafer, Digital Processing of Speech Signals (Prentice Hall, 1978), TFR combined with TFI provides a useful domain in which coding distortions can be made less objectionable. This is so because the spectrum of voiced speech, especially when synchronized to the speech periodicity, changes slowly and smoothly.
- the TFI approach is a natural way of exploiting these speech characteristics. It should be noted that the emphasis is on interpolation of spectra and not waveforms. However, since the spectrum is interpolated on a per-sample basis, the corresponding waveform tends to sound smooth even though it may be significantly different from the ideal (original) waveform.
- TFI TFI
- Eq. (5) The formulation of TFI as in Eq. (5) is very general and does not point to any specific application.
- the following sections provide detailed descriptions of several embodiments of the present invention.
- four classes of TFI that may be practical for speech applications are described below. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other embodiments of the TFI application are possible.
- linear TFI is used.
- Linear TFI is the case where I n is a linear operation on its two arguments.
- the operators F n -1 and I n which, in general do not commute, may be interchanged. This is important since performing the inverse DFT prior to interpolating may significantly reduce the cost of the entire TFI algorithm.
- I n is a linear operator
- the interpolation functions ⁇ (n) and ⁇ (n) are not necessarily linear in n and linear TFI is not a linear interpolation in that sense.
- Eq. (7) shows that linear TFI can be performed directly on two waveforms corresponding to the two survivor spectra at the frame boundaries.
- Eq. (8) shows that, in this special case, the window functions w(n,m) do not have a direct role in the TFI process. They may be used in a one-time off-line computation of ⁇ (m) and ⁇ (m). In fact, ⁇ (m) and ⁇ (m) may be specified directly, without the use of w(n,m).
- Linear TFI with linear interpolation functions ⁇ (m), ⁇ (m) is simple and attractive from implementation point of view and has previously been used in similar forms see, B. W. Kleijn, "Continuous Representations in Linear Predictive Coding," Proc. IEEEICRSSP'91, Vol. S1, pp. 201-204, May 1991; B. W. Kleijn, “Methods for Waveform Interpolation in Speech Coding," Digital Signal Processing, Vol. 1, pp. 215-230, 1991.
- This aspect of the invention is an important example of non-linear TFI.
- Linear TFI is based on linear combination of complex spectra. This operation does not, in general, preserve the spectral shape and may generate a poor estimate of the missing spectra. Simply stated, if A and B are two complex spectra, then, the magnitude of ⁇ A+ ⁇ B may be very different from that of either A or B. In speech processing applications, the short-term spectral distortions generated by linear TFI may create objectionable auditory artifacts.
- magnitude-preserving interpolation I n (.,.) is defined so as to separately interpolate the magnitude and the phase of its arguments. Note that in this case I n and F n -1 do not commute and the interpolated spectra have to be explicitly derived prior to taking the inverse DFT.
- the magnitude-phase approach may be pushed to an extreme case where the phase is totally ignored (set to zero). This eliminates haft of the information to be coded while it still produces fairly good speech quality due to the spectral-shape preservation and the inherent smoothness of the TFI.
- the TFI rate is defined as the frequency of sampling the spectrum sequence, which is clearly 1/N.
- the discrete spectrum Y(n,K) corresponds to one M(n)-size period of y(n,m). If N>M(n), the periodically-extended parts of y(n,m) take part in the TFI process. This case is referred to as Low-Rate TFI (LR-TFI).
- LR-TFI Low-Rate TFI
- LR-TFI is mostly useful for generating near-periodic signals, particularly in low-rate speech coding.
- the TFI rate is a very important factor. There are conflicting requirements on the bit rate and the TFI rate. HR-TFI provide smooth and accurate description of the signal, but a high bit rate is needed to code the data. LR-TFI is less accurate and more prone to interpolation artifacts but a lower bit rate is required for coding the data. It seems that a good tradeoff can only be found experimentally by measuring the coder performance for different TFI rates.
- Time Scale Modification (TSM) is employed.
- TSM amounts to dilation or contraction of a continuous-time signal x(t) along the time axis.
- DFT or other sinusoidal representations
- TSM can be easily approximated as ##EQU5## It is emphasized that Eq.
- the phase interpolation is performed along the m-axis and, as implied by the above notation, it may be different for each of the waveforms y(n,m).
- Various interpolation strategies may be employed, see references by Kleijn, supra. The one used in the low-rate coder will be described later.
- the boundary conditions are usually given in terms of two fundamental frequencies (pitch values).
- phase Since the phase is now independent of the DFT size, namely, of the original frequency spacing, one has to make sure that the actual spacing made by the phase ⁇ (m) does not cause spectral aliasing. This is very much dependent upon how Y(n,K) is interpolated from the boundary spectra and on how the actual size of Y(n,k) is determined.
- One advantage of the TFI system, as formulated here, is that spectral aliasing, due to excessive time-scaling, can be controlled during spectral interpolation. This is hard to do directly in the time domain.
- the time-invariant operator F -1 is now given by: ##EQU7## Note that the operator F -1 now commutes with the operator W n , which is advantageous for low-cost implementations.
- FCS Fractional Circular Shift
- FCS is usually viewed as a phase modification of the spectrum Y(n,K), with the modified spectrum given by: ##EQU9## The use of FCS in the low-rate coder will be described below.
- a final aspect of the invention deals with the use of DFT parameterization techniques.
- HR-TFI the number of terms involved per time unit may be much greater then that of the underlying signal.
- One simple way of reducing the number of terms is to non-uniformly decimate the DFT.
- Spectral smoothing techniques could also be used for this purpose. Parametrized TFI is useful in low-rate speech coding since the limited bit budget may not be sufficient for coding all the DFT terms.
- Coder 103 begins operation by processing the digitized speech signal through a classical Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) Analyzer 205 resulting in a decomposition of spectral envelope information. It is well known to those skilled in the art how to make and use the LPC analyzer. This information is represented by LPC parameters which are then quantized by the LPC Quantizer 210 and which become the coefficients for an all-pole LPC filter 220.
- LPC Linear Predictive Coding
- Voice and pitch analyzer 230 also operates on the digitized speech signal to determine if the speech is voiced or unvoiced.
- the voice and pitch analyzer 230 generates a pitch signal based on the pitch period of the speech signal for use by the Time-Frequency Interpolation (TFI) coder 235.
- the current pitch signal along with other signals as indicated in the figures, is "indexed" whereby the encoded representation of the signal is an "index" corresponding to one of a plurality of entries in a codebook. It is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art how to compress these signals using well-known techniques. The index is simply a shorthand, or compressed, method for specifying the signal.
- the indexed signals are forwarded to the channel encoder/buffer 225 so they may be properly stored or communicated over the transmission channel 105.
- the coder 103 processes and codes the digitized speech signal in one of two different modes depending on whether the current data is voiced or unvoiced.
- CELP Code-Excited Linear-Predictive
- CELP coder 215 advantageously optimizes the coded excitation signal by monitoring the output coded signal. This is represented in the figure by the dotted feedback line. In this mode, the signal is assumed to be totally a periodic and therefore there is no attempt to exploit long-term redundancies by pitch loops or similar techniques.
- the CELP mode When the signal is declared voiced, the CELP mode is turned off and the TFI coder 235 is turned on by switch 305. The rest of this section discusses this coding mode. The various operations that take place in this mode are shown in FIG. 4. The figure shows the logical progression of the TFI algorithm. Those skilled in the art will recognize that in practice, and for some specific systems, the actual flow may be somewhat different. As shown in the figure, the TFI coder is applied to the LPC residual, or LPC excitation signal, obtained by inverse-filtering the input speech with LPC inverse filter 310. Once per frame, an initial spectrum X (K) is derived by applying a DFF using the pitch-sized DFT 320 where the DFT length is determined by the current pitch signal.
- a pitched-sized DFT is advantageously used but is not required. This segment, however, may be longer than one frame.
- the spectrum is then modified by the spectral modifier 330 to reduce its size, and the modified spectrum is quantized by predictive weighted vector quantizer 340. Delay 350 is required for this quantizing operation. These operations yield the spectrum Y(N-1,K), that is, the spectrum associated with the current frame end-point.
- the quantized spectrum is then transmitted along with the current pitch period to the interpolation and alignment unit 360.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of an illustrative interpolation and alignment unit such as that shown at 360 in FIG. 4.
- the current spectrum, previous quantized spectra from delay block 370, and the current pitch signal are input to this unit.
- Current spectrum, Y(N-1,K) is first enhanced by the spectral demodifier/enhancer 405 to reverse or alter the operations performed by spectral modifier 330.
- the re-modified spectrum is then aligned in the alignment unit 410 with the spectra of the previous frame by FCS operation and interpolated by the interpolation unit 420. Additionally, the phase is also interpolated.
- the unit 360 yields the spectral sequence Y'(n,K) and phase ⁇ (m) which are input to the excitation synthesizer 380.
- the spectrum is convened to a time sequence, y(n,m), by the inverse DFT unit 510, and the time sequence is windowed by the 2-dimensional windower 520 to yield the coded voice excitation signal.
- FIG. 7 illustrates block diagram speech decoding system 107 where switch 750 selects CELP decoding or TFI decoding depending on whether the speech is voiced or unvoiced.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a block diagram of a TFI encoder 720. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the blocks on the TFI encoder perform similar functions as the blocks of the same name in the encoder.
- TFI algorithms can be envisioned within the framework formulated so far. There is no obvious systematic way of developing the best system and lots of heuristics and experimentations are involved. One way is to start with a simple system and gradually improve it by gaining more insight to the process and by eliminating one problem at a time. Along this line, we now describe in more detail three different TFI systems.
- spectral modification advantageously amounts only to nulling the upper 20% of the DFT components: if M is the current initial DFT size (half the current pitch), then, X' (K) and Y(N-1,K) have only 0.8 M complex components.
- the purpose of this windowing is to make the following VQ operation more efficient by reducing the dimensionality.
- the spectrum is quantized by a weighted, variable-size, predictive vector quantizer. Spectral weighting is accomplished by minimizing ⁇ H(K)[X'(K)-Y(N-1,K)] ⁇ where ⁇ . ⁇ means sum of squared magnitudes. H(K) is the DFT of the impulse response of a modified all-pole LPC filter. See Schroeder and Atal, supra; Kroon and Deprettere, supra.
- the quantized spectrum is now aligned with the previous spectrum by applying FCS to Y(N-1,K) as in Eq. (13). The best fractional shift is found for maximum correlation between Y'(-1,K) and Y'(N-1,K).
- System 2 was designed to remove some of the artifacts of system 1 by moving from LR-TFI to HR-TFI.
- the TFI rate is 4 times higher than that of system 1, which means that the TFI process is done every 5 msec. (40 samples). This frequent update of the spectrum allows for more accurate representation of the speech dynamics, without the excessive periodicity typical to system 1.
- Increasing the TFI rate creates a heavy burden on the quantizer since much more data has to be quantized per unit time.
- the window width is given by ##EQU11## which means that the dimensionality of the vector quantizer is never higher than 20.
- the use of magnitude-only spectrum amounts to data reduction by a factor of 2. While the spectral shape is preserved, removing the phase causes the synthesized excitation to be more spiky. This sometimes causes the output speech to sound a bit metallic. However, the advantage of achieving higher quantization performance outweighs this minor disadvantage.
- the quantization of the spectrum is performed 4 times more frequently than in the case of system 1, with essentially the same number of bits per 20 msec. interval. This is made possible by reducing the VQ dimension.
- the operation defined by Eqs. (15) and (16) means lowpass filtering.
- the quantized spectrum is extended or demodified, as shown in FIG. 5 by the spectral demodified enhancer 405, by assigning the average value of the magnitude-spectrum to all locations of the missing data: ##EQU12## This is based on the assumption that, since the LPC residual is generally white, the missing DFT components would have about the same level as the non-missing ones. Obviously, this may not be the case in many instances. However, listening tests have confirmed that the resulting spectral distortions at the high end of the spectrum is not very objectionable.
- System 3 uses the non-linear magnitude-phase LR-TFI introduced above. This is an attempt to further improve the performance by reducing the artifacts of both system 1 and system 2.
- the initial spectrum X(K) is windowed by nulling all components indexed by K ⁇ 0.4 P and then is vector quantized.
- the quantized spectrum Y(N-1,K) is then decomposed into a magnitude vector Y(N-1,k) and a phase vector argY(N-1,K).
- a sequence of spectra is then generated by linear interpolation of the magnitudes and phases, using the ones from the previous frame: ##EQU13##
- the vector size is K max . This is the maximum of previous and current spectrum sizes.
- the shorter spectrum is extended to K max by zero-padding.
- the interpolated phases are close to those of the source spectrum only towards the frame boundaries.
- the intermediate phase vectors are somewhat arbitrary since the linear interpolation does not mean good approximation to the desired phase in any quantitative sense.
- the interpolated phases act similar to the true ones in spreading the signal and, thus, the spikiness of system 2 is eliminated.
- the vector interpolation as defined above does not take care of possible spectral aliasing or distortions in the case of a large difference between the spacings of the two boundary spectra. Better interpolation schemes, in this respect, will be studied in the future.
- Each complex spectrum Y(n,K), formed by the pair ⁇ Y(n,K), argY(n,K) ⁇ , is FCS-ed to maximize its correlation with Y(-1,K), which yields the aligned spectra Y'(n,K).
- Inverse DFT is now performed, with the phase ⁇ (m) as in (14).
- the resulting waveforms y(n,k) are then weight-summed by the operator W n , as in (2), using simple rectangular functions w(n,m) of width Q, defined by: ##EQU14## This means that each waveform y(n,m) contributes to the final waveform z(m) only locally.
- a good value for the window size Q can only be found experimentally by listening to processed speech.
- This disclosure deals with time-frequency interpolation (TFI) techniques and their application to low-rate coding of voiced speech.
- TFI time-frequency interpolation
- the disclosure focuses on the formulation of the general TFI framework. Within this framework, three specific TFI systems for voiced speech coding are described. The methods and algorithms have been described without reference to specific hardware or software. Instead, the individual stages have been described in such a manner that those skilled in the art can readily adapt such hardware and software as may be available or preferable for particular applications.
