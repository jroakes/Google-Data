Definitions
- This invention relates generally to ratings and reviews of businesses and other entities and, more particularly, to scoring businesses based on user behaviors.
- the Internet is useful for a variety of purposes. For example, users may use the Internet to search for entities of interest and to retrieve information about businesses or other entities. Additionally, users may search for ratings, reviews, and other explicit feedback provided by other users. A user may decide to purchase items from or patronize an entity based on the ratings, reviews, and other explicit feedback. Additionally, search engines or other data aggregation mechanisms may assign scores to entities based on the ratings and reviews provided by other users. However, such ratings and reviews require manual entry by other users and may be subject to bias from users. The ratings and reviews may also be susceptible to spam or other activities that affect the accuracy of the ratings and reviews.
- a computer-implemented method for determining an entity score based on user behaviors associated with an entity includes identifying, one or more processors, a plurality of user payment transactions with the entity and comparing an average tip amount determined from the plurality of user payment transactions with a baseline tip amount determined from historical user payment transactions to determine a scoring signal.
- the method further includes modifying, by one or more processors, a score associated with the entity based on the scoring signal and storing, by one or more processors, the score and an entity identifier associated with the entity.
- a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium having executable computer code stored thereon for determining a score associated with an entity based on user behaviors includes a set of instructions that causes one or more processors to perform the following: identifying, one or more processors, a plurality of user payment transactions with the entity and comparing an average tip amount determined from the plurality of user payment transactions with a baseline tip amount determined from historical user payment transactions to determine a scoring signal.

- FIG. 6 is a diagram of a computer in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
- ⁇ are systems, methods, and computer-readable media for determining an entity score based on user behaviors associated with an entity.
- User behaviors are determined from user interactions with various services, such as a payment-based service, location-based service, and other services.
- the user behaviors include payment behaviors (e.g., tipping behaviors), location behaviors (e.g., repeat presences at an entity), and choice behaviors (e.g., selecting an entity over other entities in a geographic area).
- a user interacts with payment-based services, location-based services, and other services using a client computer.
- the user behaviors are determined from data obtained from the payment-based services, location-based services, and other services. For example, an average tip amount and tipping frequency is determined from payment transactions to an entity obtained from the payment-based services. Based on an evaluation of the average tip amount, tipping frequency, or both, a positive scoring signal or negative scoring signal is determined.
- the scoring signal is used to modify, e.g., increase or decrease, an entity score associated with an entity.
- users' presences at an entity are obtained from a location-based service, and the ratio of returning users to one-time users is determined.
- a positive scoring signal or negative scoring signal is determined and used to modify, e.g., increase or decrease, an entity score associated with an entity.
- user presences at an entity over a time period are determined and alternative entities in a geographic area are determined. The user presences at the selected entity are evaluated based on a comparison to the alternative entities. Based on the user's selection of the selected entity over alternative entities, a positive scoring signal is determined and used to modify, e.g., increase, an entity score associated with an entity.
- FIG. 1 depicts a system 100 illustrating the obtaining of user behaviors that are used for scoring entities in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- entity refers to a private or public entity that is capable of providing for the some or all of user interactions described herein.
- An entity may or may not have a physical location.
- an entity includes a business (e.g., a restaurant, bar, retail store), a public facility (e.g., a library, a museum, a park), and other similar entities.
- the user interactions 102 may indicate various user behaviors that can be used as signals in scoring an entity affected by the user interactions 102 .
- the user interactions 102 may include, for example, payment transactions to an entity, the presence of a user at an entity (as determined from the user's location), the selection of an entity from other entities, and other user action.
- payment behaviors 104 are collected from user interactions.
- the payment behaviors 104 may include whether a user added a tip to a payment to an entity, the amount of the tip, the frequency of tipping to an entity, and other payment behaviors.
- location based behaviors 106 may be collected from user interactions 102 .

- the choice based behaviors may include whether users selected an entity from other entities within specific geographic distance in a similar category, and other choices that indicate a preference for an entity.
- the payment behaviors 104 , the location-based behaviors 106 , and the choice-based behaviors 108 are used to affect a score 116 associated with the entity 114 .
- the behaviors 104 , 106 , and 108 are used as qualitative scoring signals 118 to increase or decrease a score 116 associated with the entity 114 .
- the score 116 associated with an entity 114 may be previously determined based on explicit feedback for the entity provided by users, such as explicit ratings and reviews, or may be a baseline score, such as zero. As will be appreciated, such explicit ratings and reviews are obtained from websites and applications that receive and aggregate user ratings and reviews for entities.
- the determined score 116 and the associated entity 114 are stored in an entity database 120 .
- the entity database 120 may include entity identifiers and the associated entity scores for each entity. The entity database 120 may then be used to provide the score for an entity to other systems, such as search engines that provide information about an entity. For example, the entity 114 may be ranked with other entities based on the entity score 116 , and the ranked entities may be provided to a client computer in response to a search query.

- the user behavior data 216 is processed by a user behavior process 218 to determine scoring signals 220 .
- the scoring signals 200 modify an entity score associated with an entity.
- the user behaviors may indicate that the user 204 generated negative behaviors towards an entity, such as by leaving a low tip amount or no tip.
- the scoring signals 200 associated with such a behavior may be negative and may result in a decrease of the entity score.
- the user behaviors may indicate that the user 204 generated positive behaviors towards an entity, such as by leaving a large tip amount or frequent tips.

- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., user payment transactions, user locations, user preferences, or other user information).
- user information e.g., user payment transactions, user locations, user preferences, or other user information.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

- FIGS. 3 , 4 , and 5 depict processes for determining scoring signals from different user behaviors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 depicts a process 300 for determining scoring signals from a payment service in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- aggregated payment transactions to an entity are obtained (block 302 ) from a payment service 304 .
- the payment service 304 may include a mobile payment service accessed by the client computer 202 , such as NFC-based mobile payment service.
- the payment transactions may include, for example, payment amounts for goods or services obtained from an entity, and tip amounts associated with the payment.
- the amount of the tips, the frequency of tips, or both are determined from the payment transactions (block 306 ).
- the frequency of tips may be determined relative to payment transactions for a single user (e.g., whether a single user frequency tipped on payment transactions to an entity) or payment transactions for multiple users (e.g., whether multiple users tipped on payment transactions to an entity).
- the amount of tips, the frequency of tips, or both are evaluated to determine a scoring signal based on the evaluation (block 308 ).
- the evaluation may include evaluating an average tip amount relative to a baseline tip amount.
- the term “average tip amount” may include computed aggregated tip amount derivatives and may be determined via different factors, multipliers, weights, adjustments, smoothing variables, other statistical formula or combination thereof.
- the baseline tip amount may be based on tip amounts to other entities in a geographic area, other entities in a similar category, other baseline tip amounts or a combination thereof.
- the evaluation may include comparing a user's tip amount to the same user's tip amounts paid to entitles having the same entity category and within the same geographic area.
- the evaluation may include comparing the average tip amount for an entity for multiple users to the average tip amount paid to other entities having the same entity category and within the same geographic area. It should be appreciated that a tip percentage may be used instead of a tip amount and obtained and evaluated in the manner described above.
- the evaluation may also include evaluating the frequency of tips relative to a baseline tip frequency.
- the baseline tip frequency may be based on tips to other entities in a geographic area, tip to other entities in a similar category, other tips, or a combination thereof.
- a scoring signal is determined based on the evaluation of the amount of tips, the frequency of tips, or both. For example, if the aggregated payment transactions indicate that users tipped a tip amount that is a threshold percentage higher than a baseline tip amount associated with entities in a similar category, a positive scoring signal may be determined. The value of the positive scoring signal may be proportional to the difference between the average tip amount from the aggregated payment transactions and the baseline tip amount. Similarly, if the aggregated payment transactions indicate that users tipped a tip amount that is a threshold percentage lower than a baseline tip amount associated with entities in a similar category, a negative scoring signal may be determined. The value of the negative scoring signal may be proportional to the difference between the average tip amount from the aggregated payment transactions and the baseline tip amount.
- an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 310 ).
- the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the aggregated payment transactions and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the aggregated payment transactions.
- the increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal providing the basis for the modification of the entity score.
- FIG. 4 depicts a process 400 for determining scoring signals from a location-based service in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- users' presences at an entity are obtained (block 402 ) from a location based service 404 .
- a user presence may be determined by the location based service from a manual indication, such as a check-in or check-out by a user, or an automatic indication based on position data, such as GPS data.
- the users' presences may include presences obtained over a time period, such as 1 day, multiple days, 1 week, multiple weeks, 1 month, multiple month, 1 year, multiple years, or any other duration.
- a ratio of returning users to one-time users is determined to determine a scoring signal based on the users' presences (block 406 ).
- a returning user may include a user having more than one presence at an entity within a time period, e.g., three presences at an entity within one week.
- a one-time user may include a user having only a single presence at an entity within the same duration.
- a scoring is determined based on the ratio. For example, if the ratio is greater than a threshold (e.g., greater than one), a positive scoring signal may be determined.
- the value of the positive scoring signal may be proportional to the ratio of returning users to one-time users. Similarly, if the ratio is less than a threshold (e.g., less than one), then a negative scoring signal is determined. The value of the negative scoring signal may be proportional to the ratio of returning users to one-time users.
- a threshold e.g., less than one
- an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 408 ).
- the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the users' presences and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the users' presences.
- the increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal that provided the basis for the modification of the entity score.
- a scoring signal is determined from user choices, e.g., a user selecting an entity over other alternative entities within a geographic area.
- FIG. 5 depicts a process 500 for determining a scoring signal from choice user behaviors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- user presences at an entity are obtained (block 502 ), such as from a location-based service 504 .
- the user presences may indicate one or more user presences at an entity over a time period.
- alternative entities within a geographic area are obtained (block 506 ) such as from a geographic map service 508 .
- the alternative entities may be determined based on parameters similar to the selected entity.
- the alternative entities may be determined based on an entity category, price range, dress code, or other parameters. If alternative entities within a geographic area do not exist (line 510 ), then the user behavior data is ignored and no scoring signal is determined (block 512 ). In this example, the user's presence at the selected entity does not indicate a preference over other alternative entities in a geographic area, as alternative entities do not exist.
- the user presences at the selected entity based on a comparison to the alternative entities may be evaluated to determine a scoring signal (block 516 ). For example, if a user has multiple presences at the selected entity within a time period despite the existence of similar areas with the geographic area, a positive scoring signal is determined.
- the value of positive scoring signal may be proportional to the number of multiple presences at the selected entity, the number of alternative entities, the distance between the user's default location and the selected entity, the distance between the user's default location and the alternative entities, or any combination thereof.
- an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 518 ).
- the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the user presences and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the user presences.
- the increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal providing the basis for the modification of the entity score.
- the scoring signal may include evaluation of user presences for multiple presences, such that multiple users choosing a selected entity over alternative entities within a geographic area may result in a higher value of a positive scoring signal.
- a negative scoring signal may be determined for alternative entities if the selected entity is less accessible to the user (less accessible to the user). For example, if a user has multiple presences at the selected entity and the selected entity is a threshold distance further away from the user's location than alternative entities in a geographic area, a negative scoring signal for the alternative entities may be determined.

The drawings may not be to scale. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but to the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
- As discussed in more detail below, provided in some embodiments are systems, methods, and computer-readable media for determining an entity score based on user behaviors associated with an entity. User behaviors are determined from user interactions with various services, such as a payment-based service, location-based service, and other services. The user behaviors include payment behaviors (e.g., tipping behaviors), location behaviors (e.g., repeat presences at an entity), and choice behaviors (e.g., selecting an entity over other entities in a geographic area).
- A user interacts with payment-based services, location-based services, and other services using a client computer. The user behaviors are determined from data obtained from the payment-based services, location-based services, and other services. For example, an average tip amount and tipping frequency is determined from payment transactions to an entity obtained from the payment-based services. Based on an evaluation of the average tip amount, tipping frequency, or both, a positive scoring signal or negative scoring signal is determined. The scoring signal is used to modify, e.g., increase or decrease, an entity score associated with an entity. In another example, users' presences at an entity are obtained from a location-based service, and the ratio of returning users to one-time users is determined. Based on the ratio, a positive scoring signal or negative scoring signal is determined and used to modify, e.g., increase or decrease, an entity score associated with an entity. In yet another example, user presences at an entity over a time period are determined and alternative entities in a geographic area are determined. The user presences at the selected entity are evaluated based on a comparison to the alternative entities. Based on the user's selection of the selected entity over alternative entities, a positive scoring signal is determined and used to modify, e.g., increase, an entity score associated with an entity.
-
FIG. 1 depicts asystem 100 illustrating the obtaining of user behaviors that are used for scoring entities in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , various user interactions 102 related to anentity 114 may occur. As used herein, the term “entity” refers to a private or public entity that is capable of providing for the some or all of user interactions described herein. An entity may or may not have a physical location. In some embodiments, for example, an entity includes a business (e.g., a restaurant, bar, retail store), a public facility (e.g., a library, a museum, a park), and other similar entities. - The user interactions 102 may indicate various user behaviors that can be used as signals in scoring an entity affected by the user interactions 102. The user interactions 102 may include, for example, payment transactions to an entity, the presence of a user at an entity (as determined from the user's location), the selection of an entity from other entities, and other user action. As shown in
FIG. 1 ,payment behaviors 104 are collected from user interactions. Thepayment behaviors 104 may include whether a user added a tip to a payment to an entity, the amount of the tip, the frequency of tipping to an entity, and other payment behaviors. Additionally, location basedbehaviors 106 may be collected from user interactions 102. The location-basedbehaviors 106 may include whether users repeatedly returned to an entity, whether users only visited an entity once and never returned, and other location-based behaviors. Choice-basedbehaviors 108 may also be collected from the user interactions 102. The choice based behaviors may include whether users selected an entity from other entities within specific geographic distance in a similar category, and other choices that indicate a preference for an entity. - As shown in
FIG. 1 , thepayment behaviors 104, the location-basedbehaviors 106, and the choice-basedbehaviors 108 are used to affect ascore 116 associated with theentity 114. In some embodiments, for example, thebehaviors qualitative scoring signals 118 to increase or decrease ascore 116 associated with theentity 114. Thescore 116 associated with anentity 114 may be previously determined based on explicit feedback for the entity provided by users, such as explicit ratings and reviews, or may be a baseline score, such as zero. As will be appreciated, such explicit ratings and reviews are obtained from websites and applications that receive and aggregate user ratings and reviews for entities. Thedetermined score 116 and the associatedentity 114 are stored in anentity database 120. Theentity database 120 may include entity identifiers and the associated entity scores for each entity. Theentity database 120 may then be used to provide the score for an entity to other systems, such as search engines that provide information about an entity. For example, theentity 114 may be ranked with other entities based on theentity score 116, and the ranked entities may be provided to a client computer in response to a search query. -
FIG. 2 depicts asystem 200 illustrating the collection of user behaviors and the determination of a scoring signal based on such user behaviors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Thesystem 200 includes aclient computer 202 associated with auser 204 and auser behavior server 206. Theclient computer 202 anduser behavior server 206 are in communication with anetwork 208. Theclient computer 202 may include laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, etc., and may include a receiver for a satellite-based positioning system, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. In some embodiments, theclient computer 202 may include a desktop computer. A user may use theclient computer 202 to retrieve information, view interactive maps, and perform computer-implemented searches, such as by searching the World Wide Web using a web-based search engine or by searching an interactive map of a geographic area. - The
user behavior server 206 may be a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Theuser behavior server 206 may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Additionally, theuser behavior server 206 may be, for example, computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 208 for communication or may communicate over other networks. - The
client computer 202 anduser behavior server 206 are in communication with thenetwork 208, such as through a wired or wireless network interface. In some embodiments, thenetwork 208 may include multiple networks, and may include any suitable network and networking technology, such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any other suitable network. Additionally, thenetwork 208 may include a wired network, a wireless network, or both. Moreover, it should be appreciated that theclient computer 202 anduser behavior server 206 may communicate over different networks separately and simultaneously. For example, theclient computer 202 may communicate over both a wireless Ethernet network and a cellular network. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , various services accessed by the client computer may communicate over thenetwork 208 in the manner described above and may provide for the collection of user behaviors. In some embodiments, apayment service 210 is accessed by theclient computer 202 and used to make payment transactions to entities. Thepayment service 210 may include online payment services, mobile payment services, and other payment services. In some embodiments, the mobile payment services may include near field communication (NFC) based services to enable a user to use theclient computer 202 to make a payment at an entity having an NFC enabled terminal. Thepayment service 210 provides for the collection of payment behaviors, such as whether theuser 204 tipped, the amount of tips, the frequency of tips, and so on. - In some embodiments, a location-based
service 212 is accessed by theclient computer 202. The location-basedservice 212 enables theuser 204 to indicate his or her present location, either manually (e.g., via manual check-ins and check-outs at entity), automatically (e.g., via position data), or both. In some embodiments, the position data includes GPS data, A-GPS data, Wi-Fi based location data, or other position data. Theuser 204 may decide whether to make his or her location available via the location-basedservice 212. The location-basedservice 212 provides for the collection of location-based behaviors, such as whether users frequently return to an entity or do not return to an entity. - Additionally,
other services 214 are accessed by theclient computer 202 and provide for the collection of other user behaviors. For example, theother services 214 may include geographic-map based services that enable theuser 204 to search for entities in a geographic area. Based on such searches and the selection of an entity from other entities in the geographic area, choice-based behaviors are provided. - The
user behavior 206 obtains theuser behavior data 216 from thevarious services user behavior data 216 is processed by auser behavior process 218 to determine scoring signals 220. As described above, for example, the scoring signals 200 modify an entity score associated with an entity. For example, the user behaviors may indicate that theuser 204 generated negative behaviors towards an entity, such as by leaving a low tip amount or no tip. The scoring signals 200 associated with such a behavior may be negative and may result in a decrease of the entity score. In contrast, the user behaviors may indicate that theuser 204 generated positive behaviors towards an entity, such as by leaving a large tip amount or frequent tips. The scoring signals 220 associated with such a behavior may be positive and may result in an increase of the entity score associated with the entity. In some embodiments, the scoring signals discussed herein may be segmented by aggregated demographics for groups of users. In such embodiments, scoring signals from users having similar demographics may be assigned a higher weight than other scoring signals when using the scoring signal in entity scoring for the similar users. - In embodiments in which the systems discussed herein collect information about users, or may make use of such information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., user payment transactions, user locations, user preferences, or other user information). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is obtained about the user and used by the processes described herein.

FIGS. 3 , 4, and 5 depict processes for determining scoring signals from different user behaviors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3 depicts aprocess 300 for determining scoring signals from a payment service in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, aggregated payment transactions to an entity are obtained (block 302) from apayment service 304. As described above, in some embodiments thepayment service 304 may include a mobile payment service accessed by theclient computer 202, such as NFC-based mobile payment service. The payment transactions may include, for example, payment amounts for goods or services obtained from an entity, and tip amounts associated with the payment. - Next, the amount of the tips, the frequency of tips, or both are determined from the payment transactions (block 306). For example, the frequency of tips may be determined relative to payment transactions for a single user (e.g., whether a single user frequency tipped on payment transactions to an entity) or payment transactions for multiple users (e.g., whether multiple users tipped on payment transactions to an entity). The amount of tips, the frequency of tips, or both are evaluated to determine a scoring signal based on the evaluation (block 308). The evaluation may include evaluating an average tip amount relative to a baseline tip amount. As used herein, the term “average tip amount” may include computed aggregated tip amount derivatives and may be determined via different factors, multipliers, weights, adjustments, smoothing variables, other statistical formula or combination thereof. The baseline tip amount may be based on tip amounts to other entities in a geographic area, other entities in a similar category, other baseline tip amounts or a combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments the evaluation may include comparing a user's tip amount to the same user's tip amounts paid to entitles having the same entity category and within the same geographic area. In some embodiments, the evaluation may include comparing the average tip amount for an entity for multiple users to the average tip amount paid to other entities having the same entity category and within the same geographic area. It should be appreciated that a tip percentage may be used instead of a tip amount and obtained and evaluated in the manner described above. The evaluation may also include evaluating the frequency of tips relative to a baseline tip frequency. Here again, the baseline tip frequency may be based on tips to other entities in a geographic area, tip to other entities in a similar category, other tips, or a combination thereof.
- A scoring signal is determined based on the evaluation of the amount of tips, the frequency of tips, or both. For example, if the aggregated payment transactions indicate that users tipped a tip amount that is a threshold percentage higher than a baseline tip amount associated with entities in a similar category, a positive scoring signal may be determined. The value of the positive scoring signal may be proportional to the difference between the average tip amount from the aggregated payment transactions and the baseline tip amount. Similarly, if the aggregated payment transactions indicate that users tipped a tip amount that is a threshold percentage lower than a baseline tip amount associated with entities in a similar category, a negative scoring signal may be determined. The value of the negative scoring signal may be proportional to the difference between the average tip amount from the aggregated payment transactions and the baseline tip amount.
- After determining a scoring signal based on the aggregated payment transactions, an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 310). For example, the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the aggregated payment transactions and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the aggregated payment transactions. The increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal providing the basis for the modification of the entity score.
-
FIG. 4 depicts aprocess 400 for determining scoring signals from a location-based service in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, users' presences at an entity are obtained (block 402) from a location basedservice 404. As described above, a user presence may be determined by the location based service from a manual indication, such as a check-in or check-out by a user, or an automatic indication based on position data, such as GPS data. The users' presences may include presences obtained over a time period, such as 1 day, multiple days, 1 week, multiple weeks, 1 month, multiple month, 1 year, multiple years, or any other duration. - After determining users' presences, a ratio of returning users to one-time users (i.e., repeat presences to single presences) is determined to determine a scoring signal based on the users' presences (block 406). In some embodiments, a returning user may include a user having more than one presence at an entity within a time period, e.g., three presences at an entity within one week. Thus, in some embodiments, a one-time user may include a user having only a single presence at an entity within the same duration. A scoring is determined based on the ratio. For example, if the ratio is greater than a threshold (e.g., greater than one), a positive scoring signal may be determined. The value of the positive scoring signal may be proportional to the ratio of returning users to one-time users. Similarly, if the ratio is less than a threshold (e.g., less than one), then a negative scoring signal is determined. The value of the negative scoring signal may be proportional to the ratio of returning users to one-time users.
- After determining a scoring signal based on the users' presences, an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 408). For example, the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the users' presences and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the users' presences. As noted above, the increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal that provided the basis for the modification of the entity score.
- As also mentioned above, in some embodiments a scoring signal is determined from user choices, e.g., a user selecting an entity over other alternative entities within a geographic area.
FIG. 5 depicts aprocess 500 for determining a scoring signal from choice user behaviors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, user presences at an entity are obtained (block 502), such as from a location-based service 504. The user presences may indicate one or more user presences at an entity over a time period. Next, alternative entities within a geographic area are obtained (block 506) such as from ageographic map service 508. The alternative entities may be determined based on parameters similar to the selected entity. For example, the alternative entities may be determined based on an entity category, price range, dress code, or other parameters. If alternative entities within a geographic area do not exist (line 510), then the user behavior data is ignored and no scoring signal is determined (block 512). In this example, the user's presence at the selected entity does not indicate a preference over other alternative entities in a geographic area, as alternative entities do not exist. - If the alternative entities to the selected entity exist within a geographic area (line 514), then the user presences at the selected entity based on a comparison to the alternative entities may be evaluated to determine a scoring signal (block 516). For example, if a user has multiple presences at the selected entity within a time period despite the existence of similar areas with the geographic area, a positive scoring signal is determined. The value of positive scoring signal may be proportional to the number of multiple presences at the selected entity, the number of alternative entities, the distance between the user's default location and the selected entity, the distance between the user's default location and the alternative entities, or any combination thereof.
- After determining a scoring signal based on the aggregated payment transactions, an entity score associated with the entity is modified (block 518). For example, the entity score may be increased if a positive scoring signal is determined from the user presences and may be decreased if a negative scoring signal is determined from the user presences. The increase or decrease of the entity score may be proportional to the value of the scoring signal providing the basis for the modification of the entity score. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the scoring signal may include evaluation of user presences for multiple presences, such that multiple users choosing a selected entity over alternative entities within a geographic area may result in a higher value of a positive scoring signal.
- In some embodiments, a negative scoring signal may be determined for alternative entities if the selected entity is less accessible to the user (less accessible to the user). For example, if a user has multiple presences at the selected entity and the selected entity is a threshold distance further away from the user's location than alternative entities in a geographic area, a negative scoring signal for the alternative entities may be determined.
