Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to ranking of search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify documents or other items that are relevant to a user's needs and to present the documents or items in a manner that is most useful to the user. Such activity often involves a fair amount of mind-reading—inferring from various clues what the user wants. Certain clues may be user specific. For example, knowledge that a user is making a request from a mobile device, and knowledge of the location of the device, can result in much better search results for such a user.
- Clues about a user's needs may also be more general. For example, search results can have an elevated importance, or inferred relevance, if a number of other search results link to them. If the linking results are themselves highly relevant, then the linked-to results may have a particularly high relevance.
- Such an approach to determining relevance is premised on the assumption that, if authors of web pages felt that another web site was relevant enough to be linked to, then web searchers would also find the site to be particularly relevant. In short, the web authors “vote up” the relevance of the sites.
- particular inputs may be generated or analyzed to affect the presentation of search results.
- such inputs may increase the relevance that a system will assign to a particular result in a particular situation, thus boosting the score or other indicator of relevance for the result (and perhaps the relevance of the result in the context of a particular query).
- Such an approach may benefit a user by providing them with search results that are more likely to match their needs.
- users can learn more using the internet, can find more relevant information more quickly, and will thus achieve more in their work or elsewhere, and will be more likely to use such a system again.
- a provider of such services may also benefit, by providing more useful services to users, and by thereby inducing more traffic to their search services.
- Such additional traffic may provide an operator with additional revenue, such as in the form of advertising that accompanies the searching and the delivery of search results.
- the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented method that includes receiving multiple features, including a first feature indicative of presentation bias that affects document result selection for search results presented in a user interface of a document search service; obtaining, based on the multiple features, information regarding document result selections for searches performed using the document search service, the information spanning multiple different queries; generating a prior model using the information spanning the multiple different queries, the prior model representing a query-independent probability of document result selection given values of the multiple features; and outputting the prior model to a ranking engine for ranking of search results to reduce influence of the presentation bias.

- the obtaining can include identifying, based on frequency of document result selection, a reduced set of document result selection records from one or more logs of user selections for the document search service; and collecting the information regarding document result selections from the reduced set of document result selection records.
- the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented method that includes obtaining, in accordance with a first implicit user feedback model, a first signal for a document result of a search query for which the document result is returned, wherein the first signal corresponds to an aspect of document relevance; obtaining, in accordance with a second implicit user feedback model, a second signal for the document result, wherein the second signal corresponds to an aspect of search result presentation; combining the first signal and the second signal to form a relevance signal for the document result; and outputting the relevance signal to a ranking engine for ranking of search results including the document result.
- the obtaining the first signal can include obtaining, in accordance with the first implicit user feedback model, a measure of relevance for the document result within a context of the search query for which the document result is returned; and the obtaining the second signal can include obtaining, in accordance with the second implicit user feedback model, a measure of presentation bias for the document result independent of the context of the search query for which the document result is returned.
- the operations can further include identifying an additional document result of the search query that is not included in the first implicit user feedback model; obtaining, in accordance with a third implicit user feedback model, an additional signal for the additional document result, wherein the additional signal corresponds to an aspect of document relevance independent of the context of the search query; and outputting the additional signal to the ranking engine for ranking of the search results including the additional document result.
- the obtaining the first signal can include obtaining, in accordance with the first implicit user feedback model, a measure of relevance for the document result independent of a context of the search query for which the document result is returned; and the obtaining the second signal can include obtaining, in accordance with the second implicit user feedback model, a measure of presentation bias for the document result independent of the context of the search query for which the document result is returned.

- User selections of search results click data
- a prior model can be designed to assist in separating the effects of result quality and presentation bias on user selections, and the prior model can be used to normalize the output of a separate implicit user feedback model in view of the effects of presentation bias.
- a prior model can be used to estimate what the implicit feedback should be for results that are too infrequent, or too recent to have sufficient historical records of implicit feedback applicable to them.

- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 shows an example system 1000 for improving the relevance of results obtained from submitting search queries as can be implemented in an internet, intranet, or other client/server environment.
- the system 1000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 1000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a user 1002 can interact with the system 1000 through a client device 1004 ( 1004 a , 1004 b , 1004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 1004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 1004 can include a random access memory (RAM) 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 1008 .
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions within the system 1000 .
- the processor 1008 is a single-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 is a multi-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 can include multiple processing cores and is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 1004 ) to display graphical information for a user interface.
- a user 1002 a can connect to a search engine 1030 within a server system 1014 to submit a query 1015 .
- a client-side query signal 1010 a is sent into a network 1012 and is forwarded to the server system 1014 as a server-side query signal 1010 b .
- Server system 1014 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- a server device 1014 includes a memory device 1016 , which can include the search engine 1030 loaded therein.
- a processor 1018 is structured to process instructions within the system 1014 . These instructions can implement one or more components of the search engine 1030 .
- the processor 1018 can be a single-threaded processor or a multi-threaded processor, and can include multiple processing cores.
- the processor 1018 can process instructions stored in the memory 1016 related to the search engine 1030 and can send information to the client device 1004 , through the network 1012 , to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 1004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the user query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 can include an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the user query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- the search engine 1030 can include a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the user query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms)
- it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants.
- the technique is exemplified in the GOGGLE® PageRank system, which treats a link from one web page to another as an indication of quality for the latter page, so that the page with the most such quality indicators is rated higher than others.
- Appropriate techniques can also be used to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- the ranking engine 1052 can receive an additional signal from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 provides one or more prior models, or one or more measures of relevance for the documents based on one or more prior models, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 1002 .
- a prior model represents a background probability of document result selection given the values of multiple selected features, as described further below.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations described below to generate the one or more prior models, or the one or more measures of relevance based on one or more prior models.
- the search engine 1030 can forward the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 1028 a through the network 1012 .
- a client-side search results signal 1028 b can be received by the client device 1004 a where the results can be stored within the RAM 1006 and/or used by the processor 1008 to display the results on an output device for the user 1002 a.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components can include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , and a rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the indexing engine 2010 can function as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 can generate scores for document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features can include aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features can include aspects of document cross-referencing, such as the PageRank of the document or the domain.
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned, to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score, using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- the ranking engine 2030 can produce a ranking of document results 2040 for display to a user based on IR scores received from the scoring engine 2020 and one or more signals from the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- a tracking component 2050 can be used to record information regarding individual user selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies user selections (clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 can be a proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- the client e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the user.
- the recorded information can be stored in result selection log(s) 2060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each user selection, the query (Q), the document (D), the time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- Other information can also be recorded regarding user interactions with a presented ranking, including negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user, but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the user interface, IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before the clicked result, the titles and snippets shown to the user before the clicked result, the user's cookie, cookie age, IP (Internet Protocol) address, user agent of the browser, etc.
- Sill further information can be recorded, such as described below during discussion of the various features that can be used to build a prior model.
- similar information e.g., IR scores, position, etc.
- the information stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 can be used by the rank modifier engine 2070 in generating the one or more signals to the ranking engine 2030 .
- a wide range of information can be collected and used to modify or tune the click signal from the user to make the signal, and the future search results provided, a better fit for the user's needs.
- user interactions with the rankings presented to the users of the information retrieval system can be used to improve future rankings.
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the rank modifier engine 2070 and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system.
- a server system 3050 includes an indexing engine 3060 and a scoring/ranking engine 3070 .
- a client system 3000 includes a user interface for presenting a ranking 3010 , a tracking component 3020 , result selection log(s) 3030 and a ranking/rank modifier engine 3040 .
- the client system 3000 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine 3040 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 3070 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in can then re-rank the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific user base.
- FIG. 4A shows an example user interface 4000 of a document search service, such as described above, for presenting a ranking.
- Individual selections of document results 4010 can be tracked within the context of a search query for which the document results 4010 are returned.
- user's click data on web page search results 4010 can be gathered and stored in log(s), which can be kept for all user queries.
- the click can be tracked via JavaScript code embedded in the search results page, an embedded browser tag, etc. This code can track when and on what a user clicks in the main search results page, and can track when the user returns to that main page.
- Post-click behavior can also be tracked via pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- the toolbar software can track all the pages that the user visits, both before and after the search results page is delivered.
- the information gathered for each click can include: (1) the query (Q) the user entered, (2) the document result (D) the user clicked on, (3) the time (T) on the document, (4) the interface language (L) (which can be given by the user), (5) the country (C) of the user (which can be identified by the host that they use, such as www-google-co-uk to indicate the United Kingdom), and (6) additional aspects of the user and session.
- the time (T) can be measured as the time between the initial click through to the document result until the time the user comes back to the main page and clicks on another document result.
- an assessment can be made about the time (T) regarding whether this time indicates a longer view of the document result or a shorter view of the document result, since longer views are generally indicative of quality for the clicked through result.
- This assessment about the time (T) can further be made in conjunction with various weighting techniques.
- Document views resulting from the selections can be weighted based on viewing length information to produce weighted views of the document result.
- a wider range of click through viewing times can be included in the assessment of result quality, where longer viewing times in the range are given more weight than shorter viewing times.
- This weighting can be either continuous or discontinuous.
- a continuous function can be applied to the document views resulting from the selections.
- the weight given to a particular click through time can fall within a continuous range of values, as defined by the specified function.
- a discontinuous function can be applied to the document views resulting from the selections. For example, there can be three viewing time categories, each having a corresponding weight. Note that such functions can be explicitly defined, or merely implicit in the software implementation.
- the individual selections of the document result can be classified into viewing time categories, and weights can be assigned to the individual selections based on results of the classifying. For example, a short click can be considered indicative of a poor page and thus given a low weight (e.g., ⁇ 0.1 per click), a medium click can be considered indicative of a potentially good page and thus given a slightly higher weight (e.g., 0.5 per click), a long click can be considered indicative of a good page and thus given a much higher weight (e.g., 1.0 per click), and a last click (where the user doesn't return to the main page) can be considered as likely indicative of a good page and thus given a fairly high weight (e.g., 0.9).
- the click weighting can also be adjusted based on previous click information. For example, if another click preceded the last click, the last click can be considered as less indicative of a good page and given only a moderate weight (e.g., 0.3 per click).
- the various time frames used to classify short, medium and long clicks, and the weights to apply can be determined for a given search engine by comparing historical data from user selection logs with human generated explicit feedback on the quality of search results for various given queries, and the weighting process can be tuned accordingly. Furthermore, these time frames and weights can be adjusted based on one or more viewing length differentiators, as is described further below.
- the weighted views of the document result can be combined to determine a number to be used in determining a measure of relevance. For example, the weighted clicks described above can be summed together for a given query-document pair. Note that safeguards against spammers (users who generate fraudulent clicks in an attempt to boost certain search results) can be taken to help ensure that the user selection data is meaningful, even when very little data is available for a given (rare) query. These safeguards can include employing a user model that describes how a user should behave over time, and if a user doesn't conform to this model, their click data can be disregarded.
- the safeguards can be designed to accomplish two main objectives: (1) ensure democracy in the votes (e.g., one single vote per cookie and/or IP for a given query-URL (Universal Resource Locator) pair), and (2) entirely remove the information coming from cookies or IP addresses that do not look natural in their browsing behavior (e.g., abnormal distribution of click positions, click durations, clicks_per_minute/hour/day, etc.). Suspicious clicks can be removed, and the click signals for queries that appear to be spammed need not be used (e.g., queries for which the clicks feature a distribution of user agents, cookie ages, etc. that do not look normal).
- a measure of relevance for the document result can be determined within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned. This measure of relevance can be calculated as a fraction, which can be directly applied to IR scores of the search results, thereby boosting the documents in the resulting ranking that have implicit user feedback indicating document quality.
- smoothing factors S0, S1 and S2 can be used, or one or more of these can be the same smoothing factor.
- the smoothing factors used can be determined based on how much traffic is received within the context of the click fraction. For example, for a given country-language tuple, the smoothing factor can be raised concordant with the amount of traffic received (e.g., a larger smoothing factor can be used for US-English queries if a good deal more of such queries are received). In addition, the smoothing factor can be increased for query sources that have historically generated more spamming activity (e.g., queries from Russia).
- one or more viewing length differentiators can be identified for use in the weighting.
- a viewing length differentiator can include a factor governed by a determined category of the search query, a factor governed by a determined type of a user generating the individual selections, or a combination of them.
- the document views can be weighted based on the viewing length information in conjunction with the viewing length differentiator(s), such as the determined category of the search query and the determined type of the user.
- the threshold(s) (or formula) for what constitutes a good click can be evaluated on query and user specific bases.
- the query categories can include “navigational” and “informational”, where a navigational query is one for which a specific target page or site is likely desired (e.g., a query such as “BMW”), and an informational query is one for which many possible pages are equally useful (e.g., a query such as “George Washington's Birthday”).
- a navigational query is one for which a specific target page or site is likely desired (e.g., a query such as “BMW”)
- an informational query is one for which many possible pages are equally useful (e.g., a query such as “George Washington's Birthday”).
- Such categories may also be broken down into sub-categories as well, such as informational-quick and informational-slow: a person may only need a small amount of time on a page to gather the information they seek when the query is “George Washington's Birthday”, but that same user may need a good deal more time to assess a result when the query is “Hilbert transform tutorial”.
- the query categories can be identified by analyzing the IR scores or the historical implicit feedback provided by the click fractions. For example, significant skew in either of these (meaning only one or a few documents are highly favored over others) can indicate a query is navigational. In contrast, more dispersed click patterns for a query can indicate the query is informational. In general, a certain category of query can be identified (e.g., navigational), a set of such queries can be located and pulled from the historical click data, and a regression analysis can be performed to identify one or more features that are indicative of that query type (e.g., mean staytime for navigational queries versus other query categories; the term “staytime” refers to time spent viewing a document result, also known as document dwell time).
- a certain category of query can be identified (e.g., navigational)
- a set of such queries can be located and pulled from the historical click data
- a regression analysis can be performed to identify one or more features that are indicative of that query type (e.g., mean staytime for
- Traditional clustering techniques can also be used to identify the query categories. This can involve using generalized clustering algorithms to analyze historic queries based on features such as the broad nature of the query (e.g., informational or navigational), length of the query, and mean document staytime for the query. These types of features can be measured for historical queries, and the threshold(s) can be adjusted accordingly. For example, K means clustering can be performed on the average duration times for the observed queries, and the threshold(s) can be adjusted based on the resulting clusters.
- User types can also be determined by analyzing click patterns. For example, computer savvy users often click faster than less experienced users, and thus users can be assigned different weighting functions based on their click behavior. These different weighting functions can even be fully user specific (a user group with one member). For example, the average click duration and/or click frequency for each individual user can be determined, and the threshold(s) for each individual user can be adjusted accordingly. Users can also be clustered into groups (e.g., using a K means clustering algorithm) based on various click behavior patterns.
- the weighting can be adjusted based on the determined type of the user both in terms of how click duration is translated into good clicks versus not-so-good clicks, and in terms of how much weight to give to the good clicks from a particular user group versus another user group.
- Some user's implicit feedback may be more valuable than other users due to the details of a user's review process. For example, a user that almost always clicks on the highest ranked result can have his good clicks assigned lower weights than a user who more often clicks results lower in the ranking first (since the second user is likely more discriminating in his assessment of what constitutes a good result).
- a user can be classified based on his or her query stream.
- presentation (or display) bias can unduly influence the effectiveness of implicit user feedback.
- Presentation bias includes various aspects of presentation, such as an attractive title or snippet provided with the document result, and where the document result appears in the presented ranking (position). Note that users tend to click results with good snippets, or that are higher in the ranking, regardless of the real relevance of the document to the query as compared with the other results.
- the presented rank (the position) of the document results 4010 is highly correlated with click rate in the sense that the top result will receive many more clicks than the last result, even if their positions are swapped.
- the user interface 4000 presents the search results for the query using multiple pages, and an interface element 4020 allows the user to view additional pages of search results as desired.
- many of the document results for a typical search may never be viewed at all by the user.
- the presentation of the results in the page can have a big impact on the observed click rates, and various aspects of presentation are often independent of the quality of a given result.
- the bolding 4030 of the results (both in the title and the snippet), length of titles 4040 , indenting 4050 , presence of ads 4060 (or similar objects that appear above the first result for a given query) can affect the observed click rates.
- the effects of presentation bias should be factored out.
- the presented rank (the position) of a document result is really a mixed feature since clicks based on position are influenced by both the presentation bias aspect and the result quality aspect, and thus in some implementations, position can be treated as a quality feature (limiting the bias features to those features that are unconnected with result quality, e.g., bolding, length of title, length of snippet, presence of ads, etc.).
- FIG. 4B shows an example process of building a prior model for use in factoring out presentation bias and enhancing the quality of signals from document result selections.
- Multiple features can be received 4110 , including a first feature indicative of presentation bias that affects document result selection for search results presented in a user interface of a document search service.
- the first feature can be the position of the document result in the user interface within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned, and a second feature can be the language (L) of the search query.
- the set of features used can include features that are correlated with click rate and that are independent of the query (Q) and the search result (D).
- the specific query (Q) or the general type of query can be used as a feature in the prior model.
- the selection of features, which are predictive of click through can be guided by standard information gain feature selection techniques.
- information regarding document result selections for searches performed using the document search service can be obtained 4120 , where the information spans multiple different queries.
- This information can be used to generate 4130 a prior model, where the prior model represents a probability of document result selection (e.g., a query-independent probability of selection) given values of the multiple features.
- FIG. 4C shows example features and an example process of building a prior model.
- One or more user selection log(s) 4300 include click through data, such as described above. These user selection log(s) 4300 can be understood conceptually as a set of queries, including a first query 4310 through query N, where many user searches, and document result selections, have been observed within the context of each query.
- a query 4310 includes a document result 4320 that was selected by a user, and the document result 4320 can have an associated relevance feature 4322 (e.g., the IR score of the document) and an associated display bias feature 4324 (e.g., the position of the document).
- another document result 4330 which was returned along with first document result 4320 within the context of the query 4310 , has its own associated relevance feature and display bias feature.
- These features of the document result 4330 , presented along with the document result 4320 can be considered features of the document result 4320 .
- the IR score of the document result 4330 can be saved as a feature of the document result 4320 , which was selected, in a single log entry including the IR score of the result 4320 , the position of result 4320 , and the IR score of the result 4330 returned along with result 4320 . Note that being “returned along with” does not indicate the two documents were necessarily displayed in the same page of the user interface, but only that the two documents were included in the search results for the given query.
- user selections can be collected 4350 from the user selection log(s) 4300 across queries (e.g., independent of query) for multiple combinations of values of the selected features, where those features can include a feature related to another document returned along with a selected document within the context of a query.
- This collecting can involve accumulating counts observed in the log(s) 4300 , including separately accumulating short, medium and long clicks, as well as the event of a result being shown, but another result being clicked.
- a query-independent selection probability can be determined 4360 given the selected features. For example, in the case of the features being position and language, the number of long, short and medium clicks at position 1 on an English language search site can be extracted from the log(s) 4300 , as well as the number of times other results have been clicked while a result at position 1 on the English language search site has been shown. These numbers can be found for every combination of position and language to determine the query-independent selection probability. In general, a mapping can be computed (based on the log(s) 4300 ) between the selected feature values and a predicted click through rate to produce a prior model for the selected features.
- the features can be split into two groups.
- the first group can include a reduced set of more important features, and the second group can contain the rest (i.e., two disjoint groups forming the full set of features).
- the first group can be used for accumulating click counts based on all possible combinations of feature values in the first group.
- the prior model can be trained on the values of the second group of features.
- the prior model can be a standard linear or logistic regression, or other model types.
- the prior model can essentially represent the statistics of historical click data, indicating what percentage of people clicked on a result given presentation of the result and the set of features.
- splitting the features into two groups can allow the use of a larger number of parameters in the model (for every combination of feature values in group one), but not so many parameters that the model cannot be trained.
- the prior model can be output 4140 to a ranking engine for ranking of search results to reduce influence of the presentation bias.
- the prior model can be saved to a computer-readable medium for use by the ranking engine, or otherwise made available to the ranking engine.
- the features of the prior model can be evaluated, the combination of feature values for a given result can be looked up in the prior model to find a click through rate predicted by the prior model, and this predicted click through rate can be compared with the click through rate given by a separate implicit user feedback model (e.g., the traditional click fraction described above) to reduce the influence of the presentation bias represented by the prior model.
- a separate implicit user feedback model e.g., the traditional click fraction described above
- the ranking score of a search result can be multiplied by a number smaller than one if the traditional click fraction is smaller than the click fraction predicted by the prior model, or by a number greater than one otherwise.
- the prior model can be used to clean the signal of an implicit user feedback model that gives a measure of relevance for a document result within the context of the search query for which the document result is returned, thereby reducing the affects of presentation bias.
- various uses can be made of, or transforms applied to the output signal of the prior model before application to search result ranking for a new search.
- Boost max(min(1+ Z,m 0), m 1), where
- p is the predicted click fraction
- a is the actual click fraction
- m0, m1, k and C are tuned parameters.
- the manner in which the output signal of the prior model is used can be adjusted based on the specific implementation and historical data combined with human generated relevance ratings (e.g., employed in a tuning process to select an appropriate boosting transform for a given implementation).
- the prior model can be used to modify and improve the ranking of search results generated for a given query, and the modified ranking can be presented to a user (e.g., on a display device in a web browser user interface).
- FIG. 4D shows another example process of building a prior model.
- the prior model is composed of two prior models whose signals are combined to form a display bias signal that is largely uncorrelated with the quality of the document result.
- a first set of features and a second set of features are received 4410 , where the first set of features includes a feature that is indicative of presentation bias for a first document result, and the second set of features includes a feature that is indicative of relevance for a second document result returned along with the first document result within the context of a search query.
- the second set of features can include position, IR score, IR score of the top result, IR score of the previous result(s), IR score of the next result(s), country, language, and number of words in the query; and the first set of features can include the above features, plus the number of bold terms in the title of the current result, the number of bold terms in the title of the previous result(s), the number of bold terms in the title of next result(s), the number of bold terms in the snippet of the current result, the number of bold terms in the snippet of the previous result(s), the number of bold terms in the snippet of the next result(s), the length of the title of the current result, the length of the title of the previous result(s), the length of the title of next result(s), the length of the snippet of the current result, the length of the snippet of the previous result(s), the length of the snippet of the next result(s), a Boolean indicator of whether any pornographic terms were shown (e.g.,
- Two prior models can be created 4420 using the two sets of features: a first user selection model based on the first set of features and a second user selection model based on the second set of features, using the techniques described above.
- the second user selection model can be built on features that are highly correlated with the quality of the result, and the first user selection model can be built on those features and presentation bias features. Any difference between these two models then is likely to be due only to presentation bias.
- Both the first and second user selection models can be output 4430 to a ranking engine for ranking of search results.
- the ratio of the click fraction predicted by the second prior model over the click fraction predicted by the first prior model can be computed (based on the observed feature values) for every document result, and the ranking score of each document result can be multiplied by its corresponding ratio, or by a monotonic function of this ratio.
- the basic rationale embodied by this approach is that, if a result is expected to have a higher click rate due to presentation bias, this result's click evidence should be discounted; and if the result is expected to have a lower click rate due to presentation bias, this result's click evidence should be over-counted.
- Position of Position of bold terms Bold terms have different Bold Terms in the title, snippet and impact if they appear at the URL. beginning of the sentence, or at the end.
- Lengths of Number of terms in the Results with longer titles, Title, Snippet title and snippet or snippets and URLs can get and URL length of the URL higher click through rates.
- Quality of The quality e.g., IR Results that have high quality Previous score

- FIG. 4E shows an example process of building a prior model used to predict a measure of implicit user feedback for a result having no previously recorded user selections.
- a reduced set of document result selection records can be identified 4510 based on frequency of document result selection.
- the log(s) 4300 can be randomly split into two halves, and the results that have click evidence in the first half, but do not have any click evidence in the second half, can be extracted.
- the reduced set of document result selection records corresponds to the set of documents that are less frequently selected according to the log(s).
- Information regarding document result selections can be collected 4520 from this reduced set, and a prior model can be built on this information using the techniques described above.
- a prior model can be built on the extracted results and features such as position, country, language and IR score. If a result for a new search does not appear at all in the regular implicit user feedback model (e.g., the traditional click fraction is undefined for the result because the result has not been selected before) this result can be assigned a click fraction as predicted by this additional prior model for ranking purposes.
- FIG. 4F shows an example process of using implicit user feedback models to form a relevance signal for a document result, within the context of a search query, for ranking purposes.
- a first signal can be obtained 4610 , in accordance with a first implicit user feedback model, for a document result of a search query for which the document result is returned, where the first signal corresponds to an aspect of document relevance.
- the first signal can include a measure of relevance for the document result within a context of the search query for which the document result is returned (e.g., the first signal can be the traditional click fraction).
- the first signal can include a measure of relevance for the document result independent of a context of the search query for which the document result is returned (e.g., the first signal can be the output of the second user selection model described above in connection with FIG. 4D ).
- a second signal can be obtained 4620 , in accordance with a second implicit user feedback model, for the document result, where the second signal corresponds to an aspect of search result presentation.
- the second signal can include a measure of presentation bias for the document result independent of the context of the search query for which the document result is returned (e.g., the second signal can be the output of a prior model built using the techniques described above in connection with FIGS. 4A-4C , such as the first user selection model described above in connection with FIG. 4D ).
- the first signal and the second signal can be combined 4630 to form a relevance signal for the document result, the relevance signal being generally independent of presentation.
- the relevance signal can be output 4640 to a ranking engine for ranking of search results including the document result.
- an additional document result of the search query can be identified 4650 that is not included in the first implicit user feedback model (e.g., a document result for which the traditional click fraction is not defined).
- An additional signal can be obtained 4670 , in accordance with a third implicit user feedback model, for the additional document result, where the additional signal corresponds to an aspect of document relevance independent of the context of the search query (e.g., the additional signal can be the output of the prior model described above in connection with FIG. 4E ).
- the additional signal can also be output 4680 to the ranking engine for ranking of the search results including the additional document result.

Abstract
Description
BASE=[#WC(Q,D)]/[#WC(Q)+S0]
where #WC(Q,D) is the sum of weighted clicks for a query-URL pair, #WC(Q) is the sum of weighted clicks for the query (summed over all results for the query), and S0 is a smoothing factor.
LANG=[#WC(Q,D,L)+S1·BASE]/[#WC(Q,L)+S1]
COUNTRY=[#WC(Q,D,L,C)+S2·LANG]/[#WC(Q,L,C)+S2]
where LANG incorporates language specific click data, plus BASE, and COUNTRY incorporates country (and language) specific click data, plus LANG. In this manner, if there is less data for the more specific click fractions, the overall fraction falls back to the next higher level for which more data is available.
Boost=C(a/p),
where p is the predicted click fraction, a is the actual click fraction, and C is a tuned parameter;
Boost=max(min(1+Z,m0),m1), where
