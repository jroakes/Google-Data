Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to signal compression systems and, more particularly, to Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP)-type speech coding systems.
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a CELP encoder 100 of the prior art.
- an input signal s(n) is applied to a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis block 101 , where linear predictive coding is used to estimate a short-term spectral envelope.
- LPC Linear Predictive Coding
- the resulting spectral parameters (or LP parameters) are denoted by the transfer function A(z).
- the spectral parameters are applied to an LPC Quantization block 102 that quantizes the spectral parameters to produce quantized spectral parameters A q that are suitable for use in a multiplexer 108 .
- the quantized spectral parameters A q are then conveyed to multiplexer 108 , and the multiplexer produces a coded bitstream based on the quantized spectral parameters and a set of codebook-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , that are determined by a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 .
- the quantized spectral, or LP, parameters are also conveyed locally to an LPC synthesis filter 105 that has a corresponding transfer function 1/A q (z).
- LPC synthesis filter 105 also receives a combined excitation signal u(n) from a first combiner 110 and produces an estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) based on the quantized spectral parameters A q and the combined excitation signal u(n).
- Combined excitation signal u(n) is produced as follows.
- An adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ is selected from an adaptive codebook (ACB) 103 based on an index parameter ⁇ .
- the adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ is then weighted based on a gain parameter ⁇ and the weighted adaptive codebook code-vector is conveyed to first combiner 110 .
- a fixed codebook code-vector c k is selected from a fixed codebook (FCB) 104 based on an index parameter k.
- the fixed codebook code-vector c k is then weighted based on a gain parameter ⁇ and is also conveyed to first combiner 110 .
- First combiner 110 then produces combined excitation signal u(n) by combining the weighted version of adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ with the weighted version of fixed codebook code-vector c k .
- LPC synthesis filter 105 conveys the input signal estimate ⁇ (n) to a second combiner 112 .
- Second combiner 112 also receives input signal s(n) and subtracts the estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) from the input signal s(n).
- the difference between input signal s(n) and input signal estimate ⁇ (n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 106 , which filter produces a perceptually weighted error signal e(n) based on the difference between ⁇ (n) and s(n) and a weighting function W(z).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 .
- Squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 uses the error signal e(n) to determine an optimal set of codebook-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ that produce the best estimate ⁇ (n) of the input signal s(n).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a decoder 200 of the prior art that corresponds to encoder 100 .
- the coded bitstream produced by encoder 100 is used by a demultiplexer in decoder 200 to decode the optimal set of codebook-related parameters, that is, ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , in a process that is identical to the synthesis process performed by encoder 100 .
- the coded bitstream produced by encoder 100 is received by decoder 200 without errors, the speech ⁇ (n) output by decoder 200 can be reconstructed as an exact duplicate of the input speech estimate ⁇ (n) produced by encoder 100 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary encoder 300 of the prior art that utilizes an equivalent, and yet more practical, system to the encoding system illustrated by encoder 100 .
- the variables are given in terms of their z-transforms.
- E ⁇ ( z ) W ⁇ ( z ) ⁇ S ⁇ ( z ) - W ⁇ ( z ) A q ⁇ ( z ) ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ C ⁇ ⁇ ( z ) + ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ C k ⁇ ( z ) ) . ( 2 )
- W(z)S(z) corresponds to a weighted version of the input signal.
- a formula can be derived for minimization of a weighted version of the perceptually weighted error, that is, ⁇ e ⁇ 2 , by squared error minimization/parameter block 308 .
- the ACB/FCB gains that is, codebook-related parameters ⁇ and ⁇ , may or may not be re-optimized, that is, quantized, given the sequentially selected ACB/FCB code-vectors c ⁇ and c k .
- Equation 8 x w T ⁇ Hc ⁇ c ⁇ T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc ⁇ .
- Equation 11 ⁇ arg ⁇ m ⁇ ⁇ in ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x w T ⁇ x w - ( x w T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ) 2 c ⁇ T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ⁇ , ( 11 )
- ⁇ * is a sequentially determined optimal ACB index parameter, that is, an ACB index parameter that minimizes the bracketed expression. Since x w is not dependent on ⁇ , Equation 11 can be rewritten as follows:
- Equation 13 arg ⁇ max ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( x w T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ) 2 c ⁇ T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ⁇ . ( 12 )
- Equation 10 can be simplified to:
- Equations 13 and 14 represent the two expressions necessary to determine the optimal ACB index ⁇ and ACB gain ⁇ in a sequential manner. These expressions can now be used to determine the sequentially optimal FCB index and gain expressions.
- the vector x w is produced by a first combiner 305 that subtracts a past excitation signal u(n-L), after filtering by a weighted synthesis filter 301 , from an output s w (n) of a perceptual error weighting filter 302 .
- ⁇ Hc ⁇ is a filtered and weighted version of ACB code-vector c ⁇ , that is, ACB code-vector c ⁇ filtered by weighted synthesis filter 303 and then weighted based on ACB gain parameter ⁇ .
- ⁇ Hc k is a filtered and weighted version of FCB code-vector c k , that is, FCB code-vector c k filtered by weighted synthesis filter 304 and then weighted based on FCB gain parameter ⁇ .
- Equation 16 arg ⁇ max ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( x 2 T ⁇ Hc k ) 2 c k T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc k ⁇ , ( 16 ) where k* is a sequentially optimal FCB index parameter, that is, an FCB index parameter that maximizes the bracketed expression.
- FCB gain ⁇ arg ⁇ max ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( d 2 T ⁇ c k ) 2 c k T ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ c k ⁇ , ( 17 ) in which the sequentially optimal FCB gain ⁇ is given as:
- encoder 300 provides a method and apparatus for determining the optimal excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , in a sequential manner.
- the sequential determination of parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ is actually sub-optimal since the optimization equations do not consider the effects that the selection of one codebook code-vector has on the selection of the other codebook code-vector.

- FIG. 5 is a logic flow diagram 500 of the steps executed by encoder 400 in coding a signal in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Logic flow 500 begins ( 502 ) when an input signal s(n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 404 .
- Weighting filter 404 weights ( 504 ) the input signal by a weighting function W(z) to produce a weighted input signal s w (n), which weighted input signal can be represented in vector notation as a vector s w .
- a past excitation signal u(n-L) is applied to a weighted synthesis filter 402 with a corresponding zero input response of H zir (z).
- Weighted input signal s w (n) and a filtered version of past excitation signal u(n-L) produced by weighted synthesis filter 402 are each conveyed to a first combiner 414 .
- First combiner 414 subtracts ( 506 ) the filtered version of past excitation signal u(n-L) from the weighted input signal s w (n) to produce a target input signal x w (n).
- First combiner 414 then conveys target input signal x w (n), or vector x w , to a second combiner 416 .
- An initial first excitation vector c ⁇ is generated ( 508 ) by a vector generator 406 based on an excitation vector-related parameter ⁇ sourced to the vector generator by an error minimization unit 420 .
- vector generator 406 is a virtual codebook such as an adaptive codebook that stores multiple vectors and parameter ⁇ is an index parameter that corresponds to a vector of the multiple vectors stored in the codebook.
- c ⁇ is an adaptive codebook (ACB) code-vector.
- vector generator 406 is a long-term predictor (LTP) filter and parameter ⁇ is an lag corresponding to a selection of a past excitation signal u(n-L).
- the initial first excitation vector c ⁇ is conveyed to a first zero state weighted synthesis filter 408 that has a corresponding transfer function H zs (z), or in matrix notation H.
- the filtered initial first excitation vector y ⁇ (n), or y ⁇ is then weighted ( 512 ) by a first weighter 409 based on an initial first excitation vector-related gain parameter ⁇ and the weighted, filtered initial first excitation vector ⁇ y ⁇ , or ⁇ Hc ⁇ , is conveyed to second combiner 416 .
- Second combiner 416 then conveys intermediate signal x 2 (n), or vector x 2 , to a third combiner 418 .
- Third combiner 418 also receives a weighted, filtered version of an initial second excitation vector c k , preferably a fixed codebook (FCB) code-vector.
- FCB fixed codebook
- the initial second excitation vector c k is generated ( 516 ) by a codebook 410 , preferably a fixed codebook (FCB), based on an initial second excitation vector-related index parameter k, preferably an FCB index parameter.
- the initial second excitation vector c k is conveyed to a second zero state weighted synthesis filter 412 that also has a corresponding transfer function H zs (z), or in matrix notation H.
- the filtered initial second excitation vector y k (n), or y k is then weighted ( 520 ) by a second weighter 413 based on an initial second excitation vector-related gain parameter ⁇ .
- the weighted, filtered initial second excitation vector ⁇ y k , or ⁇ Hc k is then also conveyed to third combiner 418 .
- vector generator 406 is described herein as a virtual codebook or an LTP filter and codebook 410 is described herein as a fixed codebook, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that the arrangement of the codebooks and their respective code-vectors may be varied without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- the first codebook may be a fixed codebook
- the second codebook may be an adaptive codebook
- both the first and second codebooks may be fixed codebooks.
- Third combiner 418 subtracts ( 522 ) the weighted, filtered initial second excitation vector ⁇ y k or ⁇ Hc k , from the intermediate signal x 2 (n), or intermediate vector x 2 , to produce a perceptually weighted error signal e(n).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to error minimization unit 420 , preferably a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block.
- Error minimization unit 420 uses the error signal e(n) to jointly determine ( 524 ) at least three of multiple excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ that optimize the performance of encoder 400 by minimizing a squared sum of the error signal e(n).
- optimization of index parameters ⁇ and k that is, a determination of ⁇ * and k*, respectively results in a generation ( 526 ) of an optimal first excitation vector c ⁇ * by vector generator 406 and an optimal second excitation vector c k * by codebook 410 , and optimization of parameters ⁇ and ⁇ respectively results in optimal weightings ( 528 ) of the filtered versions of the optimal excitation vectors c ⁇ * and c k *, thereby producing ( 530 ) a best estimate of the input signal s(n).
- the logic flow ends ( 532 ).
- error minimization unit 420 of encoder 400 determines the optimal set of excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ by performing a joint optimization process at step ( 524 ).
- a determination of excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ is optimized since the effects that the selection of one excitation vector has on the selection of the other excitation vector is taken into consideration in the optimization of each parameter.
- This expression represents the perceptually weighted error (or distortion) signal e(n), or error vector e, produced by third combiner 418 of encoder 400 and coupled by combiner 418 to error minimization unit 420 .
- the joint optimization process performed by error minimization unit 420 of encoder 400 at step ( 524 ) seeks to minimize a weighted version of the perceptually weighted squared error, that is, ⁇ e ⁇ 2 , and can be derived as follows.
- Equation 20 The ‘vector generator 406 /codebook 410 ,’ or ‘first codebook/second codebook,’ cross term ⁇ c ⁇ T H T Hc k present in Equation 20 is not present in the sequential optimization process performed by encoder 300 of the prior art.
- the presence of the cross term in the joint optimization analysis performed by encoder 400 , and the absence of the term from the process performed by encoder 300 has a profound effect on the selection of the respective optimal excitation vector indices ⁇ * and k* and corresponding excitation vectors C ⁇ * and c k *.
- Equation 26 is markedly similar to the optimal gain expressions, that is, Equations 10 and 18, for the sequential case except that C comprises a length L ⁇ 2 matrix, rather than a L ⁇ 1 vector.
- Equation 31 represents a simultaneous, joint optimization of both of the first and second excitation vectors c ⁇ * and c k *, and their associated gains based on a minimum weighted squared error.
- a first excitation vector c ⁇ may be optimized in advance by error minimization unit 420 , preferably via Equation 14, and the remaining parameters c k , ⁇ , and ⁇ may then be determined by the error minimization unit in a jointly optimal fashion.
- the error minimization criteria of Equation 31, that is, the right-hand side of Equation 31 may be rewritten as follows by expanding the equation and eliminating terms that are independent of c k :
- M is an energy of the filtered first excitation vector
- N is a correlation between weighted speech and the filtered first excitation vector
- a k is a correlation between a reverse filtered target vector and the second excitation vector
- B k is a correlation between the filtered first excitation vector and the second filtered excitation vector.
- a drawback of a joint search optimization process as compared to a sequential search optimization process is the relative complexity of the joint search optimization process due to the extra operations required to compute the numerator and denominator of a joint search optimization equation.
- a complexity of the second excitation vector-related index optimization equation resulting from the joint search process that is, Equation 33, can be made approximately equal to a complexity of the second codebook index optimization equation resulting from the sequential search performed by encoder 300 by transforming the parameters of Equation 33 to form an expression similar in form to Equation 17.
- Equation 33 Equation 33:
- R′ k argmax k ⁇ ⁇ 1 D k ′ ⁇ ( a k 2 - 2 ⁇ a k ⁇ b k + R k ′ ) ⁇ ( 35 )
- the parameters of the joint search can be transformed to the two precomputed parameters of the sequential FCB search of the prior art, thereby enabling use of the sequential FCB search algorithm in the joint search process performed by error minimization unit 420 .
- the two precomputed parameters are a correlation matrix ⁇ ′ and a backward filtered target signal d′.
- the optimal FCB excitation vector index k* is obtained from error minimization criteria as follows:
- Equation 37 can be manipulated to produce an equation that is similar in form to Equation 17.
- Equation 37 can be placed in a form in which the numerator is an inner product of two vectors (one of which is independent of k), and the denominator is in a form c k T ⁇ ′c k , where the correlation matrix ⁇ ′ is also independent of k.
- Equation 40 informs that the numerator of Equation 37 is merely a scaled version of the numerator in Equation 17, and more importantly, that the calculation complexity for the numerator of the joint search process performed by error minimization unit 420 of encoder 400 is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to the calculation complexity of the numerator for the sequential search process performed by encoder 300 .
- Equation 37 is compared with and analogized to the denominator in Equation 17 in order to put the denominator of Equation 37 in a form similar to the denominator of Equation 17. That is, c k T ⁇ ′c k D′ k (41)
- a scaling of the y vector by N requires only about 40 multiply operations.
- a generation and subtraction of the scaled yy T matrix from the scaled ⁇ matrix requires only about 840 MAC operations for a 40 ⁇ 40 matrix order.
- error minimization unit 420 may generate only one or more elements ⁇ ′(i,j) at a given time in order to save memory (RAM) associated generating the entire correlation matrix, which one or more elements may be used in an evaluation of the error minimization criteria to determine an optimal gain parameter k, that is, k*. Furthermore, in order to generate the correlation matrix ⁇ ′, error minimization unit 420 need only generate a portion of the correlation matrix, such as an upper triangular part or a lower triangular part of the correlation matrix, because of symmetry.
- codebook search routines that can easily reach 5 to 10 million ops/sec
- a corresponding penalty in complexity for the joint search process is only 3.6 to 7.2 percent. This penalty is far more efficient than the 30 to 40 percent penalty for the joint search process recommended in the Woodward and Hanzo paper of the prior art, while garnering the same performance advantage.
- encoder 400 determines analysis-by-synthesis parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , in a more efficient manner than the prior art encoders by optimizing excitation vector-related indices based on a correlation matrix ⁇ ′, which correlation matrix can be precomputed prior to execution of the joint optimization process.
- Encoder 400 generates the correlation matrix based in part on a filtered first excitation vector, which filtered first excitation vector is in turn based on an initial first excitation vector-related index parameter.
- Encoder 400 then evaluates error minimization criteria with respect to a determination of an optimal second excitation vector-related index parameter based on at least in part on a target signal, which is in turn based on an input signal, and the correlation matrix.
- Encoder 400 then generates an optimal second excitation vector-related index parameter based on the error minimization criteria.
- the encoder also backward filters the target signal to produce a backward filtered target signal d′ and evaluates the second codebook error minimization criteria based on at least in part on the backward filtered target signal and the correlation matrix.
- an analysis-by-synthesis encoder is capable of performing a hybrid joint search/sequential search process for optimization of the excitation vector-related parameters.
- the analysis-by-synthesis encoder includes a selection mechanism for selecting between a performance of the sequential search process and performance of the joint search process.
- the selection mechanism involves use of a joint search weighting factor ⁇ that facilitates a balancing, by the encoder, between the joint search and the sequential search processes.
- a joint search weighting factor ⁇ that facilitates a balancing, by the encoder, between the joint search and the sequential search processes.
- an expression for an optimal excitation vector-related index k* may be given by:
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram 600 of an exemplary CELP encoder 600 that is capable of performing a both a joint search process and a sequential search process in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 is a logic flow diagram 700 of the steps executed by encoder 600 in determining whether to perform a joint search process or a sequential search process.
- Encoder 600 utilizes a joint search weighting factor ⁇ that permits encoder 600 to determine whether to perform a joint search process or a sequential search process.
- Encoder 600 is generally similar to encoder 400 except that encoder 600 includes a zero-state pitch pre-filter 602 that filters the excitation vector c k generated by second codebook 410 and further includes an error minimization unit, that is, a squared error minimization/parameter block, that calculates a joint search weighting factor ⁇ and determines whether to perform a joint search process or a sequential search process based on the calculated joint search weighting factor.
- Pitch pre-filters are well known in the art and will not be described in detail herein. For example, exemplary pitch pre-filters are described in ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Section) Recommendation G.729, available from ITU, Place des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,055, entitled “CS-ACELP Speech Compression System with Adaptive Pitch Prediction Filter Gain Based on a Measure of Periodicity.”
- ITU-T International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Section
- a zero-state pitch pre-filter transfer function may be represented as:
- pitch pre-filter 602 is convolved with a weighted synthesis filter impulse response h(n) of a weighted synthesis filter 412 of encoder 600 prior to the search process.
- h(n) a weighted synthesis filter 412 of encoder 600 prior to the search process.
- m represents a current subframe
- m ⁇ 1 represents a previous subframe.
- the use of a quantized gain is important since the quantity must also be made available to the decoder.
- the use of a parameter based on the previous subframe for the current subframe is sub-optimal since the properties of the signal to be coded are likely to change over time.
- a CELP encoder such as encoder 600 determines whether to perform a joint search process or a sequential search process for a coding of a subframe by calculating ( 702 ), by an error minimization unit 604 , preferably a squared error minimization/parameter block, of encoder 600 , a joint search weighting factor ⁇ and performing ( 704 ), by the squared error minimization/parameter block and based on the joint search weighting factor, a hybrid joint search/sequential search process, that is, with reference to equation 46, jointly optimizing or sequentially optimizing at least two of a first excitation vector and an associated first excitation vector-related gain parameter, and a second excitation vector and an associated second excitation vector-related gain parameter, or performing an optimization process that is somewhere between the two processes.
- ⁇ ⁇ 1 , ⁇ ⁇ L 0 ⁇ f ⁇ ( ⁇ ) ⁇ 1 , ⁇ ⁇ L ( 48 )
- encoder 600 tends toward a joint optimization process when the periodicity effect ( ⁇ ) is low and tends toward a sequential optimization process when the periodicity effect is high.
- error minimization unit 604 of encoder 600 may make the factor ⁇ a function of both the unquantized excitation vector-related gain ⁇ and the pitch delay. This can be described by expression:
- a CELP encoder that optimizes excitation vector-related parameters in a more efficient manner than the encoders of the prior art.
- a CELP encoder optimizes excitation vector-related indices based on the computed correlation matrix, which matrix is in turn based on a filtered first excitation vector.
- the encoder evaluates error minimization criteria based on at least in part on a target signal, which target signal is based on an input signal, and the correlation matrix and generates a excitation vector-related index parameter in response to the error minimization criteria.
- the encoder also backward filters the target signal to produce a backward filtered target signal and evaluates the second codebook.
- a CELP encoder is provided that is capable of jointly optimizing and/or sequentially optimizing codebook indices by reference to a joint search weighting factor, thereby invoking an optimal error minimization process.
Abstract

From this expression, the weighting function W(z) can be distributed and the input signal estimate ś(n) can be decomposed into the filtered sum of the weighted codebook code-vectors:
The term W(z)S(z) corresponds to a weighted version of the input signal. By letting the weighted input signal W(z)S(z) be defined as Sw(z)=W(z)S(z) and by further letting

C kthe L× 1 FCB code-vector in response to index k.
By distributing H, and letting the input target vector xw=sw−hzir, the following expression can be obtained:
e=x w −βHc τ −γHc k. (6)
Equation 6 represents the perceptually weighted error (or distortion) vector e(n) produced by a third combiner 307 ofencoder 300 and coupled by combiner 307 to a squared error minimization/parameter block 308.
ε=∥e∥ 2 =∥x w −βHc τ −γHc k∥2. (7)
Due to complexity limitations, practical implementations of speech coding systems typically minimize the squared error in a sequential fashion. That is, the ACB component is optimized first (by assuming the FCB contribution is zero), and then the FCB component is optimized using the given (previously optimized) ACB component. The ACB/FCB gains, that is, codebook-related parameters β and γ, may or may not be re-optimized, that is, quantized, given the sequentially selected ACB/FCB code-vectors cτ and ck.
ε=∥x w −βHc τ∥2 =x w T x w−2βx w T Hc τ+β2 c τ T H T Hc τ. (8)
Minimization of the squared error is then determined by taking the partial derivative of ε with respect to β and setting the quantity to zero:
This yields an (sequentially) optimal ACB gain:
Substituting the optimal ACB gain back into Equation 8 gives:
where τ* is a sequentially determined optimal ACB index parameter, that is, an ACB index parameter that minimizes the bracketed expression. Since xw is not dependent on τ, Equation 11 can be rewritten as follows:
Now, by letting yτ equal the ACB code-vector cτ filtered by
and likewise, Equation 10 can be simplified to:
ε=∥x 2 −γHc k∥2. (15)
where γHck is a filtered and weighted version of FCB code-vector ck, that is, FCB code-vector ck filtered by
where k* is a sequentially optimal FCB index parameter, that is, an FCB index parameter that maximizes the bracketed expression. By grouping terms that are not dependent on k, that is, by letting d2 T=x2 TH and Φ=HTH, Equation 16 can be simplified to:
in which the sequentially optimal FCB gain γ is given as:
-
- H is the L×L zero-state weighted synthesis convolution matrix formed from an impulse response of a weighted synthesis filter h(n), such as synthesis filters 303 and 304, and corresponding to a transfer function Hzs(z) or H(z), which matrix can be represented as:
-
- hzir is a L×1 zero-input response of H(z) that is due to a state from a previous input,
- sw is the L×1 perceptually weighted input signal,
- β is the scalar first excitation vector-related gain,
- cτ is the L×1 first excitation vector generated in response to parameter τ,
- γ is the scalar second excitation vector-related gain, and
- ck is the L×1 second excitation vector generated in response to index parameter k.
ε=∥x w −βHc τ −γHc k∥2. (19)
An expansion of equation 19 produces the following equation:
ε=x w T x w−2βx x T Hc τ−2γx w T Hc k+β2 c τ T H T Hc τ+2βγc τ T H T Hc k+γ2 c k T H T Hc k. (20)
The ‘
Rewriting Equations 21 and 22 in vector-matrix form yields the following equation:
Equation 23 can be simplified by combining terms not dependent on τ or k, that is, by letting dT=xw TH and Φ=HTH, to produce the following equation:
or equivalently:
By letting C equal the code-vector set [cτ ck], that is, C=[cτ ck], and solving for [β γ],
[β γ]=dTC[CTΦC]−1. (26)
Equation 26 is markedly similar to the optimal gain expressions, that is, Equations 10 and 18, for the sequential case except that C comprises a length L×2 matrix, rather than a L×1 vector. Now referring back to the joint error expression, that is, Equation 20, and rewriting Equation 20 in terms of dT and Φ produces the equation:
ε=x w T x w−2βd T c τ−2γd T c k+β2 c τ T Φc τ+2βγc τ T Φc k+γ2 c k T Φc k, (27)
or equivalently:
Substituting the excitation vector set C=[Cτ ck] and the jointly optimal excitation vector-related gains [β γ]=dTC[CTΦC]−1 into Equation 28 produces the following equation:
ε=x w T x w−2d T C([C T ΦC] −1 C T d)+(dT C[C T ΦC] −1)C T ΦC([C T ΦC] −1 C T d). (29)
Since CTΦC[CTΦC]−1=I, Equation 29 can be reduced to:
ε=x w T x w −d T C[C T ΦC] −1 C T d. (30)
which equation is notably similar to Equations 13 and 17 and wherein the right-hand side of the equation comprises error minimization criteria evaluated by the error minimization unit. Equation 31 represents a simultaneous, joint optimization of both of the first and second excitation vectors cτ* and ck*, and their associated gains based on a minimum weighted squared error.
Inverting the inner matrix and substituting temporary variables yields the following equation for optimization of the second excitation vector-related index parameter k:
where M=cτ TΦcτ, N=dTcτ, Bk=cτ TΦck, Ak=dTck, Rk=ck TΦck and the determinant of the inverted matrix in Equation 32, that is, Dk, is described by the following equation, Dk=cτ TΦcτck TΦck−ck TΦcτcτ TΦck=MRk−Bk 2. It may be noted that M is an energy of the filtered first excitation vector, N is a correlation between weighted speech and the filtered first excitation vector, Ak is a correlation between a reverse filtered target vector and the second excitation vector, and Bk is a correlation between the filtered first excitation vector and the second filtered excitation vector.
Letting ak=MAk, bk=NBk, R′k=MN2Rk, and D′k=N2Dk, Eq 34 can be rewritten as:
The term R′k can be expressed in terms of D′k by observing that since D′k=N2Dk=N2MRk−N2Bk 2, R′k=MN2Rk, and bk=NBk, then R′k=D′k+bk 2. Substituting the latter expression into Equation 35 yields the following algebraic manipulation:
Since the constant, that is, the ‘1,’ in Equation 36c has no effect on the maximization process, the constant can be removed, with the result that Equation 36c can be rewritten as:
where the right-hand side of the equation comprises the error minimization criteria and where d2 T=x2 TH, and Φ=HTH. In accordance with the embodiment depicted by
d′Tck
d′Tck
d′Tck
d′Tck
d′ T=((y τ T y τ)x w T−(x w T y τ)y τ T) H (39)
From Equation 39, it is apparent that if the optimal ACB gain γ, from Equation 15, for the sequential search is used, and further noting, from Equation 16, that that d2 T=x2 TH=(xw−βyτ)TH, one can infer that:
d′ T=(y τ T y τ)d 2 T =Md 2 T. (40)
where the term d′ is a backward filtered target signal that is produced by a backward filtering of the target signal by
ck TΦ′ck
By substituting previously defined terms, the following sequence of equivalent expressions can be derived:
ck TΦ′ck
ck TΦ′ck
Since Φ=HTH is symmetric, then Φ=ΦT=HTH:
ck TΦ′ck
ck TΦ′ck
ck TΦ′ck
Now letting y=HTyτ, Equation 41e can be rewritten as:
ck TΦ′ck
and the correlation matrix Φ′ can be written as:
Φ′=N 2 MΦ−N 2 yy T. (42)
As a result,
Since the form of the error minimization criteria in Equations 17 and 44 are generally the same, the terms d′ and Φ′ can be pre-computed, and any existing sequential search process may be transformed to a joint search process without significant modification. Although the pre-computation steps may appear to be complex, based on the intricacy of the denominator in Equation 44, a simple analysis will show that the added complexity is actually quite low, if not trivial.
φ′(i, j)=φ(i, j)−y(i)y(j), 0≦i<L, 0≦j≦i. (45)
As is apparent to one skilled in the art from equation 45, the entire correlation matrix Φ′ need not be generated at one time. In various embodiments of the invention,
40+840+40+40+840=1800 multiply operations per subframe,
or about
1800 multiply operations/subframe×4 subframes/frame×50 frames/second=360,000 operations/sec,
for a typical implementation as found in many speech coding standards for telecommunications applications. When considering the fact that codebook search routines that can easily reach 5 to 10 million ops/sec, a corresponding penalty in complexity for the joint search process is only 3.6 to 7.2 percent. This penalty is far more efficient than the 30 to 40 percent penalty for the joint search process recommended in the Woodward and Hanzo paper of the prior art, while garnering the same performance advantage.
where 0≦λ≦1 defines the joint search weighting factor. If λ=1, the expression is the same as Equation 44. If λ=0, the impact of the constant terms (M, N) affect all codebook entries ck equivalently, so the expression produces the same results as Equation 17. Values between the extremes will produce some trade-off in performance between the sequential and joint search processes.
where β′ is a function of the optimal excitation vector-related parameter gain β, that is, β′=ƒ(β). For ease of implementation and minimal complexity during the codebook search process,
where ƒ(β) has been empirically determined to have good properties when ƒ(β)=1−β2, although a variety of other functions are possible. This has the effect of placing more emphasis on using a sequential search process for highly periodic signals in which the pitch period is less than a subframe length, whereby the degree of periodicity has been determined during the adaptive codebook search as represented by Equations 13 and 14. Thus, when the periodicity of the current frame is emphasized in the determination of the joint search weighting factor,
The periodicity effect is more pronounced when the delay is towards a lower value and the unquantized excitation vector-related gain β is towards a higher value. Thus, it is desired that the factor λ be low when either the excitation vector-related gain β is high or the pitch delay is low. The following function:
has been empirically found to produce desired results. Thus, when the unquantized ACB gain and the pitch delay are emphasized in the determination of the joint search weighting factor,
