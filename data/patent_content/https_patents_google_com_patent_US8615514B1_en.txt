Definitions
- An internet search engine is a tool typically designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. Users submit search queries to the search engine and the search engine identifies and presents a list of result documents in response to each search query.
- the list of result documents consists of links to webpages, images, and other types of files, typically identified and retrievable by their Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
- URLs Uniform Resource Locators
- User actions with respect to each result document presented in response to a search query submission can serve as feedback that is indicative of the relevance and quality of the result document with respect to the search query.
- User feedback data for each result document can be collected from multiple users and aggregated over time, and statistics of the aggregated user feedback data for the result document can be used to adjust the ranking of the document in the result list for future submissions of the search query.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving a plurality of document query pairs (D-Qs) associated with a website, each of the D-Qs being associated with a respective query, a respective document from the website, and respective user feedback data indicative of user behavior relative to the respective document as a search result for the respective query; partitioning the plurality of D-Qs into one or more groups according to values for a partition parameter associated with the plurality of D-Qs, each group being defined by a respective value range for the partition parameter and including D-Qs associated with partition parameter values that are within the respective value range; evaluating, by a processor, a property parameter of the website based on aggregated user feedback data of the D-Qs included within at least one of the one or more groups; and providing the evaluated property parameter as an input for ranking documents from the website as result documents for searches.
- D-Qs document query pairs
- each user feedback data includes one or more of a click-count, an impression count, and a click-to-impression ratio.
- the click-count is weighted by click-duration or click-recency.
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is an information retrieval score of a top-ranked document responsive to the respective query of the D-Q.
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is a length of the respective query of the D-Q.
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is a measure of popularity of the respective query of the D-Q.
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is a measure of commerciality of the respective query of the D-Q.
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is a total number of search results responsive for the respective query of the D-Q.
- evaluating the property parameter of the website further includes the actions of: aggregating the respective user feedback data associated with the D-Qs in each of the one or more groups; determining a distribution of aggregated user feedback data among the one or more groups; and evaluating the property parameter based on the distribution.
- a property parameter of the website is evaluated based on a distribution of aggregated user feedback data among different partitions of user feedback data that are associated with different value ranges of a partition parameter.
- the property parameter reflects a property of the website that influences the quality of the website, in either a query-dependent context or a query-independent context.
- Common property parameters include, for example, overall document quality, popularity, commerciality, and so on.
- the partition parameter being used can be chosen to suit the particular property parameter being evaluated.
- Common partition parameters include, for example, the IR score of top result document for queries associated with the website, query length, and so on.
- statistical analysis of the aggregation of user feedback data can be performed at a website level, and the website property parameter can be used as an input in ranking individual documents from the website as search results for queries. Therefore, even if user feedback data for a particular document from the website is lacking, the user feedback data for other documents from the website can be utilized to improve the ranking accuracy of the particular document in searches.

- FIG. 6 is illustrates an example architecture of a system.
- FIG. 1 shows an example information retrieval system 1000 .
- the information retrieval system can be implemented in an internet, intranet, or other client/server environment for retrieving relevant results in response to search queries submitted by users.
- the system 1000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 1000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a user 1002 interacts with the system 1000 through a client device 1004 ( 1004 a , 1004 b , 1004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 1004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 1004 includes a random access memory (RAM) 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 1008 .
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions within the device 1004 .
- the processor 1008 is a single-threaded or multi-threaded processor having one or more processor cores, for example.
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 1004 ) to display graphical information for a user interface.
- a user 1002 a connects to the search engine 1030 within a server system 1014 to submit a query 1015 .
- a client-side query signal 1010 a is sent into a network 1012 and is forwarded to the server system 1014 as a server-side query signal 1010 b .
- Server system 1014 is one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- a server device 1014 includes a memory device 1016 , which includes the search engine 1030 loaded therein.
- a processor 1018 is structured to process instructions within the device 1014 . These instructions implement one or more components of the search engine 1030 .
- the processor 1018 is a single-threaded or multi-threaded processor having one or more processing cores, for example.
- the processor 1018 processes instructions stored in the memory 1016 related to the search engine 1030 and sends information to the client device 1004 , through the network 1012 , to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 1004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the user query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 includes an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus.
- the index information for the documents in the corpus is stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 is accessed to identify documents related to the user query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- a document can be stored in a memory without having first been stored in a file.
- the search engine 1030 includes a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the user query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents is performed using techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information is determined by various appropriate techniques. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance. In particular, if a document is linked to by many other relevant documents, it is inferred that the linked document is particularly relevant. This inference is made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they are considered more relevant, and the first document is considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants.
- the ranking engine 1052 receives additional signals from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 provides one or more measures of relevance for the documents, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 1002 .
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations described further below to generate the one or more measures of relevance.
- the ranking of a particular document with respect to a particular search term can be influenced by user feedback collected from previous sessions where the same result document are presented for the same query entered by other users. User feedback is described in further detail below.
- this particular documents is particularly relevant for subsequent users that enter the same query as well.
- the ranking of this particular document is promoted in the list of result documents presented to the subsequent users.
- the user feedback data collected over time is stored in a model database 1024 . Many parameters of a user's response to a result document can be collected, and the data can be mined to derive signals of interest to improve the search engine and better serve the users.
- the search engine 1030 forwards the final, ranked result list within a server-side search result signal 1028 a through the network 1012 .
- a client-side search result signal 1028 b is received by the client device 1004 a where the results are stored within the RAM 1006 and/or used by the processor 1008 to display the results on an output device for the user 1002 a.
- FIG. 2A shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , and a rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the indexing engine 2010 functions as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 generates scores for document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features include, for example, aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features include, for example, aspects of document cross-referencing of the document or the domain.
- Each of these and other features can be represented as a respective property parameter that is input to the scoring engine 2020 .
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned, to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score, using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- the ranking engine 2030 produces a ranking of document results 2040 for display to a user based on IR scores received from the scoring engine 2020 and one or more signals from the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- a tracking component 2050 is used to record information regarding user behavior such as individual user selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 is embedded JavaScript or other code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies user selections (e.g., mouse clicks, finger hand touch gestures, or speech commands) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 is a proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed.
- the tracking component can also include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) selected by the user.
- the recorded information is stored in result selection logs 2060 .
- the recorded information includes log entries that indicate user interaction with each result document presented for each query submitted. For each user selection of a result document presented for a query, the log entries indicate the query (Q), the document (D), the user's dwell time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- the log entries also records negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user (counted as an impression), but was not selected.
- position(s) of click(s) i.e., user selection(s)
- information about the browser session e.g., existence and type of previous clicks, and post-click session activity
- IR scores of clicked results IR scores of all results shown before the click
- titles and snippets shown to the user before the click the titles and snippets shown to the user before the click
- the user's cookie cookie age
- IP (Internet Protocol) address user agent of the browser, and so on
- the time (T) between the initial click-through to the document result and the user's returning to the main page and clicking on another document result is also recorded.
- An assessment is made about the time (T) regarding whether this time indicates a longer view of the document result or a shorter view of the document result, since longer views are generally indicative of quality or relevance for the clicked through result.
- This assessment about the time (T) can further be made in conjunction with various weighting techniques.
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the rank modifier engine 2070 and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 2B shows another example information retrieval system.
- a server system 2150 includes an indexing engine 2160 and a scoring/ranking engine 2170 .
- a client system 2100 includes a user interface for presenting a ranking 2110 , a tracking component 2120 , result selection logs 2121 and a ranking/rank modifier engine 2140 .
- the client system 2100 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine 2140 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 2170 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in then re-ranks the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific user base.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating the building of an example model database 3002 for use with an information retrieval system.
- the model database 3002 is one or more databases that aggregate information indicative of user behavior on at least a per-query and per-document basis.
- information in the model database 3002 is used as input to a process that ranks documents or enhances the ranking.
- the model information can be used as input to interactive or non-interactive internet search engines, image search engines, video search engines, book search engines, consumer product search engines, other suitable processes capable of ranking documents, and combinations of these.
- a document is referenced by a universal resource locator (URL) in the model database 3002 ; however, other types of document references are possible.
- a document can be a webpage on the World Wide Web referenced by a URL.
- a user submits a query 3006 a “celica,” for example, to an information retrieval system, such as a search engine, through a graphical user interface 3009 , as presented on a personal computer, a mobile telephone, or other device.
- a query includes one or more terms.
- a query of a travel database can include the terms “bus,” “route,” “along,” “Charles,” “River.”
- terms can include special characters, numbers, mathematical expressions, Boolean expressions, slang terms, names, titles, images, sounds, videos, other suitable query terms, and combinations of these.
- query terms can be in more than one language.
- a search engine In response to the user selecting the search button 3012 , for example, a search engine returns a ranking or result list 3008 which is an ordered list of references to documents that are responsive to the query 3006 a .
- the result list 3008 includes a set of document references URL A, URL B, URL C ( 3010 a ), and URL D.
- the result list 3008 can contain the text of the URL itself, a short description of the information found within each document, a snapshot of the portion of the document which contains the query, other suitable information, or a combination of these.
- the selected URL can cause the user interface 3009 (e.g., a web browser) to present the associated document 5012 . Once the user has finished viewing the document, the user can navigate back to the result list 3008 .
- the user interface 3009 e.g., a web browser
- the model database 3002 is built as users interact with search engines. Each presentation of a document reference in the result list in response to a query is recorded as an “impression” of the referenced document in connection with the query. Each selection of the presented document reference is a recorded as a “click” for the document in connection with the query.
- a timer 3004 can be used to track how long a user views or “dwells” on the document. For example, a longer time spent dwelling on a document, such as 60 seconds or more, (i.e., a “long click”) can indicate that a user found the document to be relevant for the query.
- the click data 3014 is a count of clicks of all types (e.g., long, medium, short) for a particular query 3006 and document 3010 combination.
- the click data 3014 includes a count of each click type (e.g., long, medium, short) for a particular query 3006 and document 3010 combination.
- Aggregated click data from queries for a given document can be used to rank or enhance a ranking of that document.
- a quantity of user feedback data can be a weighted average of the count of long clicks for a given document and query pair.
- a search engine or other process creates a record 3016 in the model database 3002 for documents that are selected by users in response to a query.
- Each record 3016 within the model 3002 (herein referred to as a tuple ⁇ document, query, data>) is at least a combination of a query 3006 submitted by users, a document reference 3010 selected by users in response to that query, and a collection of data 3014 that is associated with the query, the document, and/or the document-query pair.
- model data is locale-specific (e.g., country, state, etc.) or language-specific.
- the collection of data 3014 associated with a document-query pair includes user feedback data for a respective document as a search result for a respective query associated with the document-query pair.
- the user feedback data includes, for example, an aggregation of click data (e.g., click-through counts, impression counts, click-to-impression ratios, weighted click counts, and so on) collected from users that have been shown the document and/or selected the document in response to the query.
- the collection of data 3014 associated with a document-query pair further includes various other parameters, scores, and/or measures of various qualities of the document, the query, and the document-query pair.
- These other parameters, scores, and/or measures of qualities are either stored as part of the record 3016 , or referenced in the record 3016 and retrievable from other information storage means.
- These signals include data (e.g., query terms, anchor text, domain names, and numbers of advertisements presented on webpages) that are collected from various sources (e.g., client device, web servers, and so on).
- these signals also include derived signals (e.g., popularity scores of documents, popularity scores of queries, competitiveness scores of queries, commerciality scores of queries, query length, relevance scores of documents, quality scores of documents, and so on) that have been generated by the information retrieval system based on various other collected or derived signals.
- derived signals e.g., popularity scores of documents, popularity scores of queries, competitiveness scores of queries, commerciality scores of queries, query length, relevance scores of documents, quality scores of documents, and so on
- the various signals associated with a document-query pair are indicative of various properties of the document, the query, or the document-query pair.
- a signal defined by the IR score of the top result document of a query is indicative of the quality of the query.
- a signal defined by the submission frequency or total submission volume of a query is indicative of the popularity of the query.
- a signal defined by the total number of advertisements targeting the search terms of a query is indicative of the commerciality of the query.
- a signal defined by the total number of advertisements presented on a document is indicative of the commerciality of the document.
- a signal defined by the total number of queries to which a document is responsive indicates the breath of the topic coverage of the document.
- a signal defined by the total number of result documents responsive to a query is indicative of the competitiveness of each document responsive to the query.
- a signal defined by the IR score of the document as a search result to a query is indicative of the relevance of the document in the context of the query.
- Other signals of various properties of the documents, the queries, and the document-query pairs can be defined and implemented. Other extensions of model data are possible.
- one or more signals in the collection of data associated with the document-query pairs are used to segregate or partition the user feedback data (e.g., click data that are aggregated across users and over time) associated with the document-query pairs at a website level.
- Each signal can define a different partition parameter.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are block diagrams illustrating an example process for evaluating an example property parameter of a website based on aggregated user feedback data distributed among different partitions of user feedback data made according to a partition parameter.
- the partition parameter is a signal defined or selected based on a particular property that influences the quality of the website, in either a query-dependent context or a query-independent context.
- website properties include, for example, website quality, website popularity, website commerciality, website authority, and so on.
- a respective property parameter can be defined for each of these website properties, and evaluated to represent the quality, popularity, commerciality, and authoritativeness of the website as a whole.
- These evaluated property parameters for the website as a whole are also indicative of the quality, popularity, commerciality, and authoritativeness of individual documents from the website, and can be used as inputs to a ranking engine or a rank modifier engine that ranks search results that include documents from the website.
- a process for gathering user feedback data starts with users 4012 submitting search queries 4014 to a search engine 4010 and receiving lists of result documents 4016 responsive to each of the search queries 4014 .
- Each of the lists of result documents contains document references (e.g., URLs of webpages) to documents 4018 on the World Wide Web, for example.
- User interaction with the presented result lists and/or result documents are tracked by various mechanisms and sent back to the search engine 4010 or other process.
- the search engine 4010 or other process creates records in a data model 4020 for documents that are presented to and/or selected by users in response to a query.
- the records in the data model 4020 are stored, for example, as document-query pairs (D-Qs) 4021 in the data model 4020 with corresponding user feedback data 4022 and partition parameter data 4023 .
- Partition parameter data 4023 for each D-Q include values of one or more partition parameters associated with the D-Q.
- some or all of the partition parameter data 4023 associated with each D-Q are stored separately from the data model 4020 and are identified and retrieved as needed.
- each document-query pair (D-Q) 4021 is associated with a respective query (Q), a respective document reference (D), respective user feedback data 4022 , and respective partition parameter data 4023 .
- a document is responsive to multiple queries, and is associated with multiple D-Qs.
- a query has multiple responsive documents, and is associated with multiple D-Qs as well.
- D-Qs are locale-specific (e.g., country, state, etc.) or language-specific (e.g, English).
- the respective user feedback data 4022 associated with a D-Q includes an aggregation of click data 4024 (e.g., raw click count or weighted click count) across users that have selected the respective document reference (D) in response to the respective query (Q).
- Other user feedback data includes, for example, an impression count 4026 of the respective document (D) in response to the respective query (Q) and a click-through rate 4028 (CTR) for the respective document (D) as a search result for the respective query (Q).
- An impression count is the total number of times that the respective document reference (D) has been presented in a result list in response to the respective query (Q).
- a click-through rate (CTR) represents the fraction of impressions that have resulted in a user selecting the document reference from the result list.
- Other types of user feedback data are possible.
- the partition parameter data 4023 associated with a D-Q include values of various partition parameters.
- the partition parameters can be defined by parameters, scores, or measures of various qualities (or collectively, “signals”) of the document (D), the query (Q), and the document-query pair (D-Q).
- the partition parameter data is used to segregate or partition the user feedback data in the data model 4020 .
- Examples of the signals that can server as a partition parameter for the segregation of user feedback data include a measure of query quality as indicated by the IR score of the top result document of a query, a measure of query popularity as indicated by the total query volume or the query submission frequency of a query, a measure of topic coverage of the document as indicated by the total number of queries for which the document is responsive to, and so on.
- Other definitions and/or selection of partition parameters are possible, depending on the particular website property or attribute that is of interest to the search engine 4010 in ranking documents in searches.
- each document (D) associated with a D-Q has a hosting website.
- a hosting website is associated multiple documents and multiple D-Qs in the D-Q model 4020 .
- the host or domain information associated with each D-Q is first extracted ( 4030 ) from the associated document reference (D) of each D-Q pairs.
- the document reference of each D-Q is a URL by which the D-Q's associated respective document (D) is identified and retrieved from a web server.
- the URL includes a portion that identifies the domain name of the website that hosts the associated respective document (D).
- the host or domain information in the URL is extracted and stored as a respective site key for each D-Q.
- the site keys are used to identify a collection of D-Qs that are associated with documents from a common website.
- the documents from the website form a document group (e.g., the collection of data records 4040 ) that is identified by the respective site key (e.g., “cnn.com”).
- the respective site key e.g., “cnn.com”.
- other forms of site keys or group identifiers can be implemented for groups of documents in other document depositories.
- one or more suitable partition parameters are selected and used to segregate the set of D-Qs associated with the particular website.
- One suitable partition parameter is the IR score of the top result for a query across all websites. The rationale for selecting such a partition parameter is that, if the IR score of the top result for a query across all websites is high, it is more likely than not that the query is a well-formulated query, and that the user feedback data for documents responsive to the query are more likely to reflect the quality of the documents and the quality of the websites containing the documents.
- a high concentration of positive user feedback e.g., as reflected by a high click-through rate or a large number of click-throughs
- a high concentration of positive user feedback in the low IR score range indicates high website quality
- a high concentration of positive user feedback in the low IR score range does not indicate high website quality.
- Other partition parameters can be defined and/or selected for the evaluation of various website properties or attributes.
- the whole IR score range is divided into several partitions, where each partition is defined by a corresponding value range for the IR score.
- Suitable value ranges that define the partitions do not need to be uniform and can be determined based on empirical data analysis of websites with known properties or attributes, for instance.
- the number of partitions may also vary depending on the partition parameter and/or the desired granularity of data analysis.
- Each document-query pair (D-Q) associated with the particular website (e.g., cnn.com) is assigned to a corresponding partition according to the match between the value of the partition parameter associated with the D-Q and the value range defining the partition.
- each partition may include different numbers of D-Qs and each D-Q is associated with respective user feedback data.
- the user feedback data associated with the D-Qs are aggregated within each partition.
- an aggregated click count (e.g., 4045 a - d ) is computed for each partition by summing the click count associated with each D-Q in the partition.
- an aggregated click-through rate (CTR) is computed for each partition by dividing the aggregated click count by the aggregated impression count of all the D-Qs in the partition.
- CTR aggregated click-through rate
- the method of aggregation may vary depending on the nature and definition of the user feedback data.
- the aggregated click counts ( 4045 a - d ) for the website “cnn.com” are mostly concentrated in the high IR ranges 51-80 and 81-100. This concentration of aggregated click counts in the high IR ranges tends to indicate that the website is of high quality.
- an aggregated click-through rate is computed for each partition as well. A combination of both high click-through rate and high click-count in the high IR ranges provide even stronger indication that the website is of high quality.
- a website quality score is derived either based on the entire distribution of aggregated user feedback data among the partitions, or the aggregated user feedback data for a selected subset of partitions (e.g., the partitions defined by IR score >50) ( 4044 ).
- the website quality score is derived based on a combination of multiple distributions of aggregated user feedback data, where each distribution of aggregated user feedback data is obtained according to a different partition parameter.
- another partition parameter relevant to website quality is query length (e.g., the number of terms in a search query). Queries that are neither too short nor too long tend to produce results that are good matches to the query (i.e., neither too general nor too specific). Therefore, if the clicks for documents on a website concentrate in the partitions that are associated with the high IR ranges, and in the partitions that are associated with queries having only two or three words, then it is highly likely that the website is of high quality.
- the formula for deriving a website quality score, the relevant partition parameters that should be used for partitioning the user feedback data, and the correlation between website quality and the distribution of aggregated user feedback data among the partitions can be determined using empirical data analysis of websites with known qualities and user feedback data. Models of the correlations between user feedback distribution and various website properties, including website quality, can be developed and trained using website property measures obtained through other means.
- the website quality scores derived for websites are used in search result ranking involving documents from the websites ( 4050 ).
- the website quality score is used as one of the parameters in selecting and ranking the list of result documents responsive to a search query.
- the website quality score is used to boost or demote rankings of particular documents from the website in the list of result documents responsive to the search query.
- FIG. 4B illustrates a more detailed process for evaluating an example property parameter (e.g., website quality) based on aggregated user feedback data distributed among different partitions defined by a example partition parameter (e.g., IR score of top result document).
- an example property parameter e.g., website quality
- a example partition parameter e.g., IR score of top result document
- a set of D-Qs 4061 are associated with a common website.
- Each D-Q in the set is associated with respective user feedback data, including a click count 4062 for the respective document (D) associated with the D-Q as a search result for the respective query (Q) associated with D-Q.
- the user feedback data associated with each D-Q further includes an impression count 4063 for the respective document (D) presented as a search result for the respective query (Q) of the D-Q.
- Each D-Q is also associated with respective partition parameter data 4064 , including a respective value of a partition parameter defined by the IR score of the top result for the respective query associated with the D-Q.
- Partition e.g., 4064 a - d
- D-Q_ 8 is the only D-Q whose associated IR value is within the value range defined by partition B 4064 b , and only D-Q_ 8 is assigned to Partition B. Similarly, D-Q_ 1 , D-Q_ 6 , D-Q_ 7 , and D_Q_ 10 are assigned to Partition C 4064 c ; and D-Q_ 9 is assigned to Partition D 4064 d.
- aggregated user feedback data is computed for each partition ( 4072 ).
- the user feedback data associated with each D-Q include a click count for the D-Q
- the aggregated user feedback data for each partition include the sum of click counts for all D-Qs assigned to that partition.
- the user feedback data associated with each D-Q include an impression count and a click-to-impression ratio
- the aggregated user feedback data for each partition include an aggregated click-to-impression ratio, for example, computed as the sum of click counts divided the sum of impression counts of all D-Qs assigned to that partition.
- the resulting aggregated user feedback data distributions include, for example, a distribution of aggregated click count ( 4074 a - d ) for each partition and an aggregated click-through rate ( 4076 a - d ) for each partition.
- the aggregated click count 4094 a for Partition A is the sum of the click counts associated with D-Q_ 2 , D-Q_ 3 , D-Q_ 4 and D-Q_ 5 .
- the aggregated click-through rate ( 4076 a ) for Partition A is calculated by dividing the aggregated click count (e.g., 150 ) for Partition A by the aggregated impression count (e.g., 550 ) for Partition A.
- the aggregated click-through rate for other partitions is calculated similarly using the user feedback data associated with the D-Qs within each partition.
- the aggregated click-through rates for the high IR partitions are also relatively high (e.g., at 40% and 14%, respectively). Therefore, the website is likely to be of good quality.
- a website quality score can be derived (4082) based on the distributions of aggregated user feedback data among the different partitions or certain partitions that are of particular interest (e.g., IR score >50).
- the distributions of aggregated user feedback data among different partitions made according to one or more partition parameters are used to filter out websites of poor quality.
- Threshold values of the aggregated user feedback data can be specified for certain partitions of interest. For example, if, for a website, the aggregated click count for the high IR score partition is below a click count threshold and the aggregated click through rate for the high IR score partition is also below a click-through rate threshold, then the website is considered of poor quality.
- a website quality score can be computed for the website. When ranking a document from the website as a search result responsive to a search query, the rank of the document is demoted based on the poor quality score of the website.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are flow diagrams for an example process 5000 for evaluating a property of a website based on aggregated user feedback data distributed among different partitions of user feedback data made according to a partition parameter.
- the process starts when a plurality of document-query pairs (D-Qs) associated with a common website is received ( 5002 ).
- Each of the plurality of D-Qs is associated with a respective query (Q), a respective document (D) from the common website, and respective data.
- the D-Qs associated with the common website are identified by extracting the host and domain information from the URLs of the documents (Ds) associated with the D-Qs.
- the respective data associated with each D-Q include user feedback data and partition parameter data.
- the user feedback data are data indicative of user behavior relative to the respective document (D) as a search result for the respective query (Q), and the partition parameter data include a value of a partition parameter associated with the respective query (Q) or document (D).
- values of multiple partition parameters associated with the respective query or document are included as part of the partition parameter data.
- the user feedback data associated with each D-Q include a click count for the document (D) as a search result for the query (Q), an impression count for the document (D) presented as a search result for the query (Q).
- the user feedback data sometimes also include derived information such as the click-through rate or click-to-impression ratio for the document (D) as a search result of the query (Q), a weighted click count or click-through rate based on click duration, click recency, and other factors indicating user interest to the document (D) in the context of the query (Q).
- Click duration is a measure of the time (T) between a user selecting a link on a result listing to visit a result document and the user returning from the result webpage to the result listing.
- a click with a longer duration is given more weight in computing the click count.
- Click recency is a measure of the age of a click that was received for a document in response to a query.
- an older click is given less weight than a more recent click in computing the click count.
- spam clicks e.g., fraudulent or machine-generated clicks
- the partition parameter associated with each D-Q is the IR score of the top-ranked document responsive to the respective query (Q) of the D-Q across all D-Qs in the database.
- the IR score of a document responsive to a query is a score derived for the document in a search result ranking process, and is indicative of the document's relevance to the query.
- the IR score of the top result for a query is also indicative of whether the query is a well-formulated query and whether the subject matter of the query and the result document are of sufficiently quality and general applicability in other searches.
- IR score of the top result document for a query is very low, it is probably because that either the query or the document, or the subject matter of the query are obscure or of poor quality.
- IR scores of the top result documents of queries are relevant in determining website quality because the IR scores indicate query quality, and positive feedback for webpages responsive to high quality queries is likely to reflect good webpage quality, and therefore, good website quality.
- the partition parameter is defined by query length.
- a query includes a single search term or multiple search terms. Typically, if a search query includes a single term, many results will be returned, and many of the search results are likely to be irrelevant for what the user actually intends to search for because there is too much room for ambiguity in a single search term. Alternatively, if a search query includes a large number of search terms, very specific results will be returned regardless of the quality and general applicability of the website serving the result documents. Positive user feedback for result documents of queries that are of medium length (e.g., two or three words) are indications that the result documents are of good quality. Therefore, a high aggregated click count in partitions defined by a medium query length (e.g., two or three terms) likely indicates good website quality.
- the partition parameter is defined as the total number of search results responsive for a query.
- the total number of search results responsive for a query is indicative of how much significance positive user feedback toward a particular result document should be given in determining the quality of a website serving the particular result document. If many results were returned for a search query, then the positive feedback for a result document from a website is a stronger indicator of relevance and quality for the document and the website than if only a small number of results were returned for the search query.
- a relevant input in search result ranking is a measure of popularity for a website.
- a partition parameter is defined by the total query volume (total number of submissions of the query) or query submission frequency for a query. This partition parameter measures query popularity. For example, if the total number of submissions for the search query “bankruptcy” is 3000 per day, and the total number of submissions for the search query “arachnids” is 50 per day, then the query “arachnids” is a less popular query than the query “bankruptcy.”
- the measure of query popularity is relevant in determining website popularity because websites serving well-received documents responsive to popular queries are likely to be popular websites.
- a relevant input in search result ranking is a property parameter that measures the commerciality of a website. Knowing the level of commerciality of a website helps ranking search result in a product search, for example.
- highly commercial website is also likely to be a spammed website with lots of advertising but little relevant information.
- a suitable partition parameter for deriving the commerciality score of a website is defined by the number of advertisements presented on the webpage.
- a suitable partition parameter may be defined by the number of advertisements targeting the search terms in a search query. Positive feedback for highly commercial documents or documents responsive to highly commercial queries likely indicates that the website serving the documents are highly commercial as well.
- a highly commercial website may be promoted in a product search, but may be demoted in a search for non-commercial information.
- partition parameters are possible.
- the correlations between properties of website, partition parameters, and the distribution of aggregated user feedback among different partitions can be explored through empirical data obtained through other means.
- the set of D-Qs associated with the common website is identified, the set of D-Qs are partitioned into one or more groups based on the values of the partition parameter associated with the plurality of D-Qs ( 5004 ).
- Each group being defined by a respective value range for the partition parameter and include D-Qs associated with values of the partition parameter that are within the respective value range.
- the value ranges may be defined differently for different partition parameters. The value ranges do not have to be uniform. In some implementations, only one value range of interest is specified, and D-Qs with values of the partition parameter within that value range are identified. All other D-Qs are discarded from consideration. In some implementations, the entire value range of the partition parameter is divided into consecutive sections.
- the user feedback data associated with the D-Qs in at least one of the one or more partitions are aggregated.
- the partition(s) of interest are selected based on empirical data analysis. For example, if the partition parameter is the IR score of the top result document of a query, the partition that is of particular importance to website quality determination is the high IR score range and the low IR score range, for example, as defined by a high IR score threshold and a low IR score threshold. High concentration of positive user feedback in the high IR score range indicates that the website is of good quality, while high concentration of positive user feedback in the low IR score range would indicate poor website quality.
- the partitions that are of particular importance would be query length of two or three terms. Since queries of two or three terms tend to cause retrieval of results that are neither too broad nor too specific, user feedback data concentrated in the corresponding partitions would be a good indicator of website quality.
- a property parameter for the website is evaluated based on the aggregated user feedback data for the partitions of interest ( 5006 ).
- the property parameter is indicative of a property or attribute of the website, such as quality, popularity, relevance, commerciality, authority, and so on.
- the selection of the partition parameter is based on the particular property of the website that is to be evaluated. For example, if the property of interest is the commerciality of a website, the partition parameter that is used to partition the user feedback data can be the commerciality of the query or the commerciality of the document. If the property of interest is the authoritativeness of the website, the partition parameter that is used to partition the user feedback data is the competitiveness of the query or the IR score of the document.
- the various property parameters for a website that are obtained using the process 5000 are useful as inputs for ranking documents from the website in searches.
- the popularity of the website, the authoritativeness of the website, the quality of the website, the commerciality of the website, and so on can all be used to promote or demote a document from the website as a search result for a query. Therefore, the evaluated property parameter is provided as an input for ranking documents from the website as result documents for searches ( 5008 ).
- FIG. 5B shows an example process 5100 for evaluating the property parameter based on the distribution of aggregated user feedback data.
- the respective user feedback data associated the D-Qs in each of the one or more groups are aggregated ( 5102 ), and therefore a distribution of aggregated user feedback data across all partitions is determined ( 5104 ).
- the property parameter for the website is evaluated based on the distribution ( 5106 ).
- the distribution is characterized, for example, by a particular shape, a skew factor, and so on.
- the distribution of the aggregated user feedback data is skewed toward the high IR score ranges, the distribution indicates that the website is of good quality. In contrast, if the distribution is screwed to the low IR ranges, then it indicates that the website is of poor quality.
- combinations of multiple distributions based on different partition parameters are used to improve the accuracy of the website property evaluation. For example, if the aggregated user feedback data is skewed toward the high IR scores, and the aggregated user feedback data is skewed toward highly competitive queries, then it is highly likely that the website is of good quality. The prediction of good quality is stronger than if the aggregated user feedback is skewed toward high IR scores while the aggregated user feedback is also skewed toward uncompetitive queries.
- combinations of multiple distributions of aggregated user feedback data for the same partition parameter can be used.
- the combination of the distribution of aggregated click count and the distribution of aggregated click-through rate are used.
- High click count for the high IR ranges as well as high click-through rate for the high IR ranges are used together to indicate good website quality. If either of the click count or the click-through rate in the high IR ranges does not satisfy a corresponding threshold value, then the website is not considered as having high quality.
- Various quality data of websites obtained through other means can be used to build models that explore and verify the correlations between the distributions of aggregated user feedback data and the partition parameters.
- User feedback distributions for websites of different properties and attributes are compared to derive distribution characteristics that are indicative of the different properties.
- the derived distribution characteristics are then used to predict the properties of other websites.
