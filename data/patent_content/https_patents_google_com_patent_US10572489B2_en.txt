- Synthesized snippets, for a webpage may be generated based on information obtained from sub-pages of the webpage.
- the sub-pages for the webpage may be determined based on a link analysis of the webpage.
- the sub-pages of a first webpage may include webpages that are directly or indirectly linked to by the first webpage and that are part of the same website as the first webpage.
- the sub-pages of the first webpage may also include webpages that may not necessarily be linked by traditional links. For example, a directory analysis, for example based on the strings of the uniform resource locators (URLs) of a webpage, may be performed to determine sub-pages.
- URLs uniform resource locators
- examplestore/books/fiction begins with “examplestore/books,” indicating that the fiction webpage may be a sub-page of the Books webpage.
- so-called “breadcrumb” links on a webpage may be used to determine sub-pages.
- a breadcrumb may refer to a navigation aid that may be presented by webpages to provide a user with an indication of their location in a website (e.g., a user browsing the fiction section of an online bookstore may be provided the breadcrumb “books>fiction”).
- the breadcrumbs may be parsed to determine link structures that may be used to define sub-pages.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating information that may be stored for webpages.
- the information may be obtained and/or generated by search server 210 and/or document indexing server 220 .
- webpages hosted by web servers connected to network 230 may be crawled by document indexing server 220 .
- a number of webpages, illustrated as webpage_1 through webpage_k, are illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- An address 410 , a header 420 , one or more sub-pages 430 and corresponding sub-page titles 435 , and a synthesized snippet 440 may be associated with each webpage.
- Address 410 may be a URL or a uniform resource identifier (URI) and may be stored for each webpage. Addresses 410 may be obtained as part of the crawling process by document indexing server 220 .
- URI uniform resource identifier
- Header 420 may also be associated with each webpage.
- header 420 may include text extracted from the webpage and/or text extracted from other sources. The text may serve as a brief description or title for the webpage.
- header 420 may correspond to anchor text that is used as a title, corresponding to the webpage, in search results that include that webpage.
- a number of techniques may be used to extract a header 420 for a webpage. For example, text that is near the top of the webpage or text that is formatted to be prominently presented, such as header text in a hypertext markup language (HTML) document, may be selected as a header 420 for the webpage.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Sub-pages 430 /titles 435 may include sub-pages and titles that are determined to be relevant to the webpage. As previously mentioned, sub-pages 430 , for a webpage, may be determined based on a link analysis of the webpage. In some implementations, each sub-page 430 may correspond to a webpage that is determined to be a potential shortcut link for a parent webpage. A shortcut link, as described previously, may include links, presented as part of search results, that may be used to present a user with shortcuts to other webpages. Titles 435 may include descriptive text, which may be determined based on text or other information associated with sub-pages 430 .
- Titles 435 may be chosen as relatively short, e.g., less than 30 or 40 characters, descriptors for a webpage.
- each title 435 may correspond to the header 420 of the sub-page 430 . That is, each sub-page 430 may also be an indexed webpage that may, thus, have a corresponding header 420 that may be used as the title 435 for the sub-page 430 .
- Not all webpages may be associated with sub-pages.
- only top-level webpages of a website may be candidates for shortcut links and/or sub-pages.
- only the homepage and webpages within a particular number of links of the homepage may be a shortcut link/sub-page candidate.
- additional factors such as a quality score, for example, a query-independent quality score, associated with a webpage or user traffic to the webpage, may be considered when determining whether a webpage is a shortcut link and/or sub-page candidate.
- only webpages with quality scores or user traffic to the webpages satisfying a particular threshold may be used as shortcut link and/or sub-page candidates.
- Synthesized snippet 440 may include descriptive text that is based on the sub-pages 430 /titles 435 of the webpage. The descriptive text may be generated based on the titles in sub-pages 430 /titles 435 .
- synthesized snippet 440 may be dynamically generated in response to a search query. In this situation, synthesized snippet 440 may not necessarily be stored ahead of time (e.g., prior to receiving the search query). In some implementations, synthesized snippets 440 may be generated and stored ahead of time. The creation and usage of synthesized snippet 440 will be described in more detail below.
- the information shown in FIG. 4 for each of a number of webpages, provides one example of fields that may be stored or generated for a webpage. In some implementations, fewer or additional fields may be generated or stored. For example, scores used to represent the quality of a webpage or sub-page may additionally be generated and stored.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for generating a synthesized snippet.
- Process 500 may be performed by, for example, search server 210 and/or document indexing server 220 .
- Process 500 includes determining the sub-pages for a webpage (block 510 ).
- the sub-pages may be determined automatically based on analysis of the link structure of the webpage or a website containing the webpage. For example, webpages, that are directly or indirectly linked to by a first webpage and that are part of the same website as the first webpage, may be determined to be sub-pages. As another example, webpages, that are part of the same website as the first webpage and that are below the first webpage in a website hierarchy, as determined by the URLs of the webpages, may be candidates to be sub-pages. As another example, webmasters may be given the ability to indicate which webpages should be classified as sub-pages.
- the sub-pages may be defined as different sections within the webpage.
- the webpage may include prominent section headings but may not necessarily include internal links. In this situation, the section headings may be used to determine the sub-pages within the webpage.
- a search server 210 may, for some search result documents, provide shortcut links as part of one or more of the search results in the search result documents. Webpages that are selected as possible shortcut links may also be used as sub-pages for purposes of determining synthesized snippets. In this case, the processing done to determine the potential shortcut links may be leveraged for the determination of the subpages for the webpage.
- Process 500 further includes determining titles for the sub-pages (block 520 ), for example, as described above with respect to FIG. 4 .
- Process 500 further includes selecting sub-pages to use for the synthesized snippet (block 530 ).
- the sub-pages may be selected from the set of sub-pages determined in block 510 .
- the sub-pages may be selected based on parameters associated with the sub-pages, such as quality scores associated with the sub-pages. For example, a particular quantity of the sub-pages with the highest quality scores may be selected.
- the sub-pages may be selected as sub-pages that are associated with quality scores above a particular threshold.
- titles of the sub-pages may be used in selecting sub-pages.
- the sub-page may not be selected even if the quality score is high.
- the quantity of sub-pages to be selected may be determined based on a desired length of the synthesized snippet.
- Process 500 further includes generating a synthesized snippet based on the titles of the selected sub-pages (block 540 ).
- the titles, corresponding to the selected sub-pages may be concatenated to generate the synthesized snippet.
- the sub-pages may be ranked, for example, based on their quality scores or user traffic, and the titles for the sub-pages are concatenated according to the order of the sub-pages.
- other techniques may be used to generate a synthesized snippet based on the selected sub-pages.
- One particular example of a technique that may be used to implement blocks 530 and 540 will be described next.
- a title may be selected when the corresponding sub-page satisfies the criteria: (1) the sub-page is directly linked to by the webpage; (2) a quality score of the corresponding sub-page is greater than a first threshold; (3) the sub-page has a title length less than a second threshold, e.g., 20 or 30 characters; (4) the title of the sub-page does not contain certain characters such as commas, dashes, or periods; and (5) the length of the title, when added to the total length of the previously selected titles, results in a total length less than a third threshold. Criteria (1)-(5) represent one example of a technique that can be used to generate a synthesized snippet.
- criteria (1)-(5) can be omitted or modified.
- criteria (3) may be helpful but not strictly necessary.
- the title may be truncated if the other criteria indicate that the title for the sub-page should be selected.
- a sub-page may additionally be connected to the webpage through breadcrumb links or string analysis of URLs.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram conceptually illustrating generation of a synthesized snippet by concatenating the titles of a number of sub-pages.
- three sub-pages labeled as sub-pages 610 , 620 , and 630 , are selected to be used to generate synthesized snippet 640 .
- Sub-page 610 is associated with the title “Books”
- sub-page 620 is associated with the title “Movies & TV”
- sub-page 630 is associated with the title “Clothing”
- Synthesized snippet 640 may include a concatenation of the three titles: “Books-Movies & TV-Clothing.”
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an example process 700 for using synthesized snippets in search results that include shortcut links.
- Process 700 may be performed by, for example, search server 210 .
- Process 700 includes receiving a search query (block 710 ).
- the search query may be received from a client 205 , and may be, for example, a search query relating to a general web search, a news search, an image search, or another type of search.
- Process 700 further includes identifying webpages, responsive to the search query, as search results (block 720 ).
- the webpages may be identified by a search engine using a search algorithm.
- the webpages may be documents that are determined to be relevant to the search query.
- Process 700 further includes, for each webpage included in the search results, determining whether to provide shortcut links for the webpage with the search results (block 730 ).
- shortcut links may only be provided for certain webpages included in the search results. For example, shortcut links may only be provided if the webpage is determined to be a highly relevant search result, such as a top search result that is determined to likely be the webpage to which the user intends to navigate. Alternatively or additionally, shortcut links may only be provided for webpages that are determined to have a quality score above a particular threshold or that have a relevance score, that measures the relevance of the webpage to the search query, above a particular threshold.
- Process 700 further includes determining a normal snippet and a synthesized snippet for each shortcut link that is to be presented as part of the search results (block 740 ).
- a normal snippet may include a snippet that is based on text extracted from the webpage that is being described by the snippet.
- the normal snippet may include at least some of the terms of the search query.
- the synthesized snippet may include a snippet that was generated using a process, such as process 500 ( FIG. 5 ).
- Process 700 further includes, for each shortcut link, determining whether to use the normal snippet or the synthesized snippet when providing the shortcut link (block 750 ).
- scores relating the relevance of the normal snippet to the shortcut link webpage and the synthesized snippet to the shortcut link webpage may be calculated, and the synthesized snippet may be provided when the score of the synthesized snippet is greater than the score of the normal snippet.
- the score of the synthesized snippet may be based on, for example, a number of sub-pages included in the text of the synthesized snippet, the number of candidate sub-pages that could have been used to generate the text of the synthesized snippet, the length of the synthesized snippet, and/or quality scores associated with the sub-pages that were used to form the synthesized snippet.
- the quality scores, associated with the sub-pages that were used to form the synthesized snippet may be combined to obtain the score of the synthesized snippet.
- the score relating the relevance of the normal snippet to the shortcut link webpage may be determined based on, for example, the estimated importance of the terms in the normal snippet in the shortcut link webpage, or other factors.
- the type of the normal snippet may be relevant to the determination of whether to provide the normal snippet or the synthesized snippet.
- the text of some normal snippets may be based on meta-descriptions that are explicitly indicated by a designer of the webpage. These snippets may be considered to be snippets of type “meta” while other normal snippets, such as snippets generated automatically from text of the corresponding webpage may be considered to be a different type of snippet.
- the type of the snippet may be stored.
- snippets based on meta-descriptions may be selected over a synthesized snippet. Additional checks to determine the quality or relevance of the snippet may be performed before selecting the snippet.
- Process 700 further includes generating a search result document, including the determined shortcut links and the normal and/or synthesized snippets (block 760 ).
- Search server 210 may include links, to the relevant webpages, in the search result document, which may be, for example, an HTML document.
- the search result document may include other information, such as the determined shortcut links, and, for each of the determined shortcut links, a normal and/or synthesized snippet.
- Process 700 further includes transmitting the search result document to the client, such as a client 205 (block 770 ).
- Client 205 in response to receiving the search result document, may provide the search result document to the user.
- a web browser executing at client 205 may render the search result document in a user interface at client 205 .
