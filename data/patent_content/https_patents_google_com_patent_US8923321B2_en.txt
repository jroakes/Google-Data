- the base station controller 109 groups mobile stations 101 into one or more groups for scheduling purposes.
- the mobile stations 101 may be grouped based on radio channel conditions associated with the mobile stations, for example, channel quality information reported by the mobile stations, Doppler reported by the mobile stations, distance from the serving cell, etc.
- the mobile stations 101 may be grouped based on one or more mobile station operating characteristics other than participation in a common communication session. Exemplary mobile station operating characteristics include power headroom of the mobile stations, macro diversity considerations, mobile station capability, service of the mobile station, codec rate, etc. Further, mobile stations with an active VoIP session may be grouped together.
- the base station controller 109 may assign multiple mobile stations to the same group position. For example, all mobile stations participating in the same group call may be assigned to the same group position. Similarly, all mobile stations registered for a particular broadcast/multicast session may be assigned to the same group position. In this way, the base station indicates the presence or absence of a group call or a broadcast/multicast session to several mobile stations using a single bit in the shared control channel, thereby reducing group overhead.
- a mobile station may be assigned more than one group position within the same group. For example, the base station may assign a mobile station one group position for broadcast/multicast and another group position for VoIP.

- FIG. 4 shows an exemplary set of shared resources.
- the shared resources 410 are two frames (one long frame) and eight DRCHs. If a block is defined as one frame in the time domain and one DRCH in the frequency domain, then there are 16 blocks or resources, numbered 1 through 16 .
- a DRCHs is a group of non-contiguous subcarriers, so the DRCH Index which is the vertical axis of FIG. 4 , is a logical representation of the frequency domain.
- each mobile station determines its portion of the shared resource, based on the assignments for other mobile stations. Therefore, it is necessary to define the order in which the resources are to be allocated.
- FIG. 4 an illustrative ordering pattern 420 is given which results in the blocks being numbered 1 through 16 as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the set of shared resources may be repeatedly used in an interlace pattern as described with respect to FIG. 3 .
- the 16 resources may be repeatedly used in each long frame of interlace pattern 0 in FIG. 3 .
- the 16 resources illustrated by FIG. 4 are logical representations of a set of sub-carriers in the frequency domain in a frame. It is to be understood that the exact physical location of these sub-carriers may change from frame to frame.
- An indication of the set of shared resources and the ordering pattern may be signaled from the base station 103 to the mobile stations 101 using a control channel. Further, the control channel may be transmitted in any frame with a pre-defined relationship with the beginning frame of the set of shared resources.
- the set of shared resources may begin in the same frame the control channel is transmitted, may have a fixed starting point relative to the frame that the control channel is transmitted, or may be explicitly signaled in the control channel.
- the base station 103 After the mobile stations are grouped, assigned a position (also called location) within the group, and a set of shared resources is assigned to the group, the base station 103 must indicate which mobile stations are active in a given time period, and, in some embodiments, the number of assigned resources assigned to each mobile station.
- FIG. 5 a illustrates how resource assignments may be indicated to mobile stations 101 .
- a first message field mobile station assignments 510 , indicates which mobile stations are assigned at least one of the shared resources in the corresponding set of group shared resources.
- a mobile station resource allocation field 530 may indicate specific resources, and/or the number of resources assigned to each mobile station.
- a failure handling field 540 may also be included as will be described further below.
- FIG. 5 b show an example with further details of how the message of FIG. 5 a may convey information using bit mapping.
- FIG. 5 b represents an information element 501 which as discussed above, may be sent to the mobile station over a control channel.
- the information element 501 may be sent using a shared control channel.
- the information element 501 may comprise a number of octets as shown, and may vary in size depending on, for example, the number of mobile stations in a group, sharing the control channel. Therefore, the information element 501 may be any appropriate size for conveying the necessary information to the mobile station group.
- the mobile station assignments 510 may comprise a number of bitmap fields, for example Bits 001 through bit 008 of octet 17 , item 509 , as shown in FIG. 5 b .
- the position of any mobile station within its group may corresponds to its bitmap position.
- the mobile station assigned the first group position, “position 1 ” may determine if it is assigned one of the shared resources using bitmap position 001 .
- the mobile station positions are indicted by mobile station group ordering field 511 .
- the first mobile station position in the example of FIG. 5 b would correspond to Bit 005 , which is the first position of the mobile station group ordering field 511 .
- the mobile station assigned group position 2 may determine if it is assigned one of the shared resources using second position of the mobile station group ordering field 511 , etc.
- a bitmap filed may comprise one or more bits, and that a group of bits may be used for any designation or indication.
- an active user indication may be provided by using either a binary “0” or a “1”, where inactive users are indicated using the opposite state, or some other appropriate binary values may be used.
- active mobile stations may be indicated using a binary “1” in an appropriate corresponding position of the assignment bitmap 510 which is contained in the information element 501 .
- Some embodiments may include a single bit located at the logical beginning, or any other appropriate location or field, of the assignment bitmap 510 , denoted the “ordering pattern invert field” 515 .
- the binary value of a bit such as Bit 001 , may indicate whether to follow a specifically designated ordering pattern in ascending or descending order.
- a binary ‘0’ may indicate that the mobile stations should use a first designated ordering pattern in ascending order (not inverted)
- a binary ‘1’ may indicate that the ordering pattern should be inverted, that is, in descending order.
- the base station 103 may indicate the ordering pattern to be used by the mobile station 101 group via ordering pattern field 513 of the assignment bitmap 510 . Therefore the base station 103 may indicate the desired ordering pattern during each scheduling instance. Further, the ordering pattern may be established at call setup and not signaled as part of the mobile station assignments 510 .
- Bit 002 , 003 and 004 may form the ordering pattern field 513 for designating the appropriate ordering pattern
- Bit 001 may form an ordering patter invert field 515 for indicating whether the ordering pattern is in ascending or descending order.
- the allocation sizes field 530 indicates radio resource assignment weighting information, and may also indicate a proportion of radio resources assigned, to the mobile stations.
- the radio resource assignment weighting information may also indicate a specified number or size of radio resources assigned to each mobile station.
- the radio resource assignment weighting information may also include vocoder rate, modulation, or coding information. If there is only one possible weighting value, the allocation sizes field 530 may be omitted.
- the information element 501 which contains the mobile station assignments field 510 and, if used, the allocation sizes field 530 as discussed above, are sent to the mobile station group over the shared control channel. Also as discussed above the mobile station group also shares a set of time-frequency resources.
- the shared control channel is typically transmitted by the base station 103 in each long frame for assigning resources within the long frame, although it is understood that the shared control channel could be transmitted by the base station 103 in any preceding long frame.
- the information element 501 may also include a failure handling field 540 which may comprise any appropriate number of bits and which will be described in further detail below.
- the assignments field 510 may be subdivided into two fields, for example, a broadcast/multicast/group field and a unicast field.
- a broadcast/multicast/group field For unicast, a single mobile station is assigned to a group position, while for group, multicast, and broadcast, more than one mobile station may be assigned to a group position as previously discussed.
- the interlace patterns for broadcast, multicast, group calls and unicast calls may have different durations and utilize various modulation and coding schemes.
- the assignments field may only include unicast mobile stations, thereby eliminating the broadcast/multicast/group field.
- the assignments field may only include a broadcast/multicast/group field, thereby eliminating unicast mobile stations.
- the broadcast/multicast/group field may be encoded independently from the unicast field. In this case, the broadcast/multicast/group field would have one allocation sizes fields 530 , while the unicast field would have a different allocation sizes field 530 .
- the assigned group position can be the same in multiple sectors thereby allowing the transmissions from multiple base stations to combine over the air. Further, it is advantageous to have these group positions occur at the beginning of the terminal assignments field, thereby allowing the same resource to be allocated in multiple sectors by the base stations.
- FIG. 6 provides further details of mobile station assignments and ordering pattern assignment.
- the allocation sizes field 530 is not used.
- mobile stations are assigned to a group 630 and are assigned group positions 1 through 7 , which correspond to bitmap positions 1 through 7 in the mobile station assignments field 650 .
- mobile station 3 (MS 3 ) is assigned bitmap position 1
- mobile station 6 (MS 6 ) is assigned bitmap position 2 , etc.
- the base station 103 In addition to position information, the base station 103 also indicates the set of shared resources 610 and an ordering pattern 670 indicative of the order in which the resources are allocated.
- the mobile station assignment field will also provide indication of active mobile stations in each long frame with, for example, a binary “1.”
- the mobile station assignments field is transmitted on a shared control channel every long frame. Based on the mobile station assignments field, the Nth active mobile station in each long frame is assigned the Nth resource. Referring to FIG. 6 , MS 3 is assigned the first resource, because for example it is the first mobile station with a “1” in the mobile station assignments field. MS 7 is the second mobile station with a “1” in the mobile station assignments field, thus MS 7 is assigned the second resource. Similarly, MS 10 is assigned the third resource, and MS 13 is assigned the fourth resource.
- FIG. 7 provides an illustrative example of mobile station assignments and ordering pattern assignment in accordance with the various embodiments.
- failure handling data traffic channels are utilized for mobile stations that are not able to reliably decode the shared control channel.
- MS 3 , MS 1 , MS 37 , MS 12 , MS 75 , MS 15 , MS 29 , MS 134 , MS 45 , and MS 59 are assigned to mobile station group 730 and are assigned positions 1 through 10 within the group, respectively.
- the mobile station group 730 is assigned a set of 6 shared resources 710 denoted as the assigned data traffic channels 710 and an ordering pattern 770 . Further, the group 730 is assigned two shared resources denoted as failure handling data traffic channels, which are the last two resources of the set of shared resources 710 . Finally, the group is assigned a failure handling ordering pattern 790 indicative of which order the failure handling data traffic channels are to be allocated.
- MS 1 and MS 45 may send a negative-acknowledgement of the shared control channel (SCCH-NAK) message to the base station 103 in a previous long frame, thereby informing the base station 103 of their failure to reliably decode the shared control channel.
- SCCH-NAK shared control channel
- the base station 103 will assign MS 1 to the first failure handling data traffic channel and MS 45 to the second failure handling data traffic channel according to the failure handling ordering pattern 790 .
- the remaining mobile stations are then allocated the remaining data traffic channels 710 . Note that if only one mobile station has sent an SCCH-NAK message, then the remaining failure handling data traffic channel may be used by the base station 103 as an assigned data traffic channel.
- the base station 103 may assign data traffic channels one through four, using the mobile station assignments field 750 , to MS 3 , MS 37 , MS 75 , and MS 15 , respectively as shown in 710 .
- Each mobile station with the exception of MS 1 and MS 45 , will attempt to decode the shared control channel to find the mobile station assignments field 750 .
- MS 1 and MS 45 having failed to receive or otherwise decode the shared control channel, will perform blind detection on the set of two failure handling data traffic channels, beginning with the first failure handling data traffic channel according to the failure handling ordering pattern 790 as described previously.
- the mobile station assignments field 750 will indicate that MS 1 and MS 45 are inactive, that is, a binary ‘0’ may be present in their respective mobile station assignment positions of the bitmap field.
- the failure handling assignments of MS 1 and MS 45 are persistent allocations.
- a persistent allocation means that the same mobile station will be assigned the same failure handling data traffic channel until a timer elapses, a call burst is completed, the packet is acknowledged, the base station 103 assigns the channel to another mobile station, or until the channel conditions change at the mobile station such that it may reliably decode the shared control channel.
- the shared control channel may include the failure handling field 540 , in addition to the mobile station assignments field 510 and the optional allocation sizes field 530 .
- the failure handling field 540 informs the mobile stations of which failure handling data traffic channels are in use.
- the failure handling field 540 is a bitmap wherein each bit of the bitmap may corresponds to one of the failure handling data traffic channels. If the failure handling data traffic channels are a subset of the assigned data traffic channels, then each bit of the bitmap may further corresponds to one of the assigned data traffic channels. Note that the failure handling field 540 may be encoded together with the mobile station assignments 510 and allocation sizes 530 fields, or may be encoded independently.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary allocation policy of the various embodiments that uses the failure handling bitmap field 540 .
- FIG. 8 assumes a moment in time subsequent to the example shown in FIG. 7 , that is, a snapshot of long frame number 3 wherein the scenario depicted in FIG. 7 was a snapshot of long frame number 0 .
- MS 1 which was unable to decode the shared control channel in FIG. 7 has subsequently succeeded and acknowledged its transmission, while MS 45 did not acknowledge its transmission after long frame 0 .
- the base station 103 will continue transmitting data to MS 45 on the second failure handling data traffic channel. Further, the base station 103 would like to free the first failure handling data traffic channel for use as an assigned data traffic channel. To accomplish this, the base station 103 sends a failure handling field 540 , where the failure handling field 540 is a length two bitmap, where the first bit of the bitmap corresponds to the first failure handling data traffic channel (the sixth assignable data traffic channel), and the second bit of the bitmap corresponds to the second data traffic channel (the fifth assignable data traffic channel).
- the base station 103 may populate the two-bit field, for example Bit 113 and 114 of FIG. 5 b , with “01,” wherein the binary “0” represents the available channel and the binary “1” represents the occupied channel.
- the mobile stations receiving the shared control channel may determine which of the failure handling data traffic channels are in use during each long frame.
- the base station 103 assigns MS 12 , MS 75 , MS 15 , MS 134 , and MS 59 to one of the shared resources.
- MS 12 , MS 75 , MS 15 , MS 134 determine their assigned resources via the mobile station assignment field 510 of the shared control channel.
- MS 59 also uses the failure handling blocks field to determine that the fifth data traffic channel is taken, and therefore determines that it is assigned the sixth data traffic channel.
- MS 45 continues to perform blind detection on failure handling data traffic channels 1 and 2 .
- the processing at the mobile station associated with blind detection may not be desirable under some circumstances. Therefore, in some embodiments, upon the base station 103 determining that a mobile station is not able to reliably decode the shared control channel, it transmits a failure handling control channel to the mobile station, where the failure handling control channel has a greater reliability than the shared control channel.
- the failure handling control channel may contain information for multiple mobile stations or may contain information for only the intended mobile station.
- the failure handling control channel information may include an indication of the assigned data traffic channel, or an indication of the failure handling data traffic channel, and an indication of the target mobile station. This assignment may be for one long frame or may be a persistent allocation as described previously. For example, referring again to FIG.
- the BTS would have assigned MS 1 to failure handling data channel 1 and MS 45 to failure handling data channel 2 through explicit signaling, thereby eliminating any blind detection.
- the failure handling control channel contains persistent assignments, the same mobile station will be assigned the same failure handling data traffic channel until a timer elapses, a call burst is completed, the packet is acknowledged, the base station 103 assigns the channel to another mobile station, or until the channel conditions change at the mobile station such that it may reliably decode the shared control channel.
- QoS quality of service
- persistent assignments are not used, but rather a failure handling shared control channel is used to control the mobile stations occupying the failure handling data traffic channels as a group or sub-group of the primary mobile station grouping.
- the failure handling shared control channel may also contain a mobile station assignments field, where each mobile station corresponds to a bit in the mobile station assignments field for example. Therefore, this embodiment may be considered as creating two mobile station groups, a primary group and a failure handling group.
- the failure handling shared control channel may be used by the primary group to determine the number of failure handling data traffic channels that are in use, while the failure handling group may use it to determine when the bases station 103 is sending packets to each group member.
- the failure handling control channel is encoded in such a way as to have a greater reliability than the shared control channel.
- the need of the primary group to decode the failure handling shared control channel may be eliminated by indicating the number of failure handling blocks that are being used by the failure handling group as part of the shared control channel.
- more than two groups may also be created in some embodiments. For example, mobile stations may be grouped according to various reported parameters or mobile station capabilities as was discussed above with respect to overall mobile station grouping.

- applications 1009 may comprise a software stack that communicates with a stack in the base station. Therefore, applications 1009 may comprise failure handling component 1019 for providing the capabilities of using the failure handling data traffic channels as described in detail above.
- FIG. 11 summarizes operation of a base station in accordance with the various embodiments.
- a group of mobile stations is formed as was discussed previously by for example, reported parameters, radio conditions, mobile station capabilities, physical location, or any other appropriate criteria.
- the base station in 1103 sends the shared control channel information, such as the bitmapping described with respect to FIGS. 5 a and 5 b , to the group of mobile stations.
- the base station must ensure that a majority of the mobile stations in the group may receive and/or reliably decode the shared control channel. This is necessary, because as was described above, a mobile station will determine its assigned resource via bitmap fields of the shared control channel.
- the base station may determine the shared control channel reception capability for a particular mobile station based on channel quality indications (CQI), power control indications, an explicit failure message, etc., sent from the mobile station to the base station.
- CQI channel quality indications
- the explicit failure message from the mobile station may be a shared control channel negative acknowledgment (SCCH-NAK) as was described above.
- the explicit failure message from the mobile station may be a data channel negative acknowledgment.
- the base station may allocate more or less system resources to the shared control channel, such as, but not limited to, power, OFDM symbols, OFDM subcarriers, or the like. For example, if the base station has not received any SCCH-NAK message for some period of time, it may allocate less power to the shared control channel. Alternatively, if the base station receives numerous SCCH-NAK messages, it may allocate more subcarriers to the shared control channel.
- the base station may increase the amount of system resources for the shared control channel as previously described, or it may determine that it benefits the system more to control the particular mobile station using alternate techniques.
- the base station upon determining that a particular mobile station is not able to receive or otherwise reliably decode the shared control channel, assigns the mobile station to one of a set of failure handling data traffic channels as in 1107 .
- the set of failure handling data traffic channels and the order in which they are allocated are known in advance, a priori, by the mobile station.
- the failure handling data traffic channels may be a subset of the assigned data traffic channels as was discussed previously.
- the failure handling data traffic channels may have a different transmission capability than the assigned data traffic channels.
- the failure handling data traffic channels may be allocated more OFDM symbols, more OFDM subcarriers, or more power.
- the mobile station will attempt to decode each data traffic channel sequentially during the next transmission instance until successful.
- the mobile station is aware of N failure handling channels as in 1203 .
- the base station can indicate that an explicit failure handling data traffic channel is assigned to a particular mobile station using a failure handling shared control channel.
- the mobile station will attempt to decode the failure handling data traffic channels indicated on the failure handling shared control channel.
- the mobile station obtains its resource allocation via the shared control channel as in 1205 .
- the mobile station in 1207 will attempt to decode the first failure handling data traffic channel. If the mobile station is able to decode the first failure handling data traffic channel in 1209 , it sends an acknowledgement to the base station and no further processing is needed. The mobile station may receive data over the failure handling channel as in 1211 .
- the process is repeated for all N of the failure handling data traffic channels as shown in 1213 and 1215 . If the mobile station is unable to decode a packet on any of the failure handling data traffic channels, it sends a negative acknowledgement to the base station in 1217 .
- the data may be scrambled with a scrambling code that is uniquely associated with the targeted mobile station.
- the base station may simply send a binary “0” in the bitmap position corresponding to the mobile station in the mobile station assignments field.
- the mobile station transitions back to monitoring the shared control channel after some known period of time, for example the duration of one superframe, therefore making it desirable to maintain the bitmap position in the shared control channel for that mobile station.
- the base station reassigns the bitmap position for a mobile station that is not able to reliably decode the shared control channel to a different mobile station.
- the mobile station Once a mobile station is assigned to a particular failure handling data traffic channel, the mobile station will typically maintain the same failure handling data traffic channel. This type of assignment is denoted a persistent allocation as was described previously above.
- the base station may assign the mobile station to a failure handling data traffic channel persistently as in 1107 , and send data thereby as in 1109 .
- the base station may then proceed with the shared control channel information, for example in next superframe, as in 1111 and send data to the remaining mobile stations of the group using the assigned traffic channels.
- the size of the shared control channel may be reduced by excluding bits within the mobile station allocations field during the Nth HARQ transmission for a particular set of mobile stations, where N is an integer and is typically the last HARQ transmission in a series of HARQ transmissions.
- N is an integer and is typically the last HARQ transmission in a series of HARQ transmissions.
- FIG. 13 is a flow chart showing basic operation of a mobile station in receiving the shared control channel information.
- the mobile station receives an assignments field, an optional allocation sizes field, and an optional failure handling field.
- the mobile station determines assigned prior resources and utilizing this information and allocation sizes, as well as the failure handling field, determines its own appropriate resources to utilize based on the ordering pattern and failure handling ordering pattern as in 1305 .
