The semantic interpretation of association is estimated.For example, each semantic interpretation being capable of ranked or checking.By this way, initial search
The different semantic interpretations of inquiry can be compared with each other.In some cases, can compare to select initial search based on described
The semantic interpretation of inquiry.
Following advantage can at least be provided according to the technology of the disclosure.Different semantic solutions are assessed using Search Results
Release, the clicking rate data that utilized when Search Results are produced, other data sources specific to the data etc. of user are able to
Consideration is included in the case where additional analysis need not be performed.Additionally, being commented by the different semantic interpretations to inquiring about
Estimate, can thus alleviate any ambiguity in inquiry for recognized Search Results for the inquiry prediction user view
The impact of quality.
Fig. 1 depicts the example system 100 for being estimated to the semantic interpretation of search inquiry.System 100 includes base
The search engine 106 of Search Results is obtained in inquiry.In some embodiments, system 100 can also include back-end system
108, which can be crawled, indexed and/or be annotated to Internet resources 120.Back-end system 108 can include crawling module 118
With index 116.Back-end system 108 can also include explaining evaluator 110 which can receive semantic interpretation 112 and its be associated
Standardization inquiry 114.
In operation, search engine 106 can receive initial search query from user 102 by network 104.Search engine
106 can provide to back-end system 108 initial search query so as to obtain the Search Results of the initial search query
Set.Explain that evaluator 110 can receive the semanteme that the initial search query and determination are associated with the search inquiry
Explain 112 set.Each semantic interpretation 112 with represent that will be used for obtaining the information that is associated with the semantic interpretation is looked into
The standardization inquiry 114 of inquiry.Explain that evaluator 110 subsequently can produce modified inquiry for each semantic interpretation 112, often
The standardization inquiry 114 that individual modified inquiry is explained based on the search inquiry and for the certain semantic.Explanation is commented
Estimate device 110 subsequently can for the search inquiry and each it is modified inquiry obtain Search Results, and can based on
The similarity of the associated Search Results of corresponding modified inquiry and the Search Results being associated with initial search query
Degree and each semantic interpretation 112 is estimated.In this case, each semantic interpretation 112 can be with multiple specifications
Change inquiry to be associated, each standardization inquiry represents and can be used for obtaining the different of the information associated from the semantic interpretation
Inquiry.In this case, each standardization inquiry individually can be assessed, and for example, as described below, such as pass through
Individually modified inquiry is produced for each standardization inquiry.
As shown, user 102 is communicated with search engine 106 by network 104.In some cases, user
102 can interact with computing device to submit the people of search inquiry to, and for example, which is such as by search inquiry is typed into
Web browser.User 102 can also be the software or hardware mistake that search engine 106 is accessed by application programming interface (API)
Journey.User 102 can be communicated with search engine 106 by network 104, and above-mentioned network 104 can for example include the Internet, local
Net (LAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private net (VPN), WiFi network, cellular phone network, or other networks or net
The combination of network.
Search engine 106 can be operable to by the server or server set of the reception search inquiry of network 104
Close.In some cases, search engine 106 can be the web communicated with user 102 using one or more procotol
Server, above-mentioned procotol include but is not limited to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTTP), file transfer protocol (FTP) (FTP), long-range
The invocation of procedure (RPC) or other agreements.Search engine 106 can also be included for being distributed request to the group of different server
Part, such as load balancer (not shown).
In some cases, search engine 106 can receive search inquiry and determine how from user 102 and look into described
Inquiry is processed.In some instances, search engine 106 can carry out pretreatment to inquiry, and the pretreatment includes removing sky
In vain, correct the conversion between cacography, language, speech polling is translated to text, and/or query structure is turned to into particular bin
Formula.The search inquiry is committed to back-end system 108 to obtain the search being associated with the search inquiry by search engine 106
As a result.
System 100 also includes back-end system 108.Back-end system 108 can be crawled across one or more systems or network, rope
Draw and/or annotate resource 120 (for example, webpage).Back-end system 108 can include crawling engine 118, and the latter is carried out to the Internet
Crawl and for example the resource encountered in crawling is indexed.In some embodiments, crawl module 118 and access link
To the first resource of one or more of the other resource.Crawl module 118 to load the first resource and deposit its text
In index 116, the latter is the data base of the information for including relevant with crawled resource 120 and its content (such as text) for storage,
Described information is associated with resource 120.Once crawl module 118 by the information Store relevant with first resource index 116 in,
Which subsequently can just load from first resource other resources 120 and the repetition Index process for being linked.By visiting repeatedly
The resource 120 for being linked is asked and is indexed from other resources, and crawling that module 118 can capture and index can be by crawling module 118
The substantial portions of the resource 120 for being accessed.Crawl module 118 even before system 100 receives inquiry or to search
Index holds up the 106 submissions inquiry to crawl before obtaining Search Results and index resource 120.Search engine 106 is then able to
Search Results are obtained by searching for index 116 rather than directly searching resource 120.
The inquiry that back-end system 108 is committed to by search engine 106 can be explained 110 received and processed of evaluator.
Explain that evaluator 110 can be estimated to the search inquiry that received so that it is determined that be associated with the search inquiry one
Or multiple semantic interpretations 112.Each semantic interpretation 112 can represent that one be associated with the search inquiry may be intended to.
As search inquiry there may be ambiguity, it is possible to identify multiple semantic interpretations 112.For example, in search inquiry " how
(how long Harry Potter has long is harry potter) " in, there is discrimination in lexical item " harry potter (Harry Potter) "
Justice, because they may refer to one or more particular topics, seven in such as Harry Potter (Harry Potter) royalty right
Any one in this book, any cinematographic adaptation of these books, or be associated with Harry Potter's royalty right itinerary, master
Topic park, audio books, cartoon etc..The inquiry is likely to refer to Harry Potter this role itself.Wanted according to user
Which theme is referred in inquiry, different explanations can be applied or using several different explanations.Therefore, if described look into
Inquiry refers to a book, then user may wish to number of words or the number of pages for knowing this this book.On the other hand, if the inquiry refers to electricity
One in shadow, then it is interested be probably film duration.Or, if " harry potter " refers to the imaginary angle
Color, then length may refer to its height.Each in these is the possible semantic interpretation of the inquiry.By this way,
Explain that evaluator 110 can be directed to ad hoc inquiry and determine semantic interpretation 112.
In some embodiments, each that can be directed in semantic interpretation 112 determines confidence, and which represents phase
The likelihood ratio that the explanation of association is matched with the user view of ad hoc inquiry.Confidence threshold value can also be defined indicate will to
User 102 considers min confidence fraction necessary to semantic interpretation 112 when returning Search Results.For example, the confidence level threshold
Value can be specified and just should returned search for semantic interpretation 112 of the particular search query with the confidence more than 90
It is contemplated when as a result.Explain that evaluator 110 can also determine using confidence which semantic interpretation 112 is referred to
Ad hoc inquiry is tasked, for example, such as by assigning the semantic interpretation with highest confidence.In some cases, confidence
Degree fraction can be digital value in numerical range, the centrifugal pump in numerical value set or be another type of instruction
Symbol.
Each semantic interpretation 112 is associated with standardization inquiry 114.Standardization inquiry 114 can be passed on and specific language
Justice explains the inquiry of associated user view.In some cases, standardization inquiry 114 can be used to from original spy
Determine the structure or template of the modified search inquiry of query generation.Standardization inquiry 114 can be with the information phase in ad hoc inquiry
With reference to and generate modified search inquiry.In some embodiments, standardization inquiry 114 is with unfinished portion
String, above-mentioned unfinished portion can be completed using the substring of ad hoc inquiry.For example, standardization inquiry 114 can be such as
“how many pages is the book<NAME OF BOOK ENTITY>(book《The title of book entity》How many page) "
Inquiry is not completed.Modified search inquiry can be generated from standardization inquiry 114 using the part of ad hoc inquiry.Example
Such as, previous standardization inquiry and ad hoc inquiry " how long is harry potter " are given, can be generated modified
Search inquiry " how many pages is the book harry potter (how many page of book Harry Potter) ".One
In the case of a little, explain that for certain semantic generating modified search inquiry includes lattice again being carried out to the particular search query
Formula is matched with the standardization inquiry with the semantic interpretation.For example, inquiry " how long is the book are given
Harry potter " can be reformatted as " how long is the harry potter book (and Harry Potter this
How long this book has) " so as to standardization inquiry " how many pages is the book<NAME OF BOOK ENTITY>”
Match.
In some embodiments, generating modified search inquiry for semantic interpretation includes looking into the specific search
The substring of identification special entity included in inquiry replaces with identification for institute in the standardization search inquiry of the semantic interpretation
Including special entity alternative substring.For example, ad hoc inquiry " how long is harry potter " may have inquiry
The semantic interpretation of the number of pages in one book.The standardization inquiry being associated with the semantic interpretation can be " how long is
the<NAME OF BOOK ENTITY>book(《The title of book entity》How long this this book has) ".Therefore, in " harry
In the case that potter " is identified as special entity, can be by by the substring " harry in the particular search query
Potter " replace with from it is described standardization search inquiry drawn substring " harry potter book (and Harry Potter this
Book) " and generate modified search inquiry.For example, the modified search inquiry of example can be " how long is the
Harry potter book (Harry Potter this this book how long have) ".In some embodiments, single semantic interpretation 112 can be with
With multiple associated standardization inquiries 114.
In some embodiments, explain that one or more Jing of evaluator 110 for being associated with semantic interpretation 112 are repaiied
The search inquiry that changes and obtain Search Results from index 116.Modified search query results can be used to it is corresponding
The associated semantic interpretation 112 of modified search inquiry is estimated.For example, can be tied based on the search of particular search query
Fruit and the degree of the similarity being associated between the Search Results of modified search inquiry for the semantic interpretation 112,
Each semantic interpretation 112 is estimated.In some embodiments, the degree of the similarity is looked into based on modified search
Ask the common factor size or difference size between result and the result of particular search query.For example, larger common factor can indicate one
The larger likelihood ratio of individual semantic interpretation accurate description user view.Conversely, for example, larger difference then may indicate that a language
Justice explains the 112 accurate expressions for being unlikely to be user view.In some embodiments, the degree of the similarity based on
Frequency and search specific that the associated particular keywords of particular search query occur in modified search query results
Frequency in the Search Results of rope inquiry.For example, larger keyword frequency of occurrences can indicate modified search inquiry more
Correlated results may be returned.In some embodiments, the degree of the similarity is based on by the knot of modified search inquiry
The order of fruit is compared with the order of the Search Results of particular search query.In some cases, such as user's clicking rate, stand
Other data of point business datum etc. can be used to be estimated semantic interpretation 112.These technologies or other technologies can
It is used to be estimated semantic interpretation 112, standardization 114 or modified search inquiries of inquiry.In some cases, it is specific
Semantic interpretation 112, standardization 114 or modified search inquiries of inquiry be that degree based on the similarity is selected.
By this way, semantic interpretation 112, standardization inquiry 114 or modified search inquiries can it is ranked, checking, analysis simultaneously
And be otherwise estimated.In some embodiments, the assessment of semantic interpretation 112 can be used to for specific search
Query generation is returned to the result of user.For example, the result from modified search inquiry can be used to search to specific
Rope Query Result is ranked up.Other embodiment in the range of the disclosure is also possible.
Fig. 2 depicts the schematic diagram of the modified search inquiry 204a-d of example.The modified search inquiry of each example
204a-d is generated from particular search query 202 and for the standardization search inquiry of a semantic interpretation.In Fig. 2
In, example ad hoc inquiry 202 is string " how long is harry potter ".The modified search inquiry 204a of first example
It is " how many pages is the harry potter book (how many page of this this book of Harry Potter) ", and can
It is associated with the semantic interpretation of the length that ad hoc inquiry 202 refers to a book.The modified search inquiry 204b of second example is
" how tall is harry potter (Harry Potter is how high) ", and role can be referred to ad hoc inquiry 202
The semantic interpretation of the height of " Harry Potter " is associated.The modified search inquiry 204c of 3rd example is " how long
Is the harry potter movie (Harry Potter's film how long have) ", and film can be referred to ad hoc inquiry 202
The semantic interpretation of duration is associated.The modified search inquiry 204d of 4th example is " how old is harry potter
(Harry Potter is how old) ", and the semantic solution at the age of role " Harry Potter " can be referred to ad hoc inquiry 202
Release associated.These are the modified search inquiries of example of example particular search query 202；Other modified search inquiries
It is also possible.
