Definitions
- Online content management systems allow content publishers to publish content that promotes the content publisher and/or products/services that the content publisher sells. Customer service representatives may assist content publishers in determining publication opportunities that they may wish to pursue within limited publication budgets. Recommendation systems may be used to assist customer service representatives in marketing online service opportunities, such as online content publication opportunities, to customers interested in such services. Unlike selling more statically defined products where the price has been determined and the opportunities can be directly ranked based on revenue/profit and likelihood of sales success, marketing online services presents unique challenges in attempting to rank and/or classify service opportunities.

- online service opportunities that customers may wish to pursue, such as online content publication opportunities.
- marketing online services presents some unique challenges. For example, it is difficult to accurately estimate and explain the opportunity values associated with some online services based on predicted revenue uplifts and adoption likelihoods. Additionally, it may be challenging to rank and optimize opportunities based on a customer's business requirements and to package the opportunities in a manner that is useful for recommending to the customer as solutions to the customer's business problems.
- a content management system is configured to generate recommendations based on both an estimated likelihood of adoption of a recommended opportunity by the customer and an expected revenue uplift for the customer resulting from a recommendation being adopted.

- the system may be used directly by the customers themselves to explore potential opportunities.
- a final opportunity value may be generated based on the likelihood of adoption, expected revenue uplift, and/or likelihood of marketing estimates and used to rank opportunities.
- the final opportunity value may be defined as (likelihood that customer service representative will pitch opportunity)*(likelihood that customer will adopt opportunity)*(expected revenue/profit uplift for customer if customer adopts opportunity).
- the likelihood of marketing, likelihood of adoption, and/or predicted revenue uplift may be estimated using a logistic regression model, random forest model, or another type of model.
- users may be permitted to specify parameters and/or business requirements to be used in determining recommended opportunities, such as requiring that the customer's expected return on investment (“ROI”) (e.g., click through rate) not be reduced by adopting an opportunity or providing only three recommended opportunities to the customer.
- ROI expected return on investment
- the system may be configured to convert the output signals and/or filters from the statistical predictive models into notes that can be easily interpreted by the users (e.g., by customer service representatives to recommend opportunities to their customers or by the customers themselves to determine which opportunities to pursue).

- content may be ranked based on bids associated with the content.
- a search engine or other resource operator may receive revenue by auctioning a certain set of keywords to auction participants. Auction participants may place auction bids for the ability to include their content on the search result resource, whenever a user searches using a keyword in the set.
- an online manufacturer of golf equipment may participate in an auction for the golf-related set of keywords. If a user searches for the term “golf,” and the manufacturer is determined to be the winner of the auction, content from the manufacturer may appear in the same resource as the search results.
- a provider of a website devoted to a particular topic may also receive revenue by auctioning off the ability to place content with his or her resource (e.g., embedded in a webpage, in a pop-up window, etc.).

- Content management system 108 is configured to provide recommendations to users (e.g., customer service representatives marketing opportunities to customers or directly to the customers themselves) for content publication opportunities that may be of interest to the users.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 300 for providing recommendations for service opportunities according to an illustrative implementation. Referring to both FIGS. 1 and 2 , content management system 108 may receive data relating to one or more opportunities that a customer may be interested in pursuing ( 205 ).
- the opportunities may include increasing a number or amount of bids for displaying content within a particular resource or content publication product, bidding or registering to display content in relation to a resource or content publication product with which the content publisher has not been previously associated or has not been associated for a certain amount of time, or any other service or feature that may be sold to content publishers to generate revenue for an opportunity seller.
- data relating to the opportunities may be stored in an opportunity data portion 114 of database 110 .
- the input data may include one or more of a variety of types of data relating to the customer for whom the analysis is being performed and the opportunities available for the customer to consider.
- the input data may include data received from a user of the system that is used to determine opportunities to analyze. For example, a user may enter an account identifier for the customer being analyzed that system 108 may use to obtain information regarding the content publication services and features that the customer is currently utilizing.
- the account identifier may be used to obtain data such as a current budget, revenue associated with the services currently being utilized, total bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, etc.
- performance statistics e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.
- a wide variety of different input data signals may be utilized to determine opportunity recommendations to present to the user, such as recency and/or frequency of the content provider logging in to system 108 , history of the content provider adopting/using certain products/features of system 108 (e.g., desktop device/content device/conversion reporting, has content extension/sitelink extension/video content/location extension/mobile or tablet/enhanced cost per click/conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, throttled impression shares, bid lost impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.).
- content competitiveness metrics e.g., impression shares, throttled impression shares, bid lost impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.
- Content management system 108 may be configured to generate one or more statistical models based on training data and stored the statistical models in a memory, such as content database 110 . Illustrative processes that may be used to generate the one or more statistical models are described in further detail below (e.g., with respect to FIGS. 3A and 4A ).
- Content management system 108 may be configured to calculate a likelihood of adoption for each of the opportunities being analyzed for the user based on one or more of the statistical models ( 210 ).
- the likelihood of adoption may include a value or score (e.g., a percentage) that represents an estimated likelihood that a customer, if presented with the opportunity, would adopt or move forward with the opportunity.
- At least a portion of the received input data may be processed by a likelihood of adoption model to calculate the likelihood of adoption value.
- the model may be or include a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model configured to estimate the likelihood that the customer will adopt an opportunity.
- the model may utilize various types of input to estimate the likelihood of adoption, such as previous bids/purchases made by the customer, adoption history (e.g., decisions (adoption or rejection) the customer made with respect to previously proposed opportunities), budget, data regarding the products, features, options, etc. that the customer is currently using or has used in the past, and/or other types of inputs that may be relevant to whether the customer is likely to adopt the opportunities being analyzed.
- adoption history e.g., decisions (adoption or rejection) the customer made with respect to previously proposed opportunities
- budget e.g., data regarding the products, features, options, etc. that the customer is currently using or has used in the past
- data regarding the products, features, options, etc. that the customer is currently using or has used in the past
- other types of inputs that may be relevant to whether the customer is likely to adopt the opportunities being analyzed.
- the input may include, for example, one or more of the recency and/or frequency of the content provider logging in to system 108 , history of the content provider adopting/using certain products/features of system 108 (e.g., conversion tracking, content extension, sitelink extension, video content, location extension, mobile or tablet, enhanced cost per click, conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.), budget amount and utilization, average bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), content provider trajectories (e.g., month or month spend growth, month over month cost per click, month or month click through rate, etc.), distribution over content types (e.g., percent of total content publication spend on display/mobile/search/video, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, number and status of campaigns in which bids were submitted,
- FIG. 3A illustrates a flow diagram of a process 300 that may be used to generate a model for use in calculating the estimated likelihood of adoption according to an illustrative implementation.
- Process 300 implements a training stage that utilizes a training data set to build a model that is configured to receive a variety of types of input signals and calculate the likelihood of adoption based on the input signals.
- the training data may include up to 100,000 rows of training data and hundreds or even thousands of candidate signals (e.g., binary signals).
- the training data may be data where the outcome of a presented opportunity (e.g., whether or not the customer adopted the opportunity) is known, such as data regarding opportunities presented to the customer or customers sharing similarities with the customer in the past. While the disclosure below discusses input data in a row and column format, data in other formats may be utilized in other implementations.
- System 108 may be configured to receive the training data set and split the data into bins according to a binning transformation ( 305 ).
- System 108 may trim any rows (records) that have too many missing values (e.g., greater than 30% of total columns missing). For the remaining data, for columns having greater than a threshold amount of missing values (e.g., 5% missing values), the columns may be split into separate bins.
- the columns having the missing data may be split into quantiles (4 bins) by default. Missing values may be placed in a separate bin for each column and may be treated as a separate level in a manner similar to the corresponding variable's other bins. The start and end values of each bin may be saved in configuration files and used for subsequent binning transformations.
- the same binning transformation applied at the training stage using the training data may be applied at the scoring stage to prepare the new data for scoring (e.g., the new data may be split into bins according to the start and end values of each bin stored in the configuration files).
- the data may be cleaned ( 310 ). Missing and/or extreme values or values that are not applicable to the likelihood of adoption analysis may be removed or replaced (e.g., with a default value, such as an average value for the bin). Singular columns that contain singular dominant values may be excluded.
- dummy variables may be created to replace categorical variables.
- Categorical variables are variables that can take on one of a limited (e.g., fixed) number of possible values. Dummy variables take on a binary value (e.g., 0 or 1) to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome.
- a variable “sales market” can take on values among three possible values “US”, “UK”, “FR”, it can be treated as a category variable.
- Three dummy variables, US, UK, and FR, may be used to replace the categorical variable.
- dummization of a categorical variable may help significantly speed up the convergence of the algorithm when the training dataset is large.
- System 108 may apply a transformation to the variables to account for any highly skewed signals ( 315 ).
- highly skewed signals may be identified (e.g., by comparison to other values, such as an average value) and transformed to keep the values from unduly affecting the generated model.
- a normalization or logarithmic transformation may be applied to the highly skewed signals.
- the transformations applied to the highly skewed signals may be saved into configuration files for application to subsequent transformations.
- the transformations stored in the configuration files may be applied to the new data to keep any skewed signals in the new data from unduly affecting the computed likelihood of adoption value.
- the variables may be screened to prune the variables in the training data set to those variables that will be most effective in predicting the likelihood of adoption.
- System 108 may screen the variables based on information values ( 320 ).
- Information values are used to measure the overall predictability of a variable for a binary response. Low IV values suggest low predictability.
- Information values have been used in relation to credit score models.
- information values for each bin may be defined as follows:
- IV i sum[WOE i *(% of adoptions in bin i ⁇ % of non-adoptions in bin i)]
- variables may be ranked or organized according to their IV values and a maximum and/or minimum number of variables (e.g., number of columns) may be enforced to filter out low predictive variables. For example, only a threshold amount of variables having the highest information values may be retained for purposes of building the model. In some implementations, only variables having information values above a certain threshold value (e.g., 0.1) may be retained. In this manner, system 108 may be capable of handling variable selection for a relatively large number (e.g., thousands) of variables (e.g., columns).
- System 108 may be configured to screen the variables based on a pair-wise correlation check ( 325 ).
- the remaining columns may be ranked in order according to their information values.
- the pair-wise correlation e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient
- the pair-wise correlation e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient
- the column with the lower information value may be dropped.
- a high correlation coefficient indicates that the variables will react similarly to the same input signals, and removing one of the highly correlated variables may help prevent those particular types of variables from unduly influencing the model.
- both columns may be retained if they have a pscore above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.1).
- System 108 may screen the variables using a colinearity check between the variables and the response ( 330 ).
- the correlation coefficients e.g., Pearson correlation coefficients
- Any columns for which the correlation coefficient with the response exceeds a threshold value e.g., 0.6 by default may be removed from the training data set.
- System 108 may additionally or alternatively screen the variables based on variance inflation factor (VIF) values ( 335 ).
- VIF values are used to quantify the severity of multicollinearity.
- the VIF values may be calculated using a least square regression method.
- a customized cutoff VIF value (e.g., 10) may be used to filter out columns which are highly correlated with other columns.
- a binary classification model may be fit onto the training data set ( 340 ).
- the conditioned data set may be split into two separate sets of data: a training data set used to generate the model, and a separate validation data set used to validate the model performance once it has been generated.
- a binary classification model may be fit onto the training data set.
- a logistic regression model may be used as the model for calculating the estimated likelihood of adoption.
- a random forest model may be used as the likelihood of adoption model.
- other types of models may be used.
- the performance of the model may be tested using the validation data set ( 345 ).
- the validation data set may be provided as input to the model, and the output may be compared to the actual results associated with the validation data set and/or to a baseline performance level to determine whether the model performance is adequate. If the performance of the model under the validation data set is adequate, the model may be determined to be ready for use in evaluating opportunities for a customer. If the performance of the model is determined to be inadequate, the model may be further refined using additional/different training data. In some implementations, the performance of the model may be visually analyzed (e.g., by a user) by displaying the results as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or within lift and gain charts.
- ROC receiver operating characteristic
- FIG. 3B illustrates a ROC curve chart 350 illustrating the performance of a model generated using process 300 based on an example data set according to an illustrative implementation.
- a ROC curve 355 associated with process 300 is shown along with ROC curves associated with other linear models under the same data set. It can be seen that, for this example data set, process 300 is among the two top performing models.
- FIG. 3C illustrates a ROC curve chart 370 showing logit models of the training and 20% validation/control accounts associated with an example model creating using process 300 in comparison with the same associated with a L 2 regularized logit model according to an illustrative implementation.
- Curve 375 is associated with the training data set of the model created using process 300
- curve 380 is associated with the validation data set. Normally, the more overfitted model should have a wider gap between the training and validation curves. As can be seen in chart 370 , the model created using process 300 is much less overfitted than the illustrated peer models.
- content management system 108 may be configured to calculate a likelihood of marketing ( 215 ).
- a likelihood of marketing may be calculated in the event that the direct user of the recommendation tool is a customer service representative using the tool to determine opportunities to market to a customer.
- the likelihood of marketing may be calculated using a model such as a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model.
- the model may be generated using the same or a similar process as process 300 illustrated in FIG. 3A .
- the model may be generated and/or the likelihood of marketing may be calculated based on different input signals than the likelihood of adopting.
- the input signals used with respect to the likelihood of marketing may include the revenue expected to be generated for the seller of the opportunities, a commission or other incentive that will be made by the customer service representative for selling the opportunity, quotas or other goal numbers associated with one or more of the opportunities, and/or other input factors that may affect the customer service representative's decision as to which opportunities will be present to the customer.
- signals similar to those used to calculate the likelihood of adoption may be used for the customer service representative or opportunity seller to calculate the likelihood of marketing.
- Content management system 108 may calculate an expected revenue uplift for the customer for each opportunity based on one or more of the statistical models ( 220 ).
- the expected revenue uplift or increase may be an estimated increase in revenue for the customer that is expected to result from the customer adopting the opportunity.
- the model may be or include a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model configured to estimate the revenue increase associated with adopting the opportunity.
- the model may utilize various types of input to calculate the expected revenue increase, such as, for example, the recency, frequency, and/or trajectory of logins of content providers into system 108 , the content provider's history of utilizing products/features of system 108 (e.g., conversion tracking, content extension, sitelink extension, video content, location extension, mobile or tablet, enhanced cost per click, conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.), budget amount and utilization, average bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), content provider trajectories (e.g., month or month spend growth, month over month cost per click, month or month click through rate, etc.), distribution over content types (e.g., percent of total content publication spend on display/mobile/search/video, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, number and status of campaigns in
- FIG. 4A illustrates a process 400 that may be used to generate the model used to calculate the expected revenue uplift according to an illustrative implementation.
- process 400 utilizes training data to build a predictive model as part of a training stage. Once the model has been built and validated, it may be used to predict the revenue/profit uplift that will be associated with adopting a particular opportunity.
- System 108 may be configured to split (e.g., randomly) the treated and control data into a number of subgroups N (e.g., 6 by default) ( 405 ).
- the treated data may include accounts contacted (e.g., called/emailed) by the sales/service team and the control group may include accounts to which the sales/service team has not reached out during an experiment period.
- Treatment selection bias may exist in the data, which may be caused by various factors. The existence of selection bias may harm a fair comparison between the treated (experimented) and control group.
- Propensity scores may be used to reduce or remove the selection bias.
- Propensity score models employ a predicted probability of group membership (e.g., treated vs. control group) based on observed predictors to create a counterfactual group.
- a random forest model may be used to build the propensity score model for matching the treatment and control groups.
- PScore models may be used, which are equivalent to propensity score.
- the average propensity scores for each group i may be computed as follows:
- Each account may be assigned into buckets based on its respective propensity score ( 415 ). In some implementations, all accounts may be split into a number of buckets (e.g., 10 by default) based on their propensity scores (e.g., the quantiles of the propensity scores).
- the control accounts' data is used to build a random forest model for predicting its pre/post-treatment (e.g., using a random treatment date assigned to each control account in order to obtain its pre/post treatment metric) differences of the performance metric.
- the treated accounts' uplifts may be calculated ( 425 ). The treated accounts may be scored for their predicted pre-post difference of performance metric. The treated accounts' uplifts may be scored based on a difference between their actual pre-post differences and their predicted differences in each bucket.
- System 108 may be configured to build a predictive model for calculating the expected revenue uplifts using the uplifts of the treated accounts ( 430 ).
- the candidate predictive input signals may be cleaned in a manner similar to that described with respect to process 300 .
- Some transformations, such as binning, may be applied on some candidate signals.
- the transformation may include binning and/or log transform.
- the transformation may be designed to ensure that missing data, if more than a threshold value (e.g., 5%) of a column, is put into an individual bucket so its effect can be evaluated and that highly skewed variables can be adjusted (e.g., through log transformation).
- the data may be split into training and validation data sets, and the predictive model may be built on the training data set.
- the model may be a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or a different type of model.
- the validation data set may be used to validate the model performance and confirm whether or not adjustments to the model should be made.
- ROC curves and/or lift and gain charts may be used to compare the binarized uplift against the uplift scores.
- the model may be used to predict uplifts for new accounts ( 435 ).
- the new data may be cleaned and transformed using configuration files developed in the process of developing the model. The new data set may be scored for the predicted uplifts.
- FIG. 4B illustrates an example ROC curve 450 illustrating the performance of an example predictive model generated using process 400 according to an illustrative implementation.
- the continuous response of revenue uplift may be transformed into a binary variable which takes the value of 1 if it is positive and 0 otherwise.
- ROC curve 450 is generated based on the binarized uplift data. Inspection of ROC curve 450 shows that the model has good performance with a 80% average true positive rate at the 40% average false positive rate.
- FIG. 4C provides a cumulative gains chart 470 showing the lift associated with the generated model.

- the opportunity values can be summed up for each account and their total may be used for account prioritization within a sales program or across a number of campaigns.
- a linear programming model may be created to generate the final opportunity values and rank them for each account.
- the linear model may be configured to impose some constraints on the results. For example, opportunities may be excluded from consideration if the expected return on investment (ROI) (e.g., clicks) for the customers are decremented.
- ROI expected return on investment
- a minimum and/or maximum number of opportunities to be presented to the user may be implemented by the linear model (e.g., a maximum of 5 and minimum of 3 opportunities).
- An example formulation of a linear programming model that may be used to provide recommendations to a customer service representative may be constructed as follows:
- the model may be designed to identify opportunities that have the highest opportunity values, which are based on the probability of pitching PP, probability of adoption PA, and expected revenue uplift RU:
- one or more constraints may be placed on the model.
- the model may be designed to only recommend opportunities that are profitable for the opportunity seller, such that the profit to the seller outweighs the cost associated with the opportunity:
- the total number of recommendations may be constrained to be within a minimum and/or maximum number of recommendations:
- opportunities may be constrained such that the total ROI or clicks for the customer is not decremented or increases by a threshold amount:
- one or more opportunities may be selected for presentation to the user ( 230 ).
- a set number or range of opportunities having the highest opportunity values may be selected for presentation.
- all opportunities having an opportunity value above a certain threshold may be presented.
- a set number or range of opportunities having the highest opportunity values may be presented, but only if the opportunities have an opportunity value above a certain threshold value.
- hard eligibility filters may be applied and may restrict or eliminate one or more of the opportunities from consideration. For example, opportunities associated with certain content publication programs may require that the customer have not registered with the program within a threshold amount of time prior to the opportunity (e.g., as part of a promotional opportunity to encourage the customer to register with the program).
- System 108 may provide the user with information relating to the selected opportunities ( 235 ).

- the output of the models may include a list of signals and their weights from the coefficients of the prediction models.
- Example signals that may be included as part of the soft filters may include, for example, whether the customer is registered with and/or actively using a particular content publication program, how much of a budget was spent on a particular program, whether a campaign budget has increased, a number of content items created within a certain recent time period, a budget amount for the account, a time period since the customer last logged in with system 108 , and/or various other types of signal.
- selected upsell signals may be provided that are personalized to each opportunity.
- the number of upsell signals presented to a customer service representative may be limited (e.g., maximum of 10) to avoid overwhelming the representative with too much information.
- the signals may be selected from the prediction models (e.g., opportunity value and/or likelihood of adoption and their confidence intervals) or from recommendations of a collaborating program manager (e.g., budget utilization and/or logins).
- the opportunities may be packaged and recommended within the packages.
- the opportunities may be packaged based on their affinity, adoption sequence, aggregated revenue impact, etc.
- the opportunities may be recommended based on their aggregated opportunity values.
- the opportunities may be clustered based on granular change history at the campaign or content group level.
- some new services/products may not have enough history relating to the services to provide meaningful recommendations based solely on the history of those services.
- sibling services/products may be identified as having the closest relation to the services being analyzed, and the recommendations may be provided based on historical data associated with those sibling services.

- System 108 may determine whether the direct user is a customer service representative (CSR) or a content provider ( 515 ). If the direct user is a content provider, the training data may be used to generate a likelihood of adoption model 525 and a revenue uplift model 530 . If the direct user is a CSR, the training data may also be used to generate a likelihood of marketing model 520 .
- CSR customer service representative
- the training data may also be used to generate a likelihood of marketing model 520 .
- the model coefficients may be parsed and written into a scorecard script such as a large tenzing/dremel query ( 535 ).
- the scorecard script may be run on updated signals for new accounts to generate the predicted likelihood and revenue uplift values and a raw opportunity value (e.g., at a dimension of account x opportunity).
- the scorecard script may be used to generate one or more “soft” filters for providing opportunity notes to the user ( 540 ).
- opportunities associated with new data/accounts can be scored in a scoring phase.
- the new accounts to be scored may be identified ( 545 ) and the relevant signals associated with those accounts may be obtained by system 108 ( 550 ).
- the predicted likelihood and revenue uplift values and the raw opportunity values may be generated for each opportunity, for example, using the scorecard script ( 555 ).
- the opportunities may be processed through a model designed to maximize revenue uplift while applying constraints to the opportunities to be presented.
- One or more “hard” filters may be applied to the data, and opportunities that do not satisfy the hard filters may be removed from the opportunities that may be presented to the user ( 560 ).
- System 108 may obtain business requirements ( 565 ) to be applied to the opportunities (e.g., maximum or minimum number of opportunities to be presented, requirement that opportunities do not reduce ROI or clicks for customer, requirement that opportunity costs do not exceed profits for seller, etc.) and may optimize or constrain the opportunities based on the business requirements ( 570 ).

Description
- Online content management systems allow content publishers to publish content that promotes the content publisher and/or products/services that the content publisher sells. Customer service representatives may assist content publishers in determining publication opportunities that they may wish to pursue within limited publication budgets. Recommendation systems may be used to assist customer service representatives in marketing online service opportunities, such as online content publication opportunities, to customers interested in such services. Unlike selling more statically defined products where the price has been determined and the opportunities can be directly ranked based on revenue/profit and likelihood of sales success, marketing online services presents unique challenges in attempting to rank and/or classify service opportunities.
- One implementation of the disclosure relates to a method that includes receiving, at a computerized recommendation system, input data relating to a plurality of service options for one or more services provided to a customer using a communications network. The method further includes, for each of the plurality of service options, calculating, at the recommendation system, an estimated likelihood of adoption, an expected revenue increase, and an opportunity score for the service option based on the estimated likelihood of adoption and the expected revenue increase. The estimated likelihood of adoption is an estimate of the probability that the customer will adopt the service option. The expected revenue increase is an estimated increase in revenue for the customer that is expected to result from the customer adopting the service option. The method further includes selecting, at the recommendation system, one or more of the service options to be recommended to a user based on the opportunity scores of the plurality of service options. The method further includes providing the user with information relating to the one or more selected service options.
- Another implementation of the disclosure relates to a system including at least one computing device operably coupled to at least one memory and configured to receive input data relating to a plurality of service options for one or more services provided to a customer using a communications network. The at least one computing device is further configured to, for each of the plurality of service options, calculate an estimated likelihood of adoption, an expected revenue increase, and an opportunity score for the service option based on the estimated likelihood of adoption and the expected revenue increase. The estimated likelihood of adoption is an estimate of the probability that the customer will adopt the service option. The expected revenue increase is an estimated increase in revenue for the customer that is expected to result from the customer adopting the service option. The at least one computing device is further configured to select one or more of the service options to be recommended to a user based on the opportunity scores of the plurality of service options and to provide the user with information relating to the one or more selected service options.
- Another implementation of the disclosure relates to a computer-readable storage medium having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations including receiving input data relating to a plurality of service options for one or more services provided to a customer using a communications network. The operations further include, for each of the plurality of service options, calculating an estimated likelihood of adoption, an expected revenue increase, and an opportunity score for the service option based on the estimated likelihood of adoption and the expected revenue increase. The estimated likelihood of adoption is an estimate of the probability that the customer will adopt the service option. The expected revenue increase is an estimated increase in revenue for the customer that is expected to result from the customer adopting the service option. The operations further include selecting one or more of the service options to be recommended to a user based on the opportunity scores of the plurality of service options and providing the user with information relating to the one or more selected service options.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 8 is a block diagram of a computing device according to an illustrative implementation. - Referring generally to the Figures, various illustrative systems and methods are provided that generate recommendations for online service opportunities that customers may wish to pursue, such as online content publication opportunities. Unlike selling more statically defined products where the price has been determined and the opportunities can be directly ranked based on revenue/profit and likelihood of sales success, marketing online services presents some unique challenges. For example, it is difficult to accurately estimate and explain the opportunity values associated with some online services based on predicted revenue uplifts and adoption likelihoods. Additionally, it may be challenging to rank and optimize opportunities based on a customer's business requirements and to package the opportunities in a manner that is useful for recommending to the customer as solutions to the customer's business problems.
- A content management system according to illustrative implementations of the present disclosure is configured to generate recommendations based on both an estimated likelihood of adoption of a recommended opportunity by the customer and an expected revenue uplift for the customer resulting from a recommendation being adopted. In some implementations, the system may be utilized by customer service representatives to assist with marketing potential opportunities to customers. In some implementations, the system may be used directly by the customers themselves to explore potential opportunities. A final opportunity value may be generated based on the likelihood of adoption, expected revenue uplift, and/or likelihood of marketing estimates and used to rank opportunities. In some implementations, the final opportunity value may be defined as (likelihood that customer service representative will pitch opportunity)*(likelihood that customer will adopt opportunity)*(expected revenue/profit uplift for customer if customer adopts opportunity). The likelihood of marketing, likelihood of adoption, and/or predicted revenue uplift may be estimated using a logistic regression model, random forest model, or another type of model. In some implementations, users may be permitted to specify parameters and/or business requirements to be used in determining recommended opportunities, such as requiring that the customer's expected return on investment (“ROI”) (e.g., click through rate) not be reduced by adopting an opportunity or providing only three recommended opportunities to the customer. The system may be configured to convert the output signals and/or filters from the statistical predictive models into notes that can be easily interpreted by the users (e.g., by customer service representatives to recommend opportunities to their customers or by the customers themselves to determine which opportunities to pursue).
- Referring now to
FIG. 1 , and in brief overview, a block diagram of acontent management system 108 and associatedenvironment 100 is shown according to an illustrative implementation. One ormore user devices 104 may be used by a user to perform various actions and/or access various types of content, some of which may be provided over a network 102 (e.g., the Internet, LAN, WAN, etc.). For example,user devices 104 may be used to access websites (e.g., using an internet browser), media files, and/or any other types of content.Content management system 108 may be configured to select content for display to users within resources (e.g., webpages, applications, etc.) and to provide content from acontent database 110 touser devices 104 overnetwork 102 for display within the resources. The content from whichcontent management system 108 selects items may be provided by one or more content providers vianetwork 102 usingcontent provider devices 106. - In some implementations, bids for content to be selected by
content management system 108 may be provided tocontent management system 108 from content publishers participating in an auction using devices, such ascontent provider devices 106, configured to communicate withcontent management system 108 throughnetwork 102. In such implementations,content management system 108 may determine content to be published based at least in part on the bids. -
Content management system 108 is configured to provide recommendations for different content publication opportunities or options that a content publisher may wish to consider. For example,content management system 108 may recommend that a content publisher adjust settings (e.g., bid settings) associated with a campaign to increase a number of impressions of certain content published in a certain resource, at a certain time, upon occurrence of certain conditions, etc. In another example,content management system 108 may recommend that a content publisher try publishing content under a different type of content publication product. For example,content management system 108 may recommend that a content publisher that publishes content primarily in relation to an online search engine try bidding to publish content in relation to a mobile application or other mobile resource. In some implementations,content management system 108 may provide the recommendations directly to a content provider. In some implementations,content management system 108 may provide the recommendations to a customer service representative who assists one or more content providers in making decisions regarding content publication campaigns. - Referring still to
FIG. 1 , and in greater detail,user devices 104, customer service representative (CSR)devices 105, and/orcontent provider devices 106 may be any type of computing device (e.g., having a processor and memory or other type of computer-readable medium), such as a television and/or set-top box, mobile communication device (e.g., cellular telephone, smartphone, etc.), computer and/or media device (desktop computer, laptop or notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet device, gaming system, etc.), or any other type of computing device. In some implementations, one ormore user devices 104 may be set-top boxes or other devices for use with a television set. In some implementations, content may be provided via a web-based application and/or an application resident on auser device 104. In some implementations,user devices 104,CSR devices 105, and/orcontent provider devices 106 may be designed to use various types of software and/or operating systems. In various illustrative implementations,user devices 104,CSR devices 105, and/orcontent provider devices 106 may be equipped with and/or associated with one or more user input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, remote control, touchscreen, etc.) and/or one or more display devices (e.g., television, monitor, CRT, plasma, LCD, LED, touchscreen, etc.). -
User devices 104,CSR devices 105, and/orcontent provider devices 106 may be configured to receive data from various sources using anetwork 102. In some implementations,network 102 may comprise a computing network (e.g., LAN, WAN, Internet, etc.) to whichuser devices 104,CSR devices 105, and/orcontent provider devices 106 may be connected via any type of network connection (e.g., wired, such as Ethernet, phone line, power line, etc., or wireless, such as WiFi, WiMAX, 3G, 4G, satellite, etc.). In some implementations,network 102 may include a media distribution network, such as cable (e.g., coaxial metal cable), satellite, fiber optic, etc., configured to distribute media programming and/or data content. - Some content that may be accessed via
user devices 104 may include content that has been selected to appear in conjunction with certain resources through an auction or other content selection process. For example, a portion of a search result interface or another resource may be configured to display content that has been selected through the use of an auction.Content management system 108 may be configured to receive bids from auction participants (e.g., content providers) and select content to be displayed in resources (e.g., on webpages) based on the bids. In some implementations, content may be ranked based on bids associated with the content. A search engine or other resource operator may receive revenue by auctioning a certain set of keywords to auction participants. Auction participants may place auction bids for the ability to include their content on the search result resource, whenever a user searches using a keyword in the set. For example, an online manufacturer of golf equipment may participate in an auction for the golf-related set of keywords. If a user searches for the term “golf,” and the manufacturer is determined to be the winner of the auction, content from the manufacturer may appear in the same resource as the search results. A provider of a website devoted to a particular topic may also receive revenue by auctioning off the ability to place content with his or her resource (e.g., embedded in a webpage, in a pop-up window, etc.). In some implementations, the provider of the website may be a different entity than the provider ofcontent management system 108. Similar to bidding on search results, an auction participant may place a bid in the auction using a set of keywords that corresponds to keywords found in the text of the resource. In some implementations, the auction bids may additionally or alternatively include criteria other than keywords, such as user interests, locations (e.g., geographic areas), semantic entities of resources (e.g., web pages), etc. - In some implementations, a content provider may create an account with
content management system 108. Associated with the account may be data relating to which content the content provider wishes to use, a daily budget to spend, topical categories of resources on which the content is to be placed (e.g., resources related to Sports>Golf, etc.), one or more bid amounts, and/or other data (e.g., statistical data) that may be used bycontent management system 108 to select content to be displayed byuser devices 104. When auser device 104 interacts with a resource that participates in the auction network,content management system 108 may compare bids among auction participants to select content to be included in the resource. In some implementations, bids may be received from one or morecontent provider devices 106, and information relating to the bids, including the content associated with the bids, may be stored in content database 110 (e.g., in a content portion 112). -
Content management system 108 is configured to provide recommendations to users (e.g., customer service representatives marketing opportunities to customers or directly to the customers themselves) for content publication opportunities that may be of interest to the users.FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of aprocess 300 for providing recommendations for service opportunities according to an illustrative implementation. Referring to bothFIGS. 1 and 2 ,content management system 108 may receive data relating to one or more opportunities that a customer may be interested in pursuing (205). The opportunities may include increasing a number or amount of bids for displaying content within a particular resource or content publication product, bidding or registering to display content in relation to a resource or content publication product with which the content publisher has not been previously associated or has not been associated for a certain amount of time, or any other service or feature that may be sold to content publishers to generate revenue for an opportunity seller. In some implementations, data relating to the opportunities may be stored in anopportunity data portion 114 ofdatabase 110. - The input data may include one or more of a variety of types of data relating to the customer for whom the analysis is being performed and the opportunities available for the customer to consider. The input data may include data received from a user of the system that is used to determine opportunities to analyze. For example, a user may enter an account identifier for the customer being analyzed that
system 108 may use to obtain information regarding the content publication services and features that the customer is currently utilizing. The account identifier may be used to obtain data such as a current budget, revenue associated with the services currently being utilized, total bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, etc. In various illustrative implementations, a wide variety of different input data signals may be utilized to determine opportunity recommendations to present to the user, such as recency and/or frequency of the content provider logging in tosystem 108, history of the content provider adopting/using certain products/features of system 108 (e.g., desktop device/content device/conversion reporting, has content extension/sitelink extension/video content/location extension/mobile or tablet/enhanced cost per click/conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, throttled impression shares, bid lost impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.). -
Content management system 108 may be configured to generate one or more statistical models based on training data and stored the statistical models in a memory, such ascontent database 110. Illustrative processes that may be used to generate the one or more statistical models are described in further detail below (e.g., with respect toFIGS. 3A and 4A ). -
Content management system 108 may be configured to calculate a likelihood of adoption for each of the opportunities being analyzed for the user based on one or more of the statistical models (210). The likelihood of adoption may include a value or score (e.g., a percentage) that represents an estimated likelihood that a customer, if presented with the opportunity, would adopt or move forward with the opportunity. At least a portion of the received input data may be processed by a likelihood of adoption model to calculate the likelihood of adoption value. In various implementations, the model may be or include a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model configured to estimate the likelihood that the customer will adopt an opportunity. The model may utilize various types of input to estimate the likelihood of adoption, such as previous bids/purchases made by the customer, adoption history (e.g., decisions (adoption or rejection) the customer made with respect to previously proposed opportunities), budget, data regarding the products, features, options, etc. that the customer is currently using or has used in the past, and/or other types of inputs that may be relevant to whether the customer is likely to adopt the opportunities being analyzed. The some implementations, the input may include, for example, one or more of the recency and/or frequency of the content provider logging in tosystem 108, history of the content provider adopting/using certain products/features of system 108 (e.g., conversion tracking, content extension, sitelink extension, video content, location extension, mobile or tablet, enhanced cost per click, conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.), budget amount and utilization, average bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), content provider trajectories (e.g., month or month spend growth, month over month cost per click, month or month click through rate, etc.), distribution over content types (e.g., percent of total content publication spend on display/mobile/search/video, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, number and status of campaigns in which bids were submitted, etc. -
FIG. 3A illustrates a flow diagram of aprocess 300 that may be used to generate a model for use in calculating the estimated likelihood of adoption according to an illustrative implementation.Process 300 implements a training stage that utilizes a training data set to build a model that is configured to receive a variety of types of input signals and calculate the likelihood of adoption based on the input signals. In some implementations, the training data may include up to 100,000 rows of training data and hundreds or even thousands of candidate signals (e.g., binary signals). The training data may be data where the outcome of a presented opportunity (e.g., whether or not the customer adopted the opportunity) is known, such as data regarding opportunities presented to the customer or customers sharing similarities with the customer in the past. While the disclosure below discusses input data in a row and column format, data in other formats may be utilized in other implementations. -
System 108 may be configured to receive the training data set and split the data into bins according to a binning transformation (305).System 108 may trim any rows (records) that have too many missing values (e.g., greater than 30% of total columns missing). For the remaining data, for columns having greater than a threshold amount of missing values (e.g., 5% missing values), the columns may be split into separate bins. In some implementations, the columns having the missing data may be split into quantiles (4 bins) by default. Missing values may be placed in a separate bin for each column and may be treated as a separate level in a manner similar to the corresponding variable's other bins. The start and end values of each bin may be saved in configuration files and used for subsequent binning transformations. For example, after the training has been completed and the model has been generated, at a scoring stage in which new data is received for the purposes of computing a likelihood of adoption of opportunities for customers, the same binning transformation applied at the training stage using the training data may be applied at the scoring stage to prepare the new data for scoring (e.g., the new data may be split into bins according to the start and end values of each bin stored in the configuration files). - Once the data has been placed into bins, the data may be cleaned (310). Missing and/or extreme values or values that are not applicable to the likelihood of adoption analysis may be removed or replaced (e.g., with a default value, such as an average value for the bin). Singular columns that contain singular dominant values may be excluded. In some implementations, dummy variables may be created to replace categorical variables. Categorical variables are variables that can take on one of a limited (e.g., fixed) number of possible values. Dummy variables take on a binary value (e.g., 0 or 1) to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome. For example, if a variable “sales market” can take on values among three possible values “US”, “UK”, “FR”, it can be treated as a category variable. Three dummy variables, US, UK, and FR, may be used to replace the categorical variable. In modeling the adoption likelihood through regressions or machine learning models, dummization of a categorical variable may help significantly speed up the convergence of the algorithm when the training dataset is large.
-
System 108 may apply a transformation to the variables to account for any highly skewed signals (315). During the training stage, highly skewed signals may be identified (e.g., by comparison to other values, such as an average value) and transformed to keep the values from unduly affecting the generated model. In some implementations, a normalization or logarithmic transformation may be applied to the highly skewed signals. The transformations applied to the highly skewed signals may be saved into configuration files for application to subsequent transformations. At the scoring stage, the transformations stored in the configuration files may be applied to the new data to keep any skewed signals in the new data from unduly affecting the computed likelihood of adoption value. - Once the data has cleaned and transformed into a useful format, the variables may be screened to prune the variables in the training data set to those variables that will be most effective in predicting the likelihood of adoption.
System 108 may screen the variables based on information values (320). Information values are used to measure the overall predictability of a variable for a binary response. Low IV values suggest low predictability. Information values have been used in relation to credit score models. In some implementations, information values for each bin may be defined as follows: -
IVi=sum[WOEi*(% of adoptions in bin i−% of non-adoptions in bin i)] - where
-
- WOEi (weight of evidence of bin i)=log(% of adoptions in bin i)−log(% of non-adoptions in bin i)
- and i=1, 2, 3, . . . , number of bins
- In some implementations, variables may be ranked or organized according to their IV values and a maximum and/or minimum number of variables (e.g., number of columns) may be enforced to filter out low predictive variables. For example, only a threshold amount of variables having the highest information values may be retained for purposes of building the model. In some implementations, only variables having information values above a certain threshold value (e.g., 0.1) may be retained. In this manner,
system 108 may be capable of handling variable selection for a relatively large number (e.g., thousands) of variables (e.g., columns). -
System 108 may be configured to screen the variables based on a pair-wise correlation check (325). The remaining columns may be ranked in order according to their information values. The pair-wise correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) of the top two columns may be checked (except for the column of response). If the correlation between the columns is greater than a threshold value (e.g., 0.4), then the column with the lower information value may be dropped. A high correlation coefficient indicates that the variables will react similarly to the same input signals, and removing one of the highly correlated variables may help prevent those particular types of variables from unduly influencing the model. In some implementations, both columns may be retained if they have a pscore above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.1). -
System 108 may screen the variables using a colinearity check between the variables and the response (330). The correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficients) between the response column and each individual column may be checked. Any columns for which the correlation coefficient with the response exceeds a threshold value (e.g., 0.6 by default) may be removed from the training data set. -
System 108 may additionally or alternatively screen the variables based on variance inflation factor (VIF) values (335). VIF values are used to quantify the severity of multicollinearity. In some embodiments, the VIF values may be calculated using a least square regression method. A customized cutoff VIF value (e.g., 10) may be used to filter out columns which are highly correlated with other columns. - Once the variables have been formatted and screened, a binary classification model may be fit onto the training data set (340). The conditioned data set may be split into two separate sets of data: a training data set used to generate the model, and a separate validation data set used to validate the model performance once it has been generated. A binary classification model may be fit onto the training data set. In some implementations, a logistic regression model may be used as the model for calculating the estimated likelihood of adoption. In some implementations, a random forest model may be used as the likelihood of adoption model. In still further implementations, other types of models may be used.
- After the model is generated based on the training data set, the performance of the model may be tested using the validation data set (345). The validation data set may be provided as input to the model, and the output may be compared to the actual results associated with the validation data set and/or to a baseline performance level to determine whether the model performance is adequate. If the performance of the model under the validation data set is adequate, the model may be determined to be ready for use in evaluating opportunities for a customer. If the performance of the model is determined to be inadequate, the model may be further refined using additional/different training data. In some implementations, the performance of the model may be visually analyzed (e.g., by a user) by displaying the results as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or within lift and gain charts.
-
FIG. 3B illustrates aROC curve chart 350 illustrating the performance of a model generated usingprocess 300 based on an example data set according to an illustrative implementation. AROC curve 355 associated withprocess 300 is shown along with ROC curves associated with other linear models under the same data set. It can be seen that, for this example data set,process 300 is among the two top performing models. - One common issue with linear models is overfitting, which occurs when the model selects variables incorrectly and describes noise instead of the underlying relationship between the model response and predictors. Such an issue is more likely to happen when the training data set has a large number of variables. One approach to control overfitting is to use regularization methods, such as L2-norm or Lasso, to explicitly penalize overly complex methods.
-
FIG. 3C illustrates aROC curve chart 370 showing logit models of the training and 20% validation/control accounts associated with an example model creating usingprocess 300 in comparison with the same associated with a L2 regularized logit model according to an illustrative implementation.Curve 375 is associated with the training data set of the model created usingprocess 300, andcurve 380 is associated with the validation data set. Normally, the more overfitted model should have a wider gap between the training and validation curves. As can be seen inchart 370, the model created usingprocess 300 is much less overfitted than the illustrated peer models. - Returning again to
FIG. 2 , in some implementations,content management system 108 may be configured to calculate a likelihood of marketing (215). A likelihood of marketing may be calculated in the event that the direct user of the recommendation tool is a customer service representative using the tool to determine opportunities to market to a customer. The likelihood of marketing may be calculated using a model such as a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model. In some implementations, the model may be generated using the same or a similar process asprocess 300 illustrated inFIG. 3A . The model may be generated and/or the likelihood of marketing may be calculated based on different input signals than the likelihood of adopting. For example, the input signals used with respect to the likelihood of marketing may include the revenue expected to be generated for the seller of the opportunities, a commission or other incentive that will be made by the customer service representative for selling the opportunity, quotas or other goal numbers associated with one or more of the opportunities, and/or other input factors that may affect the customer service representative's decision as to which opportunities will be present to the customer. In some implementations, signals similar to those used to calculate the likelihood of adoption may be used for the customer service representative or opportunity seller to calculate the likelihood of marketing. -
Content management system 108 may calculate an expected revenue uplift for the customer for each opportunity based on one or more of the statistical models (220). The expected revenue uplift or increase may be an estimated increase in revenue for the customer that is expected to result from the customer adopting the opportunity. In various implementations, the model may be or include a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or another type of model configured to estimate the revenue increase associated with adopting the opportunity. The model may utilize various types of input to calculate the expected revenue increase, such as, for example, the recency, frequency, and/or trajectory of logins of content providers intosystem 108, the content provider's history of utilizing products/features of system 108 (e.g., conversion tracking, content extension, sitelink extension, video content, location extension, mobile or tablet, enhanced cost per click, conversion optimizer, etc.), content competitiveness metrics (e.g., impression shares, number/percent of content groups having relative click through rate, etc.), budget amount and utilization, average bid amount, performance statistics (e.g., number of impressions, click through rate, quality statistics, etc.), content provider trajectories (e.g., month or month spend growth, month over month cost per click, month or month click through rate, etc.), distribution over content types (e.g., percent of total content publication spend on display/mobile/search/video, etc.), number and type of content groups in which bids were submitted, number and type of keywords for which bids were submitted, number and status of campaigns in which bids were submitted, etc. -
FIG. 4A illustrates aprocess 400 that may be used to generate the model used to calculate the expected revenue uplift according to an illustrative implementation. Likeprocess 300,process 400 utilizes training data to build a predictive model as part of a training stage. Once the model has been built and validated, it may be used to predict the revenue/profit uplift that will be associated with adopting a particular opportunity. -
System 108 may be configured to split (e.g., randomly) the treated and control data into a number of subgroups N (e.g., 6 by default) (405). In some implementations, the treated data may include accounts contacted (e.g., called/emailed) by the sales/service team and the control group may include accounts to which the sales/service team has not reached out during an experiment period. -
System 108 may then build propensity score models in each group and score the accounts (410). Treatment selection bias may exist in the data, which may be caused by various factors. The existence of selection bias may harm a fair comparison between the treated (experimented) and control group. Propensity scores may be used to reduce or remove the selection bias. Propensity score models employ a predicted probability of group membership (e.g., treated vs. control group) based on observed predictors to create a counterfactual group. In some implementations, a random forest model may be used to build the propensity score model for matching the treatment and control groups. In some implementations, PScore models may be used, which are equivalent to propensity score. - The average propensity scores for each group i may be computed as follows:
-
score— i=avg(score— ij)over j -
- where i=1, . . . , N; j=1, . . . , N; i< > j and score_ij=group i's scores given by group j's model
- Each account may be assigned into buckets based on its respective propensity score (415). In some implementations, all accounts may be split into a number of buckets (e.g., 10 by default) based on their propensity scores (e.g., the quantiles of the propensity scores). In each bucket, the control accounts' data is used to build a random forest model for predicting its pre/post-treatment (e.g., using a random treatment date assigned to each control account in order to obtain its pre/post treatment metric) differences of the performance metric. Once the models are created, the treated accounts' uplifts may be calculated (425). The treated accounts may be scored for their predicted pre-post difference of performance metric. The treated accounts' uplifts may be scored based on a difference between their actual pre-post differences and their predicted differences in each bucket.
-
System 108 may be configured to build a predictive model for calculating the expected revenue uplifts using the uplifts of the treated accounts (430). The candidate predictive input signals may be cleaned in a manner similar to that described with respect toprocess 300. Some transformations, such as binning, may be applied on some candidate signals. In some implementations, the transformation may include binning and/or log transform. The transformation may be designed to ensure that missing data, if more than a threshold value (e.g., 5%) of a column, is put into an individual bucket so its effect can be evaluated and that highly skewed variables can be adjusted (e.g., through log transformation). The data may be split into training and validation data sets, and the predictive model may be built on the training data set. In some implementations, the model may be a logistic regression model, a random forest model, or a different type of model. Once the model has been built onto the training data set, the validation data set may be used to validate the model performance and confirm whether or not adjustments to the model should be made. In some implementations, ROC curves and/or lift and gain charts may be used to compare the binarized uplift against the uplift scores. Once the model is validated and finalized, the model may be used to predict uplifts for new accounts (435). In some implementations, the new data may be cleaned and transformed using configuration files developed in the process of developing the model. The new data set may be scored for the predicted uplifts. -
FIG. 4B illustrates anexample ROC curve 450 illustrating the performance of an example predictive model generated usingprocess 400 according to an illustrative implementation. When validating the performance of the model, the continuous response of revenue uplift may be transformed into a binary variable which takes the value of 1 if it is positive and 0 otherwise.ROC curve 450 is generated based on the binarized uplift data. Inspection ofROC curve 450 shows that the model has good performance with a 80% average true positive rate at the 40% average false positive rate.FIG. 4C provides a cumulative gains chart 470 showing the lift associated with the generated model. - Referring again to
FIG. 2 , once the likelihood of adoption and expected revenue uplift (and, in some implementations, likelihood of marketing) calculations have been performed, a final opportunity value may be calculated for each of the opportunities (225). In some implementations (e.g., if the direct users are customers), the raw opportunity values may be defined as: -
- opportunity value=likelihood of adoption x expected revenue uplift or, for implementations in which the opportunity value is further based on a likelihood of marketing (e.g., if the users are customer service representatives):
- opportunity value=likelihood of marketing x likelihood of adoption x expected revenue uplift
- Based on the opportunity values, the opportunities may be ranked at an account level. In some implementations, the accounts may be ranked within a program (e.g., a particular type of content publication program or product, such as search engine, mobile, video, etc.) and/or across multiple programs. For example, the opportunity values can be summed up for each account and their total may be used for account prioritization within a sales program or across a number of campaigns.
- In some implementations, a linear programming model may be created to generate the final opportunity values and rank them for each account. In some implementations, the linear model may be configured to impose some constraints on the results. For example, opportunities may be excluded from consideration if the expected return on investment (ROI) (e.g., clicks) for the customers are decremented. In some implementations, a minimum and/or maximum number of opportunities to be presented to the user may be implemented by the linear model (e.g., a maximum of 5 and minimum of 3 opportunities). An example formulation of a linear programming model that may be used to provide recommendations to a customer service representative may be constructed as follows:
- Indices:
-
- c=campaign, cεC
- i=content publisher/customer, iεI
- j=opportunity (e.g., task or package), jεJ
- p=phase, pεP
- Data:
-
- RU=revenue uplift
- CU=clicks uplift
- PP=probability of pitching/marketing
- PA=probability of adoption
- C=cost to opportunity seller
- TU=upperbound limit of the number of recommended tasks
- TL=lowerbound limit of the number of recommended tasks
- Decision variable: x=recommendation action dummy variable
- The model may be designed to identify opportunities that have the highest opportunity values, which are based on the probability of pitching PP, probability of adoption PA, and expected revenue uplift RU:
-
- In some implementations, one or more constraints may be placed on the model. For example, the variables may be forced to be binary in nature, such that xi,j={0,1}. The model may be designed to only recommend opportunities that are profitable for the opportunity seller, such that the profit to the seller outweighs the cost associated with the opportunity:
-
- The total number of recommendations may be constrained to be within a minimum and/or maximum number of recommendations:
-
- In some implementations, opportunities may be constrained such that the total ROI or clicks for the customer is not decremented or increases by a threshold amount:
-
- Once the final opportunity values are calculated, one or more opportunities may be selected for presentation to the user (230). In some implementations, a set number or range of opportunities having the highest opportunity values may be selected for presentation. In some implementations, all opportunities having an opportunity value above a certain threshold may be presented. In some implementations, a set number or range of opportunities having the highest opportunity values may be presented, but only if the opportunities have an opportunity value above a certain threshold value. In some implementations, hard eligibility filters may be applied and may restrict or eliminate one or more of the opportunities from consideration. For example, opportunities associated with certain content publication programs may require that the customer have not registered with the program within a threshold amount of time prior to the opportunity (e.g., as part of a promotional opportunity to encourage the customer to register with the program).
-
System 108 may provide the user with information relating to the selected opportunities (235). In some implementations, the opportunity value and/or the component signals and/or calculated values (e.g., likelihood of marketing/adoption and expected revenue uplift) may be converted into a format (e.g., a textual format) that may be interpreted by the user for the purposes of evaluating the opportunities. In some implementations, the opportunity value and/or expected revenue uplift may be represented as a monetary value (e.g., expected increase in revenue/impact over a particular time period associated with adopting the opportunity). - In some implementations, the information presented to the user may be based in part on one or more “soft” filters that are based on selected signal and/or weights from the statistical prediction models used in calculating the opportunity value. The output of the models may include a list of signals and their weights from the coefficients of the prediction models. Example signals that may be included as part of the soft filters may include, for example, whether the customer is registered with and/or actively using a particular content publication program, how much of a budget was spent on a particular program, whether a campaign budget has increased, a number of content items created within a certain recent time period, a budget amount for the account, a time period since the customer last logged in with
system 108, and/or various other types of signal. In some implementations, selected upsell signals may be provided that are personalized to each opportunity. In some implementations, the number of upsell signals presented to a customer service representative may be limited (e.g., maximum of 10) to avoid overwhelming the representative with too much information. The signals may be selected from the prediction models (e.g., opportunity value and/or likelihood of adoption and their confidence intervals) or from recommendations of a collaborating program manager (e.g., budget utilization and/or logins). - In some implementations, the opportunities may be packaged and recommended within the packages. For example, the opportunities may be packaged based on their affinity, adoption sequence, aggregated revenue impact, etc. The opportunities may be recommended based on their aggregated opportunity values. In some implementations, the opportunities may be clustered based on granular change history at the campaign or content group level.
- In some implementations, some new services/products may not have enough history relating to the services to provide meaningful recommendations based solely on the history of those services. In such implementations, sibling services/products may be identified as having the closest relation to the services being analyzed, and the recommendations may be provided based on historical data associated with those sibling services.

FIG. 5 , a flow diagram of aprocess 500 is shown according to an illustrative implementation.Process 500 is a more detailed illustrative implementation ofprocess 200.Process 500 is implemented using two main stages, training (including validation) and scoring. In the training phase,process 500 takes input (e.g., pitching/marketing and/or adoption history) and generates an output of an opportunity scoring script. Once the models have been developed using the training data, new data may be input and used to generate recommendations for opportunities. In some implementations, the opportunity information may be presented to a customer service representative. In some implementations, the opportunity information may be presented directly to the content provider customers. -
System 108 may be configured to obtain adata set 505 to be used in training and validation of the models used to determine the opportunity values (510).Data set 505 may include data relating to a marketing history of the customer service representative, adoption history of the customer, and/or various statistics relating to the customer and/or content being analyzed.System 108 may determine whether the direct user is a customer service representative (CSR) or a content provider (515). If the direct user is a content provider, the training data may be used to generate a likelihood ofadoption model 525 and arevenue uplift model 530. If the direct user is a CSR, the training data may also be used to generate a likelihood ofmarketing model 520. - In some implementations, after the models are built, the model coefficients may be parsed and written into a scorecard script such as a large tenzing/dremel query (535). The scorecard script may be run on updated signals for new accounts to generate the predicted likelihood and revenue uplift values and a raw opportunity value (e.g., at a dimension of account x opportunity). In some implementations, the scorecard script may be used to generate one or more “soft” filters for providing opportunity notes to the user (540).
- Once the models are generated, opportunities associated with new data/accounts can be scored in a scoring phase. The new accounts to be scored may be identified (545) and the relevant signals associated with those accounts may be obtained by system 108 (550). The predicted likelihood and revenue uplift values and the raw opportunity values may be generated for each opportunity, for example, using the scorecard script (555).
- To generate the final opportunity values and recommendations, the opportunities may be processed through a model designed to maximize revenue uplift while applying constraints to the opportunities to be presented. One or more “hard” filters may be applied to the data, and opportunities that do not satisfy the hard filters may be removed from the opportunities that may be presented to the user (560).
System 108 may obtain business requirements (565) to be applied to the opportunities (e.g., maximum or minimum number of opportunities to be presented, requirement that opportunities do not reduce ROI or clicks for customer, requirement that opportunity costs do not exceed profits for seller, etc.) and may optimize or constrain the opportunities based on the business requirements (570).System 108 may then generate the final opportunity recommendations (575) and the information regarding the recommendations may be presented to the user (580). In some implementations, one or more information items relating to the soft filters may be presented as well. In some implementations, the outcome of the recommendations (whether or not the user adopted the opportunities) may be analyzed and used to refine the models to improve future recommendations provided by system 108 (585). In some implementations, the refinements may be made automatically in a self-learning and/or self-evaluating manner without further intervention by the user. - Referring now to
FIG. 6 , adisplay image 600 that shows example final opportunity recommendation information that may be presented to a user is shown according to an illustrative implementation.Image 600 includes an identifier for the account and a name of the customer.Image 600 also includes an adoption likelihood value presented as a percentage along with an average adoption likelihood value associated with the analyzed opportunities.Image 600 includes a revenue uplift and clicks uplift value, each represented by an expected percentage increase in revenue/clicks.Image 600 includes a final opportunity value, which is represented in the example as a monetary value associated with the opportunity over a financial quarter. -
Image 600 also includes some selected “soft” filters or signals used in determining the opportunity value. In the illustrated example,image 600 displays a percentage decrease in throttled impressions month-over-month, an average number of content publication groups with a bid increase in the last four weeks, an average number of keywords with a bid increase in the last four weeks, a click through rate on content published in relation to a search engine over the last month, an average quality score associated with the search-related content over the last month, a budget utilization value for the last month, a percentage increase in budget over the last month, and an indicator of whether or not the customer has opted into mobile and/or video-based content publication programs over the last month. It should be understood that the information presented inimage 600 is merely illustrative, and, in other implementations, various other types of signals, data, and/or other information may be presented to the user. - It may be challenging to find a clean control or treated group to estimate the impact of the methods and systems described herein on evaluating available opportunities. One method of solving this issue is to utilize a random experiment approach to evaluate the impact. Determining the minimum sample account size, or headcount, for the experiments and re-setting the performance targets of the users are the main issues in the random experiment approach. A statistical tool for estimating the experiment headcount may be developed where users can make assumptions and look up the suggested headcount. An example look-up chart 700 for suggested headcount is provided in
FIG. 7 according to an illustrative implementation. In some implementations, advanced users may be provided with an interface to access functions for training, validating, and/or scoring opportunities using a number of statistical and/or machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, etc.). In some implementations, the training and scoring processes may be automated and implemented in R and dremel/tenzing queries. In some such implementations, the users may be allowed to access, monitor, and/or modify aspects of the queries and/or apply their own prediction models on the training data set to compare the performance. - In some implementations, the recommendation model may be built at a geo-vertical level or a hierarchical level. In some implementations, the capacity of the models may be extended by calling efficient packages (e.g., C++, Java, etc.), such as Seti, Weka, etc. In some implementations, regularization methods and model averaging methods (e.g., bagging or boosting) may be used to improve the opportunity explanations and/or recommendations.
