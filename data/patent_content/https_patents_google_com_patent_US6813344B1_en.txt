Definitions
- the present invention relates to caller identification. More specifically, the present invention pertains to a method and system that enables caller identification look-up functions to be performed with partial phone numbers.
- Computer systems and other electronic devices have become integral tools that are used extensively to perform a wide variety of useful operations in modern society.
- Computer systems along with other electronic devices are finding new applications as a result of advances in hardware technology and rapid development in software technology.
- the growing affordability of computer systems and electronic devices together with the abundance of useful new applications contributes to strong demand for such systems and devices.
- PDA Personal Digital Assistant
- the PDA is usually a battery-powered device that is typically used as an electronic organizer having the capability to store and display a wide range of information which can include numerous addresses and telephone numbers of business and personal acquaintances, financial information, daily appointments, along with various other personal information. As such, the PDA is able to consolidate a wide variety of information and make the information easily accessible by its user. Therefore, PDAs are very useful and have gained wide popularity.
- Caller identification provides the called party with the name and/or telephone number of the calling party.
- Caller identification is usually provided to a customer by its local central office. Most often, each central office has access to a local database containing telephone numbers and the corresponding names of people within its local area. Before connecting a call to the called party, the central office searches its database for the telephone number of the calling party. If the telephone number is found within the database, the name corresponding to that number will be accessed and are delivered to the called party by the central office using a predetermined protocol.
- the service cannot provide a name to the called party.
- a service may deliver only the phone number and a message indicating that the calling party's name is unavailable. This is an undesirable result for a customer who wants to know information about the party calling.
- the caller ID function provides only the phone number of the calling party. Unless a phone number has been previously programmed into the phone, the resulting display only provides the phone number of the caller. Without any further information about the caller, except the caller's phone number, the user may not know anything about the caller thereby loosing the benefits of caller ID.
- the present invention uses a Personal Digital Assistant and a caller ID to provide detailed information to a called party.
- the called party can retrieve information about the caller even if the caller ID does not provide the name of the caller.
- a caller identification system and method are disclosed to permit caller identification of partial phone numbers.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide a flexible and programmable caller identification system that can provide information about phone numbers not previously recorded in a caller ID database.
- the caller ID system can be integrated into a portable electronic device, e.g., a portable computer system to further expand the capabilities of a partial information caller identification system.
- the caller ID service can't provide the name of the caller
- the PDA is queried to give any information that corresponds to the telephone number of the caller.
- the PDA could have a stored database of area codes and corresponding cities.
- the PDA When a call is received, and no caller ID information is supplied, the PDA could be queried to provide the name of the city that corresponds to the area code of where the call was coming from. Likewise, the PDA can have a stored database of telephone prefixes of cellular phone carriers. This would allow a user to be notified that a call was originated from a cellular phone and be provided information about the caller such as the cellular provider the caller is using.
- Embodiments of the present invention include a caller identification system and method for identifying a caller with a partial phone number look-up table.
- the caller identification system comprises a database that stores received calls and can be personalized to include information specific to partial phone numbers.
- the caller identification system disclosed can be integrated into a cellular phone.
- an incoming call initiates a search in a database to retrieve information about the caller. If a match is found, the identity of the caller is displayed. When an exact match is not found, a search for a partial match is executed and information about the partial match is displayed.
- Information for a partial match can be personalized or pre-programmed into the caller ID system such as the city associated with a particular area code or prefix.
- phone numbers with wild card flags can be programmed into the database to facilitate this type of search.
- a Personal Digital Assistant is coupled to the caller identification system.
- the caller identification system comprises a telephone sub-circuit for receiving telephone calls, caller identification logic for receiving caller identification, a memory for storing a database of received and pre-programmed phone numbers and partial phone numbers, and a processor for determining a match or the closest match between the incoming caller ID information and the caller ID information stored in the database.

- FIG. 4 is an illustration of a database 400 with partial phone numbers as used in one embodiment of the present invention.
- Many caller ID systems especially caller ID systems on cellular phones, will not display the name of the caller if the exact number is not previously programmed into the phone.
- a caller ID system would use a database of partial phone numbers with wild card values therein to retrieve information about the caller even if the phone number of the caller has not been previously stored.
- a telephone number area code usually depicts where the call originates. If the area code of a telephone number is known, a simple look up table can be used to determine the geographical location of the caller. For example, FIG. 4 illustrates an identifier column 401 with a corresponding phone number column 402 . In addition, FIG. 4 shows an incoming phone number entry 403 . Incoming phone number entry 403 represents the caller ID information received with a call. If a call is received and the entry is not programmed into the database, the caller ID system of the present invention will look in the database for a close match of the phone number received. As in FIG. 4, if a call is received form the 408 area code, the caller ID system of the present invention will display “Santa Clara Colo.” to alert the user of the geographic location of where the call originated.
- the caller ID system will display which cellular service provider the call originated from. Furthermore, the database 400 contains an entry “San Jose” and the partial match is (408) 321-****. If a call received contains the 408 area code and 321 prefix, it can be assumed that the call received is from the same city as the partial match and the caller ID system will display the city the call originated from.
- the partial match database 400 can be useful for determining calls originating from a particular business or company. For example, in a commercial telephone system (if it has a multitude of phone lines) all numbers share a similar area code and prefix. Different phone numbers are given to each phone in the company usually designated by an extension. In FIG. 4, there is an entry named “Work” and the partial match is (408) 123-45**. If a the phone number of a call received reads (408) 123-4567, the caller ID system will alert that “Work” is calling. In this embodiment, the call is known to originate from “Work” even though an exact match is not listed in the database. Furthermore, if the phone number of a call received reads (555) 555-5555, the caller ID system will look to database 400 and find the exact match for the phone number and will return the identifier “John Doe.”
- Database 400 also contains generic names and partial matches.
- the database 400 is pre-programmed to contain likely partial matches such as area codes and prefixes.
- the database is pre-programmed with generic data and can be personalized by the user to contain unique partial matches. The user can manipulate the database to contain the preferred partial matches for calls most likely received. For example, one can enter the area code and prefix of a workplace to recognize calls received from work.
- personalized ring tones can be programmed according to different types of calls. For example, a call received from a cellular phone can have a different ring tone than one that is received from a land line.
- database 400 can be updated by connecting to the internet and downloading generic caller information such as area codes and prefixed to indicate geographic locations of incoming calls.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram 500 of a caller ID system in accordance with the present invention.
- the device is a hand held device 100 .
- the wireless device may be another type of intelligent electronic device.
- a telephone call is received by phone circuit 111 and the phone number associated with the incoming call is extracted by caller ID circuit 110 .

- database 109 there exists a plurality of exact matches, partial phone numbers and wild card entries. If a match is found, the information associated to the database entry is displayed on display device 105 .
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram 600 of the process of determining a caller from a partial match database on an electronic device.
- First a telephone call is received 601 .
- the call wakes up the PDA 602 .
- an incoming phone call wakes the PDA from a sleep mode 602 .
- the caller's name will be displayed 606 . If a partial match is found, the information attached to the partial match will be displayed. In one embodiment, a tone is produced when a match is found and it is different depending on the identification of the caller.
