- CELP encoder 100 a block diagram of a CELP encoder 100 of the prior art is shown.
- an input signal s(n) is applied to a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis block 101 , where linear predictive coding is used to estimate a short-term spectral envelope.
- LPC Linear Predictive Coding
- the resulting spectral parameters (or LP parameters) are denoted by the transfer function A(z).
- the spectral parameters are applied to an LPC Quantization block 102 that quantizes the spectral parameters to produce quantized spectral parameters A q that are suitable for use in a multiplexer 108 .
- the quantized spectral parameters A q are then conveyed to multiplexer 108 , and the multiplexer produces a coded bit-stream based on the quantized spectral parameters and a set of codebook-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , that are determined by a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 .
- the quantized spectral, or LP, parameters are also conveyed locally to an LPC synthesis filter 105 that has a corresponding transfer function 1/A q (Z).
- LPC synthesis filter 105 also receives a combined excitation signal u(n) from a first combiner 110 and produces an estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) based on the quantized spectral parameters A q and the combined excitation signal u(n).
- Combined excitation signal u(n) is produced as follows.
- An adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ is selected from an adaptive codebook (ACB) 103 based on an index parameter ⁇ .
- the adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ is then weighted based on a gain parameter ⁇ 109 and the weighted adaptive codebook code-vector is conveyed to first combiner 110 .
- a fixed codebook code-vector c k is selected from a fixed codebook (FCB) 104 based on an index parameter k.
- the fixed codebook code-vector c k is then weighted based on a gain parameter ⁇ 108 and is also conveyed to first combiner 110 .
- First combiner 110 then produces combined excitation signal u(n) by combining the weighted version of adaptive codebook code-vector c ⁇ with the weighted version of fixed codebook code-vector c k .
- Contents of the ACB 103 are then updated using a delayed version of signal u(n) by subframe length L.
- LPC synthesis filter 105 conveys the input signal estimate ⁇ (n) to a second combiner 112 .
- Second combiner 112 also receives input signal s(n) and subtracts the estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) from the input signal s(n).
- the difference between input signal s(n) and input signal estimate ⁇ (n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 106 , which filter produces a perceptually weighted error signal e(n) based on the difference between ⁇ (n) and s(n) and a weighting function W(z).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 .
- Squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107 uses the error signal e(n) to determine an optimal set of codebook-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ that produce the best estimate ⁇ (n) of the input signal s(n).
- FIG. 2 generally depicts a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) decoder 200 as is known in the art.
- the excitation sequence or “codevector” c k is generated from a fixed codebook 204 (FCB) using the appropriate codebook index k. This signal is scaled using the FCB gain factor ⁇ 208 to produce a first synthetic signal.
- a codevector c ⁇ is generated from an adaptive codebook 203 (ACB) and scaled by a factor ⁇ 207 , which is used to model the long term (or periodic) component of a speech signal (with period ⁇ ) to produce a second synthetic signal.
- ACB adaptive codebook 203
- the combiner 210 adds the first synthetic signal and the second synthetic signal to produce the total excitation u (n), which is used as the input to the LPC synthesis filter 205 , which models the coarse short term spectral shape, commonly referred to as “formants”, to produce the output. Additionally, the total excitation signal u (n) is used as the adaptive codebook for the next block of synthesized speech.
- decoder 200 of the prior art corresponds to encoder 100 .
- the coded bit-stream produced by encoder 100 is used by a demultiplexer 202 in decoder 200 to decode the optimal set of codebook-related parameters, that is, ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , in a process that is reverse to the synthesis process performed by encoder 100 .
- the coded bit-stream produced by encoder 100 is received by decoder 200 without errors, the speech ⁇ (n) output by decoder 200 can be reconstructed as an exact duplicate of the input speech estimate ⁇ (n) produced by encoder 100 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary encoder 300 of the prior art that utilizes a nearly equivalent, and yet more practical, system to the encoding system illustrated by encoder 100 .
- the variables are given in terms of their z-transforms.
- E ⁇ ( z ) W ⁇ ( z ) ⁇ S ⁇ ( z ) - W ⁇ ( z ) A q ⁇ ( z ) ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ C ⁇ ⁇ ( z ) + ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ C k ⁇ ( z ) ) . ( 2 )
- W(z)S(z) corresponds to a weighted version of the input signal.
- the filter states need not be explicitly defined.
- a formula can be derived for minimization of a weighted version of the perceptually weighted error, that is, ⁇ e ⁇ 2 , by squared error minimization/parameter block 107 .
- the ACB component may be optimized first (by assuming the FCB contribution is zero), and then the FCB component is optimized using the given (previously optimized) ACB component.
- the ACB/FCB gains that is, codebook-related parameters ⁇ and ⁇ , may or may not be re-optimized, that is, quantized, given the sequentially selected ACB/FCB code-vectors c ⁇ and c k .
- Equation 11 arg ⁇ ⁇ min ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x w T ⁇ x w - ( x w T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ) 2 c ⁇ T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ⁇ , ( 11 )
- ⁇ * is an optimal ACB index parameter, that is, an ACB index parameter that minimizes the value of the bracketed expression. Since x w is not dependent on ⁇ , Equation 11 can be rewritten as follows:
- Equation 13 arg ⁇ ⁇ max ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( x w T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ) 2 c ⁇ T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc ⁇ ⁇ . ( 12 )
- Equation 10 can be simplified to:
- Equations 13 and 14 represent the two expressions necessary to determine the optimal ACB index ⁇ and ACB gain ⁇ in a sequential manner. These expressions can now be used to determine the sequentially optimal FCB index and gain expressions.
- the vector x w is produced by a first combiner 320 that subtracts a past excitation signal u(n ⁇ L), after filtering by a zero input response filter 306 , from an output s w (n) of a perceptual error weighting filter 310 .

- ⁇ Hc k is a filtered and weighted version of FCB code-vector c k , that is, FCB code-vector c k filtered by weighted synthesis filter 304 and then weighted based on FCB gain parameter ⁇ .
- Equation 16 arg ⁇ ⁇ max k ⁇ ⁇ ( x 2 T ⁇ Hc k ) 2 c k T ⁇ H T ⁇ Hc k ⁇ , ( 16 ) where k* is a sequentially optimal FCB index parameter, that is, an FCB index parameter that maximizes the value in the bracketed expression.
- FCB gain ⁇ arg ⁇ ⁇ max k ⁇ ⁇ ( d 2 T ⁇ c k ) 2 c k T ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ c k ⁇ , ( 17 ) in which the sequentially optimal FCB gain ⁇ is given as:
- encoder 300 provides a method and apparatus for determining the optimal excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ , in a sequential manner.
- the sequential determination of parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k, and ⁇ is actually sub-optimal since the optimization equations do not consider the effects that the selection of one codebook code-vector has on the selection of the other codebook code-vector.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) encoder 400 that implements an analysis-by-synthesis coding process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Encoder 400 is implemented in a processor, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art, that is in communication with one or more associated memory devices, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store data and programs that may be executed by the processor.
- RAM random access memory
- DRAM dynamic random access memory
- ROM read only memory
- encoder 400 employs multiple Adaptive Codebooks 402 , 403 and multiple Fixed Codebooks 404 , 405 and also Squared Error Minimization/Adaptive Bit Allocation/Parameter Quantization Unit 408 .
- a double-pole, multi-throw (DPMT) switch 406 that functions to select various complementary sets of Adaptive and Fixed Codebook contributions.
- the DPMT switch 406 is not limited to hardware, and can be a software configurable switch selectable by the error minimization/adaptive bit allocation unit 408 .
- the primary difference in the M sets of ACB and FCB codebooks is the respective bit allocation definitions.
- the bit allocation definitions describe the number of bits allotted to each codebook.
- the ACB/FCB configuration parameter m (1 ⁇ m ⁇ M) selects a combination of ACB/FCB that trades off bit allocation and bit rate based on the error minimization unit 408 .
- the error minimization/adaptive bit allocation unit 408 can determine a configuration, m, that provides a compromise between the bits allocated to the ACB and the bits allocated to the FCB for providing an optimal combination of encoding the input speech signal, s.
- the configuration parameter, m identifies the ACB and FCB codebooks that are to be employed during encoding.
- the configuration parameter, m can change during the encoding process for accurately modeling the input speech signal.
- the phonetic content of speech can vary such that differing contributions of the codebook can be warranted.
- speech can be composed of voiced and unvoiced portions.
- the contributions of the unvoiced portions and voiced portions can change over time.
- consonants are typical of unvoiced speech and having a more abrupt nature
- vowels are typical of voiced speech and having a more periodic nature.
- Unvoiced speech and speech onsets can rely heavily on the FCB contribution, while periodic signals such as steady state voiced speech can rely heavily on the ACB contribution.
- transition voiced speech can rely on a more balanced contribution from both the ACB and FCB.
- an embodiment of the present invention selects an ACB/FCB configuration m that optimizes the allocation of bits to the respective ACB/FCB contributions to balance the contribution of the ACB codebook and the FCB codebooks based on the content of speech for accurately modeling speech.
- the error minimization/bit allocation unit 408 determines the bit allocations that result in a minimum error, e, to produce the best estimate ⁇ (n) of the input signal s(n)
- Equation 13 may be modified to take the form:
- ⁇ m * arg ⁇ ⁇ max ⁇ m ⁇ ⁇ ( x w T ⁇ y ⁇ m ) 2 y ⁇ m T ⁇ y ⁇ m ⁇ , ( 19 )
- ⁇ m is the ACB codevector associated with the m th ACB
- ⁇ m ′ ( x w T ⁇ y ⁇ m * ) 2 y ⁇ m * T ⁇ y ⁇ m * . ( 21 )
- y ⁇ m * is the filtered ACB vector resulting from the optimal ACB parameter of codebook m, that is ⁇ m *.
- the ACB/FCB configuration m may be selected based on the maximum value of the parameter ⁇ m ′ which corresponds to the filtered ACB codevector y ⁇ m *, that produces the minimum squared error.
- maximizing the error expression ⁇ m ′ corresponds to minimizing the error, e.
- the first ACB codebooks 402 is evaluated to determine which of the codevectors, ⁇ 1 , in the first ACB codebook produces the smallest error.
- the codevector that produces the smallest error is considered the optimal codevector for the first codebook, ⁇ 1 *.
- the second ACB codebook 402 is evaluated to determine which of the codevectors, ⁇ 2 , in the ACB codebook produces the smallest error.
- the code vector that produces the smallest error is considered the optimal codevector for the second codebook, ⁇ 2 *.
- Each of the M codebooks is evaluated for the codevector that produces the smallest error, ⁇ m *. Accordingly, each codebook will have an optimal codevector that produces the minimum error for that codebook.
- Each of the codevectors in a first codebook can be represented by a certain number of bits, for example N bits.
- each of the codevectors in the second codebook can be represented by a certain number of bits that is more than the number of bits in the preceding codebook, for example N+B bits.
- the number of bits used to represent the codevectors in each codebook 1 to M can increase with each codebook to increase the codevector resolution. Increasing the bits can increase the modeling resolution of the codevectors.
- the set of codevectors in one codebook differs from a set of codevectors in another codebook by the number of bits assigned to the codevectors in the codebook.
- the first codebook, ACB 1 ( 402 ) may allocate 4 bits for the codevectors in that codebook.
- the second codebook ACB 2 may allocate 8 bits for the codevectors in that codebook. Understandably, increasing the number of bits can improve the modeling performance for certain portions of speech. For example, an adaptive codebook having codevectors with a high number of bits may accurately model voiced speech. However, a fixed codebook may not require that same number of bits to represent the voiced speech. In contrast, a fixed codebook having codevectors with a high number of bits may accurately model unvoiced speech. However, an adaptive codebook may not require that same number of bits to represent the unvoiced speech. Accordingly, the number of bits allocated to the codevectors of the codebooks can be disproportionately assigned to take advantage of the changing nature of speech.
- an initial first excitation vector c ⁇ m is generated by an adaptive codebook 402 based on an excitation vector-related parameter ⁇ m sourced to the mth adaptive codebook by the error minimization unit 408 .
- c ⁇ 1 is an adaptive codebook (ACB) code-vector.
- adaptive codebook 402 is a long-term predictor (LTP) filter and parameter ⁇ m is a lag corresponding to a selection of a past excitation signal u(n ⁇ L) for the mth adaptive codebook; that is, the adaptive codebook is a pitch related codebook.
- LTP long-term predictor
- the initial first excitation vector c ⁇ m is conveyed to a first zero state weighted synthesis filter 303 that has a corresponding transfer function H zs (z), or in matrix notation H.
- the filtered initial first excitation vector y ⁇ m is then weighted by a first gain 109 based on an initial first excitation vector-related gain parameter ⁇ and the weighted, filtered initial first excitation vector, ⁇ Hc ⁇ m , or first synthetic signal ⁇ y ⁇ m , is conveyed to second combiner 321
- Second combiner 321 then conveys intermediate signal x 2 (n), or vector x 2 , to a third combiner 307 .
- Third combiner 307 also receives a weighted, filtered version of an initial second excitation vector c km preferably a fixed codebook (FCB) code-vector.
- FCB fixed codebook
- the initial second excitation vector c km is generated by a fixed codebook 404 , preferably a fixed codebook (FCB), based on an initial second excitation vector-related index parameter k, preferably an FCB index parameter.
- the initial second excitation vector c km is conveyed to a second zero state weighted synthesis filter 304 that also has a corresponding transfer function H zs (z), or in matrix notation H.
- the filtered initial second excitation vector y km (n), or y km is then weighted by a second gain 108 based on an initial second excitation vector-related gain parameter ⁇ .
- the weighted, filtered initial second excitation vector Hc km , or signal y km is then also conveyed to third combiner 307 .
- Third combiner 307 subtracts the weighted, filtered initial second excitation vector ⁇ Hc km , or signal y km from the intermediate signal x 2 (n), or intermediate vector x 2 , to produce a perceptually weighted error signal e(n), or e.
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to the error minimization unit 408 , preferably a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block that includes adaptive bit allocation.
- the error minimization unit 408 can adjust the gain elements ⁇ and ⁇ to minimize the perceptually weighted error signal, or mean squared error criterion, e(n).
- Error minimization/bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 uses the error signal e(n) to jointly determine multiple excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k and ⁇ that optimize the performance of encoder 400 by minimizing a squared sum of the error signal e(n) 308 .
- the optimization includes identifying the bit-allocations for the ACB and FCB that produce the optimal first and second excitation vectors.
- optimization of index parameters ⁇ and k that is, a determination of ⁇ * and k*
- optimization of index parameters ⁇ and k results in a generation ( 526 ) of the optimal first excitation vector c ⁇ m * by the adaptive codebook 402 , and the optimal second excitation vector c km * by the fixed codebook 403 .
- Optimization of parameters ⁇ and ⁇ , with regard to the M bit-allocated codebooks respectively results in optimal weightings of the filtered versions of the optimal excitation vectors c ⁇ m * and c km *, thereby producing a best estimate of the input signal s(n).
- error minimization unit 408 of encoder 400 determines the optimal set of excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ m , ⁇ , k m and ⁇ by evaluating M codebook bit allocations and gain scalings that are non-sequential. By performing a bit allocation and gain scaling process during error minimization, a determination of excitation vector-related parameters ⁇ m , ⁇ , k m and ⁇ can be optimized that are interdependent among one another. That is, the effects of the selection of one excitation vector has on the selection of the other excitation vector is taken into consideration in the optimization of each parameter.
- the parameters ⁇ m , ⁇ , k m and ⁇ are dependent on the bit-allocations for each of the M codebook configurations.
- the various bit-allocations produce excitation vectors c ⁇ m * and c km * having resolutions dependent on the allocated number of bits to the codebook. Understandably, certain portions of speech may require more or less bits from the ACB and FCB codebooks for accurately modeling the speech. Error minimization/bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 can identify the optimal bit-allocations for producing the best estimate of speech.
- the optimization process identifies the bit-allocations for the adaptive codebook and the bit-allocations for the fixed codebook that together produce the best estimate of the input signal s(n).
- Error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 selects a codebook configuration parameter, m, based on a first and a second performance metric.
- the codebook configuration parameter, m in effect, identifies a first distribution of bits for a first adaptive (pitch-related) codebook and a second distribution of bits for a second adaptive (pitch-related) codebook.
- the configuration parameter, m identifies the codebook which corresponds to a particular bit-allocation.
- Error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 can identify a distribution of bits (a codebook configuration m) for adaptive codebook 402 through 403 and fixed codebook 404 through 405 that minimizes the power of the weighted error signal e(n). Error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 can identify a bit-allocation that results in the minimum closed loop analysis-by-synthesis error.
- a configuration can be selected.
- a first adaptive codebook, ACB 1 can be evaluated to produce a first performance metric (weighted error) ⁇ 1 ′ and a second performance metric (prediction gain) ⁇ 1 in accordance with the operational aspects of the invention described in FIG. 4 .
- all codevectors in the N bit ACB 1 codebook can be evaluated for minimizing the mean square error, e, of FIG. 4 .
- the metric ⁇ 1 ′ and the prediction gain ⁇ 1 that achieves the minimum error can be determined.
- a second codebook, ACB 2 can be evaluated to produce error metric ⁇ 2 ′ and prediction gain ⁇ 2 in accordance with the operational aspects of the invention described in FIG. 4 .
- the respective error metrics ⁇ 1 ′ and ⁇ 2 ′ can be compared.
- a secondary check on the relative ACB performance can ensure that noise or other potentially anomalies do not contribute to a false positive. Accordingly, a second comparison of prediction gains ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 determines if the prediction gain of ACB 2 is significantly greater than the prediction gain of ACB 1 .
- the error minimization unit/adaptive bit allocation unit 408 generates and evaluates the error metrics and the prediction gains for selecting the codebook configuration. For example, a first configuration can be evaluated against a second configuration, and the second configuration can be selected if the performance metrics of the second configuration exceed the first configuration with respect to the error bias and the prediction gain bias.
- the error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 assesses the performance modeling errors for each of the ACB and FCB codebooks and identifies the bit-allocation for these codebooks that provide the least error; that is, the contribution of each codebook that provides the highest modeling performance. For example, the error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 evaluates each of the m ACB codebooks to determine the list of m codevectors, ⁇ m , producing the smallest error. The Error minimization unit 408 selects the codebook having the codevector producing the smallest error.
- the Error minimization/adaptive bit allocation/parameter quantization unit 408 also evaluates each of the m FCB codebooks, k m , to determine the list of m codevectors producing the smallest error.
- the Error minimization unit 408 selects the codebook having the codevector producing the smallest error; that is, the codebook that corresponds to the maximum value of the parameter ⁇ m ′ in EQ (12)
- each of the codebooks are assigned a different number of bits to represent the codevectors in the codebook.
- the number of bits assigned to each codebook are fixed, and the number of adaptive and fixed codebooks are fixed.
- the Error minimization unit 408 identifies the codebook configuration providing the optimal bit-allocation prior to a determination of the multiple codebook related parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , k and ⁇ .
- bits can be allocated dynamically (adaptively) to the codevectors during an encoding. Namely, the error minimization unit 408 can increase or decrease the number of bits in a codebook for one or more codevectors to maximize a performance metric.
- bits can be allocated between the adaptive codebook 402 and the fixed codebook 404 to increase or decrease the codevector resolution in order to minimize the error criterion, e 308 .
- the Error minimization unit 408 can dynamically allocate the bits in a non-sequential order based on the first and second performance metric. That is, the bit allocations for the adaptive codebook and the fixed codebooks can occur dynamically within the same codebook.
- Error minimization unit 408 identifies a configuration, m, for a codebook which provides an optimal compromise between the quality of the first synthetic signals generated by the ACB and the quality of the second synthetic signals generated by the FCB. The optimal configuration produces the minimum error.

- Table 1 shows two bit assignment configurations available for an encoding implementation having two codebooks, ACB and FCB.
- the number of bits allocated is not limited to those shown in Table 1, which are provided only as example.
- the configurations can be stored in a data memory and accessed by the Error minimization unit/Adaptive Bit Allocation unit 408 .
- the total number of bits available to both the codebooks is 32.
- a configuration identifies the allocation of bits to each of the codebooks.
- the arrangement of the codebooks and their respective codevectors may be varied without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- Embodiments of the invention are not limited to only two codebooks, and more than two codebooks are herein contemplated.
- the first codebook may be a fixed codebook
- the second codebook may be an adaptive codebook.
- the dynamic bit-allocation strategy of the invention can be applied to Factorial Pulse Coding.
- an associated “track” defines the allowable positions for each of the three pulses within c k (3 bits per pulse plus I bit for composite sign of +, ⁇ , + or ⁇ , +, ⁇ ).
- pulse 1 can occupy positions 0 , 7 , 14 , . . . , 49
- pulse 2 can occupy positions 2 , 9 , 16 , . . . , 51
- pulse 3 can occupy positions 4 , 11 , 18 , . . . , 53 . This is known as “interleaved pulse permutation,” which is well known in the art.
- the excitation codevector c k is not generally robust enough to model different phonetic aspects of the input speech.
- the primary reason for this is that there are too few pulses which are constrained to too small a vector space.
- Each pulse takes a certain number of bits, for example, 4 bits per pulse.
- embodiments of the invention can assign more or less bits to the FCB for increasing or decreasing the number of pulses to adequately represent certain portions of speech.
- the number of pulses can be decreased for certain portions of speech, and the bits used for the pulse in the FCB can be applied to the codevectors of the ACB. In this manner, bits can be allocated between the ACB and the FCB for producing codebook configurations optimized for certain types of speech that are encoded using factorial packing.
- a single ACB 402 and a single FCB 404 can be selected in which bits can be allocated to the two codebooks.
- ACB 402 can be a Delay Contour Adjustment ACB, as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 6,236,960
- the FCB 404 can be a Factorial Pulse Codebook (FPC) for the FCB as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960 (although any ACB/FCB structures may be used).
- the delay adjustment parameter can correspond to a lag term which may be representative of a pitch period.
- the delay contour can correspond to a change in the pitch. For example, the pitch of the speech may slowly vary over time during monotone activity, or it may rapidly change over time such as the case during vocal inflections. If the pitch of the voice does not vary, or change, the delay contour can be zero. Accordingly, zero bits will be assigned to the pitch parameter since the pitch information can be retrieved from a previous encoding.
- the FCB uses a 6 pulse FCB, comprising 31 bits for the FPC over a subframe length of 54. Understandably, more pulses can be assigned to represent the codevector of the FCB since the bits to represent these pulses are allocated away from the ACB.
- the number of pulses used in an FCB can be determined through table look up. For example, a 5 bit pulse corresponds to an index in an FCB table that determines the number of bits assigned to the FCB codeword for representing the 5 bit pulse. The index is equal to the order of the pulse configuration in the total order.
- the total number of bits assigned to both codebooks is a constant for this particular example. That is, the total number of bits for each configuration is the same for each value of m.
- Table 1 is only an exemplary embodiment illustrating the principles of dynamic bit allocation between codebooks.
- the selection of a configuration m can be performed in a manner that dedicates more bits to the ACB in cases where the improvement due to the increased resolution in the ACB parameters exceeds the relative degradation due to the FCB when reducing the number of pulses from 6 to 5.
- a comprehensive error minimization on all the codevectors of the codebooks can be conducted to determine the optimal bit-allocations.
- Such an exhaustive procedure can be computationally demanding, and an alternate, more appropriate, solution can be employed.
- the lower complexity method uses a biased ACB error minimization process that justifies the reduction of bits in the FCB. In principle, more bits are allocated to the FCB when the performance is significantly greater than that using fewer bits. The performance can be measured with regard to minimizing the error. For example, a bias term (as shown in FIG.
- the bias term reveals the degree of improvement necessary to justify an increased allocation of bits from the fixed codebook to the adaptive codebook.
- the bias terms determine when the quality of one codebook contribution exceeds the quality by a second codebook contribution.
- the ACB configuration corresponding to the fewest bits can be evaluated according to the expression:
- ⁇ 1 * arg ⁇ ⁇ max ⁇ 1 ⁇ ⁇ ( x w T ⁇ y ⁇ 1 ) 2 y ⁇ 1 T ⁇ y ⁇ 1 ⁇ , ( 22 ) to produce an error metric:
- the long-term prediction gain may also be calculated to include in the selection of a configuration m, defined as:
- ⁇ m ⁇ x w ⁇ 2 ⁇ x w - y ⁇ m * ⁇ 2 . ( 24 )
- the methods herein described are applied to subframe encoding.
- a codebook configuration can be selected for each subframe of a frame of speech.
- the bits required to represent the coding configuration and the bits required to represent the codebooks can be combined into a single combined codeword.
- the single combined codeword can take advantage of coding redundancies when combining the bits of the subframes.
- an efficient coding method can applied to the bits to minimize overhead related to the ACB/FCB configuration information.
- a Huffman coding scheme can be applied to the bits to achieve higher data compression.
- a subframe configuration requires a single bit for providing two states, and there are three subframes which require a minimum of 3 bits.
- the configurations can be coded using a variable rate code, such as a Huffman code, to reduce the overhead due to the coding of the M configurations.
- Table 2 illustrates an exemplary coding configuration using Huffman coding wherein the number of bits varies as a function of the number of pulses per subframe.
- Table 2 identifies the number of Huffman code, the pulses per subframe, the number of Huffman bits, the allocation of bits between the ACB and FCB, and the total number of bits.
- the total number of bits is a constant that is the sum of the Huffman code bits, ACB bits, and FCB bits.
- the notation 6-6-5 under pulses per subframe, describes the number of pulses per subframe for a frame of speech. For example, 6-6-5 states that there are 6 subframes in subframe 1 , 6 pulses in subframe 2 , and 5 pulses in subframe 3 .
- the proportion of voiced and unvoiced portions in speech is balanced more towards voiced content. That is, most of speech is more voiced than unvoiced. Accordingly, a shorter Huffman code for unvoiced regions of speech provides more coding bits for the FCB, and longer Huffman codes corresponding to voiced speech provides more coding bits to the ACB.
- the corresponding number of ACB parameter bits is 2 per subframe. That is, each subframe requiring 5 pulses allocates 2 bits to the ACB. For example, frame 6-6-5 allocates 2 bits to the ACB, frame 6-5-5 allocates 2+2 bits to the ACB, and so on. Understandably, embodiments of the invention are not restricted to only 5 and 6 bits, or 2 bits per pulse. More or less than this number of bits can be employed for the purposes of variable length subframe coding. It should also be noted, in the particular example of Table 2, that when a pulse representing 4 bits is allocated from the FCB to the ACB, 2 of the bits are allocated to the ACB and the remaining 2 bits are allocated to the Huffman codeword.
- a speech frame can be represented by one or more subframes.
- a codebook configuration selector can determine a codebook configuration parameter for each subframe.
- the codebook configuration parameters of the subframes can be encoded into a single variable length codeword. Accordingly, increased compression can be achieved by taking advantage of the variable length coding scheme used to represent the number of pulses in the FCB.
- Table 2 an alternate representation of Table 2 is shown.
- the configurations per subframe are shown in place of the pulses per subframe (Column 2), and the ACB bits per subframe are shown in place of the ACB bits (Column 4).
- the configurations per subframe reveal the codebook configuration, m, for each of the subframes with reference to Table 1.
- 6-5-6 pulses per subframe in Table 2 corresponds to a 1-2-2 codebook configuration in the three respective subframes. Accordingly, the number of bits for each subframe changes by 2 bits depending on the number of pulses. Recall each pulse removed from the FCB requires 4 bits, though 2 bits are distributed to the ACB and 2 bits are distributed to the Huffman code. For instance, a 5 pulse FCB thus requires 2 bits, whereas a 6 pulse FCB thus requires 0 bits.
- the number of bits distributed between the ACB and the codeword fore each FCB pulse are not limited to this arrangement. More or less than 2 bits can be allocated to the ACB and the Huffman code.
- the bits for each of the codebooks can be combined into a single codeword. That is, the FCB bits for all 3 subframes can be combined together to form a large composite codeword, the method of which is described in the related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/383,506, filed on the same day and contained herein.
- the FCB bits can be efficiently encoded using a combinational factorial packing algorithm.
- the combinatorial algorithm provides an information segregation property that is more robust to bit errors.
- FCB Bits
- the error minimization unit/bit allocation unit/parameter quantization 408 can perform the parameter quantization and the coding which includes combinatorial coding, variable length Huffman coding, and factorial packing.
- a flowchart 600 of subframe encoding is shown.
- the flowchart 600 is similar in principle to the flowchart 500 . It should be noted, that reference will be made to FIG. 4 for illustrating the method steps. However, the method 600 can be practiced in more or fewer than the number of steps shown.
- the method 600 determines the codebook configuration providing the optimal bit-allocations to the codebooks for producing the best estimate of the encoded speech, in a least square errors sense.
- the method 600 can start.
- a set of M codebook configurations can be searched and a first codebook configuration parameter m can be produced at step 606 .
- the error minimization unit 408 can generate M error performance metrics for the M ACB 402 - 403 set in accordance with the processing previously described in FIG. 4 .
- m arg max ⁇ 1 ′, . . . , ⁇ M ′ ⁇ , That is, a performance metric can be generated for each of the M ACB codebooks, from which a configuration parameter m is selected.
- the codebook configuration corresponding to the maximum performance metric for the first codebook and the second codebook can be selected. More than two codebooks can be provided though only two are shown for exemplary illustration. The principles of operation can be equally applied to two more codebook sets which is herein contemplated. In one arrangement, the number of codebook sets can equal the number of codebook configurations, M.
- the method steps 602 to 606 can be repeated for each of the subframes.
- the multiple codebook-related parameters ⁇ m , ⁇ , k m and ⁇ can be determined in the manner as described in accordance with FIG. 3 .
- the M configurations of the N subframes can be coded based on Table 2.
- the codebook configuration and multiple codebook-related parameters can be combined using variable length coding or combinatorial coding. Understandably, combinational coding techniques can be applied to the bits representing the codebook configuration parameters for each of the subframes. The bits of the subframes can be combined to reduce the overhead due to the coding of the multiple subframes.
- FIG. 7 depicts a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) decoder 700 using a selectable codebook configuration in accordance with the embodiments of the invention.
- the first excitation sequence or “codevector”, c ⁇ m is generated from one of the m adaptive codebooks 402 (ACB) using the appropriate codebook index, ⁇ m .
- the codevector c ⁇ m models the long term (or periodic) component having a period ⁇ of a speech signal.
- the codevector is scaled using the ACB gain factor ⁇ 109 to produce a first synthetic signal, ⁇ c ⁇ m .
- the second excitation sequence or “codevector” c km is generated from one of the fixed codebooks 404 (FCB) using the appropriate codebook index k m .
- This codevector is scaled using the FCB gain factor ⁇ 208 to produce a second synthetic signal, ⁇ c km .
- the combiner 210 adds the first synthetic signal and the second synthetic signal to produce the total excitation u (n), which is used as the input to the LPC synthesis filter 205 .
- the LPC synthesis filter models the coarse short term spectral shape, commonly referred to as “formants”, to produce the speech output. Additionally, the total excitation signal u (n) is used as the adaptive codebook for the next block of synthesized speech.
- the demultiplexer 702 parses the codebook parameter from the coded bit-stream to determine the codebook selections. For example, the demultiplexer can parse the configuration parameter and determine m using Table 1 for identifying codebooks to use during decoding.
- the codebook-related parameters ⁇ m and k m identify the indexes to the appropriate ACB and FCB codebook, respectively.
- the parameters ⁇ and ⁇ identify the gain scaling applied by to the ACB and FCB codevectors, respectively. Recall, the multiple codebook-related parameters were determined after codebook configuration, m, was selected.
- the encoder 400 determined the multiple codebook-related parameters ⁇ m , ⁇ , k m and ⁇ through an error minimization process that included the optimal bit-allocation assignments and optimal gains scalings.
- the demultiplexer 702 parses the codebook parameter from the coded bit-stream to determine the bit allocations assigned to each codebook. For example, the demultiplexer 702 can identify the Huffman code from the received bit sequence and determine the number of bits used in the ACB and FCB codebooks according to Table 2.
- the demultiplexer 702 can identify the Huffman code which inherently identifies the codebook configuration; that is, the bit-allocation to the respective ACB and FCB. For instance, if the Huffman code is 100, according to Table 2, 2 bits can be assigned to ACB 402 , and 89 bits can be assigned to FCB 404 . In this particular arrangement, the remaining M-1 ACB codebooks and M-1 FCB codebooks are not employed; this is because the number of bits used by each codebook is established by the demultiplexer in view of the codebook configuration. For example, the first subframe includes 6 pulses from FCB, the second subframe includes 6 pulses from FCB, and the third subframe includes 5 pulses from FCB.
- the demultiplexer 702 can select the codebook configuration, m, from the demultiplexed bit stream for each speech frame, or subframe, in order to generate the first synthetic signal and second synthetic signal.
- Combiner 210 can combine the first synthetic signal and second synthetic signal into the excitation signal u(n) which is input to the synthesis filter 205 .
- the synthesis filter 205 can receive the filter coefficients, A q , from the demultiplexer 702 .
- the excitation sequence u(n) is passed through the synthesis filter 205 to eventually generate the output speech signal in accordance with the invention.
- FCB components which may utilize other scalable algebraic or fixed memory codebooks (such as VSELP) which may not occupy separate physical memories, but rather may share both codebook memory and/or program codes for execution and/or efficient implementation of the described method and apparatus.
- VSELP scalable algebraic or fixed memory codebooks
- the configuration selection criteria may be based purely on the final error signal which may be based on the combined ACB/FCB contributions, however, it should be noted that the complexity of such an embodiment may be significantly higher than the example described in the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
Abstract
Description
E(z)=W(z)(S(z)−Ŝ(z)). (1)
From this expression, the weighting function W(z) can be distributed and the input signal estimate ŝ(n) can be decomposed into the filtered sum of the weighted codebook code-vectors:
E(z)=S w(z)−H(z)(βC τ(z)+γC k(z)). (3)
By using z-transform notation, the filter states need not be explicitly defined. Now proceeding using vector notation, where the vector length L is a length of a current subframe, Equation 3 can be rewritten as follows by using the superposition principle:
e=s w −H(βc τ +γc k)−h zir, (4)
where:
-
- H is the L×L zero-state weighted synthesis convolution matrix formed from an impulse response of a weighted synthesis filter h(n), such as synthesis filters 303 and 304, and corresponding to a transfer function Hzs(z) or H(z), which matrix can be represented as:
-
- hzir is a L×1 zero-input response of H(z) 306 that is due to a state from a previous input,
- sw is the L×1 perceptually weighted input signal,
- β is the scalar adaptive codebook (ACB) gain,
- cτ is the L×1 ACB code-vector in response to index τ,
- γ is the scalar fixed codebook (FCB) gain, and
- ck is the L×1 FCB code-vector in response to index k.
By distributing H, and letting the input target vector xw=sw−hzir, the following expression can be obtained:
e=x w −βHc τ −γHc k. (6)
Equation 6 represents the perceptually weighted error (or distortion) vector e(n) produced by athird combiner 307 ofencoder 300 and coupled bycombiner 307 to a squared error minimization/parameter block 107.
ε=∥e∥ 2 =∥x w −βHc τ −γHc k∥2. (7)
ε=∥x w −βHc τ∥2 =x w T x w−2βx w T Hc τ+β2 c τ T H T Hc τ. (8)
Minimization of the squared error is then determined by taking the partial derivative of ε with respect to β and setting the quantity to zero:
This yields the optimal ACB gain:
where τ* is an optimal ACB index parameter, that is, an ACB index parameter that minimizes the value of the bracketed expression. Since xw is not dependent on τ, Equation 11 can be rewritten as follows:
Now, by letting yτ equal the ACB code-vector cτ filtered by
and likewise, Equation 10 can be simplified to:
ε=∥x 2 −γHc k∥2. (15)
where γHck is a filtered and weighted version of FCB code-vector ck, that is, FCB code-vector ck filtered by
where k* is a sequentially optimal FCB index parameter, that is, an FCB index parameter that maximizes the value in the bracketed expression. By grouping terms that are not dependent on k, that is, by letting d2 T=x2 TH and Φ=HTH, Equation 16 can be simplified to:
in which the sequentially optimal FCB gain γ is given as:
where τm is the ACB codevector associated with the mth ACB, and τm* is the optimal ACB index parameter for ACB m. From this expression, it may be possible to then select an ACB/FCB configuration using the expression:
m=arg max{ε1′, . . . ,εM′}, (20)
where εm′ is a form of the error expression which corresponds to:
where yτ

to produce an error metric:
Similar processing may then be performed for configuration m=2 to produce an error metric ε2′ corresponding to ACB parameter τ2*. The long-term prediction gain may also be calculated to include in the selection of a configuration m, defined as:
