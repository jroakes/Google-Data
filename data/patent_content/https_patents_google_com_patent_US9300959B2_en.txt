Definitions
- Video compression systems employ block processing for most of the compression operations.
- a block is a group of neighboring pixels and may be treated as one coding unit in terms of the compression operations. Theoretically, a larger coding unit is preferred to take advantage of correlation among immediate neighboring pixels.
- Various video compression standards e.g., Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG)-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4, use block sizes of 4 ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- MPEG Motion Picture Expert Group
- MPEG-4 use block sizes of 4 ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- High efficiency video coding is also a block-based hybrid spatial and temporal predictive coding scheme.
- HEVC partitions an input picture into square blocks referred to as coding tree units (CTUs) as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the CTU can be as large as 128 ⁇ 128 pixels.
- Each CTU can be partitioned into smaller square blocks called coding units (CUs).
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a CTU partition of CUs.
- a CTU 100 is first partitioned into four CUs 102 .
- Each CU 102 may also be further split into four smaller CUs 102 that are a quarter of the size of the CU 102 .
- CUs 102 - 1 , 102 - 3 , and 102 - 4 are a quarter of the size of CTU 100 . Further, a CU 102 - 2 has been split into four CUs 102 - 5 , 102 - 6 , 102 - 7 , and 102 - 8 .
- Each CU 102 may include one or more blocks, which may be referred to as prediction units (PUs).
- FIG. 3 shows an example of a CU partition of PUs.
- the PUs may be used to perform spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- a CU can be either spatially or temporally predictive coded. If a CU is coded in intra mode, each PU of the CU can have its own spatial prediction direction. If a CU is coded in inter mode, each PU of the CU can have its own motion vector(s) and associated reference picture(s).
- motion vectors are predictively coded in a temporal prediction process.
- a motion vector predictor MVP
- MVP motion vector predictor
- a single motion vector may be applied to a group of spatially neighboring or temporally collocated PUs. Using the same motion vector for a group of PUs also saves overhead.
- the encoder still needs to encode information to indicate to the decoder which temporally collocated PU was selected.
- a method determines a block of a current picture and a prediction type associated with the block. Also, the method determines one of a first list of reference pictures and a second list of reference pictures for the block. An encoder or a decoder selects the one of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures implicitly without communication of information between the encoder and the decoder indicating which of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures was selected. Then, the method sets a reference picture in the selected one of the first list of reference pictures and the second list of reference pictures as a collocated picture for the block. The selected reference picture is used in a temporal prediction process for the block.
- a method comprising: determining, by a computing device, a block of a current picture; determining, by the computing device, one of a first list of reference pictures and a second list of reference pictures for the block no matter what the prediction type associated with the block, wherein an encoder or a decoder always selects the one of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures for all blocks being encoded or decoded for at least a section of the current picture implicitly without communication of information between the encoder and the decoder indicating which of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures was selected; and setting, by the computing device, a reference picture in the selected one of the first list of reference pictures and the second list of reference pictures as a collocated picture for the block, wherein the selected reference picture is used in a temporal prediction process for the block.
- a decoder comprising: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: determining a block of a current picture; determining a prediction type associated with the block; determining one of a first list of reference pictures and a second list of reference pictures for the block, wherein the decoder selects the one of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures implicitly without receiving communication of information from an encoder indicating which of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures was selected; and setting a reference picture in the selected one of the first list of reference pictures and the second list of reference pictures as a collocated picture for the block, wherein the selected reference picture is used in a temporal prediction process in a decoding process for the block
- an encoder comprising: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: determining a block of a current picture; determining a prediction type associated with the block; determining one of a first list of reference pictures and a second list of reference pictures for the block, wherein the encoder selects the one of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures implicitly without sending information to a decoder indicating which of the first list of reference pictures or the second list of reference pictures was selected; and setting a reference picture in the selected one of the first list of reference pictures and the second list of reference pictures as a collocated picture for the block, wherein the selected reference picture is used in a temporal prediction process in an encoding process for the block.

- Encoder 402 and decoder 403 may encode and decode a bitstream using HEVC; however, other video compression standards may also be appreciated.
- Encoder 402 includes a collocated picture manager 404 - 1 and decoder 403 includes a collocated picture manager 404 - 2 .
- both collocated picture managers 404 - 1 and 404 - 2 “implicitly” determine which list, such as a list 0 or list 1 , to select a reference picture to use as a collocated picture for a current picture.
- the selected collocated picture includes motion vector (MV) information that can be used in a temporal prediction process.
- a motion vector for a partition in the collocated picture may be used as a candidate for a temporal motion vector predictor (MVP) in advanced motion vector prediction (AMVP) or as a temporal merge/skip candidate motion vector in a merge process.
- MVP temporal motion vector predictor
- AMVP advanced motion vector prediction
- the MVP or MV for the temporal merge/skip mode may be selected from a group of blocks that are spatially and collocated.
- a difference of the motion vector of the collocated block and the current motion vector of the current block is coded and sent from encoder 402 to decoder 403 .
- the motion vector of the collocated block is used in a merge process, the current block and the collocated block are merged and use the same motion vector of the collocated block.
- the temporal MVP or temporal merge/skip candidate MV is defined as the MV of a collocated block that resides in a reference picture and has the same geometrical position as a current block in the current picture.
- an associated collocated PU can reside in a preceding or subsequent PU in time.
- the collocated PU can be used as a candidate to enable MVP and merge/skip mode for the current PU.
- a collocated block can be provided for a transform unit (TU), CU or a picture itself. Subsequent discussion will reference a picture, although the same could apply to any of the listed subcomponents of a picture or a slice.
- a block may be referenced, which may be a PU, but may also be a TU, CU, a picture, or a slice.
- the collocated picture is a reference picture specified in either a list 0 or a list 1 .
- List 0 and list 1 include multiple reference pictures. Depending on various characteristics of the video, the reference picture may be selected from one of list 0 or list 1 .
- encoder 402 and decoder 403 may independently make this determination without any signaling of which of list 0 or list 1 is selected. For example, encoder 402 does not signal to decoder 403 which of list 0 or list 1 was selected. Further, encoder 402 may not signal which reference picture the encoder selected as the collocated picture in the selected list 0 or list 1 .
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 and collocated picture manager 404 - 2 independently determine the same reference picture to use as the collocated picture for a current picture.
- encoder 402 may signal to decoder 403 which reference picture was selected, but not which of list 0 or list 1 was selected.
- a flag collocated_from_l 0 flag was used to designate which one of two lists, list 0 or list 1 , includes the collocated picture.
- the flag can be set to 1 to indicate that the collocated picture shall be derived from list 0 , or set to 0 to indicate that the collocated picture should be derived from list 1 .
- the flag must be encoded in the encoded bitstream, such as in a slice header. This increases overhead in the bitstream.
- encoder 402 and decoder 403 implicitly determine the collocated picture from one of list 0 or list 1 based on different implicit methods, which will be described in more detail below.
- implicit means that encoder 402 does not communicate information to decoder 403 , such as by sending information for the flag collocated_from_l 0 _flag, to indicate which list encoder 402 selected the collocated picture from. Rather, encoder 402 and decoder 403 independently determine which of list 0 or list 1 using the same implicit method from which to select the collocated picture. Further, encoder 402 and decoder 403 select the same reference picture in the selected list 0 or list 1 as the collocated picture.
- FIG. 5 depicts a simplified flowchart 500 of a method for encoding video according to one embodiment.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 of encoder 402 determines a block in a current slice of a current picture that is being encoded.
- the slice may be a group of blocks within the current picture.
- the block may be a prediction unit (PU), but may also be other portions of the current picture or slice.
- PU prediction unit
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 determines an implicit method to use to determine which list of list 0 or list 1 to use to select a reference picture from as a collocated picture.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may be programmed with a specific implicit method to use, some of which will be described below. Thus, encoder 402 may not be dynamically deciding between various implicit methods to use. However, in other embodiments, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may dynamically select one implicit method from a list of possible implicit methods based on characteristics of the video.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 implicitly determines a list from list 0 or list 1 to select the collocated picture from based on the implicit method. For example, as will be described below, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may take into account a prediction type of the current slice (or block or picture), such as whether the current slice is a P slice or B slice. The current slice includes the current block being coded. In another example, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may take into account whether the current block is a B predicted block or a P predicted block or the block is part of a B picture or P picture. ?] Collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may then select one of list 0 or list 1 based on the prediction type. In other examples, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may select which one of list 0 or list 1 without reference to prediction type.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 implicitly selects a reference picture in the determined list 0 or list 1 to be the collocated picture. For example, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 may select the first reference picture in the determined list 0 or list 1 . In other examples, characteristics of the video may be used to determine another reference picture that is not the first reference picture in list 0 or list 1 . For example, collocated picture manager 404 - 1 selects a reference picture with the shortest temporal distance to the current picture.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 1 encodes the block using the collocated picture.
- the collocated picture is used in a candidate list where motion vector information for a collocated block in the collocated picture can be used in a temporal prediction process if selected as described above.
- encoder 402 sends an encoded bitstream that includes encoded bits for the block to decoder 403 without information, such as the flag collocated_from_l 0 _flag, indicating which list the collocated picture was selected from.
- the slice header syntax may be changed to remove information regarding the flag collocated_from_l 0 _flag. For example, the following syntax may be used for the slice header:
- slice_header( ) Descriptor lightweight_slice_flag u(1) if( !lightweight_slice_flag ) ⁇ slice_type ue(v) pic_parameter_set_id ue(v) if( IdrPicFlag ) ⁇ idr_pic_id ue(v) no_output_of_prior_pics_flag u(1) ⁇ else ⁇ pic_order_cnt_lsb u(v) ref_pic_set_pps_flag u(1) if( !
- FIG. 6 depicts a simplified flowchart 600 for decoding an encoded bitstream according to one embodiment.
- decoder 403 receives an encoded bitstream from encoder 402 .
- the encoded bitstream does not include the flag collocated_from_l 0 _flag. That is, information on which list of list 0 or list 1 encoder 402 selected the collocated picture from is not included in the encoded bitstream.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 2 of decoder 403 determines an implicit method to use to determine the collocated picture. As discussed above, different implicit methods may be used. Also, collocated picture manager 404 - 2 determines the same implicit method that encoder 402 used. In one embodiment, encoder 402 and decoder 403 may both be programmed to use the same implicit method. In other examples, encoder 402 and decoder 403 may dynamically determine the same implicit method based on characteristics of the video.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 2 implicitly determines which list of list 0 or list 1 to select the collocated picture from based on the implicit method.
- collocated picture manager 404 - 2 selects one of the reference pictures in the determined list 0 or list 1 as the collocated picture.
- Collocated picture manager 404 - 2 may select the reference picture using the same method as encoder 402 or encoder 402 may have signaled which reference picture to select.
- decoder 403 decodes a current block, such as a PU, using the selected collocated picture.
- the motion vector for the collocated block is used in a temporal prediction process to decode the current block.
- the decoded residual is then added to a corresponding prediction, which may be either spatial or temporal, to form the new reconstructed PU.
- the prediction PU is obtained using temporal prediction collocated picture manager 404 is used in the prediction process to determine the collocated picture to use.
- a decoded motion vector for the collocated block is used to determine the prediction PU in a merge/skip mode.
- the decoded motion vector may be used in AMVP as a motion vector predictor.
- FIG. 7 depicts a simplified flowchart 700 of a first implicit method for determining a collocated picture according to one embodiment.
- the steps of the method described in FIG. 7 may be performed independently by both encoder 402 and decoder 403 .
- collocated picture manager 404 determines a prediction type associated with a current slice of a current picture.
- the current slice includes the current block being encoded or decoded.
- the prediction type may be a prediction type associated with the current slice, such as the slice is a P slice or a B slice.
- collocated picture manager 404 determines whether the prediction type is B type or P type. If the prediction type is B type, at 706 , collocated picture manager 404 selects one of the lists of list 0 or list 1 . In one embodiment, if the slice type is B, then collocated picture manager 404 always selects list 1 . In other embodiments, if the slice type is B, then collocated picture manager 404 always selects list 0 .
- collocated picture manager 404 selects a reference picture in the selected list of list 0 or list 1 . For example, in one embodiment, collocated picture manager 404 always selects the first reference picture in list 1 . In other embodiments, collocated picture manager 404 always selects the first reference picture in list 0 .
- collocated picture manager 404 selects list 0 .
- collocated picture manager 404 selects a reference picture in list 0 as the collocated picture. For example, the first reference picture in list 0 may be selected.
- the reference picture that is selected as the collocated picture may then be used in a temporal prediction process by encoder 402 or decoder 403 .
- the same collocated picture is selected by both encoder 402 and decoder 403 .
- the variable colPic is a variable that specifies the reference picture that contains the collocated partition.
- the variable colPic is set to the selected reference picture in list 0 or list 1 . For example, if the slice type is equal to B, then the variable colPic is set to the first reference picture in list 1 . If the slice type is equal to P, then the variable colPic is set to the first reference picture in list 0 .
- FIG. 8 depicts a simplified flowchart 800 of a second implicit method according to one embodiment. The steps of the method described in FIG. 8 may be performed independently by both encoder 402 and decoder 403 .
- collocated picture manager 404 determines a predetermined list in which to select the collocated picture. For example, instead of determining a prediction type that is used to determine which of list 1 or list 0 to select, collocated picture manager 404 selects the same pre-determined list 0 or list 1 no matter what the prediction type. For example, encoder 402 and decoder 403 may be pre-programmed to select from only one of list 0 or list 1 .
- collocated picture manager 404 selects a reference picture in the pre-determined list. For example, collocated picture manager 404 selects the first reference picture in the pre-determined list. In one embodiment, collocated picture manager 404 selects from list 0 no matter what the prediction type is and also may select the first reference picture in list 0 . Then, encoder 402 and decoder 403 use the collocated picture in the temporal prediction process as discussed above.
- FIG. 9 depicts a simplified flowchart 900 of a third implicit method according to one embodiment. The steps of the method described in FIG. 9 may be performed independently by both encoder 402 and decoder 403 .
- collocated picture manager 404 determines that the implicit method is to select from a combined list.
- collocated picture manager 404 combines list 0 and list 1 into the combined list. That is, the reference pictures in list 0 and list 1 are combined into one combined list.
- the sequence of reference pictures in list 0 and list 1 may be sorted according to an algorithm. For example, temporal distance from the current picture may be used to sort the reference pictures in the combined list. Other methods of sorting the reference pictures may also be used, such as the reference pictures in list 0 and list 1 may be interleaved according to their original positions in list 0 and list 1 .
- collocated picture manager 404 selects a position in the combined list that includes the reference picture.
- the first reference picture in the combined list is always selected.
- another reference picture may be selected at another position based on characteristics of the video. For example, the reference picture that is closest in temporal distance may be selected if the combined list was not sorted by temporal distance.
- collocated picture manager 404 selects the reference picture at the determined position.
- FIG. 10 depicts a more detailed example of collocated picture manager 404 according to one embodiment.
- a prediction type determiner 1002 receives video information that is being encoded or decoded. For example, a block that is currently being encoded or decoded may be received. Prediction type determiner 1002 then determines the prediction type, such as whether the block is part of a B slice or P slice, the block is part of a B picture or P picture, or what type of prediction the block is being encoded or decoded with. Prediction type determiner 1002 sends the prediction type of B or P to a list determiner 1004 . List determiner 1004 uses one of the implicit methods described above to select one of list 0 or list 1 . List determiner 1004 then outputs the list selection of list 0 or list 1 to a reference picture determiner 1006 .
- Reference picture determiner 1006 selects a reference picture from one of list 0 or list 1 .
- the first picture in list 0 or list 1 may be selected.
- other reference pictures in list 0 or list 1 may be selected based on characteristics of the video.
- Reference picture determiner 1006 then outputs the selected reference picture, which is used as the collocated picture.
- reference picture determiner 1006 sets the variable colPic to a position in list 0 or list 1 or in the array RefPicList 0 or RefPicList 1 .
- encoder 402 described can be incorporated or otherwise associated with a transcoder or an encoding apparatus at a headend and decoder 403 can be incorporated or otherwise associated with a downstream device, such as a mobile device, a set top box or a transcoder.
- FIG. 11A depicts an example of encoder 402 according to one embodiment. A general operation of encoder 402 will now be described; however, it will be understood that variations on the encoding process described will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art based on the disclosure and teachings herein.
- a spatial prediction block 1104 may include different spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar, or any other direction.
- the spatial prediction direction for the PU can be coded as a syntax element. In some embodiments, brightness information (Luma) and color information (Chroma) for the PU can be predicted separately.
- the number of Luma intra prediction modes for all block size is 35. In alternate embodiments, the number of Luma intra prediction modes for blocks of any size can be 35.
- An additional mode can be used for the Chroma intra prediction mode. In some embodiments, the Chroma prediction mode can be called “IntraFromLuma.”
- Temporal prediction block 1106 performs temporal prediction.
- Inter mode coding can use data from the current input image and one or more reference images to code “P” pictures and/or “B” pictures. In some situations and/or embodiments, inter mode coding can result in higher compression than intra mode coding.
- inter mode PUs 204 can be temporally predictive coded, such that each PU 204 of the CU 202 can have one or more motion vectors and one or more associated reference images.
- Temporal prediction can be performed through a motion estimation operation that searches for a best match prediction for the PU over the associated reference images. The best match prediction can be described by the motion vectors and associated reference images.
- P pictures use data from the current input image and one or more previous reference images.
- B pictures use data from the current input image and both previous and subsequent reference images, and can have up to two motion vectors.
- the motion vectors and reference pictures can be coded in the HEVC bitstream.
- the motion vectors can be syntax elements “MV,” and the reference pictures can be syntax elements “refIdx.”
- inter mode can allow both spatial and temporal predictive coding. The best match prediction is described by the motion vector (MV) and associated reference picture index (refIdx). The motion vector and associated reference picture index are included in the coded bitstream.
- Transform block 1107 performs a transform operation with the residual PU, e.
- a set of block transforms of different sizes can be performed on a CU, such that some PUs can be divided into smaller TUs and other PUs can have TUs the same size as the PU. Division of CUs and PUs into TUs 20 can be shown by a quadtree representation.
- Transform block 1107 outputs the residual PU in a transform domain, E.
- a quantizer 1108 then quantizes the transform coefficients of the residual PU, E.
- Quantizer 1108 converts the transform coefficients into a finite number of possible values. In some embodiments, this is a lossy operation in which data lost by quantization may not be recoverable.
- entropy coding block 1110 entropy encodes the quantized coefficients, which results in final compression bits to be transmitted. Different entropy coding methods may be used, such as context-adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) or context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC).
- CAVLC context-adaptive variable length coding
- CABAC context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding
- a de-quantizer 1112 de-quantizes the quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU.
- De-quantizer 1112 then outputs the de-quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU, E′.
- An inverse transform block 1114 receives the de-quantized transform coefficients, which are then inverse transformed resulting in a reconstructed residual PU, e′.
- the reconstructed PU, e′ is then added to the corresponding prediction, x′, either spatial or temporal, to form the new reconstructed PU, x′′.
- Particular embodiments may be used in determining the prediction, such as collocated picture manager 404 is used in the prediction process to determine the collocated picture to use.
- a loop filter 1116 performs de-blocking on the reconstructed PU, x′′, to reduce blocking artifacts. Additionally, loop filter 1116 may perform a sample adaptive offset process after the completion of the de-blocking filter process for the decoded picture, which compensates for a pixel value offset between reconstructed pixels and original pixels. Also, loop filter 1116 may perform adaptive loop filtering over the reconstructed PU, which minimizes coding distortion between the input and output pictures. Additionally, if the reconstructed pictures are reference pictures, the reference pictures are stored in a reference buffer 1118 for future temporal prediction. Intra mode coded images can be a possible point where decoding can begin without needing additional reconstructed images.
- FIG. 11B depicts an example of decoder 403 according to one embodiment.
- Decoder 403 receives input bits from encoder 402 for encoded video content.
- An entropy decoding block 1130 performs entropy decoding on the input bitstream to generate quantized transform coefficients of a residual PU.
- a de-quantizer 1132 de-quantizes the quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU.
- De-quantizer 1132 then outputs the de-quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU, E′.
- An inverse transform block 1134 receives the de-quantized transform coefficients, which are then inverse transformed resulting in a reconstructed residual PU, e′.
- the reconstructed PU, e′ is then added to the corresponding prediction, x′, either spatial or temporal, to form the new reconstructed PU, x′′.
- a loop filter 1136 performs de-blocking on the reconstructed PU, x′′, to reduce blocking artifacts. Additionally, loop filter 1136 may perform a sample adaptive offset process after the completion of the de-blocking filter process for the decoded picture, which compensates for a pixel value offset between reconstructed pixels and original pixels. Also, loop filter 1136 may perform adaptive loop filtering over the reconstructed PU, which minimizes coding distortion between the input and output pictures. Additionally, if the reconstructed pictures are reference pictures, the reference pictures are stored in a reference buffer 1138 for future temporal prediction.
- the prediction PU, x′ is obtained through either spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- a spatial prediction block 1140 may receive decoded spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar. The spatial prediction directions are used to determine the prediction PU, x′.
- a temporal prediction block 1106 performs temporal prediction through a motion estimation operation. Particular embodiments may be used in determining the prediction, such as collocated picture manager 404 is used in the prediction process to determine the collocated picture to use. A decoded motion vector is used to determine the prediction PU, x′. Interpolation may be used in the motion estimation operation.
- Particular embodiments may be implemented in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, system, or machine.
- the computer-readable storage medium contains instructions for controlling a computer system to perform a method described by particular embodiments.
- the instructions when executed by one or more computer processors, may be operable to perform that which is described in particular embodiments.

Decoding Process
- If slice_type is equal to B, the variable colPic specifies the picture that contains the co-located partition as specified by RefPicList1[0].
- Otherwise (slice_type is equal to P), the variable colPic specifies the picture that contains the co-located partition as specified by RelPicList0[0].
- the variable colPic specifies the picture that contains the co-located partition as specified by RefPicList0[0].
The variable colPic is set to the selected reference picture in list0 always. Thus, slice type does not matter. Also, the first reference picture in list0 is selected.
Third Implicit Method
- the variable colPic specifies the picture that contains the co-located partition as specified by CombinedList[ref_shortest_distance],
where CombinedList is the combined list and ref_shortest_distance indicates the position of the reference picture with the shortest distance to the current picture. The variable colPic is set to the selected reference picture in the combined list. Thus, slice type does not matter. Also, the first reference picture in the combined list is selected.
