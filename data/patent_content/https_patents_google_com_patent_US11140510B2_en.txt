Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to mapping applications that display map data associated with a geographic area.
- a geographic information system is a system for archiving, retrieving, and manipulating data that has been stored and indexed according to the geographic coordinates of its elements.
- the system generally can utilize a variety of data types, such as imagery, maps, and tables.
- GIS technology can be integrated into Internet-based mapping applications.
- mapping applications can be, or can otherwise be associated with, software applications that display interactive digital maps.
- mapping applications may run on laptop and tablet computers, mobile phones, car navigation systems, hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units, etc.
- GPS global positioning system
- Many of these devices are equipped with a touchscreen, a touchpad, or are otherwise configured to receive input that includes finger gestures.
- a user may, for example, may pan across a map by swiping her finger in the desired direction, zoom in on an area by pinching two fingers together, etc.
- a mapping application can display various types of geographic data including topographical data, street data, urban transit information, and traffic data. Further, the geographic data may be schematic or based on photography, such as satellite imagery. Still further, a mapping application can display the information in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) format.
- FIG. 1 depicts an example map 180 displayed by a mapping application.
- the map 180 depicts a geographic area, and can be displayed within a viewport of a user interface associated with the mapping application. As shown, the map 180 is displayed from a top-down perspective (also referred to as a bird's-eye view, overhead view, helicopter view, aerial view, etc.).
- Map 180 defines a map topology that includes a plurality of features, such as features 182 .
- the map features are located within the map topology at positions that correspond to the positions of the features within the physical world (e.g. latitude, longitude coordinates, etc.).
- the map 180 displays points of interest, such as point of interest 184 .
- the points of interest within the map 180 can be located at positions that correspond to the positions of the points of interest within the physical world. In this manner, the map 180 can be created to provide a representation that corresponds to the geographic area as exists in the physical world.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of displaying map data within a user interface.
- the method includes identifying, by one or more computing devices, a plurality of points of interest associated with a geographic area to be displayed in a viewport associated with a digital mapping application.
- the method further includes determining, by the one or more computing devices, an adjusted position for an orientation point of interest, the adjusted position being a position that does not align with a position of the orientation point of interest in the physical world.
- the method further includes adjusting, by the one or more computing devices, a map topology associated with map data defining a visual representation of the geographic area based at least in part on the adjusted position.
- the method further includes providing for display, by the one or more computing devices, the orientation POI at the adjusted position associated with the map data within the mapping application.

- FIG. 9 depicts an example system according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a holistic contextual map view associated with a geographic area within a digital mapping environment.
- the contextual map view can provide an intuitive, point of interest (POI)-based view of the geographic area to a user.
- the contextual map view can include a plurality of POIs that can be selectively displayed based at least in part on a contextual relevance of the POIs.
- the contextual map view can display a topology associated with the geographic area that aligns with a user's perception of the geographic area. More particularly, the contextual map view can provide a rendering of the geographic area that can correspond to a view of a user located within the geographic area.
- the contextual map view can further include temporal information associated with the geographic area. For instance, the contextual map view can provide an expected representation of the geographic area at one or more future times.
- the contextual map view can further include environmental information associated with the geographic area such as information relating to the weather associated with the geographic area.
- the contextual map view can include a representation of the geographic area having a flexible topology that is not constrained by the physical dimensions of the geographic area.
- such flexible representation can be determined to emphasize or feature one or more orientation POIs.
- An orientation POI can be a landmark such as a building, bridge, structure, entity, geographic location, or other suitable landmark.
- Such orientation POI(s) can be displayed in the contextual map view.
- such orientation POI(s) can be included in the contextual map view representation at positions within the representation that may not exactly align with the corresponding positions of the POI(s) in the physical world. In this manner, an orientation POI can be rendered within the contextual map view at an adjusted position relative to the corresponding position of the POI in the physical world.
- the disclosure addresses a technical problem that the screen of a user's device may be not be large enough, when displaying a map of the geographical area with a certain resolution, also to display the orientation POI at a position which exactly aligns with the corresponding positions of the POI in the physical world. This is because the screen of the user's device is typically far smaller than a paper-based map, so that a paper-based map can display a larger geographical area for a given resolution.
- the disclosure has the technical effect that the orientation POI(s) are rendered despite the limited screen area and without sacrificing the resolution with which the geographical area is rendered.
- a plurality of POI representations can be displayed within the contextual map view.
- the POI representations can be orientation POI representations displayed at an adjusted position or other POI representations located within the geographic area.
- Such POI representations can be two-dimensional (2D) representations or three-dimensional (3D) representations.
- one or more of the POI representations displayed in the contextual map view for a geographic area can be 2D representations and one or more of the POI representations can be 3D representations.
- Such POI representations can depict the physical characteristics of the corresponding POIs. For instance, a 3D POI representation can visually represent the geometric properties of the corresponding POI in a 3D manner.
- the plurality of POIs to be displayed within the contextual map view can be selectively determined based at least in part on a ranking or score associated with the POIs. For instance, a corpus of POIs associated with the geographic area can be ranked or scored based at least in part on the popularity, relevance, category, or other suitable metric associated with the POIs. The plurality of POIs to be displayed within the contextual map view can be determined based on such ranking. For instance, the displayed POIs can correspond to POIs ranked or scored higher than a threshold. In some implementations, the displayed POIs can correspond to some number of top ranked or top scored POIs. It will be appreciated that the POIs to be displayed can be determined using any suitable POI selection technique.
- one or more orientation POIs located outside of the geographic area can be displayed within the contextual map view of the geographic area at an adjusted position.
- Such display of POIs can be implemented to provide context to the user and/or to simulate a view of the user when standing at some location within the geographic area. For instance, the user, when standing within the geographic area may be able to view a POI that is located outside of the geographic area.
- Such POI can be displayed within the contextual map view at an adjusted position to simulate the visibility of the POI.
- Such POIs can be used to orient the user, such that the contextual map view corresponds to the user's view of the physical world.
- selecting such orientations POIs to be displayed can include analyzing one or more POIs located outside of the geographic area. For instance, POIs located within a surrounding area located within a threshold distance from the geographic area can be identified. One or more of the POIs located within the surrounding area can be selected to be displayed within the contextual map view associated with the geographic area. A representation of the selected POIs can be rendered at adjusted positions within the geographic area. In some implementations, the topology of the map of the geographic area can be adjusted in conjunction with rendering the selected POIs at the adjusted positions. For instance, the map topology can be generalized by removing one or more features associated with the map. Such features can include POIs, geographic areas, geographic structures, map terrain, map geometry, entities, buildings, roads, paths, etc.
- Such features can be features located proximate the adjusted position at which the orientation POI is to be rendered. In this manner, the orientation POI can be rendered in place of the removed features.
- Such topology generalization can be performed to remove clutter from the contextual map view associated with the orientation POI(s), and to facilitate a more intuitive view of the map.
- the contextual map view can depict the geographic area from a particular viewpoint determined based at least in part on the selected POIs to be displayed in the contextual map view.
- the viewpoint can be determined to encompass an interesting or relevant view of the geographic area as defined by the selected POIs. For instance, once the POIs to be displayed have been selected, a viewpoint can be determined based at least in part on the POIs. More particularly, the viewpoint can be determined such that at least a subset of the selected POIs is displayed in the contextual map view. In this manner, the viewpoint can be determined independently from a cardinal direction scheme.
- the viewpoint can correspond to an orientation of a virtual camera associated with the geographic area. For instance, the viewpoint can correspond to an angle and/or position of the virtual camera.
- the contextual map view can include a rendering of map data associated with the geographic area from the determined viewpoint.
- the POIs to be displayed can be selected based at least in part on temporal information associated with the POIs. For instance, the POIs to be displayed can be selected based on operating hours associated with the POIs. As another example, the POIs to be displayed can be selected based at least in part on a temporal relevance of the POI. For instance, a restaurant that serves breakfast may be displayed in a contextual map view associated with breakfast time. Similarly, a bar or other late night “hotspot” can be displayed in a contextual map view associated with late night.
- the contextual map view can further include environmental information associated with the geographic area.
- the environmental information can include weather information, traffic information, transportation information (e.g. routes, public transportation scheduling, etc.), or other suitable information associated with the geographic area.
- the environmental information can be associated with the time of day associated with the map pane.
- the first pane described above can include environmental information associated with the current time
- the second pane can include environmental information associated with the first future time
- the second pane can include environmental information associated with the second future time.
- the environmental information can be represented graphically within the contextual map view.
- the weather information can be displayed graphically within the contextual map view.
- the weather information can be provided via graphical representations of weather elements indicative of the weather information, such as a sun, moon, rain, snow, clouds, etc. corresponding to the weather information displayed within contextual map view.
- the contextual map view can display the geographic area from a viewpoint that allows a representation of the sky to be displayed within the contextual map view. Such weather elements can be displayed within the displayed sky.

- the POIs can include any suitable building, structure, geographic area, entity, landmark, or other suitable POI.
- the POI data 116 can include data indicative of a plurality of POIs located within the geographic area.
- the POI data 116 can further include data indicative of a plurality of POIs located outside of the geographic area in one or more surrounding areas relative to the geographic area.
- the data indicative of the POIs can include data associated with graphical representations of the POIs to be rendered within the contextual map view.
- the data indicative of the POIs can further include metadata or other data describing one or more characteristics of the POIs.
- metadata can include one or more rankings or scores, user reviews, location data, operating hours, menus, check-in data, and/or other suitable data associated with the respective POIs.
- the contextual view manager 112 can select the POIs to be displayed within the contextual map view based at least in part on the data indicative of the POIs (e.g. the metadata associated with the POIs). For instance, the contextual view manager 112 can select the POIs to be displayed based at least in part on the rankings associated with the POIs. The contextual view manager 112 can select the POIs to be displayed using any suitable POI selection technique or strategy. In some implementations, the POIs to be displayed can be selected based at least in part on temporal information associated with the POIs. For instance, the selected POIs can be POIs that are relevant to a particular time or time range associated with the contextual map view.
- the contextual view manager 112 can further determine one or more orientation POIs to be displayed within the contextual map view.
- An orientation POI can be any suitable POI.
- an orientation POI can be a prominent structure (e.g. bridge), building, landmark etc.
- An orientation POI can be a POI that can provide geospatial context to the user.
- an orientation POI can be a POI that is not located within the geographic area to be represented within the viewport.

In this manner, the contextual view manager 112 can select the orientation POI(s) based at least in part on the data indicative of the candidate orientation POIs. In some implementations, the orientation POIs may be predetermined. In such implementations, when a predetermined orientation POI is located within the threshold distance of the geographic area, the contextual view manager 112 can facilitate the display of the orientation POI at an adjusted position within the geographic area displayed by the geospatial browser 110 .
