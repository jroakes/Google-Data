- the code snippet can cause the browser to send an ad presentation request 322 to the AMS 106 .
- the ad presentation request 322 can include a JavaScript® request.
- the ad presentation request 322 can include, for example, a request for one or more topical descriptors that summarize one or more aspects of publisher content. For example, if the content-related site were displaying content related to automobile or mechanics, the topical descriptors can include terms such as “Cars,” “Motorcycles,” “Tires,” etc.
- Receiving a request for an ad presentation can include receiving various formatting and content parameters (e.g., JavaScript® parameters).
- the ad presentation request 322 can include parameters associated with presenting descriptors, such as size parameters (e.g., maximum number of characters), shape parameters, color parameters, font parameters, presentation style parameters (e.g., audio, video, graphical, textual, etc.), etc.
- the ad presentation request 322 may also specify a quantity of descriptors desired.
- An example JavaScript® ad presentation request is shown below:
- ad_client ‘ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx’;
- Receiving a request for an ad presentation can involve receiving a descriptor destination parameter.
- This parameter can be set by the publisher 104 (e.g., using the PFEs in the AMS 106 ).
- the descriptor destination parameter specifies the location of an ad-related site (e.g., publisher landing page 237 ) hosted by the publisher 104 .
- the descriptor destination parameter can be implemented as a URL parameter in the ad presentation request.
- the following parameter can be added to the above-mentioned JavaScript® request:
- descriptor_dest_url “http://www.example-site.com/descriptor/show_descriptor_ads.html”
- the descriptor destination parameter and other parameters can be specified in the code snippet embedded in the content page 206 source code.
- receiving a request for an ad presentation can involve receiving a request for ads.
- the ad targeting request may include information associated with a request for publisher content.
- the ad targeting request may cause the AMS 106 to target ads to the requested publisher content, for example, by targeting ads to a publisher 104 or a user access device 108 .
- receiving an ad targeting request can involve a publisher 104 receiving a content request (e.g., a search request, a request to access a webpage, etc.) from a user access device 108 and the publisher 104 providing information associated with the content request (e.g., search terms, a requested URL, the content request itself, user location, formatting information, ad parameters, etc.) to the ad serving system 120 in the AMS 106 .
- the ad targeting request may include information similar to the formatting and content information 212 discussed above in connection with FIG. 2 .
- the process 300 may provide the requested ad presentation ( 330 ). This may involve identifying, generating and/or providing a requested number of descriptors and/or ads to the requesting user access device 108 . As illustrated in FIG. 3B , for example, the AMS 106 can provide an ad presentation 332 to the user access device 108 .
- the ad presentation 332 may include, for example, the ad 225 and/or the descriptor 227 .
- Providing the requested ad presentation may involve rendering the requested ad presentation (e.g., the ad 225 and the link 227 ) in a first embeddable display element, such as an HTML I-Frame, embedded in a content-related site hosted by the publisher 104 .
- ad presentation can be rendered in the ad portion 210 of the content page 206 .
- the process 300 may identify or generate relevant ads and descriptors based on the ad presentation request. This may involve searching the ad repository 136 for ads. The searching may involve searching for ads that are relevant to publisher content requested by a user. Relevant ads may be determined based on specific advertiser settings and instructions, and/or they may be determined using one or more matching, ranking and/or searching processes that match ads to context, geographic location, language, and other criteria. In some implementations, the backend systems 118 in the AMS 106 may identify relevant ads and descriptors.
- providing the requested ad presentation ( 330 ) may involve linking descriptors to destinations (e.g., URLs) specified in the received customization settings. These destinations can be passed as parameters from the requesting content-related publisher site (e.g., the content page 206 ) to the AMS 106 and then from the AMS 106 to the first embeddable display element (e.g., the ad portion 210 ).
- destinations e.g., URLs
- Providing the requested ad presentation may also involve providing a plaintext version of the requested descriptors as well as a descriptor token signed with a message authentication code, such as HMAC.
- the authentication code signature which can be set to expire after a specified time period, can store a unique timestamp or other identifier for preventing theft of the token.
- the AMS 106 may be configured to only serve ads targeted to tokens, to prevent gaming of the system.
- the process 300 may receive a user selection of the ad presentation ( 340 ). This may involve a user (or system) selecting one or more ads or descriptors in the embedded display element in which the ad presentation occurs. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3B , a user can effect a user selection 342 of the descriptor 227 in the ad portion 210 . Effecting user selection 342 may involve, for example, a user clicking or otherwise selecting the descriptor 227 in a display (e.g., browser) provided by the user access device 108 .
- a display e.g., browser
- the process 300 may provide a customized ad presentation based on the user selection and the customization settings ( 350 ). This may involve rendering a customized ad presentation in an advertisement-related site (e.g., webpage) hosted by (or otherwise associated with) the publisher 104 .
- the providing ( 350 ) may involve directing the user to the ad-related site.
- the location of the ad-related site can be specified in the customization settings and can be passed as a parameter to the embedded display element in which the ad presentation selection occurs.
- the user selection 342 may cause the user to be directed to the publisher landing page 237 , which can be hosted by the publisher 104 .
- descriptor selections may not require logging and redirecting by the AMS 106 and the user can therefore be taken directly to the publisher landing page 237 without being redirected by the AMS 106 .
- Providing the customized ad presentation ( 350 ) may involve rendering the customized ad presentation in a second embeddable display element (e.g., an HTML I-Frame) embedded in the ad-related site hosted by the content publisher.
- a second embeddable display element e.g., an HTML I-Frame
- the process 300 may embed the ad portion 247 in the publisher landing page 237 .
- the ad portion 247 may differ from the ad portion 210 .
- the ad portion 210 may be a first size (e.g., 90 ⁇ 90 pixels) while the ad portion 247 may be a second, larger size (e.g., 300 ⁇ 250).
- the ad portion 247 can also include additional and/or different features than those in the ad portion 210 .
- the second embeddable display element (e.g., the ad portion 247 ) can cause the user access device 108 (e.g., the browser) to initiate a request (e.g., a JavaScript® request) for an ad presentation to be rendered in the second embeddable display element on the publisher ad-related site.
- a request e.g., a JavaScript® request
- the ad portion 247 can cause a browser displaying the publisher ad landing page 237 to send the AMS 106 a customized ad presentation request 344 .
- the customized ad presentation request 344 can include an indication of the ad presentation selection (e.g., the selected descriptor 227 ).
- the customized ad presentation request 344 can include descriptor token values passed as parameters during the providing of the requested ad presentation (e.g. the ad presentation 332 ) during stage 330 of the process 300 .
- the publisher 104 can set the token variables to the passed values.
- the descriptor itself can be passed instead of tokens. If a publisher passes a clear text keyword to the AMS 106 , then the AMS 106 can check the clear text against the encoded version to determine if a publisher is attempting to game the system. This information can be used for spam detection or blacklisting repeat offenders. The ad result can also be checked for negative content.
- the customized ad presentation request 344 can include various information similar to that included in the ad presentation request 322 , such as formatting and content parameters.
- the publisher ad presentation request 344 can also include various additional customization settings (e.g., color scheme variables) passed as parameters.
- the publisher 104 can choose where the publisher ad landing page 237 is hosted. If the publisher 104 hosts the ad landing page, then the publisher can specify various customization options.
- a tool can provided in the PFE in the AMS 106 to generate JavaScript® or other code fragments or snippets that the publisher 104 can copy and insert into the source code of the publisher ad landing page 237 . These code fragments can be used to effect the customized ad presentation request 344 .
- This tool may be in addition to a tool provided for generating JavaScript® or other code fragments for the ad presentation requests.
- An example JavaScript® fragment for effecting a customized ad presentation request (e.g., 344 ) is shown below.
- the example fragment can be inserted in the source code of a publisher ad landing page (e.g., the publisher ad landing page 237 ).
