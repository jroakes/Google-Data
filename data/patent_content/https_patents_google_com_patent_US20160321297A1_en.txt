- the computer 102 presents a search web page or an interactive map to a user, and the user inputs a geographical search query on the computer 102 to search a geographical area.
- the computer 102 transmits a request 112 containing the query 110 to the servers 106 .
- the servers 106 receive and process the geographical search query 110 . As described further below, the servers 106 interpret the geographical search query 110 based on query templates that correspond to possible interpretations of the geographical search query 110 . After determining possible interpretations and selecting one or more interpretations of the geographical search query 110 , the servers 106 provide results based on the selected interpretations, such as from a search engine.
- the system 100 respond to geographical search query from the client 102 by providing geographic data to the clients 102 .
- the servers 106 send a response 114 containing the data responsive to the query over the network 108 to the client 102 . As shown in FIG. 1 , the response 114 includes search results 116 . For example, for a given geographic search query for a type of entity located in a geographic area, the search results 116 include entities located in the geographic area.
- a geographical search query may include one, two, three, four, or any number of terms in various arrangements. Such terms may include terms that form an address or other terms that do not form an address but are used to query a geographical search query. Geographical search queries may include, for example, “5 wall st ny,” “5 th ave ny,” “Eiffel tower,” and “new york.” As described below, these terms and arrangements of terms may form the basis of query templates used to interpret geographical search queries received from a client computer.
- FIG. 2 depicts a process 200 for interpreting geographical search queries in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Some or all steps of the process 200 may be implemented as executable code instructions stored on a non-transitory tangible machine readable medium and executed by a processor (e.g., one or more processors) of a computer (e.g., one or more computers).
- a geographical search query is obtained (block 202 ), such as from a client computer as described above.
- interpretations candidates for the search query are determined (block 204 ), such as from geographic search query templates 206 .
- the geographic search query templates are generated from previously executed geographical search queries and results.
- interpretation probabilities are assigned to the interpretation candidates for the geographical search query (block 208 ).
- Each interpretation candidate determined from the geographical search query templates 206 is associated with a probability indicating the likelihood of the interpretation candidate being the correct interpretation for the geographical search query.
- scores are assigned to the interpretation candidates for the geographical search query (block 210 ).
- the scores, and subsequent rankings may be based on other criteria, such as the popularity of a result produced by an interpretation candidate, the distance between a result produced by the interpretation candidate and a user's location, etc.
- the interpretation candidates are ranked based on the assigned scores (block 212 ).
- results for the geographical search query are provided based on the interpretation candidates (block 214 ).
- the results are obtained from a geographical search engine 216 , such as by executing one or more interpretation candidates by the geographical search engine 216 .
- the highest ranked interpretation candidate for the geographical search query is selected and used to provide a result to the geographical search query.
- two, three, four, or more of the highest ranked interpretation candidates may be selected and used to provide multiple results to the geographical search query.
- the results are provided with a request to a user for confirmation of the correct interpretation candidate and result.
- FIG. 3 depicts a process 300 for generating query templates from previously executed geographical search query logs.
- geographical search query logs are obtained (block 302 ), such as from a map search engine (block 304 ).
- the geographical search query logs may be logs of geographical search queries received from users and executed by the map search engine 304 .
- the geographical search query logs are specific to a particular context, such as a particular language, locale, country, domain (e.g., .com, .de, etc.), other suitable contexts or combination thereof.
- the geographical search query logs correspond to multiple contexts, such as multiple locales, languages, countries, domains, etc.
- unique queries from the query log are determined (block 306 ).
- the geographical search query logs may include duplicate queries.
- the duplicate queries are removed by determining the unique queries from the query logs for further processing.
- the interpretation for each unique query is determined (block 308 ).
- the interpretation for each unique query is determined by executing the query in the map search engine 304 or from query logs.
- the interpretation for a query is determined from additional signals from user actions (block 309 ). For example, in some embodiments, subsequent user actions after query execution may provide indications of a probable query interpretation. Such user actions may include, for example, a user selecting a search result, reading a web page of a search results, entering a subsequent query (e.g., refining a query by adding additional terms), and so on.
- the query templates may include any number of term types in any arrangement.
- the term types may include, for example, address numbers, routes (e.g., streets, roads, or other transportation paths having names), cities, countries, postal codes, locales, localities, provinces, states, etc. Additionally, term types may include types for bodies of water, terrain features (e.g., mountains, contoured terrain), points of interest (e.g., landmarks, tourist attractions, etc.), political districts or divisions, transit system components (e.g., railway stations, bus stations, etc.), or other suitable term types.
- examples of the query templates may include: address route city state; city state; route address; route city state; route city; or any suitable arrangement of term types.
- the unique query templates are counted (block 312 ). After extracting query templates from the interpretations, any duplicate query templates are removed by counting the unique query templates.
- the probability distributions for query templates for specific contexts are determined (block 314 ). As mentioned above, such contexts may include a language, a locale, a client type (e.g., desktop or mobile) or other contexts. Here again, in some embodiments, the probabilities may be determined using the additional signals from user actions (block 309 ). The probability distributions provide the likelihood that a query template is the correct interpretation for a given geographical search query for a context.
- geographical search queries received from a first locale may follow a different arrangement of term types than a geographical search query received from a second locale (e.g., the U.S.A.).
- variations in the arrangement of terms in a geographical search query result in multiple query templates each having a different probability of being a correct interpretation of a query for that context.
- These probabilities may be used to evaluate a geographical search query received from a user.
- a geographical search query may include the query “zurich 9000”.
- Based on the generated query templates, such a query may include interpretation candidates of “city postal code” and “street_number route”. Each of these interpretation candidates may have a probability of being the correct interpretation.
- the interpretation candidate “city postal code” may have a probability of 65%
- the interpretation candidate “street_number route” may have a probability 23%. As described above, this probability is used in the scoring and ranking of interpretation candidates for the geographical search query of “zurich 9000” when determining the appropriate result to the query.
- the query templates 316 and, in some embodiments, the probability distributions, are stored and used in further processing.
- the query templates 316 are indexed (block 318 ) to provide indexed query templates 320 .
- the indexing enables faster searching and retrieval of the query templates during processing a geographical search query.
- the query template generation process is executed “offline” to predetermine query templates for use by in processing search queries. For example, after accumulating query logs and user actions, additional query templates may be generated and incorporated into the templates available for query interpretations. Further, in some embodiments, processing of queries, as described in FIG. 2 , may be performed without templates using the map search engine. After sufficient data is accumulated, templates may be generated to improve performance and accuracy of query processing.
- FIG. 4 depicts an example of a data structure 400 for storing query templates, transmitting query templates, or both.
- the data structure 400 may be stored as a message for packaging and transmission, as a record in a table of database, etc.
- the discussion of the data structure 400 refers to various attributes and values that are associated via any suitable structure, such as key-value pairs, rows and columns of a table, etc.
- the data structure 400 may include any number of columns and information suitable for storage with a query template.
- attributes of the data structure 400 includes feature type 402 , query template 404 , language 406 , country 408 , count 410 , and type 412 .
- the feature type 402 identifies the type of result produced by interpreting a query using the query template identified by the query template attribute 404 .
- a result identifies a route, a city, a province, a state, a country, or any other geographic area or identification.
- the query template 404 stores the sequence of term types for the query template.
- Additional attributes of the data structure 400 identify various contexts for a query or query template.
- the language 406 identifies the language of a query or query template.
- the country 408 identifies the country code where a query originated from, such as identifying the country by IP address, country code, or other identifier.
- the count 410 identifies the count of the template, such as the count determined above in FIG. 3 that is used in probability determinations for a query template.
- the data structure 400 includes a query type 412 identifying a type of a query.
- the query type 412 may refer to a client type, e.g., desktop or mobile.
- FIGS. 5A-5B depict various geographical search queries and corresponding interpretation candidates/query templates in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As mentioned above, however, any one of the geographical search queries may have two or more interpretation candidates, although only one interpretation candidate is depicted in FIGS. 5A-5D .
- FIG. 5A depicts a geographical search query 500 of “5 wall st. ny”.
- this geographical search query 500 has an interpretation candidate 502 of “street_number route locality” such that the term “5” of the query 500 corresponds to a term type of “street_number”, the term “wall st”. of the query 500 corresponds to a term type of “route”, and the term “ny” of the query corresponds to a term type of “locality”.
- this interpretation candidate is derived from a query template have a term type arrangement of “street_number route locality”.
- FIG. 5B depicts a geographical search query 504 of “5th ave nt”.
- this geographical search query 504 has an interpretation candidate 506 of “route locality”.
- the term “5th ave” of the query 506 corresponds to a term type of “route”
- the term “ny” of the query 506 corresponds to a term type of “locality”.
- this interpretation candidate is derived from a query template have a term type arrangement of “route locality”.
- FIG. 5C depicts a geographical search query 508 of “eiffel tower”. As shown in FIG. 5C , this geographical search query 508 has an interpretation candidate 510 of “entity_poi”. Thus, based on the interpretation candidate 510 , the term “eiffel tower” of the query 508 corresponds to a single term type (“entity_poi”) for a point of interest.
- the query template for the interpretation candidate 510 may thus be the term type arrangement of “entity_poi”.
- FIG. 5D depicts a geographical search query 512 of “new york”.
- this geographical search query 512 has an interpretation candidate 514 of “locality”.
- the term “new york” of the query 508 corresponds to a single term type of “locality”.
- a geographical search query may have multiple interpretation candidates. For example, “new york” may be interpreted based on query templates of term type “locality” and term type “state”. Each of these query templates may have a different probability of being the correct interpretation, and selection of interoperation candidates is based on a scoring and ranking that incorporates these probabilities.
- query templates are provided to other processes for analysis and determination of different data.
- FIG. 6 depicts a process 660 illustrating the providing of query templates 602 to various other processes for different determinations.
- the changes to the query templates are analyzed over a time period (block 604 ).
- query templates may be generated periodically, such as every hour, every day, every week, every month, etc.
- the query templates may thus be analyzed over such periods to determine changes to the query templates. For example, each query template from one previous period, two previous periods, three previous periods, four previous periods, are stored and compared to the query templates generated for the present period. For example, for query templates generated every two months, the query templates generated for one period may compared to query templates generate two months ago.
- performance metrics are determined (block 606 ). For example, if the query templates become less specific and contain less term types over time, this may indicate that the interpretations provided for the users' geographical search queries are relatively accurate, enabling users to specific a lower number of terms when entering a geographical search query. Additionally, in some embodiments analyzing the query templates over time is used to determine query usages (block 608 ). Because the queries are generated from previously executed queries that are received from users, the changes in the query templates over time correspond to changes in users' queries. The changes in users' queries may indicate how queries for a specific context are changing over time. For example, users in a specific locale may stop specifying certain terms in queries or may start including certain terms in queries, and such changes are reflected in the term types of the query templates.
- the query templates are used to generate n-grams and prefixes for various linguistic processes (block 610 ).
- popular query templates for a context e.g., the query templates having the highest probabilities or that provide the most popular interpretation candidates
- the n-grams and prefixes are used to provide spelling corrections (block 612 ), such as for subsequent geographical search queries or other queries.
- the n-grams and prefixes are used to provide query suggestions (block 614 ), such as for subsequent geographical search queries. For example, when a user begins to enter a geographical search query, an “autocomplete” suggestion may be provided for the query based on the n-grams and prefixes determined from popular query templates.

FIG. 1 is a diagram that illustrates asystem 100 in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , thesystem 100 includes aclient 102 in communication withservers 106 over anetwork 108. such that theclient 102 transmits data to and receive data from theservers 106. In some embodiments, theclient 102 includes thick-clients, thin-clients, or both. Theclient 102 may be, for example, computers, such smartphones, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, etc. In some embodiments, thesystem 100 may includemultiple clients 102. Theservers 106 may include a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Theservers 106 may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Theservers 106 may be, for example, computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 108 for communication or may communicate over other networks. Thenetwork 108 includes any suitable network, such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any other suitable network. - The
servers 106 may include a geographic information system (GIS), a search engine, web services, or any combination of these systems. In such embodiments, thecomputer 102 transmits ageographical search query 110 to theservers 106. For example, thecomputer 102 presents a search web page or an interactive map to a user, and the user inputs a geographical search query on thecomputer 102 to search a geographical area. After receiving the inputted query, thecomputer 102 transmits arequest 112 containing thequery 110 to theservers 106. - The
servers 106 receive and process thegeographical search query 110. As described further below, theservers 106 interpret thegeographical search query 110 based on query templates that correspond to possible interpretations of thegeographical search query 110. After determining possible interpretations and selecting one or more interpretations of thegeographical search query 110, theservers 106 provide results based on the selected interpretations, such as from a search engine. Thesystem 100 respond to geographical search query from theclient 102 by providing geographic data to theclients 102. Theservers 106 send aresponse 114 containing the data responsive to the query over thenetwork 108 to theclient 102. As shown inFIG. 1 , theresponse 114 includes search results 116. For example, for a given geographic search query for a type of entity located in a geographic area, the search results 116 include entities located in the geographic area. - A geographical search query may include one, two, three, four, or any number of terms in various arrangements. Such terms may include terms that form an address or other terms that do not form an address but are used to query a geographical search query. Geographical search queries may include, for example, “5 wall st ny,” “5th ave ny,” “Eiffel tower,” and “new york.” As described below, these terms and arrangements of terms may form the basis of query templates used to interpret geographical search queries received from a client computer.

FIG. 2 depicts aprocess 200 for interpreting geographical search queries in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 200 may be implemented as executable code instructions stored on a non-transitory tangible machine readable medium and executed by a processor (e.g., one or more processors) of a computer (e.g., one or more computers). Initially, a geographical search query is obtained (block 202), such as from a client computer as described above. Next, interpretations candidates for the search query are determined (block 204), such as from geographicsearch query templates 206. As described below and illustrated inFIG. 3 , the geographic search query templates are generated from previously executed geographical search queries and results. - Next, interpretation probabilities are assigned to the interpretation candidates for the geographical search query (block 208). Each interpretation candidate determined from the geographical
search query templates 206 is associated with a probability indicating the likelihood of the interpretation candidate being the correct interpretation for the geographical search query. Based on these probabilities and, in some embodiments, other criteria, scores are assigned to the interpretation candidates for the geographical search query (block 210). For example, the scores, and subsequent rankings, may be based on other criteria, such as the popularity of a result produced by an interpretation candidate, the distance between a result produced by the interpretation candidate and a user's location, etc. - Next, the interpretation candidates are ranked based on the assigned scores (block 212). After ranking, results for the geographical search query are provided based on the interpretation candidates (block 214). The results are obtained from a
geographical search engine 216, such as by executing one or more interpretation candidates by thegeographical search engine 216. In some embodiments, the highest ranked interpretation candidate for the geographical search query is selected and used to provide a result to the geographical search query. In other embodiments, two, three, four, or more of the highest ranked interpretation candidates may be selected and used to provide multiple results to the geographical search query. In such an embodiment, the results are provided with a request to a user for confirmation of the correct interpretation candidate and result. - As described above, a geographical search query is evaluated against query templates to determine interpretation candidates for the geographical search query. The query templates are generated (also referred to as “mined”) from previously executed geographical search queries having a set of terms.
FIG. 3 depicts aprocess 300 for generating query templates from previously executed geographical search query logs. Initially, geographical search query logs are obtained (block 302), such as from a map search engine (block 304). For example, the geographical search query logs may be logs of geographical search queries received from users and executed by themap search engine 304. Additionally, in some embodiments, the geographical search query logs are specific to a particular context, such as a particular language, locale, country, domain (e.g., .com, .de, etc.), other suitable contexts or combination thereof. In other embodiments, the geographical search query logs correspond to multiple contexts, such as multiple locales, languages, countries, domains, etc. - Next, unique queries from the query log are determined (block 306). The geographical search query logs may include duplicate queries. The duplicate queries are removed by determining the unique queries from the query logs for further processing. Next, the interpretation for each unique query is determined (block 308). In some embodiments, the interpretation for each unique query is determined by executing the query in the
map search engine 304 or from query logs. Additionally, in some embodiments, the interpretation for a query is determined from additional signals from user actions (block 309). For example, in some embodiments, subsequent user actions after query execution may provide indications of a probable query interpretation. Such user actions may include, for example, a user selecting a search result, reading a web page of a search results, entering a subsequent query (e.g., refining a query by adding additional terms), and so on. - After determining the interpretations for each unique query, query templates are extracted from the interpretations (block 310). The query templates may include any number of term types in any arrangement. The term types may include, for example, address numbers, routes (e.g., streets, roads, or other transportation paths having names), cities, countries, postal codes, locales, localities, provinces, states, etc. Additionally, term types may include types for bodies of water, terrain features (e.g., mountains, contoured terrain), points of interest (e.g., landmarks, tourist attractions, etc.), political districts or divisions, transit system components (e.g., railway stations, bus stations, etc.), or other suitable term types. Thus, examples of the query templates may include: address route city state; city state; route address; route city state; route city; or any suitable arrangement of term types.
- Next, the unique query templates are counted (block 312). After extracting query templates from the interpretations, any duplicate query templates are removed by counting the unique query templates. Next, the probability distributions for query templates for specific contexts are determined (block 314). As mentioned above, such contexts may include a language, a locale, a client type (e.g., desktop or mobile) or other contexts. Here again, in some embodiments, the probabilities may be determined using the additional signals from user actions (block 309). The probability distributions provide the likelihood that a query template is the correct interpretation for a given geographical search query for a context. For example, geographical search queries received from a first locale (e.g., Romania) may follow a different arrangement of term types than a geographical search query received from a second locale (e.g., the U.S.A.). Moreover, for a specific context, such as a specific locale, variations in the arrangement of terms in a geographical search query result in multiple query templates each having a different probability of being a correct interpretation of a query for that context. These probabilities may be used to evaluate a geographical search query received from a user. For example, such a geographical search query may include the query “zurich 9000”. Based on the generated query templates, such a query may include interpretation candidates of “city postal code” and “street_number route”. Each of these interpretation candidates may have a probability of being the correct interpretation. For example, the interpretation candidate “city postal code” may have a probability of 65%, and the interpretation candidate “street_number route” may have a probability 23%. As described above, this probability is used in the scoring and ranking of interpretation candidates for the geographical search query of “zurich 9000” when determining the appropriate result to the query.
- The
query templates 316 and, in some embodiments, the probability distributions, are stored and used in further processing. In some embodiments, thequery templates 316 are indexed (block 318) to provide indexedquery templates 320. For example, the indexing enables faster searching and retrieval of the query templates during processing a geographical search query. In some embodiments, the query template generation process is executed “offline” to predetermine query templates for use by in processing search queries. For example, after accumulating query logs and user actions, additional query templates may be generated and incorporated into the templates available for query interpretations. Further, in some embodiments, processing of queries, as described inFIG. 2 , may be performed without templates using the map search engine. After sufficient data is accumulated, templates may be generated to improve performance and accuracy of query processing. - As mentioned above, the query templates are stored, such as in a data repository (e.g., a database).
FIG. 4 depicts an example of adata structure 400 for storing query templates, transmitting query templates, or both. Thedata structure 400 may be stored as a message for packaging and transmission, as a record in a table of database, etc. The discussion of thedata structure 400 refers to various attributes and values that are associated via any suitable structure, such as key-value pairs, rows and columns of a table, etc. Thedata structure 400 may include any number of columns and information suitable for storage with a query template. As shown inFIG. 4 , attributes of thedata structure 400 includesfeature type 402,query template 404,language 406,country 408, count 410, andtype 412. - The
feature type 402 identifies the type of result produced by interpreting a query using the query template identified by thequery template attribute 404. For example, a result identifies a route, a city, a province, a state, a country, or any other geographic area or identification. Thequery template 404 stores the sequence of term types for the query template. - Additional attributes of the
data structure 400 identify various contexts for a query or query template. For example, thelanguage 406 identifies the language of a query or query template. Thecountry 408 identifies the country code where a query originated from, such as identifying the country by IP address, country code, or other identifier. Thecount 410 identifies the count of the template, such as the count determined above inFIG. 3 that is used in probability determinations for a query template. Finally, thedata structure 400 includes aquery type 412 identifying a type of a query. For example, thequery type 412 may refer to a client type, e.g., desktop or mobile. -
FIGS. 5A-5B depict various geographical search queries and corresponding interpretation candidates/query templates in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As mentioned above, however, any one of the geographical search queries may have two or more interpretation candidates, although only one interpretation candidate is depicted inFIGS. 5A-5D . -
FIG. 5A depicts ageographical search query 500 of “5 wall st. ny”. As shown inFIG. 5A , thisgeographical search query 500 has aninterpretation candidate 502 of “street_number route locality” such that the term “5” of thequery 500 corresponds to a term type of “street_number”, the term “wall st”. of thequery 500 corresponds to a term type of “route”, and the term “ny” of the query corresponds to a term type of “locality”. Thus, as described above, this interpretation candidate is derived from a query template have a term type arrangement of “street_number route locality”. -
FIG. 5B depicts ageographical search query 504 of “5th ave nt”. As shown inFIG. 5B , thisgeographical search query 504 has aninterpretation candidate 506 of “route locality”. Based on this interpretation candidate, the term “5th ave” of thequery 506 corresponds to a term type of “route” and the term “ny” of thequery 506 corresponds to a term type of “locality”. Thus, as described above, this interpretation candidate is derived from a query template have a term type arrangement of “route locality”. -
FIG. 5C depicts ageographical search query 508 of “eiffel tower”. As shown inFIG. 5C , thisgeographical search query 508 has aninterpretation candidate 510 of “entity_poi”. Thus, based on theinterpretation candidate 510, the term “eiffel tower” of thequery 508 corresponds to a single term type (“entity_poi”) for a point of interest. The query template for theinterpretation candidate 510 may thus be the term type arrangement of “entity_poi”. - Finally,
FIG. 5D depicts ageographical search query 512 of “new york”. As shown inFIG. 5D , thisgeographical search query 512 has aninterpretation candidate 514 of “locality”. Thus, based on theinterpretation candidate 514, the term “new york” of thequery 508 corresponds to a single term type of “locality”. As mentioned above, a geographical search query may have multiple interpretation candidates. For example, “new york” may be interpreted based on query templates of term type “locality” and term type “state”. Each of these query templates may have a different probability of being the correct interpretation, and selection of interoperation candidates is based on a scoring and ranking that incorporates these probabilities. - In some embodiments, query templates are provided to other processes for analysis and determination of different data.
FIG. 6 depicts a process 660 illustrating the providing ofquery templates 602 to various other processes for different determinations. In some embodiments, for example, the changes to the query templates are analyzed over a time period (block 604). As noted above, query templates may be generated periodically, such as every hour, every day, every week, every month, etc. The query templates may thus be analyzed over such periods to determine changes to the query templates. For example, each query template from one previous period, two previous periods, three previous periods, four previous periods, are stored and compared to the query templates generated for the present period. For example, for query templates generated every two months, the query templates generated for one period may compared to query templates generate two months ago. - After analyzing query templates over time, performance metrics are determined (block 606). For example, if the query templates become less specific and contain less term types over time, this may indicate that the interpretations provided for the users' geographical search queries are relatively accurate, enabling users to specific a lower number of terms when entering a geographical search query. Additionally, in some embodiments analyzing the query templates over time is used to determine query usages (block 608). Because the queries are generated from previously executed queries that are received from users, the changes in the query templates over time correspond to changes in users' queries. The changes in users' queries may indicate how queries for a specific context are changing over time. For example, users in a specific locale may stop specifying certain terms in queries or may start including certain terms in queries, and such changes are reflected in the term types of the query templates.
- Additionally, the query templates are used to generate n-grams and prefixes for various linguistic processes (block 610). For example, popular query templates for a context (e.g., the query templates having the highest probabilities or that provide the most popular interpretation candidates) are used as a basis for generating n-grams and prefixes for certain terms. In some embodiments, the n-grams and prefixes are used to provide spelling corrections (block 612), such as for subsequent geographical search queries or other queries. Additionally, in some embodiments, the n-grams and prefixes are used to provide query suggestions (block 614), such as for subsequent geographical search queries. For example, when a user begins to enter a geographical search query, an “autocomplete” suggestion may be provided for the query based on the n-grams and prefixes determined from popular query templates.
