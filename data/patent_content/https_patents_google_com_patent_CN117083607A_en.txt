Abstract
Systems and methods for generating queries and responses based on application metadata are provided. The system and method may include a data processing system ("DPS"). The DPS may receive a request for content from a client device. The DPS may access metadata for one or more applications available for installation, the metadata for each application including a plurality of field-value pairs including values received from devices corresponding to publishers of the application. The DPS may determine an entry associated with the application from the metadata, including a query and a corresponding response. The DPS may select a content item comprising a subset of one or more items and an actionable object that, when selected, causes the client device to access an information resource from which an application of the one or more applications may be installed. The DPS may transmit the content item for display on the client device.
Description
Background
In a computerized content delivery network, electronic content items may be distributed from a content server to user devices via content slots provided by content publishers. The content provider may serve one or more content items to the content server. The content publisher may provide one or more content slots (e.g., content item slots) configured to present at least one content item. The content server may select at least one content item and provide the content item to the content slot. The content publisher may present the content item in a content slot for display on the client device.
Disclosure of Invention
The content server may select and provide content items of different styles or formats to the client device. The content item may comprise an image, video or other playable format. In some implementations, the content items can include one or more queries (sometimes referred to as queries) and one or more corresponding responses (e.g., predetermined selections, options, or interactive elements). A user of the client device may provide an input indicating a selection of at least one of the one or more responses. The content server may provide at least one content item to the client device. A user of the client device may select a response corresponding to at least one query within the content item. A content provider that provides content items may provide rewards to a user in response to the user successfully interacting with one or more content items. In some cases, a content publisher that presents one or more content items via at least one corresponding content slot may provide a reward after a user successfully interacts with the one or more content items. Motivating a user with a reward may increase user engagement with a content item (e.g., increase participation, viewing, or user interaction with a content item).
Traditionally, a content provider may create or generate one or more queries for a content server to generate content items. For each query, the content provider may provide a set of responses (e.g., selections of responses) corresponding to the query. The content server may include queries and responses into the content items for presentation in at least one content slot provided by a content publisher of the various content publishers. However, generating and storing queries and responses can be resource intensive for a content server and can be time consuming for a content provider that provides queries, responses, or other content to generate content items. For example, conventionally, content providers may plan a combination or arrangement of queries and responses, responses to each query, or update queries and responses for generating content items, which may be a time-consuming process. Further, because these queries and corresponding responses may be included in content items stored by the content server, they may consume a significant amount of storage resources from the content server.
To address the challenges associated with interactive content items, namely the amount of time consumed by a content provider to generate queries and responses for such content items and the amount of storage resources consumed by a content server to store such content items, the systems and methods described herein may automatically generate queries and responses for content items. In some implementations, the interaction-based content items can be used to facilitate or increase user engagement with certain applications to be installed on the client device (e.g., directing queries to or based on information of the applications).
For such interaction-based content items related to a client application, the present disclosure may be directed to one or more processors (e.g., of a data processing system or content server) configured to automatically generate queries and responses based on metadata associated with the application. The metadata may be accessible to the data processing system. By generating queries and responses from metadata accessible by the data processing system, the data processing system can reduce the amount of data stored in the database as well as the amount of data sent to and received from the content provider. Further, the data processing system may reduce the amount of time it takes for administrators of content providers to generate such queries and responses, arrange the content of content items, or update their inventory of queries and responses.
The data processing system may teach the user and determine the accuracy of metadata of the application with respect to the application using the interaction-based content items generated using the metadata of the application corresponding to the content items. For example, depending on the provided user's responses to certain queries (e.g., selection of at least one response in a list of responses), the response (or feedback) from the user may be used to confirm the accuracy of the metadata of the application. Thus, the systems and methods described herein may reduce resource consumption (e.g., from storing queries and interactive elements from content providers via generating content items with metadata corresponding to applications), reduce network traffic (or network congestion), and reduce time consumption for content providers because the content providers will not need to send queries, responses, or content to a content server for generating content items.
At least one aspect is directed to a method of generating queries and responses based on application metadata. The method may include a data processing system including one or more processors and memory. The method may include receiving, by a data processing system, a request for content from a client device. The method may include accessing, by a data processing system, metadata of one or more applications available for installation, the metadata of each of the one or more applications including a plurality of field-value pairs including values received from devices corresponding to publishers of the applications. The method may include determining, by the data processing system, one or more entries associated with one or more applications from the metadata, the one or more entries including one or more queries and corresponding one or more responses. The method may include selecting, by the data processing system, a content item comprising a subset of one or more items and an actionable object, which when selected, causes the client device to access an information resource from which an application of the one or more applications may be installed. The method may include transmitting, by the data processing system, the content item to the client device for display on the client device.
In some implementations, the method can include receiving, by the data processing system, input from the client device corresponding to a correct response associated with the content item. The method may include terminating, by the data processing system, the content item on the client device. The method may include disabling, by the data processing system, visibility of a display of the content item on the client device. In some implementations, the application can be a first application, and the request for content can include an identification of a second application that includes a content slot in which the content item is presented. In some implementations, to select the content item, the method can include selecting, by the data processing system, the content item based on the identification of the second application and the type of content slot.
In some implementations, the method can include selecting, by the data processing system, a subset of one or more entries for inclusion in the content item, the data processing system selecting each entry of the subset by identifying a priority for each field from a plurality of field-value pairs of metadata of the application, the allocation of the priorities being based on either i) a number of values associated with the field, or ii) a number of incorrect responses previously received from the client device for the content item including the query for the field. In some implementations, a selection model can be used to select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in a content item. The method may include receiving, by the data processing system from the client device, interaction data with the content item presented on the client device, the interaction data identifying a response selected at the client device. The method may include updating, by the data processing system, a selection model for selecting a plurality of entries for a plurality of client devices based on interaction data from the client devices.
In some implementations, the content items can include scripts that, when executed on the client device, can cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to provide interaction data to the data processing system that is detected from a selection of one or more interactive elements within the content slot.
In some implementations, the content items may include images corresponding to rewards and scripts that, when executed on the client device, may cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect the first interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates an incorrect response. The script may cause the client device to provide a notification to a display device of the client device indicating that the selection is incorrect. The script may cause the client device to detect the second interaction data from a selection of other one or more interactive elements associated with the subset of one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates a correct response. The script may cause the client device to present an image corresponding to the reward to a display device of the client device in response to determining that the second interaction data corresponds to the correct response.
In some implementations, the method can include determining, by the data processing system, that the interaction time exceeds a threshold after presenting the content item on the client device. The method may include triggering, by the data processing system, a script of the content item to cause the client device to present a reward corresponding to the content item in response to the interaction time exceeding a threshold. In some implementations, the content items can include scripts that, when executed on the client device, can cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates a correct response. The script may cause the client device to send, in response to determining that the correct response is selected, an instruction to an entity associated with the content provider to update a value corresponding to the content provider, the value corresponding to a performance indicator of a content item including a subset of the one or more items and the actionable object associated with the application.
At least one aspect is directed to a system for generating queries and responses based on application metadata. The system may include a data processing system including one or more processors and memory. The data processing system may receive a request for content from a client device. The data processing system may access metadata of one or more applications available for installation, the metadata of each of the one or more applications including a plurality of field-value pairs including values received from devices corresponding to publishers of the applications. The data processing system may determine one or more entries associated with one or more applications from the metadata, the one or more entries including one or more queries and corresponding one or more responses. The data processing system may select a content item comprising a subset of one or more items and an actionable object, which when selected, causes the client device to access an information resource from which an application of the one or more applications may be installed. The data processing system may send the content item to the client device for display on the client device.
In some implementations, the data processing system can receive input from the client device corresponding to a correct response associated with the content item. The data processing system may terminate the content item on the client device. The data processing system may disable visibility of the content item displayed on the client device. In some implementations, the application can be a first application, and the request for content can include an identification of a second application that includes a content slot in which the content item is presented. In some implementations, to select the content item, the data processing system can select the content item based on an identification of the second application and a type of the content slot.
In some implementations, the data processing system may select a subset of one or more entries for inclusion in the content item, the data processing system selecting each entry of the subset by identifying a priority for each field from a plurality of field-value pairs of metadata of the application, the allocation of the priorities being based on i) a number of values associated with the field, or ii) a number of incorrect responses previously received from the client device for the content item including the query for the field. In some implementations, a selection model can be used to select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in a content item. The data processing system may receive, from a client device, interaction data with a content item presented on the client device, the interaction data identifying a response selected at the client device. The data processing system may update a selection model for selecting a plurality of items for a plurality of client devices based on interaction data from the client devices.
In some implementations, the content items can include scripts that, when executed on the client device, can cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to provide interaction data to the data processing system that is detected from a selection of one or more interactive elements within the content slot.
In some implementations, the content items may include images corresponding to rewards and scripts that, when executed on the client device, may cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect the first interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates an incorrect response. The script may cause the client device to provide a notification to a display device of the client device indicating that the selection is incorrect. The script may cause the client device to detect the second interaction data from a selection of other one or more interactive elements associated with the subset of one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates a correct response. The script may cause the client device to present an image corresponding to the reward to a display device of the client device in response to determining that the second interaction data corresponds to the correct response.
In some implementations, the data processing system can determine that the interaction time exceeds a threshold after rendering the content item on the client device. The data processing system may trigger a script of the content item to cause the client device to present a reward corresponding to the content item in response to the interaction time exceeding a threshold. In some implementations, the content items can include scripts that, when executed on the client device, cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot. The script may cause the client device to detect interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The script may cause the client device to determine that the selection indicates a correct response. The script may cause the client device to send, in response to determining that the correct response is selected, an instruction to an entity associated with the content provider to update a value corresponding to the content provider, the value corresponding to a performance indicator of a content item including a subset of the one or more items and the actionable object associated with the application.

Detailed Description
The following is a more detailed description of various concepts and embodiments thereof related to methods, apparatus, and systems for generating queries and responses based on application metadata for content items. Since the concepts described are not limited to any particular embodiment, the various concepts introduced above and discussed in more detail below may be implemented in any of a variety of ways.
The content server may select and provide content items of different styles or formats to the client device. The content items may include images, videos, other playable formats, or other elements configured to appear for display on the client device. When rendered on a client device, the content item may be interactive (e.g., including at least one interactive element in the content item) or playable. In some implementations, the content items can include one or more queries (sometimes referred to as queries) and one or more corresponding responses (e.g., predetermined selections, options, or interactive elements for user selection). A user of the client device may provide an input indicating a selection of at least one of the one or more responses. The content server may provide at least one content item to the client device. A user of the client device may select a response corresponding to at least one query within the content item. A content provider that provides content items may provide rewards to a user in response to the user successfully interacting with one or more content items. In some cases, a content publisher that presents one or more content items via at least one corresponding content slot may provide a reward after a user successfully interacts with the one or more content items. Motivating a user with a reward may increase user engagement with a content item (e.g., increase participation, viewing, or user interaction with a content item).
Traditionally, a content provider may create or generate one or more queries for a content server to generate content items. For each query, the content provider may provide a set of responses (e.g., selections of responses) corresponding to the query. The content server may include the query and the response into the content item for presentation in at least one content slot provided by a content publisher of the respective content publishers. However, generating and storing queries and responses can be resource intensive for a content server and can be time consuming for a content provider that provides queries, responses, or other content to generate content items. For example, conventionally, content providers may plan a combination or arrangement of queries and responses, responses to each query, or update queries and responses for generating content items, which may be a time-consuming process. Further, because these queries and corresponding responses may be included in content items stored by the content server, they may consume a significant amount of storage resources from the content server.
To address the challenges associated with interactive content items, namely the amount of time consumed by a content provider to generate queries and responses for such content items and the amount of storage resources consumed by a content server to store such content items, the systems and methods described herein may automatically generate queries and responses for content items. In some implementations, the interaction-based content items can be used to facilitate or increase user engagement with certain applications to be installed on the client device (e.g., directing queries to or based on information of the applications).
For such interaction-based content items related to a client application, the present disclosure may be directed to one or more processors (e.g., of a data processing system or content server) configured to automatically generate queries and responses based on metadata associated with the application. The metadata may be accessible to the data processing system. By generating queries and responses from metadata accessible by the data processing system, the data processing system can reduce the amount of data stored in the database as well as the amount of data sent to and received from the content provider. Further, the data processing system may reduce the amount of time it takes for administrators of content providers to generate such queries and responses, arrange the content of content items, or update their inventory of queries and responses.
The data processing system may introduce applications to a user and determine accuracy of metadata of the applications using the interaction-based content items generated using the metadata of the applications corresponding to the content items. For example, depending on the provided user's responses to certain queries (e.g., selection of at least one response in a list of responses), the response (or feedback) from the user may be used to confirm the accuracy of the metadata of the application. Thus, the systems and methods described herein may reduce resource consumption (e.g., from storing queries and interactive elements from content providers via generating content items with metadata corresponding to applications), reduce network traffic (or network congestion), and reduce time consumption for content providers because the content providers will not need to send queries, responses, or content to a content server for generating content items.
Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a computer system 100 is shown, according to an embodiment. Computer system 100 may include at least a network 102, a resource 104, a content provider 106, a user device 108 (sometimes referred to as a client device), a data storage device 110, a data processing system 112 ("DPS"), and a content publisher 114.DPS112 may be referred to as or include features and functionality of a content server to generate content items. The network 102 may facilitate communications or connections between the resources 104, the content provider 106, the user device 108, the data storage device 110, the DPS112, and the content publisher 114. For example, the user device 108 may request and receive resource content (e.g., web pages, documents, applications, etc.) from the resource 104 via the network 102. In some implementations, the resources 104 can include content item slots for presenting third party content items from the content provider 106. Information and data from the resources 104 (such as content slots, web pages, documents, application resources, application metadata, etc.) may be provided by the content publishers 114 that manage the resources 104. For example, the content publishers 114 can send or provide data (e.g., metadata, information, scripts, code, etc.) related to applications, web pages, documents, or other services to the resources 104. One or more components of computer system 100 (e.g., content provider 106, user device 108, data storage device 110, or DPS 112) may access resource 104. The DPS112 may receive a request for a content item from the user device 108, select a qualified content item or generate a content item in response to the request, and distribute the content item to the user device 108 via the network 102. The request for the content item from the user device 108 may be in response to the user device 108 accessing an application, web page, or other resource 104 managed by the at least one content publisher 114. The resource 114 may include at least one content slot for rendering the content item. To distribute the content items, the DPS112 may provide the selected or generated content items to a content slot provided by the content publisher 114. Accordingly, the content items can be rendered in content slots of respective resources 114 (e.g., applications, web pages, documents, etc.). In some implementations, one or more generated content items may be stored in a data storage device 110 accessible by the DPS 112.
The network 102 may be a local area network (local area network, LAN), wide area network (wide area network, WAN), cellular network, satellite network, radio network, the internet, or any other type of data network, or a combination thereof. Network 102 may include any number of computing devices (e.g., computers, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) configured to send, receive, or relay data. Network 102 may also include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example, the user device 108 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver of a computing device hardwired to the network 102 (e.g., via fiber optic cable, CAT5 cable, etc.). Network 102 may facilitate communications or connections between components of computer system 100.
Computer system 100 may include resources 104. The resources 104 may include any type of information or data structures that may be provided over the network 102. In some implementations, the resources 104 can be represented by a resource address (e.g., uniform resource locator (uniform resource locator, URL)) associated with each resourceAnd (5) identification. The resources 104 may include web pages (e.g., HTML web pages, PHP web pages, etc.), applications (e.g., downloadable or installable software that may be executed locally or via a connection to the network 102), word processing documents, portable document format (portable document format, PDF) documents, images, videos, programming elements, interactive content, streaming video/audio sources, or other types of electronic information. The resources 104 may include content or user interfaces (e.g., words, phrases, images, sounds, videos, computer graphics ("CG"), etc.) with embedded information (e.g., meta information embedded in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions. The embedded instructions may include computer readable instructions (e.g., software code) executable by the user device 108 (e.g., by an application running on the user device 108), Etc.).
In some implementations, the resources 104 can include content slots for rendering third-party content items. For example, the resource 104 may include one or more iframe elements (e.g., an HTML "iframe" element: < iframe > </iframe >) for rendering third-party content items from the content provider 106. The resource 104 may include a content slot for rendering a content item generated by the DPS 112. The iframe may be a linked "target" frame defined by other elements and may be selected by a user agent (e.g., user device 108, a web browser running on user device 108, an application executing on user device 108, etc.) as a focus for printing, viewing its source, or other forms of user interaction. The content slot may cause the user device 108 to request a third party content item from the DPS112 in response to viewing the first party resource content from the resource 104. For example, the user may initiate an application (e.g., a local application, a web application, etc.) on the user device 108. The user device 108 may request information (e.g., images, user interfaces, videos, interactive elements, content slots, etc.) associated with the application from the resource 104. The content slots of the application may cause the user device 108 to request a content item from the DPS112 (e.g., by sending a request for content to the DPS 112). The DPS112 may receive a request for content and generate at least one content item accordingly. The DPS112 may provide or transmit one or more content items to the content slots for rendering the content items in an application executing on the user device 108.
Computer system 100 may include a content publisher 114. For example, the content publishers 114 may be referred to as application publishers, website publishers, or resource providers. Content publishers 114 can provide data, such as application data, web pages, documents, and the like, to resources 104. Content publishers 114 can generate data to provide resources 104. For example, the content publisher 114 may create, modify, or delete web pages, applications, word processing documents, portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, programming elements, interactive content, streaming video/audio sources, or other types of electronic information from the resource 104. Content publishers 114 can provide first party resource content to resources 104. The user device 108 may request the first party resource content via a corresponding application executing on the user device 108.
In some implementations, the content publishers 114 can publish web pages or provide access to applications that include slots for inserting supplemental content provided by content providers other than the content publishers 114. For example, in such a technique, the content publisher 114 may insert a script (e.g., in the form of JAVASCRIPT) into the header of the application. When the application is loaded, the script may trigger the user device 108 to contact one or more content providers 106 to provide supplemental information (e.g., relevance score, interaction rate, likelihood of user interaction, bid value, etc., or any combination thereof) for selecting or generating content for inclusion in the application. In some cases, the script may trigger the user device 108 to contact the DPS112 to generate or select a content item to be included in the slot (e.g., using supplemental information provided by the content provider 106).
In some implementations, the content publishers 114 can provide incentives for content items that users participate in rendering in one or more content slots of the respective applications of the content publishers 114. For example, content publisher 114 may provide one or more iframe elements or data indicating a content slot type (e.g., banner, notification, or spot content slot) for inclusion in an application, a web page executing on a web browser, or a document presented in a document processing application. The content publisher 114 may provide code, scripts, or computer readable instructions to indicate the location or positioning of one or more content slots, an interval for displaying content slots (e.g., 10 minute period, 20 minute period, etc.), a condition for disabling the visibility of the content slots or terminating the display of the content slots (e.g., interactions with interactive elements appearing in the content slots, timeout periods, etc.), or an incentive (e.g., rewards) to be provided to a user device (e.g., a user account accessed in an executing application) when successfully interacting with the interactive elements of the content item. The content publishers 114 can provide incentives associated with applications executing on the user devices 108, such as coins, points (points) from the applications, cosmetics, objects, accessories, or other items (e.g., available, fair, or collectable in the applications). Content publisher 114 may indicate to the user one or more conditions to be met for sending the incentive. For example, the conditions may include at least a successful response from the user device 108 or participation in the content item for a predetermined time threshold (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.).
In some implementations, the content publisher 114 may register or opt-in to features or functions (e.g., services) provided by the DPS 112. For example, the content publisher 114 may provide or allocate a content slot for rendering the content item. If the content publisher 114 chooses to join the service provided by the DPS112, the DPS112 may provide the generated content item for presentation in the content slot. The content publisher 114 may provide incentives or rewards when the user satisfies a condition of the content item (e.g., duration of participation or successful interaction or selection of one of the responses). The user may select at least one response from a list of predetermined responses corresponding to the query. The DPS112 may monitor the user's interactions with the content item. If the user provides a satisfactory or successful response to the query, the DPS112 may access the resource 104 to retrieve the reward for provision to the user device 108. The DPS112 may transmit, present, or otherwise present rewards to the user device 108, which are reflected in applications executing on the user device 108 (e.g., applications of the content publishers 114).
The computer system 100 may include a content provider 106. The content provider 106 may include one or more electronic devices on behalf of an administrator, resource carrier, business owner, or other entity that uses the services provided by the DPS 112. The content provider 106 may include at least an application 116 and at least metadata 118. The applications 116 may include software, code, scripts, hyperlinks, and other information to direct the user device 108 to an installation page of an application, install an application, execute an application, and so forth. The DPS112 may access data of the application 116 to, for example, provide the user device 108 with an executable file for installing the application 116 of the content provider 106. In some cases, at least a subset or at least a portion of the information of the application 116 may be provided to the resource 104 for the user device 108 to access and execute applications associated with the content provider 106. Metadata 118 may include various field-value pairs associated with application 116. At least a portion or at least a subset of the metadata 118 may be presented in an installation page (e.g., store page) of the application 116 to indicate description or backend information of the application 116. In some implementations, the metadata of the application can be provided by the content provider 106. In some implementations, the metadata of the application may be determined by the DPS or another system in communication with the DPS. For example, the total number of downloads of an application or statistics related to devices that have downloaded the application may be determined by the DPS or other system rather than being received by the content provider 106.
For example, the fields in the field-value pair may include at least one of a title, description, genre or category, search term or keyword, at least one image, address of the application 116 page, rule or policy, application size, total number of downloads, latest version of the application 116, release date, at least one video (e.g., advance notice or initial presentation of the application 116 content), one or more content creators, comments, ratings, or other subject matter associated with or associated with the application 116. The values in the field-value pair may include a description, text, data, or file corresponding to the field, such as text of a title, descriptive text of the application 116, image data, hyperlinks or uniform resource locators ("URLs"), or an indication (e.g., in text form) of the application 116 genre of the category field.
The content provider 106 may transmit data or metadata 118 of the application 116 to the DPS112. In some cases, DPS112 may access application 116 or metadata 118 to generate a content item. For example, DPS112 may use the field-value pairs to generate one or more queries and corresponding responses. The DPS112 may use at least one query and at least one response associated with the query. DPS112 may identify or generate one or more responses (e.g., from other metadata of other applications) that are not included in the field-value pairs of application 116. In a further example, the DPS112 may select a category of the application 116 as a query (e.g., "what is the genre of this application"). If the categories of the application 116 include actions, adventure, and policies, the DPS112 may select one of the actions as a response. For other responses, the DPS112 may identify categories that are not listed in the metadata 118 of the application 116, such as mystery, policy, business, puzzle, or simulation. DPS112 may select at least one category for other responses that is not part of metadata 118. Accordingly, the DPS112 may generate at least one content item having a query and various responses.
In some implementations, the content provider 106 can be one or more administrators or developers of the application 116. The content provider 106 may register with the DPS112 to allow applications of the content provider 106 to be available through the application store or marketplace. As part of the registration process, the content provider 106 may provide metadata for the application to the DPS. In some implementations, the DPS may generate one or more field-value pairs of metadata based on the content of the application or based on data received from the content provider 106. In some implementations, the DPS may generate one or more field-value pairs of metadata for an application based on analysis of devices that have installed the application or have requested access to the application. The content provider 106 may be an editor of metadata 118 of the application 116. For example, if the content provider 106 is a developer of the promotional application 116, the content provider 106 may provide metadata 118 to provide details of the application 116 to a user of the user device 108. In some cases, the content provider 106 may be a retailer of promotional products (e.g., electronic products, apparel, accessories, household items, etc.). Each content provider 106 may communicate product information associated with a different product set to DPS112.
In some implementations, the content provider 106 may register or opt-in to features or functions (e.g., services) provided by the DPS112, such as automatically generating content items using application metadata. For example, the content provider 106 may allow the DPS112 to access and use application metadata provided by the content provider 106. When selecting to join a service, the DPS112 may access metadata 118 of the application 116 to generate one or more queries and responses. The content provider 106 may not need to provide separate queries or responses corresponding to each query for the DPS112 to generate the content item. In some implementations, the content provider 106 can send instructions or rules for generating the content item, such as a background image for rendering the content item, an arrangement of selectable responses (e.g., based on alphabetical order or response values). The value of the response may refer to a hexadecimal value, a binary value, or a size of a number for presentation in the response. The content provider 106 may indicate for the DPS112 which field-value pair(s) to use to generate the one or more content items.
In some implementations, after generating the content item, the DPS112 may store the content item in at least one of the various data storage devices 110. In some other implementations, the DPS112 may not store the generated content items in the data storage device 110. For example, in response to receiving a request for content, the DPS112 may obtain the latest metadata 118 from the content provider 106 (e.g., in an application page, store page, or installation page associated with the application 116). In another example, the DPS112 may store a portion of the generated content item for use in generating other content items, such as background subjects/images, types of field-value pairs to be used, dimensions of the content item, or other configurations that may be used as templates for generating additional content items.
In some implementations, the content provider 106 may submit or configure the DPS112 with the activity parameters to the DPS 112. The activity parameters may be used to control the distribution of the content items to the user device 108. The activity parameters may include keywords associated with the content item, bids corresponding to the keywords, application types for displaying the content item, application types for not displaying the content item, content distribution budget, geographic constraints, or other criteria that the DPS112 uses to determine when the content item may be presented to the user device 108.
The content provider 106 may access the DPS112 to monitor the performance of content items distributed according to established activity parameters. For example, the content provider 106 may access the DPS112 to view one or more behavioral indicators associated with a content item or collection of content items. The behavioral indicators may describe interactions (e.g., impressions, clicks, conversions, spending amounts, etc.) between the user device 108 with respect to the distributed content item or collection of content items. In some cases, the behavioral indicators may describe interactive elements selected by the user and descriptions corresponding to those interactive elements, such as presentation text, field-value pairs, or metadata 118 of the application 116.
Computer system 100 may include user device 108. User device 108 may include any number and/or type of user-operable electronic devices. For example, user device 108 may include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smart phone, a tablet computer, a mobile communication device, a remote workstation, a client terminal, an entertainment console, or any other device capable of interacting with other components of computer system 100 (e.g., via a communication interface). For example, the user device 108 may be capable of receiving resource content from the resource 104 and/or third party content items from the content provider 106 or DPS 112. User device 108 may include a mobile device or a non-mobile device.
In some implementations, the user device 108 includes an application (e.g., a web browser, resource renderer, etc.) for converting the electronic content into a format (e.g., visual, auditory, graphical, etc.) that is understandable to the user. An application may be installed at a user device108 or via a communication interface, such as to access a web application executing on a device of the DPS112 or the content publisher 114. For example, an application may be installed by accessing or visiting a store page of the application, an application page of the content publisher 114, or an application page of the content provider 106 (e.g., of the application 116 linked in the content item). The user device 108 may include user interface elements (e.g., electronic display, speaker, keyboard, mouse, microphone, printer, etc.) for presenting content to a user, receiving user input, or facilitating user interaction with electronic content (e.g., clicking on a content item, hovering over a content item, etc.). The user device 108 may act as a user agent for allowing a user to view HTML encoded content. The user device 108 may include a processor capable of processing embedded information (e.g., meta information embedded in hyperlinks, etc.) and executing embedded instructions. The embedded instructions may include computer-readable instructions (e.g., software code, Etc.).
In some implementations, the user device 108 may be able to detect interactions with the distributed content items. Interactions with the content item may include hovering over the content item, clicking on the content item (e.g., an interactive element in the content item), viewing source information of the content item, or any other type of interaction between the user device 108 and the content item. In some cases, interactions with content items may not require explicit actions by a user for a particular content item. In some implementations, an impression (e.g., displaying or presenting a content item) may be eligible for interaction. In such implementations, the content item may be terminated or hidden from display after a predetermined time. Criteria for defining which user actions (e.g., active or passive) qualify as interactions may be determined by the content provider 106 or by the DPS112 on an individual basis (e.g., for each content item).
The user device 108 may be configured to execute the computer-readable fingers in response to the detected interaction with the content itemCode (e.g., software code,Etc.). Computer readable instructions may be included in the distributed content items or otherwise provided to the user device 108. In some implementations, the computer-readable instructions cause the user device 108 to present a personalized visual display in response to the detected interaction with the content item. Personalized visual displays may refer to related visual displays of applications, web pages, or documents that are targeted to the respective user or targeted to user access. The personalized visual display may include multiple product images associated with a single content provider 106. If the visual display includes images, the images may be arranged in a collage, mosaic, or other visual presentation format such that multiple images may be presented to the user device 108 concurrently. The visual display may be associated with a user-oriented application and may include an image of the application or a link to direct the user device 108 to an application page (e.g., to install or view details of the application). The computer-readable instructions may cause the user device 108 to present details or elements of the application (e.g., application summary, specification, price, image, purchase information, release date, etc.) in the visual display in response to the detected interaction with the application image or application link associated in the personalized visual display.
Computer system 100 may include a data storage device 110. The data storage device 110 may be any type of memory device capable of storing profile data, content item data, billing data, or any other type of data used by the DPS 112. In some cases, the data storage device 110 may store data for use by other components of the computer system 100 (such as the content provider 106 or the user device 108). The data storage device 110 may include any type of non-volatile memory, medium, or memory device. For example, data storage device 110 may include semiconductor memory devices (e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory devices, etc.), magnetic disks (e.g., internal hard disk, removable magnetic disk, etc.), magneto-optical disks, and/or CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. In some implementations, the data storage device 110 may be located locally to the DPS112 or the content provider 106. In other implementations, the data storage device 110 may be a remote data storage device that is connected to the DPS112 via the network 102.
The data storage device 110 may store various templates to generate content items for different types of content slots. For example, the data storage device 110 may store templates for video content slots, banner content slots, static content slots, spot content slots, notification content slots, and the like. The templates may have different sizes, wherein one or more content items may be stretched or contracted to fit the templates. Based on the type of content slot (e.g., the type of content item to be displayed in the slot), the DPS112 may use different templates to generate the content item. The data storage device 110 may store data for the application 116 for the content provider 106. The data storage device 110 may store metadata 118. In some implementations, the data storage device 110 can store at least a subset of the information from the resource 104.
The data storage device 110 may store historical data of a user (e.g., a user account or user device 108). The data storage device 110 may store historical user interactions with content items that are presented in an application of at least one content publisher 114. For example, the data storage device 110 may include, store, or maintain information related to a user's response to a query, such as selection of interactive elements or randomly generated interactive elements based on application metadata. The DPS112 may use the interaction data to determine performance data or performance metrics (e.g., measure performance) of the application metadata. For example, if most users select the same interactive element as a response to the query, the DPS112 may determine whether the query is unintelligible (e.g., will not confuse the user selecting at least one response corresponding to the query), whether the application metadata is inaccurate if the first selectable element provided in the content item is clicked by most users, or other indications or hints that may be derived from the performance data of the content item. In some cases, the DPS112 may inform the content provider 106 of the performance metrics. For example, DPS112 may indicate a general trend or common response provided by a user to one or more queries. Based on the common response, the content provider 106 may examine, update, or maintain the application metadata. The content provider 106 may provide instructions to the DPS112 to generate similar content items with high performance, not generate content items with low performance, or generate content items with a higher amount of interaction rate.
The data storage device 110 may store user information associated with the user device 108. The user information may include, for example, user-specific information (e.g., user demographics, user preferences, user behavior data, user profile data, etc.), contextual information (e.g., user location, web page context, recent page views, etc.), keyword information (e.g., keywords associated with a particular web page or search query, etc.), and/or other information that may be used to generate queries or responses related to or of interest to a particular user or user device. The user information may include applications installed on the user device 108, applications that the user has recently used (e.g., within an hour, day, week, etc.), or categories of applications that the user has executed or installed (e.g., genres).
For the case where the system discussed herein collects personal information about a user or may utilize personal information, the user is provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how content that may be more relevant to the user is received from a content server. Furthermore, prior to storing or using certain data, it is processed (e.g., by DPS 112) in one or more ways such that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user is processed such that personally identifiable information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user (summarized as such as city, zip code, or country level) may be summarized where location information is obtained such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how the DPS112 collects and uses information (e.g., by application, by user device 108, etc.).
In some implementations, the data storage device 110 may be part of a data storage server or system capable of receiving and responding to requests from the DPS112. For example, the data storage device 110 may receive a request for application metadata or user information from the DPS112 and provide the requested information to the DPS112. In addition to the data discussed above, data storage device 110 may also store other data from any of the components of computer system 100 that may be described herein.
Computer system 100 may include DPS112 (sometimes referred to as a content server, computing system, or processing component of computer system 100). The DPS112 may receive or retrieve application metadata from the content provider 106 and/or the data storage device 110. In some implementations, the application metadata may be updated in real-time or prior to retrieval by DPS112. For example, the content provider 106 may provide updates to the metadata 118. In response to the update, application metadata stored in the data storage device 110 associated with the application 116 of the content provider 106 may be updated. In some implementations, the metadata 118 may be provided directly from the content provider 106 for the DPS112 to generate queries and responses. In some implementations, the metadata 118 may be determined by the DPS112 based on data collected by the DPS112 or another system in communication with the DPS112. For example, the total number of downloads or the application size of the application may be determined by the DPS112 without receiving data from the content provider. The DPS112 may generate or select various queries or responses that are estimated to be most relevant to a particular user or user device (e.g., the user device on which the personalized visual display will be presented) or of most interest to a particular user or user device (e.g., the user device on which the personalized visual display will be presented). The generated query may be based on, for example, the type of query that the user is likely to query when seeking to install the application, such as the genre of the application, what the application is generally about, rules or policies of the application, or what is generally desired in installing/using the application.
The DPS112 may generate content items that may be personalized to the user (e.g., based on user information, search history, cookies, queries, or applications executed by or installed on the user device 108) and cause the content items to be presented via the particular user device via content slots provided by the content publisher 114. The content items may include background displays (e.g., transparency, color, image, watermark, etc.) presented via presentation in corresponding content slots. The background display may be based on or from application metadata, such as an image of the application or a color matching the background of the application page.
The content item may include an interactive element such as a link to an application 116 of the content provider 106 (e.g., a second application different from the first application executing on the user device 108 having the content slot and rendering the content item) or a selection for responding to a query. The DPS112 may select for the user based on at least one field-value pair of the application metadata. The DPS112 may use the value from the corresponding field-value pair to generate or select at least one selection and generate other selections based on the value corresponding to the field but not in the field-value pair. For example, if the query indicates that the user selects a response with rules of a second application (such as chess), the DPS112 may generate at least one selection with one of the rules from the second application (e.g., win a dead opponent for a game), and generate other selections not related to the second application (e.g., move one level up by a collection coin, slide left or right to turn, move using the "w", "s", "a", "d" keys, etc.). The DPS112 may present a selection (portfolio) including the performance metrics or status of the activity to the content provider 106. The selection presented to the content provider 106 may indicate conversion events (e.g., clicks, page views, etc.) from the user device 108, conversion rates (e.g., click-throughs, number of views, application 116 installations after user interaction with the interactive element, etc.), or activity costs of the service utilizing the DPS112. DPS112 is described in more detail with reference to fig. 2.
Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram illustrating a DPS is shown, in accordance with an embodiment. DPS112 may include a communication interface 120 and processing circuitry 130. Communication interface 120 may include a wired or wireless interface (e.g., jack, antenna, transmitter, receiver, transceiver, wired terminal, ethernet port, wiFi transceiver, etc.) for data communication with a local or remote device or system. Communication interface 120 may allow DPS112 to communicate with components of computer system 100, such as network 102, resources 104, content provider 106, user devices 108, and data storage device 110. For example, the communication interface 120 may allow the DPS112 to receive or retrieve communications from a user device (e.g., the user device 108), user information from a data storage device (e.g., the data storage device 110), application metadata provided by the content provider 106, or resources provided by a content publisher. The communication interface 120 may allow the DPS112 to transmit or provide data to components of the computer system 100, such as providing generated content items to content slots provided by the content publishers 114, transmitting performance metrics (e.g., conversion rate or historical interactions of users with content items) to the content providers 106, providing notifications, content items or web applications to the user devices 108, or transmitting data to store or update the data storage devices 110.
The communication interface 120 may be configured to receive metadata (e.g., metadata 118) from the content provider 106 and/or the data storage device 110. The metadata may include, for example, application images (e.g., thumbnail images, low/medium/high resolution images, alternate application images, etc.), application details (e.g., application summaries, application descriptions, release dates, comments, application categories, etc.), and/or other information from field-value pairs of the application metadata. In some implementations, the content provider 106 can provide additional information to incorporate when generating one or more content items, such as custom logos, icons, images, or backgrounds (e.g., business or company icons) that represent the content provider 106.
Communication interface 120 may be configured to receive user information from user device 108 and/or data storage device 110. The user information may include, for example, user-specific information (e.g., user demographics, user preferences, user behavior data, etc.), contextual information (e.g., user location, web page context, recent page views, etc.), keyword information (e.g., keywords associated with a particular web page or search query, etc.), and/or other information that the DPS112 may use to generate or select queries related to a particular user or user device 108 or an application used by the user or user device 108 or a query of interest to the particular user or user device 108 or an application used by the user or user device 108 and corresponding response selections (e.g., a query related to an application installed on the user device 108 or a query directed to a user preference when seeking to install a new application on the user device 108). The application metadata may be stored on the data storage device 110 or the content provider device of the content provider 106. The application metadata may be updated in real-time, periodically each (e.g., check for updates every 10 minutes, every 1 hour, etc.), or in response to DPS112 requesting application metadata to generate a query or response. For any application metadata updates, if stored on the data storage device 110, the content provider 106 may communicate with the data storage device 110 to update the stored metadata. In some implementations, the application metadata may be stored locally on the content provider device such that the DPS112 may retrieve or request the metadata from the content provider 106.
DPS112 may include at least one processing circuit 130. The processing circuit 130 may include a processor 132 and a memory 134.DPS112 may perform the features and functions of processing circuitry 130, processor 132, or memory 134 described herein. The processor 132 may be implemented as a general purpose processor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a CPU, a GPU, a set of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing components.
Memory 134 may include one or more devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, flash memory, hard disk storage, etc.) for storing data and/or computer code for carrying out and/or facilitating the various processes, layers, and modules described in this disclosure. Memory 134 may include volatile memory or nonvolatile memory. Memory 134 may include database components, object code components, script components, or any other type of information structure for supporting the various active actions and information structures described in this disclosure. In some implementations, the memory 134 is communicatively connected to the processor 132 via the processing circuit 130 and includes computer code (e.g., data modules stored in the memory 134) for performing one or more processes described herein. Briefly, memory 134 may include, but is not limited to, a request receiver 136, an application metadata manager 138, a query manager 140, a content item manager 142, a response collector 144, and an application registration manager 146. Components of the memory 134 (e.g., the request receiver 136, the application metadata manager 138, the query manager 140, the content item manager 142, the response collector 144, or the application registration manager 146) may be in electrical communication with other components of the memory 134 to perform the features and functions described herein, including at least generating or selecting queries and interactive elements, generating content items, determining queries or responses to be included in content items, determining performance of content items, providing activity information or statistics to the content provider 106, and so forth.
Still referring to FIG. 2, in more detail, the request receiver 136 may be configured to receive requests from the content publishers 114, the content providers 106, the user devices 108, or other components of the computer system 100. The request receiver 136 may receive a request for content from at least one of the user device 108 or the content publisher 114 that provides a content slot for the content item. For example, the request receiver 136 may receive a request from the user device 108 to access an application. The request to access the application may include at least a user interface that presents or displays the application, one or more content slots within the user interface, or a page within the display application. For example, receiving a request to access an application may include a request for a content item. Further, the resources 104 may include configurations of content slots, such as time intervals to refresh the content of the content slots, time intervals to display the content slots (e.g., spot content slots or notify content slots), or when to disable visibility or terminate the content slots. The content publisher 114 may adjust the configuration of the type of content slots to be provided in the application, the number of content items allowed to be displayed, the time interval at which the content is refreshed or displayed, and so forth.
In another example, the user device 108 may use data from the resource 104 to access an application managed by the content publisher 114 to update or execute the application. After accessing the application, the user device 108 may display a user interface of the application. The user interface of the application may include one or more content slots. To fill the content slots, the request receiver 136 may receive at least one request from the content publisher 114 for one or more content items to be rendered in the content slots. In some implementations, the request receiver 136 may receive a request to access an application or web page and a request for content simultaneously or concurrently to render or display a user interface of the application or web page with one or more content items.
The content slots may be embedded in a user interface of the application. The content slots may not be embedded in the user interface such that the content slots may be removed, replaced, or moved to different locations on the user interface. The content slots may be configured to appear or disappear, such as enabling or disabling visibility of the content slots (e.g., which in turn enables or disables visibility of content items in the respective content slots). For example, the content slots may be spot content slots to present spot content items. The break-in content item may cover a majority of the user interface of the application displayed on the user device 108. Most may refer to 70%, 80%, or 90% of the user interface (e.g., in a window appearing on the display of the user device 108). In some implementations, the content slots may be banner-type or notification-type content slots that may appear a predetermined time (such as 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) after accessing the application. The content slots may appear at the top, side(s), bottom, or other locations of the user interface. In some implementations, the content item or content slot may be transparent or at least partially transparent when rendered for display over a portion of the user interface. For example, the content publisher 114 may configure the content slots (e.g., and content items to be rendered in the content slots) to be transparent with a level of opacity (such as 80%, 70%, 60%, etc.). The level of opacity may be configured by the content publisher 114. The opacity of a content slot may be reflected in the opacity of a content item displayed in the corresponding content slot.
The request receiver 136 may receive a request from the content provider 106 for an activity state or performance of a content item generated using application metadata provided by the content provider 106. For example, the request receiver 136 may receive a request from the content provider 106 to generate a report (e.g., summary report or summary) of the performance of the activity. In response to the request receiver 136 receiving the request, the request receiver 136 may communicate with the content item manager 142, the response collector 144, or other components of the DPS112 to generate summary reports of at least conversion events, conversion rates, installation rates, activity costs, and other performance data of the content items generated using the application metadata from the respective content provider 106.
In some implementations, the request receiver 136 may receive a request for content from the user device 108 or the content publisher 114. The request for content may include an identification of a second application including a content slot in which to present at least one content item. The identification of the second application may be different from the identification of the first application, which may be an application executing on the user device 108. The first application may be from the content publisher 114 (e.g., the data of the first application may be from the resource 104) and the second application may be from the content provider 106, such as the application 116.
The request receiver 136 may receive a request from the user device 108 to access an information resource. The information resource may refer to the data storage device 110, an application page, a store page, or access data from the application 116 of the content provider 106. For example, the content item may include a link to redirect the user device 108 to an installation page for installing the second application or to directly install the second application in response to receiving the interaction of the user device 108. Thus, the request receiver 136 may receive a request from the user device 108 to access an information resource to install the application 116 of the content provider 106 when the user interacts with a link presented in the content item.
The application metadata manager 138 may access or retrieve metadata (sometimes commonly referred to as application metadata) for one or more applications available for installation. The application metadata may be stored in the data storage device 110 or on a local device of the content provider 106. The metadata may include various field-value pairs, where the value (e.g., description, data, etc.) of each field may be provided, configured, or indicated by the content provider 106. The metadata may be associated with the content provider 106. The application metadata manager 138 may retrieve metadata of other components of the DPS112 (e.g., the query manager 140 or the content item manager 142) for generating queries, responses, or content items, e.g., for rendering the content items in a content slot and on the user device 108. In some implementations, the application metadata manager 138 can access metadata of applications installed on the user device 108. The DPS112 may use, in part, metadata of an installed application, which may include a content slot for rendering a content item, to launch or provide access to the user device 108. In this case, the metadata may be provided or configured by the content publisher 114.
The application metadata manager 138 may receive metadata updates from the content provider 106. For example, the application metadata manager 138 may receive input of a value of a configuration field-value pair from a device of the content provider 106. In response to save or application changes, the application metadata manager 138 may propagate or forward the updated field-value pair(s) from the content provider 106 to any storage devices (e.g., the data storage device 110 or the metadata 118) that maintain the application's outdated metadata. Thus, when retrieving metadata for an application, DPS112 may generate a content item with the time-new query and response information. For example, if the metadata of the application is stored in a database for a store page or an installation page, the application metadata manager 138 may send the updated metadata corresponding to the application to the database, thereby updating the application information in the store page.
The application metadata manager 138 may monitor traffic to store pages or installation pages. Traffic to the installation page may include at least tour, view, download/install, time stamp (e.g., time of tour, download, view, etc., including rush hour or rush hour), etc. The application metadata manager 138 may monitor traffic of users visiting or redirected to the store and content items presented to the user device 108. For example, the application metadata manager 138 may gauge the conversion rate (e.g., click through rate) or performance of the content item to enable a user to visit an installation page or download an application of the content provider 106.
The application metadata manager 138 may determine the priority of each field-value pair. The priority of field-value pairs may be based on the likelihood of interacting with the content item when using the field-value pairs as queries or responses, on the field-value pairs that may be used to generate an attractive (or noticeable) query or response, or on relevance to the user (e.g., context of an application or web page in which the content item is to be presented). For example, the application metadata manager 138 may determine the interaction likelihood of the content item based on historical interaction data indicative of field-value pairs used to generate the content item and an interaction rate (or conversion rate) of the content item determined by recording interactions of the user with the content item. In another example, the application metadata manager 138 may identify field-value pairs, such as the name (or title) of the application, an image, a keyword, a category, a version, or a rule/policy. The application metadata manager 138 may prioritize field-value pairs, such as images, names, keywords (e.g., for searching applications in store pages), or categories that the user will likely understand or understand. When field-value pairs are used to generate a content item, the prioritization of one or more field-value pairs may indicate at least the engagement, understandability, or prominence of an item (e.g., a query or response). In some cases, for example, the versions of the applications may not be prioritized to generate queries or responses, as most users may not be aware of the specific version of the application of the content provider 106. In some other cases, the application metadata manager 138 may prioritize versions of the applications for generating queries or one or more responses.
The application metadata manager 138 may generate performance metrics or reports for the content provider 106 or the content publisher 114. In some implementations, the application metadata manager 138 can generate performance metrics or reports for the content provider 106 or the content publisher 114 based on the performance of the content items. For example, for the content provider 106, the application metadata manager 138 may generate a report indicating at least a number of content items provided for presentation or display, conversion rate (e.g., a tour to an application site after viewing at least one content item), installation rate (e.g., a user installation after presenting at least one content item), a list for generating queries and responses for the content items, performance of each query and response (e.g., participation rate or rate of participation for each query), and other aggregated summaries. The application metadata manager 138 may send the generated reports to the content provider 106 upon request (e.g., received from the respective content provider 106) or at predetermined periods (e.g., daily reports, weekly reports, monthly reports, etc.). For example, the application metadata manager 138 may generate and send a performance report for the content publisher 114 indicating a count of content items that are presented in the content slots over a period of time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), a bid provided to present the content items (e.g., a total amount from the content provider 106), or a reward distributed to the user (e.g., a user account or user device 108 that successfully interacted with the content items).
The query manager 140 may be referred to as an entry manager, a query generator/selector, or a response generator/selector. Query manager 140 may determine one or more entries associated with an application from content provider 160. The entries may be based on metadata of the application. The entries may include at least one or more queries and corresponding one or more responses. The response may be referred to as a selection, interactive element, selectable item, or predetermined button corresponding to the query. Each query may correspond to a plurality of responses. The user may provide a response (e.g., a reply to the query) by selecting at least one response using their user device 108.
For example, the query manager 140 may select or generate a query and corresponding response based on field-value pairs of metadata. Using the image and name fields as an example, query manager 140 may generate a query with "what is the name of this application? ", while displaying an entry for an image associated with the application. The query manager 140 may generate a response corresponding to the query, such as the correct name of the application and at least one name of other similar applications. The query manager 140 may group the generated set of queries and responses into entries. In another example, the category field of the metadata, what is one of the genres of the query 'application name' the query manager 140 may generate? ". The query may be presented as or entered into the content item using the image of the application. The query manager 140 may generate a response with at least one value from the category field of the application metadata and other responses with values not included in the value field of the application metadata. For example, if the values of the categories include actions and mystery, query manager 140 may generate a response having the following values: action, adventure, space, puzzle solution, and simulation. In some implementations, the query manager 140 can store the generated entries in a database (e.g., the data storage device 110). For example, if stored in a database, the query manager 140 may select or retrieve an entry from the database in response to receiving a request for content from the user device 108 or the content publisher 114. In some other implementations, the query manager 140 may not store the generated entries in a database. The query manager 140 may instead generate an entry upon receiving a request for content.
The query manager 140 may identify a performance history (e.g., performance metrics or historical statistics of the entries) for each query. For example, the query manager 140 may determine an entry (e.g., a query or response) for generating the content item. For each entry (e.g., each query or response corresponding to the query), the query manager 140 may determine the number of correct or incorrect responses provided by the user. A higher incorrect response (e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%, etc.) may indicate that the query (or predetermined response) may be confusing or unclear, too difficult, or uninteresting or irrelevant to the user. A higher correct response may indicate that the query (or predetermined response) is not challenging, obvious to the user, or self-evident. In some implementations, the query manager 140 may not pick or select the entry with the higher incorrect response. In some implementations, the query manager 140 can select the entry with the higher correct response. In some other implementations, the query manager 140 may select entries with a moderate level of correct or incorrect response (e.g., 60%, 70%, or 75% correct).
In some implementations, for a large number of incorrect responses, the query manager 140 can forward the performance history to the content provider 106, for example, to update metadata information (e.g., if the information provided in the metadata is incorrect). Further, based on the performance history, the query manager 140 can determine one or more entries to select or generate for presentation in the content slots of the application. The metadata used to generate the item may originate from a second application from the content provider 106, rather than from the first application providing the content publisher 114 for rendering the content slot with the query and corresponding response content item.
In some implementations, the query manager 140 can receive one or more responses provided by the user device 108 from the response collector 144. The query manager 140 may input the response to a machine learning engine or machine learning model to determine the next entry (or query and response) to use. The machine learning model may be referred to as a selection model for selecting queries or corresponding responses based on interaction data from the user device 108. For example, the query manager 140 may input a history of user responses to the entries into the machine learning model. The machine learning model may be trained using training data samples (e.g., historical query and response and user-selected sample data). The machine learning model may output an indication of the performance level of each query (e.g., conversion rate, correct selection of response, etc.), which may be ranked or listed as a report. Based on the performance level of each query and response pair, the query manager 140 may prioritize the use of one or more items over other items to increase user engagement with the content item. Prioritizing the items may refer to DPS112 more frequently selecting or generating items to generate content items for presentation in a content slot. In some implementations, the query manager 140 may not generate, retrieve, or provide one or more items to the content item manager 142 to generate content items based on the performance level of each item. The query manager 140 may prioritize (or mark higher order for) entries with higher performance levels. Based on the prioritization of the items, the query manager 140 may determine which item to generate or select for the content item manager 142. In some cases, based on the prioritization, the query manager 140 may determine which entry is not generated or selected for the content item manager 142.
In some implementations, the query manager 140 can select or generate a query or response personalized to the user or user device 108. For example, the query manager 140 may use a selection model (e.g., trained by a machine learning engine using one or more machine learning techniques) to determine the types of items with which the user is likely to interact. The selection model may be trained with interaction data from various users associated with various content items generated from different application metadata, such as based on the type of field-value pairs used, the type of application (e.g., action, puzzle, mystery, adventure, simulation, etc.), the number of selectable responses provided, font sizes of queries and responses, and the ratio of interactions of other formats and configurations of the content items of the application with the content items. The selection model may receive or be trained with the user's interaction data from the user device 108 to determine preferences or types of content items with which the user is likely to interact or translate. Accordingly, using the selection model, the query manager 140 can select queries and responses from the database that are personalized (or specialized) for the user based on the interaction data. In this way, the query manager 140 can provide items to the content item manager 142 to generate content items that can be translated from user interactions.
The content item manager 142 may select or generate content items that include at least a subset of one or more items and actionable objects. For example, the actionable object may be a link or hyperlink that links to an application of the content provider 106 for installation. For example, upon receiving an indication of interaction from the user device 108, the DPS112 may redirect the user device 108 to access a store page or an installation page associated with the application of the content provider 106. In some cases, the actionable object may be a script that, when selected by the user device, may cause the user device to access the information resource. From the information resource (e.g., a store page in a web browser), the user device 108 may install an application associated with the content item and/or actionable object.
The content item manager 142 may generate content items based on the items (e.g., queries and corresponding responses) determined, selected, generated, or provided by the query manager 140. The content item manager 142 may format the content item based on the type of content slot used to render the content item. For example, the content item manager 142 may reduce the size of an entry (e.g., query, response, or image) to fit in a banner-type content slot, or enlarge the size of an entry to cover a break-in type content slot. The content item manager 142 may configure the placement and appearance of content items based on other types of content slots (e.g., notification content slots, playable content slots, etc.) such that the content items appear natural to an application or web page (e.g., similar theme, color, font, text size, or seamless insertion). The content item manager 142 may customize the arrangement of items in any configuration to suit the content slots and/or applications or web pages. In some cases, the content provider 106 may provide a template or specify formatting of the content item such that the content item manager 142 may insert an entry according to the template to generate the content item. The content item manager 142 may send the content item to the user device 108, where the user device 108 may display the content item. The content item manager 142 may send the content item to a content slot provided by the content publisher 114, where the content slot with the content item may be provided to the user device 108.
The content item manager 142 may select based on the identity of the second application. For example, the content item manager 142 may retrieve an entry from a database generated using metadata of a second application (e.g., an application of the content provider 106). The content item manager 142 may select a content item having a query and corresponding response with information related to the second application. In the case of selecting responses, the content item manager 142 may select one or more responses with information not included in the metadata of the application, which may indicate incorrect responses if the user selects the responses. The content item manager 142 may include links or hyperlinks in content items retrieved from the application metadata. For example, the link or hyperlink may be referred to as an actionable object to redirect the user device 108 to an information resource for installing the second application.
The content item manager 142 may select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in the content item. The subset may refer to at least one item in the list of items to be included as a query and response. To select an entry, the content item manager 142 may identify a priority for each field from a field-value pair of metadata of the application. The priority of each field may be set by the query manager 140 or other components of the DPS112 described herein. For example, the priority of each field may be based on the number of values associated with that field (e.g., a category field may include 2-10 values, a version field may include 1 value, a name field may include 1 value, a rule field may include more than 5 values, a keyword field may include at least 10 values, etc.). The priority of each field may be based on the number of incorrect (or correct) responses previously received from the user device 108 for the content item that includes the query for that field. For example, when a field is selected for a query and response of a content item, each incorrect selection provided by at least one user may decrease the rating or priority of the field. On the other hand, when at least one user provides the correct selection of a response to a content item having a field, the rating or priority of the field may be increased for the content item manager 142 to select an item included in the content item.
In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can manage the visibility of content items. For example, the content item manager 142 may enable visibility of content items presented on the user device 108. In response to receiving the correct response from the user device 108, the content item manager 142 may disable the content item or visualize the visibility of the content slot of the content item. In some implementations, if the user device 108 sends an indication of a selection of an incorrect response, the content item manager 142 can enable visibility or provide a prompt for presentation on a display device of the user device 108. The cues may appear in a content slot in which the content item is presented. The content item manager 142 may maintain the visibility of the content items for retry by the user. In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can provide the second content item in response to receiving the at least one incorrect response (e.g., the second content item can be provided after a number of attempts). For example, the content item manager 142 may select a second item or a second subset of one or more items for inclusion in the content item (e.g., which may replace previous queries and responses). In some cases, the content item manager 142 may maintain the same query, but select one or more different responses, e.g., for a second user attempt. The content item manager 142 may rearrange or shuffle the responses, such as in response to incorrect selections of the responses.
In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can use a selection model to select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in a content item. For example, the content item manager 142 may train the selection model using interaction data (e.g., interactions with content items having queries and corresponding responses) from the user device 108 as input or a training data set. Based on the interaction data, the selection model may output the performance of each field of the field-value pairs used to generate or select the query (or response). The selection model may rate or configure the priority of each field for inclusion by the content item manager 142 in the content item. Based on the output of the selection model, the content item manager 142 may select a subset of the items based on at least one of the other information, such as performance, priority, and the items.
In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can include one or more scripts in the content item. The script may be executed on the user device 108, such as in response to the content item being presented in a content slot or displayed on the user device 108 (e.g., 1 millisecond ("ms"), 10ms, 50ms, or soon thereafter). The script may cause the user device to perform the features or functions described herein. For example, the script may cause the user device 108 to present a subset of one or more items, such as at least one query and various responses corresponding to the query, within the content slot. The script may cause the user device 108 to detect interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The selection may be initiated or provided by a user of the user device 108. The script may cause the user device 108 to provide the DPS112 with interaction data detected from the selection of one or more interactive elements within the content slot. Transmitting or providing data to DPS112 may transmit data to at least one component of DPS112 (e.g., request receiver 136, application metadata manager 138, query manager 140, content item manager 142, response collector 144, or application registration manager 146).
The content item manager 142 may include a termination icon or object in the content item. The content item manager 142 may configure the time that the object is visible to or capable of interacting with the user device 108. For example, the termination icon may appear after a predetermined period of time (such as 10 seconds, 12 seconds, 15 seconds, etc.) after the content item is presented. In some cases, the content item manager 142 may include a termination icon with other elements of the content item, such as for display with other elements of the content item (e.g., queries, images, interactive elements, etc.). The content item manager 142 may terminate or disable the visibility of the content item in response to user interaction with the termination icon.
In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can include or provide images corresponding to rewards in content items (e.g., incentives for participating in or interacting with content items). In response to the DPS112 receiving a selection of the correct response to the presentation in the content item, the reward may be presented to the user device 108. The content item manager 142 may include a script in the content item that may cause the user device 108 to detect the first interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements (e.g., responses) associated with a subset of the one or more items. The interactive elements associated with the subset of items may refer to interactive elements corresponding to queries included in the content item. In some implementations, the script can cause the user device 108 to determine that the selection indicates an incorrect response or selection of the interactive element. The script may cause the user device 108 to provide a notification to the user device 108 (e.g., a display device electrically connected to the user device 108) indicating that the selection was incorrect. In some implementations, the script can cause the user device 108 to detect the second interaction data from a selection of other one or more interactive elements associated with the subset of one or more items. The script may cause the user device 108 to determine that the selection is correct or that the selection indicates a correct interactive element. The script may cause the user device 108 to render an image corresponding to the reward in response to determining that the second interaction data corresponds to a correct response. After presenting the reward, the DPS112 may communicate with a resource 104 or a content publisher 114 that manages an application that provides a content slot for presenting content items to the user device 108. The DPS112 may indicate that the user provided the correct response to the content item. The DPS112 may retrieve or receive rewards from the resource 104 or the content issuer 114 to provide a user account concurrently with or in response to the image of the presentation rewards. The type of rewards provided to the user may vary depending on the application in which the content slots are presented or based on the configuration of the content publisher 114. In some implementations, the DPS112 may perform one or more features and functions of the user device 108 initiated by a script included in the content item, such as determining whether the interaction data indicates a successful (e.g., correct) or unsuccessful (e.g., incorrect) selection of the interactive element associated with the item.
In some implementations, the content item manager 142 can include a script in the content item that can cause the user device 108 to send instructions to the content provider 106 to provide application metadata for generating an entry included in the content item in response to determining that the correct interactive element was selected. For example, the instructions sent to the content provider 106 may include an update to a value corresponding to a performance indicator of the content item generated using metadata of the application from the content provider 106. By sending an update to the value, the content provider 106 may be notified of, for example, the capabilities of each field used to generate the content item, the conversion rate of the update, the user device 108 installing the application after the content item is presented, the user's impression of the content item based on the metadata of the content provider 106, or other information/reports that may be presented to the content provider 106.
The response collector 144 may receive input or responses from the user device 108. For example, the response collector 144 may receive an input indicating selection of an interactive element of the content item (e.g., a predetermined response that appears in the content item). The response collector 144 may receive a selection of an actionable object included in the content item (e.g., for redirecting the user device 108 to an application page or an installation page). The response collector 144 may receive an input that may correspond to a correct interactive element associated with the content item or may correspond to an incorrect interactive element associated with the content item. The response collector 144 may receive an input indicating a selection corresponding to a pixel location or position on a content item presented on the user device 108. Each interactive element may be associated with a set of pixels that appear in the content slot as part of the content item. In this case, receiving a selection of an interactive element may refer to receiving input at a pixel location corresponding to a set of pixels associated with the interactive element (e.g., a button press, a finger press or tap at a mouse pointer location, etc.). Accordingly, the response collector 144 may identify the interactive elements selected by the user device 108.
The response collector 144 may receive input from the user device 108 to terminate, turn off, or disable the visibility of the content item displayed on the user device 108. For example, the content item may include a termination button, icon, or element. The response collector 144 may receive input from the user device 108 indicating selection of a termination button. Accordingly, the DPS112 may terminate or disable the visibility of the content item in response to receiving the input. The input received by the response collector 144 may be referred to as interaction data from the user device 108.
The response collector 144 may receive interaction data (e.g., an indication of input, selection, or user engagement) from the user device 108 indicating selection of an interactive element of the various interactive elements corresponding to the entry or query. Response collector 144 may determine whether the interaction data indicates a correct response or an incorrect response to the query. Based on whether the response is correct or incorrect, the response collector 144 may update a selection model for selecting one or more items for generating subsequent content items, such as selecting items based on interaction data from the user device 108. For example, based on the interaction data, the selection model may select one or more entries in which a medium number of users select the correct response (e.g., 70%, 75%, or 80% of the correct responses). In some cases, for example, the selection model may select one or more entries based on a number of incorrect responses received from the user, such as to increase the user's understanding of the application or to determine whether to notify the content provider 106 of potentially erroneous information in the metadata used to generate the content item.
Response collector 144 may transmit responses or interaction data received from user device 108 to other components of DPS 112. For example, response collector 144 may send interaction data to query manager 140 to generate or select one or more queries based on fields with which the user is likely to interact or participate. In addition, the response collector 144 may send interaction data to the query manager 140 to determine or update the priority of each query, or to identify the performance of the fields. The response collector 144 may send interaction data for the content item manager 142 to select one or more items for inclusion in the content item based on the performance of each item, the priority of the item, and other performance metrics of past content items and user interactions. In some implementations, the response collector 144 can send the interaction data to the application registration manager 146 to determine Xiang Narong the amount charged by the provider 106, the amount delivered to the content publisher 114, and the like.
The application registration manager 146 may manage the registration or registration of the content provider 106 or the content publisher 114 with the services, features, or functions provided by the DPS112 (e.g., generating content items based on metadata from the content provider 106 or presenting content items in content slots provided by the content publisher 114). Through the registration service, the DPS112 may be authorized to access metadata of applications managed by the registered content provider 106. Further, through the registration service, the DPS112 may publish or otherwise provide the generated content items to available content slots provided by the content publisher 114. Through registration, the content publisher 114 may configure what rewards to provide after the user successfully responds to the query for the content item. The content publisher 114 may configure the type of content slots, the frequency at which content slots are provided, the time at which content slots are provided, etc.
In some implementations, the application registration manager 146 may be referred to as a rewards manager. The application registration manager 146 may provide rewards to the user. For example, the application registration manager may provide rewards to the user device 108 or the user account in response to receiving a correct response from the user device 108. To provide rewards, the application registration manager 146 may request that rewards from the content publisher 114 be presented or entered in a user account associated with the user providing the correct response (e.g., correct selection of the interactive elements in the content item). In some implementations, the DPS112 may provide a reward to the user after successive attempts by the user, such as based on a predetermined time (e.g., 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, etc.) or number of attempts (e.g., 3 attempts, 5 attempts, etc.).
For example, if the user interacts with the content item (or items of content) for a predetermined time, the DPS112 may provide rewards for attempts by the user to respond to the query, even if the response is incorrect. In another example, DPS112 may provide the reward after a number of attempts by the user to provide the correct response. In some implementations, the DPS112 may not provide any rewards unless the user provides a correct response or selects the correct interactive element associated with the entry. In some implementations, even after a predetermined time or attempt, the DPS112 may not provide a reward to the user if the user does not exhibit an effort to attempt to provide a correct response (e.g., quick clicks after providing a second content item, repeated clicks on the same interactive element, or no mouse movement). The rewards may be provided to respective applications executing on the user device 108. In some implementations, to present the reward, a script included in the content item can be executed on the user device 108 such that the user device 108 can display the reward. The script may be executed in response to any of the above conditions discussed above for providing rewards.
Thus, by generating queries and responses from metadata accessible to the DPS112 and generating content items using the metadata, the DPS112 may reduce resource consumption (e.g., reduce the amount of data stored in a database to generate content items), reduce network traffic or network congestion (e.g., the amount of data sent to and received from the content provider 106), and reduce the time consumption of the content provider 106 (e.g., the content provider 106 need not generate such queries and responses, arrange the content of content items, or update a manifest of their queries and responses).
Referring now to FIG. 3, an example table of field-value pairs of application metadata is shown, according to an embodiment. The table of field-value pairs may be used, configured, or otherwise maintained by one or more components of the system 100 (e.g., the resource 104, the content provider 106, the user device 108, the data storage device 110, the DPS112, or the content publisher 114) in conjunction with fig. 1-2 or any other computing device described herein. Table 300 may include various field-value pairs of metadata from an application. The application may be managed by a content provider (e.g., content provider 106) or a content publisher (e.g., content publisher 114). In this example, table 300 may include field-value pairs of metadata for an application from a content provider (e.g., metadata 118 for application 116). Table 300 may include various fields 302A-302N (sometimes collectively referred to as field(s) 302) and associated values 304A-304N (sometimes collectively referred to as value(s) 304).
For example, field 302 may include at least a name, category, keyword, image, description, URL, rule (or policy), application size, number of downloads, latest version update, etc. Each field 302 may include a corresponding pair of values. The value of the name field may include various characters or text (e.g., "summons to a mission") that identifies the name of the application. The values of the categories may include a list of genres or classifications of the application (e.g., action, adventure, puzzle, mystery, 3D, simulation, first person shooter game ("FPS"), multiplayer online ("MMO"), collaboration, romance, role playing ("RPG"), etc.). The values of the keyword fields may include one or more terms (e.g., "summons to a mission," "summons to an action," etc.) that one or more user devices (e.g., user device 108) may input, such as in a resource (e.g., resource 104), website, application store, or other online location, when attempting to find an application. The values of the image fields may include image data or files, such as one or more JPG, PDF, GIF, as well as other image files (e.g., profile images, background images, etc.) for downloading and rendering application images. The value of the description field may include a textual description of the application generated or provided by an administrator or developer of the application (e.g., a content provider or content publisher). The text description may include a short summary detailing the story or type of the application as it is executed. For example, the value of the URL field may include one or more links to at least one of a store page, an installation page, a web page, or other page or site associated with the application.
In further examples, the values of the rules or policy fields may include various descriptions of rules for using the application, such as how to browse the user interface of the application, user agreements and privacy policies associated with installing or using the application, rules (or controls, instructions or key bindings) for utilizing the application or controlling elements (e.g., characters or items) within the application, and other rules that direct the user to properly use the application. The value of the application size field may include a value (e.g., the size of a compressed or uncompressed file) indicating the file size or disk space consumption at the time of downloading or installing the application. The value of the number of downloads may include a value indicating the total user profile of the downloaded application, the total user purchasing and downloading the application, the total user device to which the application was downloaded or installed, and other variables that may be used to determine the number of downloads (e.g., a download that may or may not be counted as additional records from the same user profile or user device for reinstallation or re-download). The value of the latest version update field may include the current version number of the application. The content provider may update the version number in response to issuing an update to the application installation file (e.g., issuing an update file to an application page or store page for installation by a user prior to using the application).
The field-value pairs discussed herein may be updated by the content provider, such as by updating application metadata provided to store pages from which applications may be downloaded or installed. Any updates to the application metadata may be reflected in field-value pairs, at least some of which may be displayed in the application page, such as at least name, category, image, description, application size, number of downloads, or current version number of the application, etc.
As discussed herein, one or more components of the system 100 (e.g., DPS 112) may utilize field-value pairs of metadata to generate one or more queries, corresponding responses, or content items. For example, a name field-value pair (sometimes commonly referred to as a pair) may be used by the DPS to generate a query that concurrently visualizes application images in an image pair, "what is the name of this application? ". With the generated query, the DPS may generate a plurality of corresponding responses including at least interactive elements with values from the name pair (e.g., "summons for a mission") and other interactive elements with other application names (e.g., "flame application", "live mission", etc.). For example, other names of other applications may be selected based on other applications having one or more similar pairs (such as similar categories, keywords, names, developers, etc.). In some implementations, the selection of other names for other applications may be performed randomly by the DPS. In some implementations, similar techniques may be performed for selecting other interactive elements to include as part of the response, such as when other field-value pairs are used to generate a query.
In another example, the DPS may utilize a combination of name and category pairs to generate a query "referring to FIG. 4, an example illustration of an interactive content item according to an implementation is shown. 1-2 or any other computing device described herein, one or more components of system 100 (e.g., resource 104, content provider 106, user device 108, data storage device 110, DPS112, or content publisher 114) may execute, perform, or carry out the example operations presented or otherwise described in diagram 400 to generate one or more elements. Example illustration 400 may include examples of content items, such as content items 410, 420, and 430. When describing the example illustration 400, these content items (e.g., content items 410, 420, or 430) may be referred to as first content items, second content items, or third content items.
Each content item described herein may be generated or selected by a DPS (e.g., DPS 112) using application metadata provided by or retrieved from one or more content providers (e.g., content provider 106). Each content item may include a query and a plurality of corresponding responses generated by the DPS. At least one response may correspond to a value paired with a corresponding field from the field-value pair of metadata, while other responses may not correspond to values from that field. Other responses may be values that are excluded or not included from the corresponding field-value pair of the metadata. The responses may be interactive elements such that, while appearing in the content slots, a user may interact (e.g., within pixel coordinates identifying each interactive element) with the interactive elements (e.g., mouse presses, touch gestures, etc.) to select at least one response. Examples of queries and corresponding responses that may be included in one or more content items may be described herein.
In some implementations, the content item 410 can be a quiz-type content item that includes one or more questions associated with one or more correct answers (or alternative answers). For example, the content item 410 may include what category the query '"application' belongs to? ". Instead of "application", the query may include the name of the application. The DPS may retrieve the name (e.g., data from the value corresponding to the name field) from the application metadata. In this example, the DPS may use at least the category field as part of the content item 410. Since the query indicates that the user selected a category (e.g., from the category field of the metadata), the DPS may include at least one value corresponding to the category field from the metadata in the content item 410. The DPS may include other values of interactive elements or responses that are set to incorrect that are not included in the metadata. For example, if the "application" has a category puzzle and mystery, the DPS may include the puzzle or mystery as one of the responses (or interactive elements). Other interactive elements may include categories that are not puzzle or mystery, such as adventure, action, and so forth.
The content item 420 may include a query of which developer the 'application' belongs to? ". In this example, the DPS may include a value from a developer field as part of the content item 420. Because the query indicates that the user selected or identified the developer of the "application," the DPS may select or generate at least one response to the developer associated with the "application," as well as one or more other responses to the developer mentioned in the content item 420 that are not associated with the "application. The application of the content item 420 may differ from 410 based on the content provider from which the metadata is derived.
Is the content item 430 may include a query "application" a free application? ". In this example, the DPS may include a value from a price field (sometimes referred to as a purchase field or a cost field) as part of the content item 430. The value of the price field may include price data of the application, such as an amount to be paid before the characteristics of the application are downloaded, installed, or otherwise utilized. In this case, the DPS may include a "Yes" or "No" response. The total number of interactive elements may be set by the content provider or an administrator of the DPS. In some cases, the number of interactive elements may be based on the size of the content slot such that the DPS may include fewer interactive elements (e.g., 2 or 3) in a smaller content slot or more interactive elements (e.g., 4 or more) in a larger content slot.
In some implementations, the DPS may include "perhaps", "skip" or "I don't know" as one of the responsive or interactive elements that the user may select. For example, the DPS may include one or more alternative responses (or alternative elements) that may be common when considering any query provided to the user. Alternative responses may include common replies, such as "perhaps", "skipped", "uncertain", "next", etc., that may be expected from the user when any query is provided. In response to one or more of these alternative responses, the DPS may determine whether to provide any additional content items for presentation to the user, terminate the content items, provide rewards associated with the content items from the content publisher providing the content slots (e.g., different content items may provide different levels of rewards). For example, if the user selects the "perhaps" interactive element, the DPS may provide the second content item to the user. If so configured by an administrator, content provider, or content publisher, repeated selections of "perhaps" interactive elements may terminate the content slot without the user receiving any rewards. In another example, the selection of "uncertain" may be a valid response in some cases, and the DPS may provide or perform a reward for the user in response to receiving one or more interactive element selections.
Referring to fig. 5, an example illustration of a client device rendering an interactive content item within a first application is shown, according to an embodiment. 1-2 or any other computing device described herein, one or more components of system 100 (e.g., resource 104, content provider 106, user device 108, data storage device 110, DPS112, or content publisher 114) may execute, perform or carry out example operations of rendering, generating, or presenting one or more elements presented or otherwise described in diagram 500. The example illustration 500 may include a client device displaying a first instance 510, a second instance 520, or a third instance 530. Each instance may represent a state of the client device or a time at which the client device displays an application, content item, or rewards interface. For example, the first instance 510 may include a client device rendering a first application. The second instance 520 may include a client device rendering the content item. The third instance 530 may include a client device presenting a rewards interface.
In a first instance 510, a user of a client device may launch or access a first application. The first application may be presented on a display of the client device (e.g., in full screen, borderless full screen, or windowed mode). The first application may be any application, such as an application installed locally on a client device, a web browser application, a virtual desktop application, an application executing on a server, and the like. The first application may be provided by the content publisher (e.g., the data of the first application may come from a resource of the content publisher). The first application may include one or more content slots displayed at a portion of the application interface. In some cases, such as for an instantiated content slot, the content slot may be visible after a period of time from the start of the application. In some implementations, such as in the second instance 520, the content slot can display an instantiated content item, wherein a DPS that manages the content item can enable visibility of the content slot based on a configuration of resources of the first application.
In a second instance 520, the client device may render a content slot having the content item. For example, the client device may be presented with a content slot enabled based on a timer (e.g., a set time since the start of an application configured by the content publisher and other techniques for presenting content items to the user). The content slot may include a script that, when executed on the client device, may cause the client device to send a request for at least one content item to the DPS. The DPS may provide content items to a content slot that appears on the client device. In this case, the content item may include a portion 522 with a query (e.g., question) and one or more corresponding responses (e.g., a set of answers or options for the user to select from), an exit icon 524, and an actionable object 526 (e.g., a button or another interactive element) with a link or hyperlink to a second application (e.g., a web page or store page for installing the second application). In some cases, the content item may include a marker 528 that highlights or hovers over the response. The flag 528 may indicate a corresponding response to be selected if, for example, the user clicks or presses a selection button (e.g., carriage return, space, and other buttons based on the settings of the first application or content item). In some implementations, the marker 528 may not be part of the content item, but rather an indicator of a mouse icon for navigating to select an interactive element, actionable object 526, exit icon 524, or other area presented for display.
The DPS may generate the content items in the second instance 520 from metadata from an application (e.g., a second application) from the content provider. The DPS may generate a query and one or more corresponding responses based on the metadata of the application. For example, the content item may include a query of what is the genre of the' second application? ". In this case, the "second application" may be replaced with the name or title of the application from the content provider. The DPS may retrieve the name of the application from the value of the name field in the field-value pair of the metadata. In this case, the DPS generates a query using the genre field (e.g., category field) and the name field of the metadata. Since the DPS uses the genre of the application as a premise for the user selection response, the DPS may select at least one value from the genre field to include as one of the interactive elements. For other interactive elements, the DPS may include other genres (or values) not indicated in the field-value pair. For example, if the genre field of metadata from the second application includes adventure, decryption, and non-novelty, the DPS may select the action as one of the interactive elements. The DPS may select a genre (e.g., action, mystery, etc.) that is not presented in the field-value pair to include as part of the interactive element (e.g., associated with the incorrect response).
Referring to the previous example, a user may interact with the client device to place a marker 528 at one of the responses (such as the "adventure" genre). Since the "adventure" is part of the genre field of the second application (e.g., metadata of the second application), the DPS may determine that the user selection (or response) is correct. Accordingly, in response to the user selecting the correct response, the DPS may provide a reward interface for presentation in the content slot. The bonus interface may replace the content item for rendering the content slot. In some implementations, the DPS may provide a content item that includes a script for rendering in the content slot. In response to a user selection of the correct response, a script of the content item may be executed on the client device, which may cause the client device to present an image corresponding to the reward, where the reward may be provided to the user account in the first application. In some implementations, if the user selects an incorrect response, the script can cause the client device (e.g., in the content slot) to provide a notification indicating that the selection was incorrect. The content item may remain in the content slot for the user to reselect the second interactive element after the erroneous selection. In some cases, after prompting the user for incorrect selection, the DPS may replace the content item with another content item.
In some implementations, the DPS may provide a reward to the user account even if the user does not select the correct response. For example, the DPS may determine that the user is actively engaged in the content item (e.g., attempting to select a correct response for the content item, hovering a cursor over/moving over the interactive element, selecting an incorrect response, attempting to select a correct response for the second content item, etc.). After a period of time (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.), the DPS may determine to provide a reward for the user's effort. In some implementations, the rewards may be different (e.g., fewer coins or less item rarity) if the user does not select the correct response.
In a third example 530, the client device may present a rewards interface in response to the user selecting the correct response. Concurrently with or in response to displaying the reward interface, the DPS may send instructions to the first application to retrieve the reward (e.g., an item or object similar to the image) corresponding to the reward interface and provide the reward to the user account. In some implementations, the DPS may retrieve the corresponding rewards stored in the resource such that the DPS may provide the rewards to the user account in response to the user selecting the correct response or the image presented with the rewards.
Throughout the second instance 520 or the third instance 530, the DPS may maintain an exit icon 524 and an actionable object 526 for presentation in the content slot. For example, at any time the content slot is visible or enabled on the display of the client device, the user may interact with the exit icon 524 to terminate the content slot or content item. In some implementations, the DPS may insert the exit icon 524 into the content slot or content item after a period of time (such as 15 seconds after the content slot is visible on the client device). In some implementations, the DPS may insert the exit icon 524 after the user first attempts to select the interactive element. Actionable objects 526 may be included at any portion in a content slot (or content item), such as the bottom of the content item. In some cases, the DPS may include the actionable object 526 as a second content item in the same content slot such that the link to the second application is separate from the content item associated with the metadata of the second application. By rendering the actionable object 526 throughout the presentation of the content item or rewards interface, the DPS may provide the user with an opportunity to be redirected to an installation page of the second application, such as in response to interaction with the actionable object 526. For example, actionable object 526 may include a script that, when executed, may cause a client device to redirect to a page to which actionable object 526 is associated or linked.
In some implementations, the DPS may terminate the content item and/or the content slot after the duration of presentation of the reward to the user (e.g., in the event that the user selects the correct response). For example, after presenting the reward interface for 10 seconds, the DPS may terminate the reward interface and the content slot for the user to continue using the first application. In some implementations, the DPS may terminate the content item and/or the content slot in response to the user failing to select a correct response or the user selecting an incorrect response. For example, after a predetermined number of user-selected incorrect responses (e.g., 3 attempts, 5 attempts, and other times configured by the DPS), the DPS may terminate the content item and content slot after notifying the user that the selection was incorrect (e.g., 5 seconds after prompting, etc.). In some implementations, the appearance of the content item can be based on metadata of the second application. For example, the context of the content item may comprise an image of the second application or comprise a color matching the image of the second application.
Referring to FIG. 6, a flowchart of an example method for generating queries and responses based on application metadata is shown, according to an embodiment. The functions described herein with respect to method 600 may be performed or otherwise operated by one or more components of computer system 100 as shown in fig. 1, DPS112 as shown in fig. 1 and 2, and other computing systems, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, at least in conjunction with fig. 1 and 2, the functionality of method 600 may be split between one or more components of computer system 100. The method 600 may include: in step 605, the DPS receives a request for content. At step 610, the DPS may access metadata for one or more applications. At step 615, the DPS may identify various field-value pairs. At step 620, the DPS may determine whether the metadata is current. In step 625, the DPS may update the field-value pairs. At step 630, the DPS may determine one or more items associated with the one or more applications. At step 635, the DPS may select the content item. At step 640, the DPS may transmit the content item for display on the client device.
Referring in more detail to fig. 6, at step 605, the dps may receive a request for content from a client device. In some cases, the DPS may receive a request when a client device initiates an application of a content publisher. In some cases, the DPS may receive the request while the application presents the content slot, which may cause the client device to send a request for content to the DPS. The content slots of the application may be presented during startup or after a period of time configured by the content publisher. For example, the content publisher may set a timer for providing certain types of content slots (e.g., banners, breaks, etc.). After receiving the request for content, the DPS may proceed to step 610.
At step 610, the DPS may access metadata of one or more applications available for installation. By accessing such metadata, the DPS may provide at least one content item for presentation in the content slot, which may motivate a user of the client device to install an application (e.g., a query, response, or actionable object associated with the application) associated with the content item. The metadata for each of the one or more applications may include a plurality of field-value pairs including values received from devices corresponding to publishers of the application (e.g., content publishers). For example, the content publisher may include one or more values in at least one field for publishing content items including queries and responses based on field-value pairs in the content slots. In this case, for example, the content publisher may facilitate at least providing or configuring interactive elements or queries for content items.
In some cases, an application of a publisher (e.g., a content publisher that provides a content slot for rendering a content item) may be referred to as a first application. For example, a client device may launch a first application and request content items for a content slot in the first application. In some implementations, the request for content from the client device can include at least an identification of a second application (e.g., an application of the content provider). The request for content may include an identification of a content slot in which the content item is presented. For example, the DPS may receive a request for content from a client device. From the request, the DPS may identify from which application (or metadata of the application) an entry is generated, including an entry in a content item, or from which application (or metadata of the application) a content item is selected having a query or response associated with metadata of the application. After accessing the metadata of the application, the DPS may proceed to step 615.
At step 615, the DPS may identify various field-value pairs. The field-value pairs may be stored as part of the metadata for each application. The field-value pairs may be retrieved directly from the content provider providing the metadata or from a data storage device remote from the content provider. The field-value pairs including the field names and the values associated with each field may be presented in an information resource associated with the content provider, such as a web page of the application, an installation page, or a store page of the application. Using the field-value pairs, the DPS may generate one or more entries. Each entry may include a query and a corresponding response to the query. The entries may be stored in a database. In some implementations, an entry for content can be temporarily stored in a database in response to receiving a request for the content and generating the entry for the content. In this case, the entry may be removed or deleted after the entry is used to generate one or more content items or the one or more content items are presented on the client device (e.g., after the content items are terminated for display on the client device).
The content provider may update the field-value pairs. For example, the content provider may edit a store page or web page associated with the application. The content, data or information in at least one page may be metadata of the application. By updating the page, the content provider can update the metadata of the application. The DPS may retrieve the most recent metadata for generating the content item, wherein the outdated content item may not be stored for subsequent requests for content. In this case, the DPS may proceed to 620 to determine the status of the metadata, for example, when the metadata is not reflected in one of the data storage device or the resource after the updated metadata is provided by the content provider. In some implementations, if the DPS retrieves metadata from a storage device associated with the content provider, where the metadata is current and the DPS does not check, the DPS may proceed to step 630.
At step 620, the DPS may determine whether the metadata is current. For example, metadata for one or more applications may be stored in a data storage device that is remote from the device of the content provider. The DPS or other processing system may utilize metadata from the data storage device rather than directly communicating with the content provider device. Thus, the DPS may determine whether the metadata is current or not to retrieve the latest information. The DPS may determine whether the content provider updated metadata that was not reflected in the metadata stored in the data storage device. For example, if the DPS relies on metadata from a data storage device, the DPS may determine if the metadata is outdated (e.g., last updated 30 hours ago, 1 week ago, etc.), and synchronize the metadata based on the newly updated metadata. In some implementations, the DPS may retrieve the metadata of the installation page of the application from the content provider directly from the content provider, with the latest time-new metadata. In these embodiments, the DPS may skip checking whether the metadata is current and proceed to step 630. However, in the case where there is a device using metadata from the data storage device, if the metadata is not new, the DPS may proceed to step 625.
In step 625, the DPS may update the field-value pairs. For example, the DPS or other processing system may rely on metadata from a data storage device that is remote from the content provider (e.g., content provider device). The DPS may communicate with the content provider to synchronize metadata from the content provider to metadata stored in the data storage device. When updating metadata, field-value pairs of metadata may be updated for generating queries, corresponding responses, and/or content items. After updating the metadata, the DPS may proceed to step 630.
At step 630, the DPS may determine one or more items associated with the one or more applications. The DPS may determine one or more items from metadata of one or more applications. The one or more entries may include one or more queries and corresponding one or more responses. In some cases, determining one or more items may refer to the DPS generating one or more items from metadata in response to a request for content, at a predetermined time period (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, etc.), or in response to an update to the metadata. In some implementations, if an entry is stored in the data storage device, the DPS may refresh, update, or otherwise replace the currently stored entry with an updated entry based on metadata of one or more applications. By determining the items, the DPS may identify at least one item to include in the content item. In some implementations, determining an entry can refer to determining a context of a content item. For example, the entry may be included as part of the content item. The DPS may determine an entry for a content item for use in selecting which content item to present on a client device. After determining the entry, the DPS may proceed to step 635.
At step 635, the DPS may select a content item that includes a subset of one or more items and an actionable object. The subset of entries may include at least one entry containing a query and a corresponding response. Responses may vary in number, such as based on the query (e.g., field(s) used to generate the query), the size of the content slot, or preferences of the content provider or content publisher (e.g., configurable by the content provider or adjustable by the content publisher that published the content item). When the client device selects an actionable object, the actionable object (or a script included in the actionable object) may cause the client device to access information resources from which applications of the one or more applications may be installed. For example, the actionable object may include hyperlinks associated with applications of the content provider (such as an installation page, store page, or web page of the content provider or application). When selected, the client device may be redirected to the corresponding information resource.
In some implementations, the DPS can select the content item based on an identification of the second application. For example, the DPS may receive a request for content having an identification of a second application (e.g., an application of a content provider). Based on what applications are identified, the DPS may select content items generated from metadata of the respective applications identified by the identification of the second application. In some implementations, the DPS can select a content item based on the type of content slot used to display the content item. For example, content slots may differ in size, shape, location, or time at which the content slots appear on the client device. Based on the content slots, the DPS may determine which content item to select, such as how many responses should be included, the context of the content item (e.g., to match the context of the first application at the time, which may vary based on events in the first application), the type of content item to be relevant to the user, and other criteria for selecting the content item.
In some implementations, instead of selecting a content item, the DPS may select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in the content item (e.g., thereby generating the content item). The DPS may select each entry of the subset by identifying the priority of each field from the field-value pair of the metadata of the application. For example, based on the priority of each field, the DPS may select the highest priority entry or at least one highest entry in the priority list. By selecting at least one of these items, the DPS may generate a content item. The priority may be assigned based at least on a number of values associated with the field or a number of incorrect responses previously received from the client device for content items comprising a query for the field. For example, for a greater number of values associated with a field, the DPS may generate more responses for each query based on the field (e.g., category field, description field, rule field, keyword field, etc.). For a smaller number of values associated with a field, the DPS may not be able to generate many responses for inclusion in the content item (e.g., version field, number of downloads field, application size field, etc.). However, this may not be the case, and even if the number of values is small, for example, if the category field has only one value, the DPS may still order the field to have a high priority since it may include other responses as part of the interactive element, or in the case where it may generate a response that can be noted by the user.
In another example, the DPS may adjust the priority of the fields based on the number of incorrect responses. The number of any responses may refer to a ratio, a count of times, or other indicator for monitoring the selection made by the user. If a certain field for a content item entry receives a large number of incorrect responses (e.g., 8/10 of the responses received over a span of a day or week or more than 1000 incorrect responses), the DPS may assign a low priority to that field, such as when other entries or content items are generated or selected. In some implementations, the DPS may adjust the priority of the fields based on the number of correct responses. For example, the DPS may determine that the user rate of selecting the correct response exceeds 95% for a content item using a field(s) for the item, as well as other thresholds that may be configured by the DPS or the content provider. For example, instead of setting a high priority for the fields with the highest correct response rate, the DPS may assign a medium priority to these fields so that the content item incentives for the understanding of the second application, rather than providing a free reward. In some cases, the DPS may automatically decrease the priority of certain fields with the highest number of correct responses so that other fields may be used for the content item. In some cases, the DPS may not select one of the highest priority items, but may select a lower priority item. For example, to test whether the priority of a field or entry should be moved up, the DPS may use a lower priority field to generate or select a content item. The DPS may perform this selection, for example, once a week, once a month, and once in other time ranges. In some cases, the DPS may not enable this functionality so that the DPS may select a content item having fields within a particular priority range (e.g., the first 10 or 20 fields).
By generating queries and responses from metadata accessible to the DPS and generating content items using the metadata, the DPS may reduce resource consumption (e.g., reduce the amount of data stored in a database to generate content items), reduce network traffic or network congestion (e.g., the amount of data sent to and received from content providers), and reduce the time consumption of the content providers (e.g., the content providers need not generate such queries and responses, arrange the content of the content items, or update their inventory of queries and responses).
At step 640, the DPS may transmit the content item to the client device for display on the client device. For example, the DPS may transmit data for a content item having at least a query, response, and actionable object to the content slot. The content slot may render the content item for display on the client device. The DPS may receive input from the client device selecting at least one interactive element (e.g., a corresponding response) in the content item. The DPS may determine that the input corresponds to a correct response associated with the content item. In some cases, the DPS may terminate the content item on the client device after an input corresponding to the correct response. In some other cases, the DPS may disable the visibility of the content item displayed on the client device.
In some implementations, the DPS may use a selection model to select a subset of one or more items for inclusion in the content item. The selection model may be trained using historical interaction data from the client device with content items previously generated and presented to the client device. Using the selection model, the DPS may determine which subset of one or more items are of interest to the respective user and potentially result in user interaction (e.g., motivating or increasing user engagement). For example, the DPS may receive interaction data with a content item presented on a client device. The interaction data may identify a response selected at the client device to indicate whether the response corresponds to a correct response or an incorrect response associated with the content item. The DPS may update a selection model for selecting items for various client devices based on interaction data from the client devices. For example, if the DPS receives interaction data from a client device indicating an incorrect response, and in some cases, interaction data from other client devices tend (e.g., 8/10) to indicate an incorrect response, the DPS may not select an entry in the event that the client device tends to select an incorrect response. In some implementations, the DPS may determine from the interaction data that the client device selected the same potentially incorrect response. In this case, the DPS may inform the content provider of the accuracy of the validation metadata. Accordingly, the DPS may maintain or increase the accuracy of metadata for the content provider's applications.
In some implementations, the content items can include scripts. The script may be executed on the client device in response to at least one event occurring on the client device or in response to a content item, such as enabling a content slot on the client device for rendering the content item, entering the content item in the content slot, or interacting with the content item. The script may cause the client device to perform one or more features and functions described herein. For example, the script may cause the client device to present a subset of one or more items within the content slot (e.g., present queries and responses within the content slot, or present at least one content item having one or more items). The client device may detect interaction data from a user selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of one or more items. The interactive element may be or include one or more responses corresponding to the entry. The client device may provide the DPS with interaction data detected from the selection of one or more interactive elements within the content slot. The interaction data may indicate whether the selected interactive element is a correct response or an incorrect response.
In some implementations, the content items can include images and scripts corresponding to rewards. The image may refer to a reward interface that displays rewards in response to a user selecting a correct response. For example, the client device may present a subset of one or more entries (e.g., at least one query and corresponding response) within the content slot. The client device may detect the first interaction data from a selection of one or more interactive elements associated with a subset of the one or more items. The client device may determine that the selection indicates an incorrect response. Accordingly, the client device may provide a notification to a display device of the client device indicating that the selection is incorrect. In some cases, the client device may terminate or disable the visibility of the content item after informing the user that the selection was incorrect. In this case, no rewards may be provided to the user or user account. In some implementations, the client device can detect the second interaction data from a selection of other one or more interactive elements associated with the subset of one or more items. The client device may determine that the selection indicates a correct response. Accordingly, the client device may present an image corresponding to the reward to a display device of the client device in response to determining that the second interaction data corresponds to the correct response. The first interaction data and the second interaction data may comprise indications of interactions or selections of at least one interactive element within the content item. In this case, when presenting the reward to the client device, or also in response to determining that the second interaction data corresponds to a correct response, the DPS may notify the content issuer (e.g., the content issuer's device) to provide the reward to the user account that provided the correct response. The rewards may be the same as those shown in the image.
In some implementations, the DPS may determine that the interaction time exceeds a threshold after presentation of the content item on the client device. For example, the DPS may monitor activity or interaction data of the client device. The DPS may determine that the user of the client device is actively attempting to provide a correct response (e.g., move a cursor within a content item, the user reads an indication of a query and response, a selection of an incorrect response after consideration, etc.). For a user's effort, the DPS may trigger a script of the content item to cause the client device to present a reward corresponding to the content item in response to the interaction time exceeding a threshold. For example, the interaction time may be predetermined or based on a counter activated during movement of a cursor or other activity performed by the user. The predetermined time or when the counter reaches the time limit may be configured by the content publisher, the content provider, or the DPS (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.). In some implementations, the DPS may not provide rewards to the user (e.g., a client device or user account within the first application) without receiving interaction data indicating a selection of a correct response.
In some implementations, by executing the script and the client device determining that the user selected the correct response, the client device may send an instruction to an entity associated with the content provider to update a value corresponding to the content provider in response to determining that the correct response was selected. The value may correspond to a performance indicator of the content item, such as a subset of one or more entries and actionable objects associated with the application. For example, the DPS may transmit an instruction to increase the ratio of performance metrics that indicates the likelihood that the client device will select the correct response for the field-value pair used to generate the content item. The performance indicator may indicate the performance of each field-value pair when used to generate the content item.
In some implementations, if the interaction data indicates a selection of an incorrect response, the DPS may decrease the performance index associated with the item with which the user interacted. In some cases, the performance index may indicate a conversion rate of the user interacting with at least one responsive or actionable object to download the application. In other words, the performance indicator may indicate the user's engagement performance such that receiving a selection of a responsive or actionable object may increase the performance indicator. Otherwise, if the client device receives interaction data indicating a selection of the exit icon, the performance indicator may decrease to indicate that the user is not engaged in or does not want to interact with the content item. The performance metrics may be updated for or to the content provider to determine the performance of the content item activity registered by the content provider. In some cases, the DPS may perform prioritization or selection of items or content items based on performance metrics. For example, the DPS may prioritize content items or items with higher performance metrics (e.g., with which a user may interact) for display on a client device.
In some implementations, after constructing and updating the performance index for a period of time (e.g., 10 days, 20 days, etc.), the DPS may determine to use an entry in the performance index range (e.g., the first 30% of entries) for rendering the content item. Thus, some field-value pairs may not be used to generate or select a content item after a period of time. In some implementations, the DPS may reset the performance index after a period of time (such as 1 month, 2 months, or quarterly). Thus, entries (e.g., fields) with low value performance metrics may be used at a later time. For example, in some cases, the performance of these fields may be better after resetting the performance metrics.
