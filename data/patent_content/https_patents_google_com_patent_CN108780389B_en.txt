Abstract
Embodiments generally relate to retrieving an image from a device for consumption by a receiving device. In some implementations, the computing device can receive an update to the set of images from the communication device, including at least one image that was not previously received in a previous version of the set. The computing device may store updates for the set in long-term memory and copy at least one image from the updated images to non-persistent memory. Images in non-persistent memory may not exceed a maximum threshold. In response to a change in the computing device from inactive to active, the computing device may display an image from the non-persistent memory as a background image on the computing device. Further responsive to a minimum threshold for the number of images in the non-persistent memory, the computing device may copy at least one image of the new image to the non-persistent memory.
Description
Background
It is very likely that a large number of digital images consumed by a computing device are accessed. The widespread availability of computer devices to communicate with each other expands the accessibility of images. The image may be consumed by being viewed, transferred, projected, displayed, and the like. For example, the image may be used as a background image in a computer display screen. Such utilization of images can place a heavy burden on computer devices with low processing power, such as wearable devices for smartwatches. To cope with the processing and storage burden, devices with limited internal resources may offload some of the computational and substantial storage requirements to more powerful computing devices.
Disclosure of Invention
Embodiments generally relate to retrieving an image from a device for consumption by another device. In some implementations, a method may be performed by a computing device, such as a wearable device, to receive an update of a set of images from a communication device. The update of the set may include more than one new image that was not included in the previous version of the set stored by the computing device. The method may also store, using the computing device, the update of the image collection in a long term memory of the computing device. At least one image from the set's update may be copied to non-persistent memory as a usable image. In some embodiments, the available images in non-persistent memory do not exceed a maximum threshold. In response to a change of the computing device from the inactive use state to the active use state, the computing device may display at least one of the available images as a background image on the computing device. Further in response to the available images in the non-persistent memory reaching a minimum threshold, the computing device may copy at least one of the one or more new images to the non-persistent memory. In some embodiments, the minimum threshold is lower than the value of the maximum threshold.
In some aspects, the update of the set may be received at least partially in response to a charging mode of the communication device. In some implementations, the update can be received at least partially in response to an event in a user's calendar, or in response to a piece of music being played on the computing device.
The method may include determining a change to an image repository of the communication device prior to receiving the update to the collection. In some implementations, the update to the set of images can include a previous image included in a previous version of the set stored by the computing device. Updates to the image collection may be stored to replace previous versions of the collection.
In some aspects, the method includes editing the background image based on the shape and size of the display screen. In some implementations of image editing, a template form for the shape and size of the display screen may be determined, a content form may be determined in the template form, and a background image may be positioned on the display screen based on the content form. The method may include a template form configured to fit a maximum size and shape of a shape and size of a display screen.
In some aspects of the computer-implemented method, the previous version of the collection may be from a previous request for the image, where the previous request was a user search query. In some implementations, the collection may be an album and the previous version of the album may be from a previous request for the image, where the previous request was a user selection of the album.
In still other embodiments, a system may be provided and may include one or more processors, long-term and non-persistent memory of a wearable device and one or more computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause performance of operations that may include receiving an update of an image set from a communication device and storing the update of the set in the long-term memory of the wearable device. The operations may include copying at least one image from the updated images of the set to the non-persistent memory as a usable image. In response to a change in the computing device from an inactive use state to an active use state, the operations may include displaying at least one of the available images as a background image on the wearable device. In response to a minimum threshold for the number of images in the non-persistent memory, the operations may include copying at least one of the new images to the non-persistent memory. In some embodiments, the available images in non-persistent memory may not exceed a maximum threshold. The update to the set may include more than one new image that was not included in the previous version of the set stored by the wearable device.
In some aspects of the system, the operation of receiving an update of the set may be responsive, at least in part, to a charging mode of the communication device. In some implementations, the operations may include determining a change in an image repository of the communication device prior to receiving the update of the collection.
In some aspects, the operations may include editing the background image based on the shape and size of the display screen. Editing may include determining a template form for the shape and size of the display screen, determining a content form within the template form, and positioning a background image on the display screen based on the content form. In some embodiments, the template form may be the largest size and shape that fits the shape and size of the display screen.
In still other aspects, a computer-implemented method may be performed by a communication device, such as a mobile device, and may include detecting a charging mode of the communication device, determining one or more new images to update a set of images, wherein the one or more new images are not included in a previous version of the set provided to a computing device, such as a wearable device. The method performed by the communication device may further include editing the new image according to appearance characteristics of a display screen of the computing device and storing the update of the set of images in the repository. Based on the charging mode of the communication device, the method may include transmitting an update of the set of images to the computing device.
In some aspects, a method by a communication device may include determining a charging mode of a computing device and providing an update of a set of images in response to the charging mode of the computing device. In some implementations, a method by a computing device may include detecting a minimum power state of a communication device. The charging mode may be detected in response to a minimum power state.
In some aspects, the appearance characteristics of a display screen of a computing device may include the shape and size of the display screen. Editing may include determining a template form for the shape and size of a display screen of the computing device, determining a primary content form within the template form, and editing the image based on the primary content form. In some implementations, editing can also include determining one or more separation gaps inside one or more edges of the template form, and sizing the primary content form to not overlap the one or more separation gaps. In some examples, the template form may be a maximum size and shape configured to fit the shape and size of the display screen of the computing device.
In yet other embodiments, tangible, non-transitory, recordable computer-readable storage devices, such as media, are discussed to store instructions that cause performance of operations. A non-transitory computer-readable medium may store instructions that receive updates to a set of images from a communication device for storage on a computing device, such as a wearable device. The update of the set may include more than one new image that was not included in the previous version of the set stored by the computing device. The instructions may also provide for storing updates to the set of images in long-term memory of the computing device and copying at least one image from the updates of the set to non-persistent memory as execution of the available images on the computing device. In some embodiments, the available images in non-persistent memory do not exceed a maximum threshold. In response to a change of the computing device from the inactive use state to the active use state, the computing device may display at least one of the available images as a background image on the computing device. Further in response to a minimum threshold for the number of images in the non-persistent memory, the computing device may copy at least one image in the new image to the non-persistent memory in the computing device.

Detailed Description
In various embodiments, an image retrieval system provides a computing device with a tool to automatically receive images from a communication device. For example, a wearable device, such as a smart watch, headset, health wearable device, etc., may communicate with a communication device, such as a mobile computing device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, personal computer, server, etc., to process and obtain image content. In some implementations, the computing device may be a wearable or non-wearable device, where network communication, processing power, and/or storage resources may be poor (e.g., slow or unreliable) and/or expensive.
In some implementations, a user may request and receive more than one image. For example, a user may request an image by entering a search query, by requesting an image album, and/or by picking up more than one particular image. The repository in the long-term memory of the computing device may be synchronized with the repository of the communication device, which contains images captured in response to a user request. The communication device may, for example, periodically receive more than one update to the repository. When such updates are received, in some embodiments, the communication device may provide such updates to its repository for automatic synchronization with the repository in the memory of the computing device. The communication device may process the image, e.g., edit, before providing the image to the computing device to prepare the image for consumption.
Automatic synchronization can occur without requiring the user to specifically make a new request for any updated image. In some embodiments, the automatic synchronization of the updated images may occur in response to a triggering event, at regular intervals, or at other times.
In some implementations, more than one image can be pushed from the communication device to the computing device. In still further embodiments, the image may be pulled from the communication device in response to a specialized request from the computing device. In some implementations, the image transfer can occur while the communication device and/or computing device is charging or otherwise supplementing their power.
Examples of updating the set of images during charging are possible to dynamically provide new images to the computing device without burdening the power supply of the communication device and/or the computing device. Thus, it is possible to reduce the number of times the bluetooth channel is opened for data transmission, for example. In this example, the bluetooth channel may only need to be turned on while charging is taking place, for example, at night. The computing device may provide the user with new images during non-charging hours, such as during the day, without the computing device needing to communicate with the communication device, wherein the user does not alter initiating new requests or modifying previous requests, such as new search queries or different album requests.
Images received by a computing device may be stored in long-term memory of the computing device, and multiple images may be kept in a queue and prepared for their use. When the computing device enters an active state, more than one image from the queue may be consumed. For example, the image may be automatically popped up or otherwise retrieved from the queue and displayed. The user may not need to specifically request the next image to be displayed. For example, the image may be displayed as a new background image behind the control unit and other data on the display screen of the computing device. Such automatic image updates may require less communication with retrieving an updated set of images and may help conserve power usage for either or both of the computing device and the communication device.
In some implementations, a predetermined number of retrieved images can be held in a queue for consumption by the computing device. For images, the computing device may obtain various types of consumption. For example, the images may be displayed (e.g., displayed on a display screen), projected (e.g., rendered onto a physical space), shared (e.g., by emailing, instant messaging, text messaging, videoconferencing, or posting to a website), edited (e.g., edited by a user directly from a display screen), or printed (e.g., sent to a printer device). When images are retrieved from non-persistent memory of a computing device and rendered, a certain number of the retrieved images may be replaced with images from long-term memory of the computing device. In this manner, a predetermined number of images, e.g., a minimum threshold, may be prepared for a potentially reduced waiting period.
The image retrieval system may further adapt the image to various display screens on different computing devices. Some such editing processes may include geometric editing of the image based on determined appearance characteristics of a given display screen, such as the shape, size, surface texture and flatness and/or sphericity of the display screen. Template forms such as squares, rectangles, and squares may be customized for the display screen. In some embodiments, the size of the template form may be set to the maximum specification that fits within the display screen, for example, the maximum square form. The content form may be shaped and sized to fit within the template form and provide a platform for the image. The image may be adapted to fit at least substantially within the content form.
In some implementations, the image may be displayed as a background image on a display screen, e.g., on the front of a smart watch. In some examples, the background image may include images displayed behind other data, icons, and control units. The background image may also be a screen saver, for example, such an image being displayed when the user is not using the device for a particular period of time. The background image may also be part of a lock screen, part of a main screen, etc.
In some implementations, a new image may be automatically displayed when a computing device, e.g., a wearable device, transitions from an inactive usage state (e.g., a timeout, idle, or dim light mode) to an active state (e.g., a mode in which the computing device is able to interact with a user, such as the user manipulating or viewing a display screen or application software on the computing device, or some time after such interaction). For example, the inactive usage pattern may occur by a triggering event or automatically at a pre-specified time, upon request by the user.
For the display of the new background image, no special user instruction for the new background image may be required. From the user's perspective, the appearance of the updated image may appear seamless without the need to launch an application to retrieve the new image. For example, in some examples, it may be advantageous for a computing device, such as a smart watch, to be able to refresh a new image without requiring the computing device user to manually browse through potentially countless images and select images.
For example, if a smart watch user has recently taken pictures during a family vacation to hawaii, the vacation user may enjoy watching vacation pictures on her smart watch while she continues her daily activities. At some point during her trip, the vacation user in this example has requested her smart watch to retrieve an album named "vacation". Upon an initial request for images in the album, the smartwatch may retrieve only a small number of photos from the user's smartphone that meet the user request criteria, and quickly display the initial results. From the user's perspective, the results of her search query appear instantaneously on the front of her smart watch. In the background, the smart watch may continue to collect photos that meet the search criteria and store these remaining photos in long-term memory, e.g., hard disk, solid state disk, etc. When the user finishes viewing the initial photograph, a number of remaining photographs may be placed in a queue for continued viewing by the user. The image she viewed on her smart watch appears seamless.
After the vacation user returns, she charges her device in preparation for the next few days of work. During charging of her smart watch, her mobile phone has pushed a collection with new photos of her journey to her smart watch. The updated set may include the most recent photos that she has not previously viewed on her smart watch.
Periodically during the user's work day, her smart watch switches to an idle mode showing a minimal user interface display, e.g., a black background with white text and graphics. When she scans her smart watch, the smart watch flips from an inactive state to an active state. The smart watch front automatically displays a new background image from her most recent vacation without the user requesting an update to the photograph. Throughout the day, as the smart watch switches from inactive to active state, a random play of a new image appears that she vacates, prompting her colleagues and friends to ask her journey. Throughout the vacation user's day, she reflects the time of her journey.
Images displayed on computing devices, such as wearable devices, may enhance aesthetics, elicit emotional reactions, contribute to sports, health, and medical outcomes, provide information such as environmental conditions, and so forth. The images may include still images (e.g., photographs, graphics, drawings, etc.), animated images, moving video, and the like. In some cases, the image may be an image of the user's person, for example, an image that makes a story in progress in the user's life visible and serves as a visual footprint marking where the user has arrived. Examples of some personal images include a photograph taken by a user, a photograph of a user taken by another person, a self-portrait of a user, a photograph taken by another person that is familiar with or close to the user's subject, and so forth. In some implementations, the image may also include posts from social media. For example, the user may receive updated images published by other people, such as friends, family members, or organizations.
In still other embodiments, the image may be non-personal in nature, including visual representations of data such as sensor information, depictions for interactive purposes, picture notifications, and the like. Other examples of individuals and non-individuals are also possible.
FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which some embodiments of an image retrieval system 100 are implemented to enable a user to receive images on a computing device 102. The image retrieval system 100 includes a computing device 102 and a communication device 120, which may be connected to each other (as shown by the dashed lines) over a network 112 to implement retrieval of images. Although one communication device 120 is shown, the image retrieval system 100 may include more than one communication device 120.
Although a mobile phone is shown in fig. 1 as an example of the communication device 120, other types of communication devices may additionally or alternatively be used. The communication device 120 according to various embodiments may be any computing device, such as a mobile computing device, capable of communicating images to the computing device 102 and determining and processing input, with or without an image capture unit. For example, a server, such as a server in a cloud storage implementation, a notebook computer, a laptop computer, a netbook, a tablet computer, a media device, a desktop computer, a gaming console, etc., are suitable communication devices capable of transmitting images to the computing device 102.
In the example shown in fig. 1, the communication device 120 includes a display screen 110 and an image capturing unit (not shown). The display screen 110 may be a TFT (thin film transistor) liquid crystal display, an OLED (organic light emitting diode) display, or other suitable display technology. The communication device 120 may display an exemplary image 106 on the display screen 110, the exemplary image 106 being captured by an image capture unit of the communication device 120. In this example, the image 106 depicts a family good scene 130. The image 106 may be modified by the communication device 120 and stored in a collection of more than one image to be provided to the computing device.
In some implementations, the image 106 may be captured, edited, or otherwise created by other image capture devices. The image 106 may be received from another image capture device or from other image collection sources via the communication device 120. For example, a communication device 120, such as a mobile computing device, e.g., a mobile phone, may extract image results from an image collection source, such as a server. In some implementations, images created by a third party can be streamed to the communication device. The capture of the image by the communication device 120 may be upon user request, such as subscribing to an image from a third party source, or the image may be captured by the communication device 120 without user request.
The communication device 120 may prepare the image 106 for transfer to the computing device 102, e.g., modified and stored as a collection member. An image 106, such as a newly captured picture of a family blessing, may be stored as a new image via the communication device to update the previous set of images. For example, the computing device may have made an initial request for an album named "family". The image 106 may be identified as a new photograph of a family album. For example, the communication device 120 may evaluate the image 106 after the user agrees and determine that the new picture contains family members. In some embodiments, with specific consent of the user, to determine the images for the collection, the communication device may analyze the visual content of the images, determine metadata for the images, and so forth, such as by image recognition analysis. The image 106 may also be recognized by a user or otherwise as belonging to a collection. The revised collection with family album images 106 may be ready to be provided to the computing device 102 as a previously requested update to the family album collection.
In some implementations, the computing device 102 can synchronize or otherwise receive an image, such as an updated image, with the communication device 120 when the communication device is in the charging mode to supplement power for the communication device. In some implementations, when the communication device 120 is in the charging mode, the communication device 120 can look for new images to update the set of images. In some implementations, a minimum power state of the communication device and/or computing device, such as 50% of the power remaining in the battery, 80% of the power remaining in the battery, 2 hours remaining in the battery, etc., may trigger the image retrieval system 100 to delay transferring images to the computing device 102, delay image capture by the communication device, and/or delay image processing by the communication device until a charging mode is entered. For example, detecting 50% or less power to the device may require the device to wait until a charging mode does not perform more than one step in the image transfer. Once the communication device and/or computing device is in the charging state, the delaying operation may proceed according to the processes described herein.
Power sources such as chargers, computers, vehicles, and the like may be connected to the communication device 120 and begin a charging mode for the communication device 120. For example, communication with a power source may be attached to a port of the communication device 120 via a power cord 124, such as a USB cable. Various power sources may be employed, with or without the power cord 124. In some embodiments, the charging may occur via a wireless connection to a power source, which may emit current. Other embodiments of converting or inducing power may charge the communication device, such as mobile inductive charging.
In still other implementations, the communication device 120 may monitor its power level and/or receive an indication of the power level of the computing device 102. The image set may be periodically updated and provided based on the power level. For example, when the power level of the communication device is at or above a threshold power level, e.g., 50% of the battery remaining, 80% of the battery remaining, 2 hours of the battery remaining, the battery fully charged, the communication device 120 may update the image set and may push the image update set to the computing device 102. Below this power level, the communication device 120 may update the set less frequently or wait until the communication device 120 is in a charging mode to update and push the image set.
The communication device 120 can determine more than one change to the set of images and automatically push the updated set to the computing device 102. In still other embodiments, the computing device 102 may receive updates to the set at predetermined times, e.g., nighttime, in response to a triggering event, such as a notification that the communication device is in a charging mode or a notification that the set of images has been updated, or in response to a request by a user, on demand.
In some implementations, an application running on the computing device 102 can initiate a request for an image and provide criteria for a collection of images. In some implementations, the images can be selected in an intelligent manner. For example, a music application may request images on a computing device that are related to, or otherwise available for, a particular piece of music being played. For example, an update to a music library may trigger a request and/or selection of an image to correspond to the updated music library. In other examples, the image may be requested based on the context of the user's planned calendar. With the user's consent, the computing device and/or communication device may access the user's calendar and determine that a particular event is about to occur. For example, if a calendar represents a user planning to participate in an athletic event, images related to the sport may be pushed to the computing device before, during, or after the event.
In some implementations, the images can be provided to the computing device 102 in an interleaved manner, e.g., in response to a user request for the images. The first portion of the image collection may be sent immediately through the communication device 120 after the communication device receives the initial request from the computing device 102. The first portion may include a particular number of available images that the user may begin using. For example, the first portion may include three images that may be displayed for viewing by a user. In some implementations, the first portion of the set of images can be placed into a queue of the computing device 102 for quick consumption by the user. When the user consumes the first portion of the collection of images, the communication device 120 may continue to collect any other images to be added to the collection and push the second portion of the collection to the computing device 102. The second partial image may be received in the background of computing device 102 as it is collected and pushed from communication device 120. When the user is finished viewing the first portion of the collection, the second portion of the image may be ready for consumption by the computing device.
In some implementations, the second portion represents the remainder of the image collection. In still other embodiments, the second portion includes less than all of the remainder of the image set. In these cases, the communication device may continue to collect images for the collection and send a portion of the collection to the computing device 102. The staggered transfer of images may be repeated for any number of portions, e.g., third portion, fourth portion of the image collection.
Such transfer of interleaved portions of an image may cause a small amount of data to be provided to a computing device after the data is ready for transfer. As the communication device extracts more data, the computing device may quickly render portions of the image. In this manner, a user may experience a quick response time to request an image for acquisition, for example, to respond to a search query or to request an album.
The computing device 102 may collect a collection of images across more than one network 112. Communications across more than one network 112 may include privacy and security measures, such as encryption and password protection. The network 112 may include more than one WAN (wide area network) and/or LAN (local area network), which may be wired and/or wireless. In some examples, network 112 may include more than one cellular network and/or the internet, among other networks. In some examples, such as BluetoothTMA local network of networks is employed for communication between the computing device 102 and the communication device 120. In some implementations, the computing device 102 and the communication device 120 can be coupled to each other using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. In still other implementations, the computing device 102 and the communication device 120 may be physically coupled to exchange information. Although the network 112 is shown as a single network, it should be understood that the network 112 may include a plurality of different networks that are themselves communicatively connected. The network 112 may take other forms as well.
Although fig. 1 represents a smart watch as a type of computing device 102, other non-wearable computing devices or other types of wearable apparatuses that may receive updated images for consumption from a communication device may also be used. Wearable devices are worn in contact with or near the body of a user. For example, the computing device 102 may be a wearable device that functions as a clip, a band, a watch, jewelry, goggles, an eye, a contact lens, apparel, an accessory, an appendage to a wearable item, and so forth. For example, a user may view an image on a display of a smart watch or smart wristband, a Head Mounted Device (HMD), a finger ring, or the like.
Some wearable computing devices include or are essentially used as health or exercise equipment. For example, the wearable device may be configured to monitor physiological states, provide health information, and manage healthcare. Such a health wearable may comprise at least one sensor measuring a bio-signal or an environmental component.
In some implementations, the computing device is an augmented reality device that overlays an image onto the environment. For example, the computing device may be a wearable device with a camera and projector to project more than one image and detect user interaction with the projected image. For example, where image recognition software is employed, such augmented reality devices may include input of security permissions for their use.
However, it should be understood that other types of computing devices may be configured to provide similar image retrieval functionality, and/or may include similar components as those described with respect to wearable devices and smart watches.
The display screen 104 on the computing device 102 may be used to display various user interfaces. The display screen may be a TFT (thin film transistor) liquid crystal display, an OLED (light emitting diode) display or other suitable display technology.
The image 106 may be displayed on the display screen 104. For example, the image 106 may be displayed as a background image to more than one display unit. Various display units, such as watch time 108, may be displayed on the display screen 104 over the background image 106. The display unit may also include date, sensor output such as pedometer readings, weather data, email, available command menus, and the like. In some implementations, as described below, the image 106 may be edited by the communication device 120 and/or the computing device 102 for use on the computing device.
Fig. 2(a), (b) and 2(c) show various formats of a display screen 202 of a smart watch type computing device with a display unit displayed on a background image 204. For example, the image 106 may be used as the background image 204. Fig. 2(a) shows a display unit of a digital clock 206 with a number and date 208. Fig. 2(b) shows a conventional simulated face with hour and minute hands 210 extending from and rotating about a central point, and with a second hand 212 and minute indicia around the periphery. Fig. 2(c) shows circular arms 216, 218 displaying time in hours and minutes, respectively, and five minute marks 220 around the perimeter of the watch face. Many other types of computing device fronts are possible.
In the example in fig. 2(a) to (c), the display screen 202 is circular in shape, and the background image 204 is edited to surround the entire watch front. In some implementations, the background image 204 can be displayed on a portion of the display screen 202. The display screen of a computing device may have various appearance features of different shapes, sizes, and flatness or curvature. In some implementations, the display screen may be a stereoscopic display to convey depth of field perception.
In some embodiments, geometric editing of the image may provide standard image shapes and sizes for various display screens. Geometric editing of the image may be performed by the communication device 120, the computing device 102, or other computing device. Fig. 3(a) to (f) show examples of geometric editing processing for a flat circular display screen, fig. 3(g) shows a geometric editing image on a flat square display screen, and fig. 3(g) shows a geometric editing image on a flat rectangular display screen. The geometry editing process may be implemented by an application stored on the communication device 120, the computing device 102, or another device, for example, in a combination of the communication device 120, the computing device 102, and a server, or in one of the device 120, the device 102, or the server. The geometry editing application may be code and program configured to edit an image based on appearance characteristics of a display screen.
In fig. 3(a), a base display screen 302, such as a blank screen, may be provided having appearance characteristics such as shape (e.g., circular), size, surface texture, hardness, flatness, and/or sphericity. The base display screen 302 may display any color, pattern, graphic, etc. In fig. 3(b), the geometry editing process may include determining a template form 304 from the overlaid base display screen 302. Template form 304 may be a particular shape that is sized according to the appearance characteristics of the display screen. Template form 304 may be used as a guide for editing an image for cropping a display screen. For example, template form 304 may be the largest dimension of a shape that fits within base display screen 302, such as the largest square in a circular or oval display screen or the largest circular or oval form as in a rectangular display screen. In some implementations, the template form 304 can be smaller than the base display screen 302 and positioned for a portion of the screen. In still other embodiments, template form 304 may encompass the entire underlying display screen 302.
In some embodiments, as shown in fig. 3(c), the geometry editing process may include sizing one or more separation gaps 306 within template form 304 for at least a portion of the perimeter of template form 304, such as a peripheral edge or arc. The separation gap 306 may be formed by pixel fill and may create a space between more than one image and the edge of the display screen. In some implementations, the separation gap 306 can serve as a boundary between multiple images. The separation gap can be any shape, size, gauge (e.g., length and width), such as 8 pixels wide. In some embodiments, various sizes and shapes of the plurality of separation gaps 306 may be used.
The geometric editing process may further include determining more than one primary content form 308 positioned at least substantially within the template form 304 and outside (e.g., not overlapping) the separation gap 306. In some implementations, the inner edge of the separation gap 306 can define the shape and size of the primary content form 308. The primary content form 308 may not overlap the separation gap 306. The primary content may provide a focus image to appear on the base display screen 302. In some implementations, primary content form 308 may be sized, shaped, and positioned to fit within the inner edge of separation gap 306 of template form 304. In some implementations, the inner boundary of the separation gap 306 defines the outer boundary of the primary content form 308. As shown in fig. 3(d), the geometric editing process may further include the removal of the template form 304, holding the primary content form 308 in place on the base display screen 302.
In some implementations, as shown in the example in fig. 3(e), more than one additional content form 310 can be determined in whole or in part by a geometric editing process. The additional content form 310 may provide image positioning on the base display screen 302. In some implementations, the additional content form 310 causes the image to move position on the base display screen 302 to the position of the primary content form 308 by scrolling, voice commands, touch commands, or the like. In some implementations, the additional content form 310 can be determined to replicate at least a portion of the primary content form 308 in size and shape such that the image appears partially on the display screen 302 and partially deviates from the base display screen 302. The additional content form 310 may be separated from the primary content form 308 by a separation gap 306. Fig. 3(e) shows a film strip layout of an image. The film strip layout may be capable of scrolling vertically or horizontally. Other layouts may be used for the content forms 308 and 310 on the base display screen 302.
The size and shape of the primary content form 308 may be used by the geometric editing process to determine editing parameters, such as size and shape, to cause the image to appear to fill the primary content form 308. The location of the content forms 308 and 310 on the display screen may further be used to determine the location of the image on the base display screen 302.
In fig. 3(f), the image edited according to the geometric editing process may be positioned at the position of the content form on the base display screen 302. The primary content form 308 may provide the location of the primary image 312 on the display screen 302. The primary image 312 (e.g., the image 106 received from the communication device 120 in fig. 1) may be positioned at the location of the primary content form 308. In some implementations, the multiple additional images 314 and 316 can be displayed in whole or in part at more than one location of the additional content form 310. The main image 312 and additional images 314, 316 may be dynamically updated as new images are modified according to the geometric editing process. For example, the user may scroll the images forward and backward so that the images located by the primary content form 308 and the additional content form 310 can be changed.
The space 318 between images may be created by the separation gap 306 of the template form 304. The space 318 may be any color, pattern, graphic, etc.
In fig. 3(g), the square display screen 320 includes a square image 322, which is edited according to the geometric editing process shown in fig. 3(a) to (d). In this example, a single primary image 322 is displayed and no additional images are displayed. In this example, the additional content form is not used to position the image on the display screen 320. In fig. 3(h), the rectangular square display screen 330 includes a square main image 332, where only the main image 332 is displayed, the square main image 332 being edited according to the geometric editing process shown in fig. 3(a) to (f). In this example, a partial additional content form may be used to locate one additional image 334.
Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of an example computing device 102 and communication device 120. The computing device 102 includes components that may include a memory 414, a processor 416, a display 410, a power component 418, and an interface 402 to acquire and consume images. The computing device 102 may include a power supply component 418, such as a battery, that is connected to a power source via a charging interface 420. The components of computing device 102 are communicatively coupled by a bus 422.
The communication device 120 may include memory 424, a processor 432, a camera controller 430, a power component 434, and an interface 442 to capture and transfer images. The communication device 120 may also include a power supply component 434, such as a battery, which may be connected to a power source via a charging interface 436. The components of the communication device 120 may be communicatively coupled via a bus 444. The computing device 102 may synchronize with the image repository 426 of the communication device 120 through the synchronization module 438 of the communication device 120 and via the interface 442 of the communication device 120.
In some implementations, the communication device 120 may receive an image request, e.g., a search query, album identification, etc., from the computing device 102 via the interface 442. In response to a request, the communication device 120 may collect more than one image into a collection, optionally prepare the images, such as edit the images, and store the collection in the image repository 426.
In some implementations, the camera controller 430 can capture images for acquisition and storage by the communication device 120. The image may also be created by other components, for example, by a drawing tool of the communication device 120. In some implementations, more than one external image source 450, such as a server storing a cloud-based photo gallery, a photo stream source, a social network, etc., can provide more than one image to the communication device 120 via the interface 442. The memory 424 of the communication device 120 may store images.
In some implementations, the image retrieval system 100 enables owners of images, such as creators, administrators, controllers, or owners of images from the image sources 450, to specify and/or agree to use their images via communication devices and computing devices. The owner of the image may provide consent to the use of certain information about the image, which may include activities related to capturing the image and the use of the capture device, identity information identifying the person identified in the image, and so forth. For example, the image retrieval system 100 may provide the user with a number of options for specifying and/or agreeing to use particular information. For example, the selections regarding designation and/or consent may be associated with a particular capture device, applications and components of the capture device, individual images, all images, individual photo albums, all photo albums, and the like. The selection can be carried out in a variety of ways. For example, the image retrieval system 100 may cause buttons or check boxes to be displayed next to the various selections. In some implementations, the image retrieval system 100 may enable users of a social network to specify and/or agree to use target recognition, typically including facial recognition, with their images.
Further, some data may be processed in more than one way before it is stored or used by the communication device 120 and the computing device 102, such that some information is removed. For example, the identity of a person may be processed so that no identifying information is determined, or a geographic location (e.g., city, zip code, or state level) may be generalized where location information is obtained so that a particular location of a person cannot be determined. Thus, the owner of the image may control how the image retrieval system 100 collects and uses the information.
The analysis module 440 of the communication device 120 may be a set of instructions that are executed by the processor 432 to determine an image for a collection of images and analyze the image, e.g., visual content of the image, metadata associated with the image, etc. In the event that the user has consented to the use of the images, the analysis module 440 may employ various target recognition techniques to discern targets present in the images to determine the images for the collection. For example, tree and sky segmentation, face detection (where the user has specifically agreed to the use of face detection techniques), face recognition (where the user has specifically agreed to the use of face recognition techniques), learning techniques such as neural network processing, and other processes or combinations of processes may be used to discern the target. The target recognition process may be specific to the type of image being processed. For example, natural images may be processed using object recognition techniques that detect objects that are common in nature. Such recognition techniques may be integrated into the analysis module 440. The communication device 120 may also access the identification technology through software or hardware external to the communication device 120. In some implementations, a server, such as the server of image source 450, may provide identification techniques and additional image processing techniques.
In some implementations, to identify the target, the analysis module 440 may compare and match the target (e.g., target image) to the reference image. In some implementations, the communication device 120, image source 450, or other computing device can search the reference image to identify any more than one reference image that is similar to the target in the image. For a given reference image, features for analysis may be extracted from the image of the target and then compared to those in more than one reference map. For example, analysis of the relative location, size, and/or shape of target features, such as facial features, body features, etc., may be performed with the consent of the user. In some embodiments, data collected from the analysis may be used to match a target in an image to more than one reference image using matching or similar features. In some implementations, multiple reference images may be normalized and the target data from those images compressed into a composite representation with information (e.g., target feature data), and then the target in the image may be compared to the composite representation with the user's consent for facial recognition. In some implementations, location information where the image is captured and the environment surrounding the target may be used for target recognition, with the user agreeing to use such information. For example, a tennis player on a tennis court may be identified, and a child near a school or playground may be identified.
In some cases, an object in an image may be similar to multiple reference images related to objects in the same category. As such, objects associated with objects in the image are likely to be of the same type as objects associated with the reference image.
In some embodiments, to facilitate target recognition, the analysis module 440 may employ geometric recognition based on feature recognition. Further, the analysis module 440 may use photometric techniques, which are based on statistical methods that extract target features as values for alignment. A combination of geometric and photometric methods may also be used when comparing an object in an image with more than one reference.
Other identification techniques may be used by the analysis module 440 of the other device or the communication device 120. For example, the analysis module 440 may use recognition techniques that use one or more of principal component analysis, linear recognition analysis, elastic bundle graph matching, hidden markov models, and dynamic link matching. It should be appreciated that other devices or the analysis module 440 of the communication device 120 may use other known or later developed recognition techniques and/or systems.
In some implementations, the image repository 426 of the communication device 120 can be updated with an updated set of new images and images previously provided in the set for a previous image request. The updated set may replace the past set in the image repository 426. The past set may have been collected in response to an image request received via the interface 442.
In various embodiments, images identified for aggregation and received from image sources 450 may be stored in memory 424, modified by editing module 428, or provided directly to image repository 426 of communication device 120. In some implementations, the editing module 428 can be a set of instructions executed by the processor 432 to edit an image consumed by the computing device 102. In some implementations, the editing module 428 can be stored in the memory 424 of the communication device 120 and can be accessed and executed by the processor 432. In some implementations, the editing module 428 can be implemented using hardware including a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In some other implementations, the editing module 428 may be implemented using a combination of hardware and software.
More than one image from the memory 424 may be edited by the editing module 428, for example, in response to a user search query from the computing device 102. The image may be edited by the editing module 428 to create an image that meets the requirements of the computing device 102, a display screen (e.g., OLED, LCD, etc.) of the computing device 102, or is otherwise suitable for consumption by the computing device 102. For example, the image may be compressed, cropped, reformatted, color depth adjusted (e.g., 16-bit, 32-bit, etc.), resolution adjusted, or otherwise processed to make the image compatible or suitable for use by the computing device 102. The communication device may also employ other editing techniques, such as processes for improving quality, adding effects to images, creating animations such as animated GIF (graphics interchange format), producing 3D imagery, and the like. Images that are ready to be received by computing device 102 may be stored in image repository 426, including images modified by editing module 428.
The computing device 102 may synchronize with the image repository 426 to retrieve images stored in the image repository 426. The synchronization module 438 may be a set of instructions executed by the processor 432 to indicate synchronization with the computing device 102. In some implementations, the synchronization module 438 may be stored in the memory 424 of the communication device 120 and may be accessed and executed by the processor 432. In some implementations, the synchronization module 438 can be implemented using hardware including an FPGA and an ASIC. In some other implementations, the synchronization module 438 may be implemented using a combination of hardware and software. In some implementations, the computing device can include a synchronization module in addition to or in place of the synchronization module 438 of the communication device 120.
The computing device 102 may receive images via the interface 402. Interface 402 on computing device 102 and interface 442 on communication device 120 enable communication with remote devices (e.g., capture devices, servers, other computing devices) over one or more networks 112 (as shown in fig. 1). Interfaces 402 and 442 may include ethernet adapters, USB (universal serial bus), wireless interconnect components, or other interfaces based on a wired or wireless standard or proprietary. The interfaces 402 and 442 may be configured to be able to communicate via various communication protocols, including BluetoothTMLTE, CDMA, WiMax, WiFi direct EDGE, 3G, 4G, HTTP, TCP, SIP, device contact based transport protocols, device mobile based pairing protocols, and other communication protocols. Communication between computing device 102 and communication device 120 via interfaces 402 and 442 may include a graphLike a request, for example a user search query.
In an exemplary method, the search query may be used to make an image request on the computing device 102. For example, the request may be a background image replacing the display screen 502 shown in fig. 5(a), (b), (c)), and (d). Other image requests may also be employed using various input and display screens.
In an example, a user interface on a display screen 502 of the computing device 102 can provide a search element icon 504. In an example, a user may pull down a search element icon 504 by touching and sliding down on the screen, as shown by a pull down arrow 506 for illustrative purposes. In FIG. 5(b), a downward movement for illustrative purposes, shown by a downward arrow 506, may result in an enlarged search element icon 504. In fig. 5(c), display screen 502 shows a search interface that can be fully expanded and can cover a significant portion of display screen 502, or the entire display screen 502.
In some implementations, the user can interact with the computing device 102 through voice or touch input. For example, microphone icon 508 represents a ready to accept audio, such as a voice command. In some implementations, the display screen 502 is a multi-touch sensitive screen. The search interface 508 on the screen 502 may accept various inputs, for example, touch instructions such as zoom in, click, scroll, slide, and the like. In some implementations, the computing device 102 may accept various other inputs, such as, but not limited to, audio such as voice recognition, touch screens, switch input with a screen or external keyboard, head-mouse, gesture recognition, facial recognition, motion trackers, eye-motion trackers, smart buttons, trackballs, trackpens, handwriting pads, pens, stylus pens, and hand-shaped mice. Input may include a user applying touch, voice, single-click, typing, gesture, movement (e.g., moving eyes, arms, body), and other actions. In some implementations, the user contacts the display screen 502 with a finger or stylus to select an item displayed by the display screen 502. The user may enter text or activate control functions of the computing device 102.
In some embodiments, the user may enter an entry, such as a date or date range at which the image was captured, a description of the image, and so forth. The user may also select from a list 510 of search categories, such as more than one standard image category, previous queries, user preferences, album titles, and the like. In an example, the list 510 includes two categories: a category of date type, "april of 2015" and a category of local type, "Venice Italy". Various other types of categories may also be used in the list 510. In some implementations, the list of categories 510 can be received from the communication device 120 via analysis of the image by the analysis module 440. For example, targets identified by more than one image analysis module 440 may be used as categories for the list 510.
As shown in fig. 5(d), the search results interface on display screen 502 may display more than one search results image 512 retrieved from communication device 120. The results interface may also include search terms selected from the list 510. The resulting image may be scrolled by scroll unit 514 and displayed from non-persistent memory 406 as a copy of the image stored in long-term memory 404.
The image sets received by the computing device 102 may be stored in a repository 412 of long-term memory 404, such as a hard disk, and/or in a cached non-persistent memory 406, such as memory 424. Repository 412 may have a variety of structures that enable rapid retrieval of images for transfer to non-persistent memory 406. In some implementations, images may be indexed in repository 412 based on timestamps. For example, when the user scrolls back and forth through images taken before or after the current image. In some implementations, images can be indexed according to a topic depicted in the image or by search terms, such as a "tree" of search terms that a user may enter, and the images are indexed into collections according to the search terms. In this manner, the image of the tree may be scrolled back and forth. In some implementations, images can be indexed in repository 412 based on a combination of time and subject matter. In still other embodiments, the index may be based on other parameters, such as the album to which the image belongs, the quality of the image, the image source 450, the resolution, and the like. Such indexing may enable "cache-like" performance and may allow for rapid replenishment of non-persistent memory regardless of how the user browses the image.
Images may be stored in repository 412 of long term memory 404 in a manner that caching facilitates reducing cache miss rates. To save memory space, the image can be reduced to a small size. By storing the updated image set in long-term memory, the computing device 102 can access the images while offline and not in communication with the communication device 120.
In some implementations, when a predetermined number of images are consumed, e.g., displayed, a predetermined number of images received by the computing device 102, e.g., a minimum threshold of images, can be maintained in the non-persistent memory 406 by copying the images from the long-term memory 404 to the non-persistent memory 406, which serves as temporary storage. The particular number of images reflects the number of images available to the user at any given time. When images are consumed, they may not be permanently retained in non-persistent memory. For example, three images may be defined for display purposes on a computing device. The user can scroll back and forth the first three images from the collection of non-persistent memory. When the user scrolls to the fourth image, the computing device removes the first image from the non-persistent memory to keep the number of uses at three. As the user scrolls back toward the first image, the computing device may remove the fourth image from the non-persistent memory and reload the first image again for viewing. In various embodiments, any number of images may be employed for consumption, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6 to 12 images.
In some embodiments, a predetermined number of images, e.g., a minimum threshold of images, may be maintained in non-persistent memory as consumed images. In some of these cases, the non-persistent memory may be replenished when a certain amount of the images for consumption are consumed. For example, the predetermined number of images in the non-persistent memory (minimum threshold) may be 3, and the number of images for consumption may be a number, for example, 2, which is less than the predetermined number of images. In some cases where the image is held in the queue, there may not be a minimum threshold and the image may be replenished into non-persistent memory as it is consumed. In these ways, delays in providing images to the user may be avoided or reduced. In still other embodiments, the system may wait to replenish the non-persistent memory with a predetermined number of images (minimum threshold) until all images in the non-persistent memory are consumed. For example, the number of images for consumption may be the same as a predetermined number of images (minimum threshold), or the number of images for consumption may not be set.
The image may be consumed in various ways. For example, the image may be displayed or pinched by the user scrolling in various directions of the display screen to zoom. Image consumption may include selecting an image for sharing or setting up an image as a background image like the front of a smart watch, e.g., a periodically changing background image or changing a background image when transitioning to an active mode of a computing device.
In some embodiments, the non-persistent memory may be replenished in a periodic manner. For example, when all images have been depleted (e.g., consumed) in a particular order, image retrieval system 100 again supplies images to non-persistent memory in the same order. In some embodiments, the order in which images are provided to non-persistent memory may be randomly scrambled. Other orders of images may also be based on, for example, image content, time of day, calendar events, location of the computing device, user preferences, and so forth.
The computing device 102 may include one or more processors 416 and memory 414. The processor 416 may process instructions for execution within the computing device 102, including instructions stored in the memory 414. The processor may coordinate computing device components, e.g., applications, wireless or wired communication through an interface, etc. Each coupled to a computer system bus 422. In some embodiments, multiple processors and buses 422 may be used.
The processor 416 may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. Processors may also be implemented using various architectures. For example, the processor 416 may be a CISC (Complex instruction System computer) processor, RISC (reduced instruction set computer) processor, or MISC (minimal instruction set computer) processor.
A "processor" includes any suitable hardware and/or software system, mechanism, or component that processes data, signals, or other information. A processor can include a system with a general-purpose central processing unit, multiple processing units, dedicated circuitry for achieving functionality, or other systems. The processing need not be limited to a geographic location, or have temporal limitations. For example, a processor may perform its functions in "real-time", "offline", in "batch mode", and the like. Portions of the processing may be performed by different (or the same) processing systems, at different times and at different locations.
The memory 414 stores information within the computing device 102. The memory 414 may be any suitable data storage, memory and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including an electronic storage device such as Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), magnetic storage (hard drives, etc.), flash memory, optical storage (CDs, DVDs, or the like), magnetic or optical disks, or other tangible media suitable for storing instructions (e.g., programs or software instructions) for execution by a processor. For example, a tangible medium, such as a hardware storage device, may be used to store control logic, which may include executable instructions. The instructions may also be embodied in or provided as electronic signals, for example, delivered from a server (e.g., a distribution system and/or a cloud computing system) in the form of software as a service (SaaS).
More than one processor 416 and memory 414 may implement the editing module 408 and the display 410. In some implementations, the editing module 108 may be a set of instructions executed by the processor 416 for editing an image consumed by the computing device 102. In some implementations, the editing module 408 can be stored in the memory 414 of the computing device 102 and can be accessed and executed by the processor 416. In some implementations, the editing module 408 can be implemented using hardware including Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) editing modules. In other embodiments, the editing module 408 may be implemented using a combination of hardware and software.
The display 410 may include hardware configured to display images, cells, etc. on a display screen. Display 410 is coupled to bus 422 for communication with other components of computing device 102 via signal lines. Computing device 102 may also include other types of non-display output devices, such as speakers for audio interfaces, vibration or force feedback devices, and so forth.
The computer program, also known as a program, software application, or code, may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more of the methods described herein. The computer program may be tangibly embodied in an information carrier, such as a computer-or machine-readable medium, e.g., in memory 414, storage device, or in memory on processor 416. A machine-readable medium is any computer program product, apparatus, or device for providing machine instructions or data to a programmable processor.
The routines of particular embodiments may be implemented using any suitable programming language and programming techniques. Different programming techniques, such as procedural or object oriented, may be employed. The routines may be executed on a single or multiple processors. Any suitable component or combination of components of the image retrieval system 100, or a suitable processor or processors associated with the image retrieval system 100 may perform the described steps.
Although the steps, operations, or computations may be presented in a specific order, their order may be changed in different specific embodiments. In some particular embodiments, multiple steps shown in sequence in this specification can be performed simultaneously, and/or there can be other steps in place of or in addition to those shown herein.
The computing device 120, which is a wearable device, may have a screen that is small in size and may have various shapes and sizes. In some implementations, the changes may be altered by the editing module 408 of the computing device 102 and/or the editing module 428 of the communication device 120 before being consumed, such as before being displayed by the display 410. For example, the geometry of the image may be altered to fit the display screen. The image may be cropped and resized for viewing on the display screen. In some embodiments, the image may be adjusted to display the image with minimal distortion on a flat or flexible display screen, such as a partially or fully curved, bendable, rollable display screen, or the like.
The background image may be edited to alter color, saturation, transparency, apply one or more filters to the image, etc., to serve as a background image against the display unit. When the display unit appears bright, such as white, the background image may be dark. In some implementations, certain objects, foreground or background may be edited differently in the image in relation to the appearance of the display element. For example, the sky in the background image may be darkened or brightened without changing the scenery depicted in the picture. The background image may also be centered or positioned on the display screen relative to the position of the display unit to enhance the display of the display unit and the background image. For example, the background image may be shifted to bring the focus of the background image away from the display unit to allow the focus, e.g., viewing time 108, to be viewed without disturbing the display unit.
The computing device 102 may consume the images in various ways, such as sharing, displaying, organizing and saving, user editing, and so forth. The images may share various communications with one or more recipients, including email, instant messages, text messages, video conferences, posts on websites such as social media websites and blogs, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and near field communication connections (e.g., learning), as well as various activations, such as gestures to approach the recipient and use sensors, among other ways to communicate the images.
As shown in fig. 6(a), (b), and (c), one embodiment of sharing involves selection of images. For example, FIG. 6(a) shows a strip of images displayed on display screen 602 that can be scrolled having a portion of a top image, a main image 604, and a portion of a bottom image. In particular embodiments, for purposes of illustration, one or more images may be selected as points 606, which may or may not appear on the screen on the display on top of the selected image. In some embodiments, certain images may be deselected, such as by darkening unselected images.
As shown in fig. 6(b), the sharing control unit 608 may be provided on the sharing interface together with the selected image on the display screen 602. As shown in fig. 6(c), a menu 610 of sharing modes may be provided on the menu interface of the display screen 602, and more than one mode may be selected. The command indicative of the computing device 102 may be input in various ways, such as by touch, language command, gesture, and so forth. Examples of some voice commands may include "scroll," "share," "texting," "beam," "inbox," "post," and so forth.
The images may be displayed in various formats, such as background images, movie tape imaging, grid layouts, and the like. The image queue in the non-persistent memory 406 may enable fast performance of pinch-zoom actions. As shown in fig. 7(a), (b), (c), and (d), one image 704 may be displayed and manipulated on the display screen 702. In fig. 7(a), a selected one of the images 704 may be zoomed out by zooming in, e.g., by pinching, of a diagonally oriented arrow 706 as for illustration purposes. As shown in fig. 7(b), the reduced presentation of the selected one image 704 may be displayed in a grid format 708 along with other reduced images from the collection. In fig. 7(c), the selected image 704 may also be enlarged by scaling with diagonally oriented arrows 710 as for illustration purposes. In fig. 7(d), the enlarged presentation of the selected image 704 may fill the display screen 702. Such a zooming action may be indicated by a user's touch, sound, gesture, or the like.
FIG. 8 illustrates, by way of a flow chart, some embodiments of capturing and displaying images that may be performed by the processor 416 of the computing device 102 as shown in FIG. 4. The computing device 102 may communicate with the communication device 120, and in block 802, the computing device 102 may determine that the set of updates is presented in the repository 426 of the communication device 120. For example, the computing device 102 may receive a notification of the set of updates from the communication device 120, the computing device 102 may send a query to the collection device for the updates, and so on. In some implementations, the computing device 102 can determine updates to the set by receiving a set of updates without prior notification.
More than one image in the updated set may be copied to a queue, such as non-persistent memory 406, as in block 808. In some implementations, an image queue minimum or maximum threshold may be specified for the queue. For example, a maximum threshold number of images, such as 6, may define a maximum number of images to be placed in the queue. In some cases, more than one image that has been recently received from the updated set that does not exceed the maximum threshold number may be copied into the queue and either be replenished with any previous images in the queue or replace existing images in the queue. In some embodiments, the queue maximum threshold value represents an amount of memory capacity specified for the queue. In these cases, the queue may not exceed a threshold memory capacity for images stored in the queue.
In the example shown in fig. 8, in decision block 810, when the computing device 102 switches from the inactive state to the active state, the next image may be retrieved from the queue and displayed, as shown in block 812. In the inactive state, the device may have limited Central Processing Unit (CPU) cycles. If such a switch does not occur, for example, if the computing device remains in an active state, the computing device may maintain the current image as the current display image, as shown in block 814. In some implementations, for example, if the computing device is in an inactive state, the display can transition to a default screen, such as blank, until an active state switch occurs.
In some cases, because images are used from the queue, when the number of images in the queue reaches, for example, a minimum threshold or a predetermined number of thresholds, as determined at block 816, the queue may be supplemented by copying more than one image from the set from long-term memory, as shown at block 818. If the number of images in the queue is above a minimum threshold, e.g., above a predetermined number, then the next image in the queue is ready to be displayed and the queue is not replenished. For example, the predetermined number of minimum thresholds may be a number or quantity of stores that is less than an upper limit or maximum threshold that the queue can accommodate. In some embodiments, the queue may hold a particular number of images or a number consumed by memory, rather than having a maximum or minimum threshold.
Fig. 9 illustrates, in flow chart form, geometric editing of an image for a display screen (e.g., display screen 104). Geometric editing may be performed in whole or in part by the computing device 102, the communication device 120, the image source 440, or other computing device. In some implementations, as shown in block 902, more than one appearance characteristic of the display screen may be determined. The appearance characteristics may include one or more of the shape, size, surface texture, flatness, and/or sphericity of the display screen. In block 904, a template form may be created based on the appearance characteristics. Template form 304 may specify a shape for the image, e.g., square, circle, oval, etc., to match the display screen. In some examples, the template form may specify a deformation of the image, for example to match a curvature of the display screen.
In block 906, more than one separation gap 306 may be determined in template form 304, for example, at or along more than one edge of the template form. The separation gap may be used as a blank area of the image on the display screen.
In block 908, one or more content forms, e.g., 308, can be determined to fit at least substantially within template form 304 by being sized, shaped, and/or positioned, and not to overlap compartment gap 306. In some implementations, the inner edge of the separation gap 306 can define the shape and size of the primary content form 308.
In block 910, the image may be edited based substantially on the content form. For example, the image may be cropped or enlarged. In some implementations, geometric image editing of an image may include filling the periphery of the image with pixels that may be borrowed from the image. As shown in block 912, the compilation image may be positioned in line with the formation of content on the display screen. In some embodiments, the positioning of the image may include determining a focus object or point in the image, such as by image analysis techniques, and centering the focus object or point in the template form. In some embodiments, the gap between the form of the template and the outer edge of the display screen may be filled in any color, such as a solid line, a pattern, a graphic, and the like.
FIG. 10 illustrates, by way of a flow chart, some embodiments of acquiring and providing images, which may be performed by a processor 432 of the computing device 120 as shown in FIG. 4. In block 1002, a charging mode of a communication device may be detected. In block 1004, an image may be determined to belong to a set of images to update the set. The image may not previously belong to the collection. For example, a new image may be newly captured or acquired. In some embodiments, the image has been previously captured or acquired but recently identified as belonging to the set of images.
In block 1006, the image may be edited based on one or more appearance characteristics of a display screen of the computing device 102, for example. Editing may include geometric editing and/or other editing techniques previously described herein.
In block 1008, the updated set including the new images may be stored in repository 426 for transfer to computing device 102. In determination block 1010, a charging mode of the communication device 120 and/or the computing device 102 may be detected. In response to the charging mode, the updated set of images may be provided to the computing device, as in block 1012. The repository may be maintained, e.g., the updated set may remain in the repository on standby or may be periodically updated until a charging mode occurs, as shown in block 1014. For example, the communication device 120 may continue to update the collection in the repository with new images while waiting for a charging mode to transfer the collection of images to the computing device 102.
Where the systems discussed herein collect or utilize personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or functions collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social activities or activities, profession, the user's preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that is more relevant to the user. In addition, some data may be processed in more than one way before it is stored or used, so that the personal identification information is removed. For example, the user identity may be processed such that personally identifiable information of the user is not determined, or in the case where location information of the user is obtained (e.g., city, zip code, or state level), the geographic location of the user is generalized such that the specific location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how the content server collects and uses information about the user.
A number of embodiments have been described. Features described in conditional language may describe alternative embodiments. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the functional blocks, methods, devices, and systems described in this disclosure may be integrated or divided into different combinations of systems, devices, and functional blocks. While the specification has been described with respect to specific embodiments thereof, these specific implementations are merely illustrative, and not restrictive. The concepts illustrated in the examples may be applied to other examples and embodiments. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure, and other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.
