- An "activity”, as used herein, can be a data construct describing a thing to do, which a user can associate with a user's "activity-assistant account.”
- an activity is defined at least in part by one or more singular, global activity parameters.
- global parameters for a given activity may include a title or text description (e.g., "get brunch at Restaurant ABC"), data indicating the location that is associated with the activity (e.g., a latitude/longitude and/or a street address of Restaurant ABC), data indicating one or more user "moods” that may be indicative of the activity being more or less well-suited for a given user at a given point in time (e.g., “fun”, “social”, “cerebral”, “productive”, “ambitious”, etc.), data indicating time constraints on the activity (e.g., the hours that Restaurant ABC is open and/or the hours during which Restaurant ABC serves brunch), and any other data that may be directly or indirectly interpreted to affect the importance of a given activity to a given user.
- a title or text description e.g., "get brunch at Restaurant ABC”
- data indicating the location that is associated with the activity e.g., a latitude/longitude and/or a street address of Restaurant ABC
- an activity is a user-defined construct, and thus the global parameters that define each activity may vary.
- a given activity may include all of the above-mentioned global activity parameters, a subset of the above-mentioned parameters, or none of the above-mentioned parameters.
- a user may create an activity that is not tied to any particular location (e.g., "do homework for art history class"), and thus choose not to provide a location.
- activities are flexible and dynamic constructs, it should be understood that the above-mentioned examples of global parameters are not limiting. It is also possible that an activity may be generated by a computing system or device without any initial user input (or alternatively, generated based on some user-provided input).
- an activity Once an activity is created, its global parameters may be applied to all users who add the activity or become associated with the activity. Thus, in effect, there is a single copy of each activity and its global parameters that is common to all those users. It should be understood that global parameters are flexible and dynamic, and may change over time in relation to the activity. For example, a "popularity" parameter may be defined for an activity that is updated on an ongoing basis to reflect the number of users that have added the activity.
- user-specific parameters which vary between users, may be defined for an activity. Accordingly, while the global parameters of an activity are the same for all users, each user that adds an activity may customize their user-specific parameters for the activity.
- user-specific parameters may be used to specify (a) plans regarding the activity (e.g., “I want to do it”, “I want to do it again, but not for a few weeks,” “I must do it before July 4,” “I never want to do it again,” etc.), (b) the user's history regarding that activity (e.g., I went there with Lauren on Nov 4 and again with Ryan on Nov 28), (c) personal time constraints based on user preferences (e.g., preference of brunch early on Sunday so that time is available to digest before yoga class at noon), and/or (d) any other personal preferences that may overrides or modify the global parameters (e.g., "I like to go to Restaurant ABC when I'm sad because it cheers me up,” “I like to go to Restaurant ABC when I have friends in town,” etc.).
- plans regarding the activity e.g., "I want to do it”, “I want to do it again, but not for a few weeks,” “I must do it before July 4,” “I never want to do it again,” etc.
- an activity can be designated as a "public” or "private” activity. Depending on how a given activity is defined, this designation may be made by setting a global parameter when the activity is created (and thus apply to all users who add the activity), and/or may be made via a user-specific parameter that is settable by each user who adds an activity.
- an "activity assistant system” is provided, which is configured to evaluate the relative importance of activities to a particular user so that activities can be presented on the user interface of the activity assistant system in a logical manner.
- the activity assistant system may score an activity based not only on the characteristics of the activity itself, but also based on data that is indicative of the user's "context" (e.g., the user's, interests, intents, moods, experiences, associations with other users, etc.).
- the user interface of the activity assistant system may therefore provide users with a dynamic and flexible mechanism for deciding what activities they might enjoy, and how they would like to spend their time.
- the activity assistant system identifies and/or determines any number of "signals" that is directly or indirectly relevant to the importance of an activity to the particular user.
- signals can take the form of information provided by global parameters and user-specific parameters taken individually or information determined by evaluating interactions between global parameters, user-specific parameters, and/or other data sources.
- the activity assistant system evaluates the signals for a particular combination of user and activity, and based on the signals, quantify the importance of the particular activity for the particular user (e.g., by assigning a "score" to the activity).
- signals include but are not limited to: an indication of a user's desire to do or complete an activity (e.g., plans), the level of similarity between user's mood and activity mood, the level of similarity between the user's context (as indicated by user-specific signals and/or user-specific parameters indicating, for example, whether the user is on a desktop computer/mobile phone, on-line/off-line, talking on the phone, driving, walking, etc.) and corresponding activity context requirements and/or restrictions (as indicated by global parameters of the activity), a distance between the user's current detected (or indicated) location and the activity location (if available), the
- the activity for the current weather conditions at the user's current or indicated location and/or the current weather conditions at the activity's indicated location e.g., rainy, sunny, snowy, etc.
- a user-designated priority for the activity e.g., a user-designated due date (or next due date, if recurring), a user's snooze history or pattern for the activity, an amount of time required for the activity, a progress or status of the activity (done, active, in- progress, etc.), ownership of the activity (e.g., whether the owner is the particular user in question or another user), whether the user received an invitation to the activity or just a notice that the activity exists (e.g., a "heads-up"), a popularity of the activity (e.g., number of comments on an activity, or the number of people who have commented, copied, liked, shared, done, or followed the activity), a similarity between a user query string and the activity text (for search/suggest), a similarity between
- the user interface of the activity assistant system presents activities that a particular user has associated with their account in a logical order that is based at least in part upon the relative importance of the activities to the user.
- the activity assistant system evaluates the signals for each activity in a user's activity list (i.e., each activity that has been added by the user) and assign a score to the activity.
- the activity assistant system can then rank the activities in the user's activity list according to their respectively determined score, and relay this information to the user interface of the activity assistant system so that it can adjust the displayed activity list accordingly.
- the intelligence of the activity assistant system is utilized to provide "suggested" activities that are tailored to the particular user's preferences, tendencies, location, time table, associated other users, and/or mood at a given point in time.
- the activity assistant system initiates an activity search that takes into account the scores of activities when ranking the search results, and these search results are presented to the user via the user interface of the activity assistant system.
- the activity assistant system supports an "activity search" feature of the user interface of the activity assistant system. This feature allows the user to enter text and initiate an activity search on the text, the results of which factor in the relative scores of activities as assessed by the activity assistant system.
- a user interface is provided that allows for intuitive user interaction with such activities.
- a user typically accesses the user interface of the activity assistant system by logging in to a user's account in the activity-assistant system.
- the user interface of the activity assistant system displays graphical representations of activities to a user in a logical manner that varies according to the interests, intents, associations with other users, and moods of the user.
- the user views activities they have added to a personal "activity list," view suggested activities, create and add new activities to their activity list, and/or add/delete existing activities (e.g., those created by other users) to/from their activity list, among other functions.
- the user interface provides a visualization of (a) how the user has been spending his or her time; and (b) how the user could be spending his or hers time in the future.
- a given online social networking service typically does not provide personalized recommendations for activities that are relevant to the user and the user's existing contacts.
- the follow description describes example implementations for providing suggested activities based on a user's contacts.
- the user interface of the activity assistant system provides an interface for providing one or more suggested activities based on one or more selected contacts.
- the activity assistant system provides a display of one or more contacts (e.g., contacts that a user may have some interest in, such as people the user follows and people who follow the user on social networks, people that may be similar to the user based on interests, etc.).
- the user selects one or more of the contacts (or alternatively, searches for contacts).
- the activity assistant system determines a set of common or shared activities that all of the selected contacts have indicated a desire or want to do. Further, the activity assistant system also determines activities that a subset of the selected contacts have indicated a desire or want to do.
- Figure 1A conceptually illustrates an example process 100 for suggesting one or more activities based on one or more contacts of a user.
- the process 100 is performed by one or more computing devices or systems in some configurations.
- the process 100 begins at 105 by receiving a selection of one or more contacts, wherein each contact is respectively associated with one or more activities.
- the selected one or more contacts are social networking contacts of the user.
- Other types of contacts can be included are still be within the scope of the subject technology. For instance, contacts from e-mail, text messaging and/or instant messaging are selected in one example.
- the selection of one or more contacts is based on user input.
- the selection of the one or more contacts can include user input such as, but not limited to, a mouse cursor selection, a keyboard shortcut selection, a touch input selection (e.g., via a touchscreen device), etc.
- Other types of user input can be received for selecting the contacts and still be within the scope of the subject technology.
- the process 100 at 1 10 determines one or more activities based on the selected one or more contacts and at least one parameter associated with the determined one or more activities.
- each of the determined one or more activities includes a parameter indicating a desire to perform the determined activities by the selected contacts (e.g., a "want- to-do" parameter).
- each activity includes data indicating a specific deed or action that is desired to be performed by a corresponding contact (e.g., "see the northern lights,” “visit the pyramids,” “go see a movie,” “try new restaurant in downtown,” “make beer at home,” “start a company,” etc.).
- the process 100 performs a search query on one or activities (e.g., from a data store including activity data) associated with each selected contact to determine each activity that at least one selected contact has indicated a desire to perform based on the parameter (e.g., the "want-to-do" parameter).
- activities e.g., from a data store including activity data
- the parameter e.g., the "want-to-do" parameter
- the process 100 at 1 15 ranks the determined one or more activities based at least on a number of selected contacts associated with each of the determined one or more activities. For instance, the activities are ranked so any activity in which that all of the selected contacts indicate a desire to do are ranked higher than any other activity that only a subset of the selected contacts indicate a desire to do.
- the process 100 further ranks the determined one or more activities based on one or more signals associated with each of the determined one or more activities. Some examples of signals include, but not limited to, a level of difficulty associated with each of the ranked one or more activities, one or more interests of the selected contacts, each respective proximity of the selected contacts to the user or location of a respective activity, a time or date of a respective activity, etc. Other signals can be utilized and still be within the scope of the subject technology.
- the process 100 can sort the determined activities according to a relevancy metric.
- the process 100 at 120 provides for display the ranked one or more activities and each selected contact associated with the ranked one or more activities.
- An example graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the ranked activities is described in further detail in Figure 5.
- GUI graphical user interface
- Figure IB conceptually illustrates an example process 150 for detenriining one or more common completed activities between a user and one or more contacts.
- the process 100 is performed by one or more computing devices or systems in some configurations.
- the process 150 is performed conjunctively with the process 100 described in Figure 1A. For instance, based on the selected contacts at 105 in the process 100, the process 150 determines one or more common activities that have been completed by the user and at least one selected contact.
- the process 150 begins at 155 by determining one or more activities that have been completed by at least one contact among the selected one or more contacts and the user.
- the selected contacts can be provided by user input selecting one or more contacts or provided via a search query for contacts.
- each activity includes a parameter indicating whether the activity has been completed (e.g., parameter indicating a progress or status of the activity as being "done" or "completed”).
- the process 150 performs a search query on one or activities (e.g., from a data store including activity data) associated with each selected contact.
- the process 150 determines whether the user and at least one selected contact(s) has completed the activity as indicated by the parameter.
- the process 150 at 160 then provides for display the one or more completed activities and each selected contact associated with the one or more completed activities.
- the process 150 then ends. In this manner, the process 150 provides one or more activities that the user and the selected contacts have both completed, which enables the user to review former activities that have been commonly done by the user and any selected contact(s).
- Figure 2 conceptually illustrates an example process 200 for providing a group message to one or more contacts associated with a selected activity.
- the process 200 can be performed by one or more computing devices or systems in some configurations. In one example, the process 200 can be performed conjunctively with the process 100 described in Figure 1A.
- the process 200 begins at 205 by receiving a selection of one activity among the ranked one or more activities.
- the process 200 at 210 generates a group message between each contact associated with the selected one activity.
- the group message is one of an instant message, social network post, video conference, e-mail, SMS, and MMS.
- the process 200 at 215 provides for display the group message between each contact associated with the selected one activity. The process 200 then ends.
- the group message provided by the process 200 facilitates communication between a user and any selected contacts associated with a respective activity. In this manner, the user can plan with or communicate with the selected users in order to complete a respective activity provided by the process 100 in Figure 1 A.
- FIG 3 conceptually illustrates an example process 300 for processing user input for indicating that a user adds an activity among ranked activities.
- the process 300 can be performed by one or more computing devices or systems in some configurations. In one example, the process 300 can be performed conjunctively with the process 100 described in Figure 1A.
- the process 300 begins at 305 receiving an input indicating that the user adds an activity among the ranked one or more activities via interaction with a first user interface element.
- the process 300 at 310 stores data in a user account (e.g., in a user-account data store) associated with the user to indicate that the user has added the activity.
- the process 300 at 315 stores data in a centralized data store (e.g., global activity data store) indicating that the user has added the activity.
- the process 300 then ends.
- FIG 4 conceptually illustrates an example process 400 for processing user input for indicating that a user has completed an activity among ranked activities.
- the process 400 can be performed by one or more computing devices or systems in some configurations. In one example, the process 400 can be performed conjunctively with the process 100 described in Figure 1A.
- the process 400 begins at 405 by receiving an input indicating that the user has completed one activity among the ranked one or more activities via interaction with a second user interface element.
- the process 400 at 410 stores data in the user account (e.g., in a user- account data store) associated with the user to indicate that the user has completed the one activity.
- the process 400 at 415 stores data in a centralized data store (e.g., global activity data store) indicating that the user has completed the one activity.
- the process 400 then ends.
- FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates a graphical user interface (GUI) 500 in which some configurations of the subject technology can be implemented. More specifically, the GUI 500 can include different sets of graphical elements for providing and interacting with one or more suggested activities as described in Figures 1-4.
- a graphical element can include, but is not limited to, a button, check box, radio button, slider, list box, drop-down list, menu, combo box, icon, text box, scroll bar, etc.
- the GUI 500 is displayed in a client application such as a web browser, mobile application, or desktop application.
- the GUI 500 is provided by an online service or system in some configurations. Additionally, in some configurations, the GUI 500 is provided in a widget.
- the term "widget” refers to a lightweight application (e.g., lightweight in comparison to a full application suite or software package) providing a GUI that includes one or more graphical elements used to provide a specific application.
- the GUI 500 includes display areas 505, 530, 540, 550 and 560.
- the display area 505 include respective graphical representations 510, 515, 520 and 525 (e.g., an avatar, profile image, icon, etc.)
- the different users illustrated in the example GUI 500 are contacts that a user is following (e.g., the user has added) and contacts that are following the user (e.g., the contacts have added the user).
- the selected users shown in the display area 505 are selected responsive to user input (e.g., touch selection input on a touch screen device as shown, mouse cursor input, keyboard input, etc.).
- other users in the display area 505 that are not selected shown as non- highlighted.
- the users are members of an online social networking service or other service that provides the herein described activity assistant system.
