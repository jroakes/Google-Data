Definitions
- This document generally relates to information management.
- E-mail systems allow people to exchange ideas and collaborate on projects.
- advertisers can send on-line advertisements (or “ads”) to viewers in which the ads are selected based on the content of e-mail messages.
- the selection of ads may be achieved by various techniques.
- an initial determination is made to identify all advertisements that are a match or near match for terms in the e-mail.
- the match may be made, for example, between one or more words in the e-mail, and keywords identified by an advertiser and associated with a particular advertisement or group of advertisements, such as an ad campaign.
- a company selling fishing tackle may have a line of large lures, and may thus identify terms such as “lunker,” “sturgeon,” and “muskie fever” as keywords to associate with their advertisements for such large lures.
- Those advertisements may then be considered by the system for sending to users when the users send or receive e-mails containing such terms.
- the comparison may also be made between terms in the e-mail, and the text in an advertisement or the text in a target of a hyperlink in an advertisement, or to a combination of keywords, target text, and advertisement text, among other possible techniques.
- An advertisement may be selected for sending to users if there is a “near” match also, for example, if an e-mail includes terms that are known synonyms or mistypings or misspellings of the keyword terms for an advertisement.
- a user profile is identified, the user profile including portions of information related to a first user that is present in a collaborative environment that enables the first user to interact with at least one other user.
- a weight is associated with a portion of information.
- An advertisement is identified based on the portions of information and associated weights, and the advertisement is shown to the first user.
- the collaborative environment can include an instant messaging interface, a web conferencing interface, an on-line calendar interface, a video conferencing interface, or a Voice-over-IP interface.
- the collaborative environment can allow the first user to interact with the at least one other user in real time.

- the collaborative environment can include an instant messaging interface. Identifying the advertisement can include identifying an advertisement based on the portions of information, the associated weights, and the messages exchanged through the instant messaging interface. Displaying the identified advertisement can include displaying the identified advertisement proximate (e.g., adjacent) to the messages and adjusting a position of the advertisement when the first user scrolls through the messages. Multiple advertisements can be displayed proximate to the messages, and the advertisements are scrolled in response to scrolling of the messages.
- the portions of information can include information about the first user, information about other users present in the collaboration environment, information about a relationship between the first user and one or more other users present in the collaboration environment, information about a relationship between the other users present in the collaboration environment, or information about an ongoing collaboration.
- a time can be associated with each portion of information.
- a weight can be assigned to each portion of information based on the time associated with the portion of information. The weight assigned to each respective portion of information can be decreased over time.
- the weights of the portions of information can be adjusted based on whom the first user interacts with in the collaborative environment.
- the weight of a portion of information that is shared between the first and second users can be increased.
- the weight of the portion of information that is shared between the first and second users can be decreased.
- Portions of information related to other users whom the first user interacts with in the collaborative environment can be added to the user profile of the first user.
- portions of information related to the second user can be removed from the user profile of the first user.
- Different weights can be associated with a same portion of information for different applications used by the user.
- a first weight can be associated with the portion of information
- a second weight can be associated with the portion of information.
- a presence of a first user in a session of a collaborative environment is detected.

- the user profile can include portions of information about the first user.
- a weight can be associated with each of the portions of information.
- Identifying the advertisement can include identifying an advertisement based on the portions of information and associated weights.
- the advertisement can be updated based on information about the first user or the at least one other user that is collected during the session.
- a presence of a first user and a second user in an interactive session of a collaborative environment is detected.
- a first user profile having information about the first user and a second user profile having information about the second user are identified.
- An advertisement is identified based on the first and second user profiles, and the advertisement is shown to at least one of the first and second users.
- the advertisement can be updated based on information about at least one of the first and second users that is collected during the interactive session.
- an advertisement is displayed to the first user and the advertisement is refreshed at a rate based on a speed of exchange of information between the first user and another user.
- the collaborative environment can include an instant messaging interface, a web conferencing interface, an on-line calendar interface, a video conferencing interface, or a Voice-over-IP interface.
- New advertisements can be provided to the first user faster if the first user changes information with the other user at a faster rate. New advertisements can be provided to the first user faster if the first user responds to messages from the other user quicker.
- an advertisement is identified based on portions of information related to a user and time associated with the portions of information, in which information associated with different times are given different weights when identifying the advertisement.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. More recent information can be given more weight than older information when identifying the advertisement based on the portions of information.
- an application server provides a collaborative environment to enable users to interact with one another.
- a database includes user profiles having a plurality of portions of information related to a plurality of users, each user profile being associated with one of the users, and each portion of information having an associated weight.
- An ad server identifies an advertisement based on the portions of information related to a first user that is present in the collaborative environment and weights associated with the portions of information.
- the application server can include an instant messaging server, a web conferencing server, a video conferencing server, an Internet relay chat server, an e-mail server, a calendar server, or a Voice-over-IP server.
- the ad server can update the advertisement over time based on current information about the first user or at least one other user who interacts with the first user.
- the application server can include a messaging server, and the ad server can identify the advertisement based on the portions of information, the associated weights, and messages exchanged through the messaging server.
- a system in another aspect, includes means for identifying a user profile comprising portions of information related to a first user that is present in a collaborative environment that enables the first user to interact with at least one other user; means for associating a weight with each of the portions of information; means for identifying an advertisement based on the portions of information and associated weights; and means for displaying the identified advertisement to the first user.
- Advertisements that are more relevant to users' interests can be identified and presented to the users. Users can receive fresh advertisements based on real-time information, such as real-time chat or instant messaging content.

- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of an example general computer system.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a collaboration system 100 that provides several applications, including collaborative applications that allow users (e.g., 102 a , 102 b , 102 c , collectively referenced as 102 ) to collaborate with one anther, applications that enhance productivity of the users 102 , and applications that help the users 102 find and organize information.
- the system 100 establishes profiles of the users 102 based on information about the users 102 , including messages exchanged between the users 102 , and selects ads 116 based on profiles of the users 102 so that relevant and useful ads 116 can be delivered to the users 102 .
- the system 100 may include an instant messaging server 104 to allow users 102 to exchange instant messages, an Internet relay chat (IRC) server 106 to allow users 102 to conduct Internet chat, an e-mail server 108 to allow users 102 to send e-mail messages to one another, and a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) server 118 to allow users 102 to make phone calls or have video conferences over the Internet.
- a calendar server 110 allows users 102 to set up calendar events.
- a search server 112 allows users 102 to search for information.
- a web hosting server 120 hosts web pages (including web logs, or blogs) of the users 102 .
- a video server 126 delivers shared videos to the users 102 .
- An ad server 114 provides sponsored content (e.g., advertisements, also referred to as “ads” 116 ) to the users 102 .
- Two or more of the above servers can be combined into one server.
- the profiles of the users 102 can be established based on information that the users 102 provided to the collaboration system 100 , for example, when the users 102 registered for the services provided by the system 100 .
- the user profiles can also be established based on information (e.g., e-mail or instant messages, or calendar entries) gathered from or otherwise inferred about the users 102 while the users 102 access the services provided by the system 100 .
- the collaboration system 100 provides the user 102 with options of enabling or disabling gathering information to support advertisements.
- the system 100 may provide a user 102 a an option to decide whether and which type of messages (e.g., e-mails and instant messages) sent to the user 102 a and other users (e.g., 102 b and 102 c ) can be used to determine content (e.g., ads 116 ) delivered to the other users.
- a privacy policy can be provided to the users 102 to specify what information is gathered and how the information is used.
- the users 102 access the services of the collaboration system 100 through user agents 124 a , 124 b , and 124 c (collectively referenced as 124 ).
- the user agents 124 a - 124 c can be, for example, chat application programs, e-mails application programs, or VoIP application programs executing on personal computers, cell phones, and/or personal digital assistants, etc. While only three users 102 and their user agents 124 are shown in the figure, any number of users and user agents may be present.
- the collaboration system 100 stores information about the users 102 and documents associated with the users 102 in user profiles 300 .
- the user profiles 300 may store user personal information, such as user name, post office address, and e-mail address.
- the user profiles 300 may store messages and documents sent from the users 102 , including, e-mails, instant messages, and calendar entries.
- the user profiles 300 may include information about the statuses of the users 102 , such as presence information that indicates whether the user is on-line, off-line, away, or busy.
- the system 100 analyzes the user profiles 300 , selects relevant ads 116 , and delivers the ads 116 to the user agents 124 to be shown to the users 102 . While reference is made to delivering ads, other forms of content or services including other forms of sponsored content can be delivered.
- the users 102 are connected to the collaboration system 100 through a network 118 , which can be any type of connection suitable for information transfer, including a local area network, a wide area network, an intranet, an extranet, the Internet, or any combination thereof. It is to be understood that while one possible configuration of a collaboration system 100 is shown, other suitable configurations may also be used.
- an instant messaging service may involve the following participants:
- ads request refers generally to an ad client activity that causes one or more ads to be displayed.
- a user 102 can be a presentity principal or a watcher principal depending on, e.g., whether the user 102 is sending a message or receiving a message, respectively.
- the criteria for selecting ads 116 can be mainly based on the information related to the watcher principal since it is the watcher principal who is receiving and viewing information, including ads 116 .
- the watcher user agent used by the watcher principal can be, e.g., an instant messaging application, an e-mail application, or a web browser.
- the system 100 displays ads 116 to the left or right of instant message lines (the direction in which the user 102 writes the language may influence the choice of left or right).
- the corresponding ads 116 scroll along with the instant message lines.
- new ads 116 appear beside the new instant message lines. Scrolling through the instant message lines will also scroll through the corresponding ads 116 .
- the vertical size of the ads 116 may be one or more lines.
- the size of ads 116 are fixed (e.g., three lines per ad 116 ).
- different ads 116 can have different sizes.
- ads 116 can be displayed proximate (e.g., adjacent) to the instant message lines, but the movement of the ads 116 are independent of the movement of the message lines.
- each ad 116 can be displayed for a predetermined period of time, or for a period of time specified by the sponsor of the ad. This way, the ads 116 remain on the instant message window for a period of time after the users 102 have scrolled through the instant messages.
- Ads 116 can be displayed in the presence section of presence and instant messaging services.
- the presence section refers to the portion of the window that shows the name or identifier of the user 102 participating in the instant message.
- an ad 116 can appear beside a principal's name or between the principal's name and his status (e.g., active or inactive, on-line or off-line).
- An ad 116 can appear at the top, bottom, or side of the presence section.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 130 for selecting and displaying ads 116 to users 102 of the collaboration system 100 .
- the process 130 is shown from the perspective of a single user 102 , referred to as the principal user.
- the term “user profile” of a user 102 a generally refers to information associated with the user 102 a , including information provided to the collaboration system 100 when the user 102 a sets up an account, and information gathered by the system 100 as the user 102 a interacts with other users (e.g., 102 b and 102 c ).
- the term “user ad profile” 300 of the user 102 a may include the “user profile” of the user 102 a , the “user profiles” of other users (e.g., 102 b and 102 c ) who interact with the user 102 a , and information about the interaction between the user 102 a and the other users.
- a user ad profile 300 having information about the principal user 102 is established (e.g., by the collaboration system 100 ). Updates to the user ad profile 300 can be made in real time.
- the term “real time” means that the user ad profile 300 is updated in a short amount of time after events occur, so that the system 100 can target ads 116 based on the most current information, such as content of an instant message that the principal user 102 recently sent or received.
- the user ad profile 300 stores information about the principal user's current and previous activities, current and previous collaboration information, and similar information of other users 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 can change according to the presence or absence of other users 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 can include, e.g., e-mails, chat messages, blogs, web pages, calendar entries, and search histories (e.g., searches for web documents, video, music, and searches on social networking sites) that are associated with the principal user 102 . In some implementations, entire e-mails and documents, etc., are stored in the user ad profile 300 .
- the user ad profile 300 can include information about interactions between the media, e.g., e-mails leading to chats, information on current and past activities, geographic location of the principal user, and the local time of the principal user, to name a few examples.
- the user ad profile 300 can include data that are associated with other users whose presence information is available. Such data may include collaborative data, e.g., shared word processing documents, shared spreadsheets, joint calendar entries, and blogs associated with the other users.
- Different pieces of information can be given different weight. For example, documents (e.g., e-mail or instant messages) related to the collaborations with the principal user may be more relevant when selecting ads, and hence given greater weights.
- documents e.g., e-mail or instant messages
- a timestamp is associated with each piece of data in the user ad profile indicating its age, such as for example by the collaboration system 100 .
- the system 100 may assign different weights to data according to the timestamps. For example, for some types of information, a piece of information may be associated with weights that decrease over time. An older chat session may be less relevant than a more recent one. Different types of information may have weights that decrease at different rates. Weights for information obtained from chat messages may decrease at a faster rate than weights for information obtained from e-mail messages.
- Privacy settings of the users 102 can be checked before gathering information for purpose of establishing a watcher principal ad profile. For example, when the system 100 detects an e-mail sent to recipients other than the principal user, the collaboration system 100 checks the privacy settings of the other recipients (in addition to that of the principal user) to determine whether including the e-mail in the principal user's ad profile complies with the privacy requirements of the other recipients. If one of the recipients does not wish his information to be used for ad targeting, then the e-mail will not be included in the principal user's ad profile.
- the user ad profile 300 preserves the structure of data. For example, when an e-mail is added to the user ad profile 300 , the entire e-mail, including the e-mail subject line, e-mail tags or folders, and e-mail sender and recipient lists are preserved in the user ad profile 300 , and can later be used in the selection of ads 116 . Emoticons (or emotion icons), universal resource identifiers (URIs), and other data can also be preserved and used in the selection of ads 116 . For example, when chat messages are added to the user ad profile 300 , the names of users participating in the chat sessions and their local times can be preserved in the user ad profile 300 .
- the user ad profile 300 includes information about particular situations such as (1) the watcher principal just started using the instant messaging service so there is no previous data, (2) a presentity principal just started using the instant messaging service so there is no previous data, and (3) the watcher and the presentity principal have no previous communications.
- These situations differ from just lacking information because the absence of communication between two people when it was previously possible differs from the absence of communication when it was not previously possible because they were not participating in the system.
- each datum e.g., an e-mail or an instant text message
- a weight can be in the range of, e.g., 0.0 to 1.0 for one or more dimensions.
- the dimensions can include the datum's time, its source, and its collaboration relevance.
- the weights of various dimensions are later combined into a single numeric value in the range [0.0, 1.0].
- the aggregate weights for the important keywords in each datum are computed. For example, keyword weights can be determined using information processing techniques such as word and bigram frequency and statistical improbability.
- the weight of a datum can be the same regardless of its age.
- the weight of each datum can be assigned using a number of mathematical models for modeling the decrease in relevance (and therefore weight) over time. For example, more recent information can be weighted higher, and the weight may decrease over time according to a function. Relevance can be modeled as linearly degrading with past events given a lower weight. The slope of the decay can be based on how past data are valued—the greater the downward slope, the less important the past data are valued.
- Relevance can be modeled by more complicated functions. For example, relevance may be modeled as exponentially degrading using exponential decay, exponential distribution, or a forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus Curve), and choosing a constant according to how the valuation of the past is viewed. A smaller negative constant is used if past data is more valuable.
- Weight scales can vary, e.g., linear, exponential, logarithmic, or even binary. For example, a weight of 7 can be ten times more relevant than a weight of 6.
- Another weighting technique assumes that relevance may depend on how closely a datum correlates to the current interactive session in time and/or content.
- the weight of a piece of data can correspond to the correlation between the piece of data and the current interactive session, e.g., documents more relevant to the current chat session can be weighted higher. For example, if the current collaboration is an instant message chat with another user regarding a recent sports event, datum such as e-mails, web pages or past searches including the names of the teams involved may be more relevant.
- the correlations can be modified (e.g., by exponentiating the correlation values) to make more relevant documents weighted even higher.
- the system 100 can use a clustering algorithm to form clusters of documents that are related to the current interactive session, and documents with lower correlation to the current interactive session can be given a lower weight or discarded.
- Weighting can be based on the source or nature of the datum itself. Data from various sources can be given different weights in the range [0.0, 1.0]. For example, a chat datum might be considered more relevant than a calendar entry for an ad 116 to be delivered alongside a current chat, so the weight of the chat datum may be 0.8 while the weight of the calendar entry may be 0.3.
- Weighting may also be based on the users 102 involved in creating a datum. For example, in the context of instant messaging, when choosing an ad to be placed near a watcher principal's displayed presence information, a chat datum from a chat between the watcher principal W and a presentity principal P may be given a higher weight than a chat datum from a chat among the principal users W, P, C, and D, where C and D are other principals. In some examples, chat datum without principal P automatically gets zero weight.
- Weighting may also be based on the previous ad events in the user ad profile 300 . For example, a user may have never previously clicked on ads for dogs but has clicked on ads for dog food, so dog food ads will be given higher weights than ads for dogs.
- the weights for each of the datum dimensions under consideration can be combined into a single weight.
- the weights can be averaged, their product can be computed, or an L-2 norm (i.e., vector norm) of the weights can be computed.
- the weighted information is used to select relevant ads 116 from a collection of possible ads.
- the weighted information in various pieces of datum can be combined to produce a list of relevant words and weights, where a higher weight indicates more relevance to a current interactive session.
- keywords can be extracted from the pieces of datum using information processing techniques such as statistical improbable phrases and frequent words, bigrams, trigrams, and n-grams.
- a minimum weight threshold can be used so that words having weights less than the threshold are discarded.
- the set of all potential ads 116 is filtered to include just ads 116 with keywords having positive weights.
- the filtered set of ads 116 is ranked based on various criteria, e.g., bids and click-through rates.
- the weights of the keywords in each ad 116 can be incorporated in the ranking.
- the highest ranked ads 116 are delivered, e.g., to the principal user's agent 124 and presented to the principal user 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 may include information about interactions between the principal user 102 and other particular users 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 may store information showing that when the principal user 102 a communicates with users 102 b and 102 c , the topics of discussions are mostly related to computer games and movies, respectively.
- the system 100 detects that the principal user 102 a is in current interactive sessions with the user 102 b or 102 c , the selection of ads can be biased towards ads related to computer games or movies, respectively.
- the ad server 114 delivers the identified ads to the users 102 using a number of criteria.
- the ads 116 can be delivered to all watcher principals, a maximum number of ads 116 can be delivered to the watcher principals, or the number of ads 116 being delivered can be adaptively determined based on user agents' visibility areas.
- the system 100 does not deliver ads to the user 102 or chooses ads independently of the user 102 .
- step 140 of the process 130 chosen ads 116 are shown to the user 102 , e.g., via the user agent 124 .
- Ads 116 can be displayed in a number of places during various collaboration activities. The position and content of ads 116 displayed can depend on, e.g., the ongoing activity and the screen layout of the principal user agent.
- step 142 the displayed ads 116 are periodically refreshed to present new ads 116 .
- An interactive application can be executed for a long period of time, even when the user 102 is not actively using the application. For example, an instant messaging window can remain open on the user's chat agent 124 for a long period of time. This gives an opportunity to refresh advertisements displayed on the user agents 124 a - 124 c.
- the user agents 124 can issue new ad requests based on a set of criteria or policies.
- the policies can be based on chat content where a new ad request is generated after every new instant message.
- the policies can be based on chat rate, i.e., how frequently users exchange messages. For quicker chatters, ads 116 can be refreshed in a quicker fashion.
- policies specify that ads 116 be refreshed based on a presence and or status change for one or more of the users 102 . For example, a refresh may occur every time a user 102 (in the context of instant messaging, either a presentity principal or a watcher principal) comes online, goes off-line, or has a status change. Some implementations include policies that specify that ads 116 be refreshed based on a change to a user agent window (e.g., minimizing, closing, opening, and/or resizing a window of chat client).
- policies specify that ads 116 be refreshed based on changes in the position and grouping of presence information in the user agent. Some implementations of policies specify that ads 116 be refreshed based on time duration, e.g., ads are refreshed every predetermined period of time. Other policies specify that ads 116 be refreshed based on user local time. For example, the local time of the day can trigger refresh of ads, such as meals/movies-related advertisement (e.g., no breakfast ads after 11 am).
- the ad request can include various information.
- the ad request can include information about all currently visible ads, each ad being represented by a unique identifier.
- the ad request may include information about all currently visible ads and the most recent no-longer displaying ads.
- the user agent itself does not maintain state information.
- the ad server 114 maintains information on the state of the user agent 124 (which may have a unique ID) and triggers refreshing of ads according to the ad refresh policies and the state information.
- state information can indicate the presence or absence of principals, duration of interactions, which collaborative environments are being used by each principal, the activities occurring within each environment, and the activity rates within each environment.
- ads can be refreshed at a constant rate independent of principal activity, at a rate linear in the principal's activity, or at a rate based on the number of collaborative environments used in a predetermined past period of time.
- Ads can be refreshed when principals enter or leave the collaborative environment. For example, when a new principal arrives, a new ad can be shown. Ads can be refreshed after an ad click.
- ad duplication policies can include one or more of the following:
- FIG. 3 shows an example data structure for a user ad profile 300 associated with a principal user 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 includes principal user basic information 152 , such as name, address, gender, age, local time, etc.
- the user ad profile 300 may also include information 160 concerning other users 102 .
- the user ad profile 300 can include information about current activities 154 , such as current chat messages, current e-mail strings, current shared documents, and current search queries.
- the user ad profile 300 can include information about past activities 156 , such as previous chat messages, previous calendar entries, and previous e-mail strings.
- the user ad profile 300 can include saved shared documents, web pages and blogs created by the principal user.
- the user ad profile 300 can include searches histories (e.g., searches for web documents, video, music, social networking information).
- the user ad profile 300 may include, for example, information 158 about interactions between the various activities, such as e-mails leading to chats, chats leading to calendar entries or shared documents. Each piece of data may have a timestamp indicating its age.
- the user ad profile 300 can include information about previous ad events 159 , including ad impressions, clicks on ads, and conversions on ads. Each piece of data may have a timestamp indicating its occurrence.
- the user ad profile 300 can be dynamically updated.
- the user ad profile 300 can include saved shared documents, web pages and blogs created by the other users.
- the saved shared documents, web pages and blogs created by the other users can be removed from the user ad profile 300 associated with the principal user.
- the weights for those documents are increased.
- the documents associated with the other users are decreased. This way, in some implementations, the weights for documents associated with people whom the principal user communicates more often can be higher than documents associated with people whom the principal user communicates less often.
- FIG. 4 shows an example display for an instant message chat client 170 that includes a chat window 172 and a presence window 174 .
- the dimensions of various portions of the chat window 172 and presence window 174 can be adjusted based on content, and are only an example. Other sizes (relative or otherwise) are possible.
- the presence window 174 displays information about the users 102 who are participating in the interactive session, including their statuses (online, offline, busy, etc.).
- the chat window 172 allows the principal user 102 to send and receive instant massages to and from one or more of the other users 102 listed in the presence window 174 .
- Advertisements e.g., 176 and 178 can be displayed in the chat window 172 next to the instant message lines 180 .
- the ad 176 and 178 will correspondingly scroll (indicated by the dashed arrow).
- new ads (not shown in the figure) will appear.
- scrolling through instant message lines 180 will also scroll through the corresponding ads.
- An advertisement 182 can be displayed beside the instant message lines 180 and be independent of the scroll movement of the message lines.
- the ad 182 may be refreshed so that a new ad appears as the instant message lines 180 scroll, or the ad 182 may remain fixed for a period of time.
- Advertisements 184 a , 184 b , and 184 c can be displayed in the presence window 174 .
- the ads 184 a - 184 c may appear next to the user names and their corresponding statuses.
- the ads can be chosen based on the watcher principal and other users. For example, the same watcher principal may be chatting with another principal about a recent vacation, another principal about bicycles, and another principal about fishing. The ad next to each principal's presentity can reflect those interests: one concerning travel, one concerning cycling, and one concerning fishing, respectively. Since the watcher principal mentally associates the person with the topic, the corresponding ads are more likely to be effective.
- An ad 186 can be shown at the bottom of the presence window 174 . Ads can also appear elsewhere in the chat window 172 and the presence window 174 .
- the user ad profile 300 can include information on shared calendar entries and which calendars are displayed.
- ads 116 can be displayed in shared calendars having events that can be edited and viewed by multiple users 102 .
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a principle user's shared calendar 190 .
- ads e.g., 192 and 194
- An ad 200 can be displayed beside a list 202 of other user's calendars.
- one user's calendar may include an event related to a trip to a foreign country
- another user's calendar may include an event about a classical music concert
- another user's calendar may include an event related to a professional conference on a renewable energy technologies.
- the ad next to each principal's presentity can reflect those interests: one concerning travel, one concerning music, and one concerning renewable energy, respectively. Since the watcher principal mentally associates the user with the topic, the corresponding ads are more likely to be effective.
- Ads e.g., 204
- Ads can be displayed at other blank spaces near the calendar 190 .
- the selection and ranking of ads 116 for a particular calendar entry can be based on, for example, the calendar event and information about the people who are participating in the event.
- pieces of information in the user ad profile related to the people who are participating in the event or chose not to participate can be given more weight.
- pieces of information having timestamps closer in time to the event can be given more weight.
- an event 196 on January 8 th involves the principal user and user 1
- an event 198 on January 17 th involves the principal user, user 1, and user 2.
- information in the user ad profile 300 involving only the principle user and the user 1 could be weighted more heavily than data involving user 2 and other users.
- Information in the user profile data 300 having timestamps on or near January 8 th can be given more weight than data from other time periods.
- the collaborative system 100 can include a video sharing application that allows users 102 to share user-generated video with family and friends. Relevant sponsored content can be provided to viewers of the video based on the content of the video and information about the users viewing the video.
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a user interface of a shared video application 210 that allows users to share self-produced video in compliance with relevant copyright laws.
- a video 218 is shown in a video window 212 , and relevant ads 214 and 216 are selected based on information about the video 218 and the user ad profile 300 .
- the user ad profile 300 can include information about the current and past videos viewed by the user, such as the title, category, and description of the videos.
- the ads can be refreshed when the user watches another video, be refreshed periodically, or be refreshed after a period of time specified by metadata embedded in the ad.
- the user ad profile 300 that is used to assist selection of ads 102 while the principal user is viewing the video 218 includes information, for example, that is gathered by the collaborative system 100 when the principal user is using other applications, such as e-mail and instant messaging applications.
- the user ad profile 300 in the selection of ads, more relevant ads can be identified than using information about the video 218 alone.
- the user has the option of turning off the feature of gathering information for purpose of selecting sponsored content.
- the information in the user ad profile 300 can be given different weights depending on the current application being used by the principal user. For example, when the principal user is in a chat session with another user, and an instant message line (referred to as msg1) includes the title of a movie, the message line msg1 is a piece of information that is given a weight w1 and stored in the user ad profile 300 .
- the principal user uses the shared video application 210 to view a shared video 218 .
- the message line msg1 can be given a weight w2 when used in selecting ads to be shown alongside the video 218 , and the weight w2 can be different from w1.
- the principal user is chatting with a friend about a movie, he may be less interested in interrupting the chat session to view a movie trailer. However, when the principal user is viewing shared videos, he may be more interested in viewing the movie trailer.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of a user interface for a voice-over-IP application 220 that includes a presence window 222 for displaying presence information of users.
- the principal user can select one or more available users from a list of available users to engage in phone conversations.
- Voice recognition of the conversations can provide user profile information that is similar to the text information provided by instant messages.
- the recognized speech of the conversations can be added to the user ad profile 300 for use in selecting relevant ads.
- ads 224 a , 224 b , and 224 c can be displayed near the user status information 226 , and an ad 228 can be displayed at a blank space of the presence window 222 .
- the ads 224 a , 224 b , and 224 c can be selected based on information relevant to the users A, B, and C, respectively.
- the presence window 222 shows a message 230 indicating that the conversation is being processed to support display of ads.
- An option is provided to the user 102 to turn off this feature.
- a similar message is provided to all participants of the VoIP call to allow any participant to turn off use of the conversation in selecting ads.
