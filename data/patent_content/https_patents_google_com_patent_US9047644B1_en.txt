Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to methods, systems, and computer programs for providing contextual information to a user who has been added to another user's social graph.
- social networks have gained in popularity amongst internet users.
- Social networks enable users to hold representative accounts, and designate connections to other account holders, which may include friends or family members on the same social network. These connections determine a user's social graph, which defines the user and the others with whom the user is connected on the social network. Users can conduct a variety of activities based on their social graph, including sharing information and media with others, receiving updates from others, commenting on posted information, playing games, chatting, etc.
- a first user who wishes to add a second user to their social graph may send a request to the second user making their intentions known. The second user may then accept or reject/ignore the request from the first user.
- a mutual addition occurs wherein the second user is added to the first user's social graph and the first user is added to the second user's social graph as well.
- the addition of the second user to the first user's social graph does not necessarily require the reciprocal addition of the first user to the second user's social graph.
- the social graph addition mechanism can likewise be configured so that addition of the second user to the first user's social graph occurs without the reciprocal addition of the first user to the second user's social graph.
- Implementations of the present disclosure provide methods, systems, and computer programs for providing context regarding an addition to a social graph. It should be appreciated that the present disclosure can be implemented in numerous ways, e.g., a process, an apparatus, a system, a device or a method on a computer readable medium. Several implementations of the present disclosure are described below.
- a method for providing context regarding an addition to a social graph includes method operations of processing a request from a first user to add a second user to a social graph of the first user; determining a context that identified the second user to the first user, the context defined by an activity of the second user preceding the request to add the second user to the social graph of the first user; and generating a message for the second user describing the processed request and containing information based on the context that identified the second user to the first user.
- processing the request includes adding the second user to the social graph of the first user in response to receiving the request.
- the context defines an activity of the second user on a network-accessible property; and the message identifies the network-accessible property or the activity of the second user on the network-accessible property.
- the network-accessible property is an Internet website.
- the method includes determining activity of the first user from the network-accessible property to an event initiating the request to add the second user, the determined activity enabling the determination of the context.
- generating the message includes associating the message with a social networking account of the second user.
- the context defines one or more of a comment posted by the second user, a review posted by the second user, a location of the second user.
- the context is defined by an activity of the first user preceding the request to add the second user to the social graph of the first user.
- a non-transitory computer-readable medium having program instructions embodied thereon for providing context regarding an addition to a social graph.
- the program instructions include the following: program instructions for processing a request from a first user to add a second user to a social graph of the first user; program instructions for determining a context that identified the second user to the first user, the context defined by an activity of the second user preceding the request to add the second user to the social graph of the first user; and program instructions for generating a message for the second user describing the processed request and containing information based on the context that identified the second user to the first user.
- a system for providing context regarding an addition to a social graph includes a social graph editor configured to process a request from a first user to add a second user to a social graph of the first user.
- a context identification module is configured to determine a context that identified the second user to the first user, the context defined by an activity of the second user preceding the request to add the second user to the social graph of the first user.
- a notification module is configured to generate a message for the second user describing the processed request and containing information based on the context that identified the second user to the first user.
- Various implementations may provide for a primary user to add a secondary user to the primary user's social graph, and provide context of the addition to the secondary user via a message.
- the secondary user may not know the primary user apart from the event of the social graph addition, the secondary user can nonetheless understand the context of the social graph addition, and therefore gain an understanding of the primary user's motive or reasons for adding the secondary user to his/her social graph.
- the context may be defined to varying degrees of specificity, and may identify a property visited by the primary user, specific content defined by the secondary user with which the primary user interacted, etc. Accordingly, the secondary user can gain an understanding of what types of content cause primary users to add the secondary user to their social graphs.

- Users 124 interact with each other in the context of a social network, where users can include real people and entities.
- Each user has an account in the social network, and the account includes at least a user name.
- each account can include a profile of the user with additional information about the user, e.g., birth date, residence, favorite activities, etc. The user is in control of what information is added to the profile, and what information is shared with others.
- a user may access the social network through different devices, e.g., a smart phone 114 , a tablet computer 116 , a laptop 118 , a mobile phone 120 , a personal computer 122 , or any computing device that provides access to the Internet.
- the illustrated devices are only examples.
- social network server 106 delivers services that enable users to interface with each other.
- the social network provides a site that enables users to define user accounts, which can be accounts for people and entity accounts. Through those accounts, users are able to connect with their friends, group of friends, entities, groups of entities, etc.
- the relationships established in the social network may be utilized in other contexts.
- Processing server 102 can be configured to perform various additional functions related to the social network, e.g., executing applications which run within the social networking environment, or processing data relating to external sites which have integrated social functionality.
- Search server 104 provides Internet search capabilities.
- FIG. 1 is exemplary. Other implementations may utilize different servers, have the functionality of one server distributed over a plurality of servers, have the functionality of two or more servers combined into a single server, have a different amount of user categories in the social network, categorize users by different criteria, etc.
- the implementations illustrated in FIG. 1 should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting, but rather exemplary or illustrative.
- FIG. 2 broadly illustrates a process for providing context regarding an addition to a social graph, in accordance with some implementations.
- a social network 130 is provided, including user accounts 132 .
- Each user in the social network 130 has a social graph which defines that user's connections to other users.
- a user A and a user B both have accounts on the social network 130 .
- Initially user A and user B are unrelated in that neither user is in the other's social graph.
- property F, property G, and property H are various network-accessible/connected properties which may be visited or accessed by users over a network.
- Examples of network-accessible properties include websites, applications, apps, or other types of objects which are made accessible over a network or which communicate over a network to retrieve or send data or are otherwise connected to or reliant upon a network, e.g., the Internet.
- a property e.g., a website
- a mobile device e.g., a smart phone or tablet computer
- the properties F, G, and H are to be broadly construed as items which facilitate user interaction that enables the social functionality described herein.
- property F includes a social object 134
- property G includes a social object 136
- property H includes a social object 138 .
- a social object is an item integrated into a property which identifies a user having an account on the social network 130 .
- a social object is generally defined by an activity of a social network user who interacts on the property, for example by commenting or posting data. Examples of a social object include a comment, review, picture, video, or other item posted by a social network user that identifies the social network user.
- user B has visited each of the properties F, G, and H, and interacted with each of the respective social objects 134 , 136 , and 138 .
- social objects 134 , 136 , and 138 each identify the user B, who is a user with an account on the social network 130 .
- user A When user A visits one of the properties F, G, or H, user A may encounter the corresponding social object defined on that property that identifies user B, and so learn about user B's existence on the social network. Based on this discovery of user B, user A may proceed to add user B (or request to add user B) to user A's social graph. This will trigger a notification sent to user B via the social network 130 informing user B that he/she has been added to user A's social graph. However, if user B does not otherwise know of user A, then merely informing user B of the addition provides user B with no context as to how or why user A would add user B to their social graph.
- methods and systems as described herein provide for user B to be provided with context regarding user B's addition to user A's social graph.
- implementations are generally described with reference to the provision of context regarding addition of user B to user A's social graph.
- similar concepts and principles as are described herein can be applied to provide context regarding a request to add user B to user A's social graph which may precede an actual addition of user B to user A's social graph.
- user A visits property F, and views the social object 134 which identifies user B. Based on viewing user B's activity as evidenced by the social object 134 (e.g. reading a comment or review posted by user B), user A may become interested in user B and wish to add user B to user A's social graph. Thus, the user A may navigate from the property F to user B's profile page 140 on the social network. This may be accomplished through a link or reference provided in the social object 134 that enables user A to navigate to user B's profile page 140 . From user B's profile page 130 , user A may proceed to add user B to user A's social graph 144 , the addition being stored to user A's social network account 142 . In another implementation, the social object 134 may be configured to enable user A to add user B to user A's social graph 144 directly from the social object 134 .
- a notification 148 is generated and applied to user B's social networking account 146 .
- the notification 148 indicates that user B was added user A's social graph, and also provides context regarding the addition.
- the context provided may include information identifying the property F on which user A viewed the social object 134 .
- the context may further include identification of the specific social object 134 on the property F.
- the notification 148 may indicate that user A added user B after viewing user B's comment/review or other posted item on the property F.
- the generated notification 148 is associated with user B's social network account 146 .
- the notification is sent to user B via a message service 150 , e.g., an e-mail service, a mobile app notification service, etc.
- a message service 150 e.g., an e-mail service, a mobile app notification service, etc.
- user B is informed not only of the fact of the addition to user A's social graph, but also the context by which user A learned about user B's existence and from which user A effected the social graph addition.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a user making an addition to a social graph from a website, in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- the user A visits a website 160 .
- the website 160 includes content 162 , which can be any type of content communicable over the Internet or presentable via the website 160 , including text, graphic content, video content, audio content, interactive application content, etc.
- the website 160 includes a social widget 164 which enables a social functionality to be integrated in the website 160 .
- the social widget 164 is a plugin or application for the website that is executed alongside the rendering of the website to the user A.
- the social widget 164 communicates with the social network 130 to retrieve and send social data 166 .
- the social widget 164 may be a comments widget that enables social network users to generate comments relating to content presented on the website 160 .
- the comments from social network users are displayed by the social widget as part of the website 160 .
- Each comment may identify the social network user who generated that comment, and provide various options relating to that user or the user's comment, including a link to the user's social network profile page, an option to subscribe to the user or the specific comment, an option to indicate endorsement of the comment, an option to reply to the comment, and an option to add the user to the active visiting user's social graph (user A's social graph in the illustrated example).
- the comments widget can be configured to send comment data to the social network 130 for storage, and retrieve comment data from the social network 130 at the time of rendering of the website in order to present the comments associated with the content 162 to the visiting user.
- the social widget 164 may be an endorsement widget that enables social network users to indicate endorsement of the content 162 on the website 160 .
- the endorsement widget may enable the active user to see the names of other social network users who have endorsed the content 162 on the website 160 .
- each user name may be linked to the user's corresponding social network profile page, enabling the active user to navigate to the profile page of another user indicating endorsement to learn more information about the other user.
- the endorsement widget may also include an option to add a user to the active user's social graph directly from the website 160 .
- the social widget 164 may be configured to provide any type of functionality that may be associated with users of the social network 130 .
- the functionality of the social widget 164 may permit a social network user to define an activity that is associated with their user account, and which may be displayed by the social widget 164 on the website 160 , identifying the social network user to other users who visit the website.
- the data presented by the social widget 164 identifies user B to the user A. This is the result of user B's prior activity when visiting the website 160 , performing an action via the social widget, e.g., generating a comment or indicating endorsement, so as to generate social data 166 that is stored by the social network 130 . This social data 166 is later retrieved and presented by the social widget 164 when user A visits the website 160 , thus indicating to user A the activity of user B.
- the user A generates a request 168 to add user B to his social graph via the social widget 164 . The request is communicated to the social network 130 , which proceeds to process the request.
- the user B is added to user A's social graph 142 , and a message informing user B of the addition and providing the context of the addition, is associated with user B's account 146 as part of user B's messages 170 .
- the context can include identification of the website from which user A generated the request to add user B, as well as information about user B's activity on the website via the social widget which enabled user A to learn about user B's existence.

- an articles tab 396 which provides access to articles posted by the entity, etc.
- her activity on the entity's social network profile page can be determined, e.g. determining specific content that is accessed by the active user. After viewing content of the entity's social network page 330 , the active user may choose to add the entity to her social graph. Thus, the user will request to add the entity to her social graph, generating a request that is processed at operation 398 .
- the context of the social graph addition is identified based on the determined activity of the active user while visiting the entity's profile page.
- statistics associated with content on the entity's profile page are updated to reflect the social graph addition made by the active user.
- the statistics are reported to the entity in an appropriate manner.
- the entity may be added by many users and therefore it is impractical or undesirable to report each individual social graph addition and its context to the entity.
- the number of social graph additions over a specified time period for a particular context can be reported.
- reporting can detail specific numbers of social graph additions correlated to specific pieces of content accessed by users prior to generating requests to add the entity to their social graphs.
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example of providing context for a social graph addition, in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.
- a mobile device 360 is shown executing an app having an interface 362 .
- the app provides for identification of other users of the app (or service corresponding to the app) who are located nearby to the primary user operating the device 360 .
- the app interface 362 indicates the primary user's current position 363 on a map, and identifies a user “Ed” located nearby.
- the primary user may add Ed to his social graph, either directly from the current app, or perhaps via additional properties or pages.
- a message is generated to Ed, notifying Ed of the social graph addition and providing the context of the addition. In the present example, the message identifies that Ed was added to the primary user's social graph while he was at a particular location.
- FIG. 11 illustrates an example of providing context for a social graph addition, in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.
- the mobile device 360 is shown executing an app which enables a user to check in to an establishment, e.g. a restaurant or other business.
- the app interface 370 is displayed on the mobile device 360 , and may identify other users who have checked in to the same establishment, e.g. a user “Charlie” in the illustrated implementation.
- the active user may add the user Charlie to his or her social graph, either directly from the app or via other properties or pages.
- a message is generated and sent to Charlie, informing Charlie of the social graph addition by the active user and identifying that the addition occurred based on Charlie having checked in at the same establishment as the active user.
- a first user may discover a second user when browsing a page of a third user that identifies the second user (e.g., a social network page of the third user that displays or otherwise features members of the third user's social graph including the second user). If the first user adds the second user after viewing the page of the third user, a notification informing the second user of his/her addition to the first user's social graph may identify the context of the addition, referencing the page of the third user or the third user's social graph and the second user's inclusion therein.
- a notification informing the second user of his/her addition to the first user's social graph may identify the context of the addition, referencing the page of the third user or the third user's social graph and the second user's inclusion therein.
- the context of a social graph addition can include or involve any of various types of properties or activities related to one or both of a first user and a second user who adds the first user to their social graph.
- the specific level of granularity with which the context of a given social graph addition is provided can vary.
- the context may be determined to be a given website or property, or a specific page that is part of the website or property, or a specific piece of content within a particular page.
- the specific context can be determined based in part on the primary user's interactions with a page or with specific content presented on the page. In this manner, the context can be determined with greater specificity based on user interaction so as to provide additional contextual detail to the secondary user regarding their addition to the primary user's social graph.
- the primary user may be presented with options regarding the sending of messages identifying context of the social graph addition to the secondary user. Such options may be set before, during or after the social graph addition occurs. For example, in some implementations, an option may be provided to the primary user to determine whether or not to send contextual information as part of the notification sent to the secondary user following addition of the secondary user to the primary user's social graph. In this manner, the primary user may opt out of sending context information to the secondary user if they so choose. In some implementations, various options for providing specific types of information may be provided, e.g., whether to include website or property information, specific content identification, or other kinds of information in the notification.
- the primary user may be presented with options for selecting which of a plurality of contextual information types to be included in the notification sent to the secondary user. Such options may be especially useful in the situation where there are several possible contextual reasons for the primary user's interest in the secondary user, e.g., when there are multiple pieces of content on a given page or property. In some implementations, there may also be presented an option to include a personal note.
- FIG. 12 illustrates a view of a primary user's notifications on a social network, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure.
- a general message 380 indicates that several users on the social network have added the primary user to their social graphs. The specific users who have added the primary user to their social graphs are detailed below the general message 380 .
- the context of the social graph addition is provided. For example, the user Ben Jones is indicated as having added the primary user via a maps website. The user John Smith is indicated as having added the primary user via a video website. And the user Maggie Doe is indicated as having added the primary user via a tech website. Some users may not have a context indicated for their addition of the primary user to their social graphs.
