Abstract
In a hierarchical profile, each node represents at least one feature of behavioral data collected (300) about an entity (102) profiled, with the topmost node selected (306) as the "statistically most informative" feature of the data. A profile can cover numerous domains and be predictively very powerful in each domain. A number of observations can be "aggregated" (316) together into a single datapoint. In use, the structure of the profile is compared (402) against current information associated with the entity to produce (406) a recommendation or prediction. If the profile represents at least some data aggregation, then new observations (500) are folded (504a, 504b, 504c) into the profile based on statistical weights of the aggregations. Because of the way the profile is created and updated, its hierarchical structure maps the collected observations. Therefore, as new observations are incorporated, if the new observations change (600a) the profile's structure significantly, then it can be hypothesized (602) that something "interesting" has happened to the entity.
Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to personal computer, and more specifically, relate to filing (profile) computer user's behavior.
Background technology
For example, along with personal communication devices's (, cell phone) is developed to, support increasing function, people carry out the operation that surpasses call far away by these functions.As everyone knows, these equipment allow its user's access websites, the application of operation based on web now conventionally, for example, (to create media file, by using the camera on this equipment, take pictures or recorded video), and carry out downloads of media file from remote server (via the web interface of w that equipment is supported).In carrying out these movable processes, user generates the bulk information about its preference and behavior.Some in this information are clearly generated when user arranges preference in profile.Other information may imply, move the frequency of concrete application such as user.
Advertiser and other commercial entities recognize what kind of value is this information with hint of expressing have.(certainly, the entity except trade company is collected the behavioural information about the entity except potential customers, but this example performs well in promoting this discussion).When advertiser at " tradition " media (for example, magazine and TV) (for example seek in addition " new media ", on line and Information Mobile Service) when improving the validity of their advertising campaign, these advertisers may want to carry out personalization message for particular user.If the personalized real information based on about this user preferences and detest, so at least in theory, compares with the general message of tradition that everyone is broadcasted, this personalization message is more meaningful for user.For example, retailer can be by direct messages to the user who searches for actively the information of the similar commodity about selling with this retailer.This allows retailer to excavate to prepare the human needs of buying, rather than as in traditional approach blindly to only watching the people of TV or reading print media to send advertisement.
Some technology of having developed are collected customer information.For example, web browser is followed the trail of individual search conventionally, and searching request is reported to the trade company that the product that this people searching for can be provided.Common experience is, search for example when " snowblower " on webpage, and the pop-up advertisement of then only just seeing about snowblower for several seconds after initial ranging.Buying habit is also tracked in the checkout lanes in local grocery, and this information for offering this client by very specific reward voucher together with its receipt.The information of collecting is constantly fed to trade company, make these trade companies can their product of refinement, locate potential future market, advertisement be directed to possible candidate, managed inventory etc.
When the information of collecting about particular person, create this people's " profile ".From the angle of commercial entity, the information of thanks to delivering to personal profiles is more, and the specificity of this information is higher, better.In order to formulate better excitation, the provider of stream power transmission shadow may want to know that specific people likes seeing Western, but also wants to know that this people only watches Western after workaday late 9 after its child has fallen asleep.
This example starts hint may be for being collected into the bulk information of personal profiles.In order to control this bulk information, carefully create personal profiles.As everyone knows, each message sample can be depicted as the point in hyperspace.Dimension table in this space show data sample feature (for example, where is user when collecting this sample? is he much? what is his WKG working? he with who together?).Value along this feature of positional representation of dimension.The structure of the type makes to be relatively easy to " find out " in hyperspace and from those preferences individual's preference, to produce rationally recommendation results accurately.
Yet the various dimensions mode of this expression personal profiles has problems.The profile that existence obtains starts to consume a lot of possible feature of a large amount of storage spaces and a lot of values of those features, has produced only along with the increase of the data volume of collecting for concrete individual and cost and the maintenance issues increasing along with the increase of personal profiles number.For example, and traditional personal profiles may only have been contained people's a movable territory (, media consumption), makes this profile useless for the prediction outside this territory.In relevant development, even if these profiles may be very large, but from statistical angle, it is " quantity is very rare " normally, because it may only have some data points along any given dimension.This has seriously limited the predictive power of profile.
Summary of the invention
Above-mentioned consideration and the other problems of having solved of the present invention, is appreciated that the present invention by reference to this explanation, accompanying drawing and claim.The present invention collects behavioral data, and creates the level profile of entity.This profile can be thought of as the shape of a pine tree, and one of them node is in the highest preference level, and at each one or more node in lower level.Each node represents at least one feature of the behavioral data of collection, and wherein uppermost node is selected as the feature of " maximum fault information in statistics " of these data.More low-level node comes with descending sort based on its relative " quantity of information ".This level can be extended to more and more lower layer, until " containing criterion " is satisfied.For example, the behavior observation that this criterion can be set forth when the collection of specified quantitative is comprised in this profile or when this profile comprises the preference level of given number, and this profile is satisfied.
Collected behavior observation can comprise passive usage data, by this entity or preference, contextual information and the statistics clearly stated by certain other main body.The behavioral data of collecting can be filtered, and makes the profile obtaining contain individual domain.On the other hand, by comprise behavior observation as much as possible, can form contain a plurality of territories and due to based on a large amount of observations cause the very strong profile of predictive power in each territory.
The entity of profile is individual not necessarily.Can be group's (howsoever definition), corporate entity or or even the data entity (for example, a class film) that defined by Collection Rules.Use data analysis technique of the present invention, the in the situation that of given observed data set, some embodiment even can select optimal entity to file.
In some cases, a lot of behavior observations can be by " gatherings " one-tenth individual data point together.Individual node can represent a lot of features or the statistics gathering of behavior observation.Gathering may cause some loss of datas, but has the benefit of remarkable minimizing memory requirement.In other cases, keep all behavior observations.
In use, the hierarchical structure of profile is made comparisons with the current context that is associated with this entity (or other) information.Most probable process in the statistics that the structure of profile has directly caused will following in recommending, predict the outcome or shining upon behavior pattern for this entity.As mentioned above, if utilized from the data creation in a plurality of territories profile, so in the situation that a large amount of observed data of given this part about this entity and the consistance of specific action (by the weight analysis susceptible of proof in profile), it is in all that territory and may in some new territories, be even all useful.For example, even if there is not the observation to individual music preferences while driving, the music that common the done observation when music preferences that this profile can be based on when this people drive and this people drive is recommended in this people plays while driving.
When new behavior observation becomes available, this profile of continuous updating.If preserved all observations, this process for creating profile of can repeating so is initially to upgrade it.More what is interesting is, if existing profile represents at least some data gatherings (and therefore some loss of datas), can the statistical weight based on these gatherings new observation be called in to existing profile effectively so.This new observation can be so that this profile be assigned to the statistical weight of its node or even modifying in the ad hoc structure of its level.
Owing to creating and upgrading the mode of profile, the structure of this level is the figure of collected observation.This fact can be used in interesting mode: when new observation is made and is integrated into this profile, if new observation significantly changes the structure of this profile, can suppose so, the thing of " interesting " may occur this entity.Therefore the change that, detects profile can trigger such as sending advertisement or other notices to this entity or initiating the action of checking to the file of this entity.For example, if individual has observed recent more " upgrading " goods of having bought, this people's investment broker may call out this people to confirm whether its investment policy should be reconsidered so.

Embodiment
Forward accompanying drawing to, wherein, identical reference numbers designate similar elements, the present invention is shown in suitable environment and realizes.Following description is based on embodiments of the invention, and should not be understood to limit the invention to the optional embodiment to about clearly not describing herein.
Each aspect of the present invention can be put into practice in the representative communication environment 100 of Fig. 1.Its communication facilities 104 of user's 102 use is carried out various tasks, such as access websites 106, communicate by letter with friend 108, in order to work or application based on web of enjoyment operation, to do shopping and record health and fitness information.When carrying out these activities, user 102 generates the information of behavior, preference, health status and social contact about him.Some in this information are clearly generated when user 102 arranges preference in profile.Other information may imply, the frequency of moving concrete application or communicating with unique individual such as user 102.About user's action and other information of preference, can interact and generate by the user of the equipment the communication facilities 104 with except him.For example, his current location and speed can be found out and record in the GPS unit in his car.Set Top Box in user family (or head end of server top box) can recording user browse selection.
This information is significant to user 102 itself and much business and personal entity.For example, advertiser may like using this information, so that advertising campaign and user's 102 specific needs and preference adapt to.Restaurant storekeeper may wish to be recommended near those restaurants of route that user 102 often travels.This information can also be for recommending music, user 102 is play on communication facilities 104.
Fig. 2 shows the main intraware of representative communication device 104 (for example, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, panel computer or personal computer) or server 106.Interface 200 sending and receiving media in networking present, relevant information and download request.The operation of processor 202 opertaing devices 104,106, and particularly, support each aspect of the present invention as shown in Figures 3 to 6 hereinafter described.The user's (or custodian) of user interface 204 supports and equipment 104,106 interaction.The typical user interface of communication facilities 104 comprises display, keypad and other user input devices.This keypad can be physics or virtual, relates at the virtual key that touches screen display.Below will the concrete use of particular device to these assemblies be suitably discussed.
Fig. 3 presented according to each aspect of the present invention for create registration profile method.(it should be noted, the process flow diagram of Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 is mainly intended to support below to discuss.Under some embodiment and some situations, these in process flow diagram " step " are optional and can carry out with different orders, if carried out.) the method starts in the step 300 of Fig. 3 a, the behavioural information of wherein collecting the entity about filing.
As mentioned above, from clear and definite preference or the grade of experience of statement, almost any information may be used to the statistics and convergence (for example demographic information) of passive use and context data, observation and other data.As it is evident that from below discussing, the observation of carrying out and the type of observation are more, and the predictive ability of the level profile obtaining is just stronger.
In the past, behavioral data is filtered by context property conventionally, makes the profile obtaining only reflect the observation about viewing behavior.Archive file technology is important in some prior art, because when when sparsely covering a large amount of observation of very large context domain, and those technology very poor efficiency that becomes.Can be when this apply when the filtration of the type, for accepting observation from many contexts, this may be more useful.The structure of the level profile obtaining contributes to the sensing of observing from many different territories.
The word of " entity " about filing is suitable herein.The disclosure for simplicity, the entity of filing is considered to the user 102 of Fig. 1 conventionally.Yet the other types of these entities are possible or come in handy.The entity of filing can be body corporate, social networks or any definable lineup.The lineup of filing can define by shared context property (as normally used in advertisement).For advertiser, this grouping is more interesting than the profile based on single people, because with respect to any specific people about this group, about more observations of this group, is available.Therefore, the characteristic of this group (and behavior response) can be more accurate than one of any characteristic in its participant.This entity can also limit subset by the context of the observation about user, social networks or any people that can restriction group and limit, and for example, this entity can consist of given user, because he is only on weekdays or only when he is observed in car time.
In certain embodiments, this entity defines by search rule,, defines the rule what observed data is applicable to the entity that will be archived that is.Therefore, this entity itself can define by data collection process.Its useful application will below discussed about the step 320 of Fig. 3 b.
In step 302, in collected observation recognition feature." feature " be can assignment variable.For example, " when carrying out this observation, user where? " " feature " can there is the value of " in his car ", or more have quantity of information, " in the car on the working road at it in 250 miles of interstate highways ".Conventionally, single observation is the set of feature and value.Different observations will comprise the different value of different characteristic and these features.The challenge of most effective filing is when characteristic set significantly changes between difference is observed, to process observed data.It should be noted that when observing, " the feature rich degree " of some observations is subject to the restriction of available sensor.For example, this for example, near other people normally useful (, particularly when selecting the film that will watch) of identity of knowing when observing this user for example, but the social type of information that exists may be always not available.
" coverage criterion " for the level profile of constructing arranges alternatively in step 304.This will discuss in the step 312 of hereinafter with reference Fig. 3 b.
The needed computational analysis of level that builds profile really starts from step 306.The observed data set of feature to identification in step 302 is analyzed, the feature of tool quantity of information in identification statistics.Counting after this step allows it is known to those skilled in the art that, but simple example can contribute to illustrate current discussion.If created, be used for answering a question: " this user wears one-piece dress working conventionally? " profile, this feature " hair color " and " height " may not be to have very much quantity of information.This user's sex has more quantity of information by being expected, and this user's job specification is also.Yet in order to make result profile the most useful, it can not be created to answer the particular problem problem of a concrete class (or or even).Even if having this ubiquity, the known technology of counting can be used for step 306.
Use, from the selection feature of step 306, is selected the value of feature in step 308.Conventionally, in the statistics of the feature of selection, the value of tool quantity of information is selected herein.Another simple example should be helpful.Consider this inquiry: " what is the most probable hair color of user? " if during the feature of selecting " nationality ", by desired character " China ", " Japan ", " Kenya " and " Norway ", be to answer in the statistics of this inquiry tool quantity of information so, " U.S. " and " Australia " is not (due to four before, latter two country exists race's mixing greatly).
In statistics, in the selecteed situation of value of most important feature and this feature, in step 310, create the first preference level of level profile.The importance of the process of Fig. 3 starts in sight at least in part.(this when using complete profile Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 discussion in become clearer).Although used concrete inquiry to clarify some concepts in the discussion above, do not used these inquiries when creating this level.That is, level does not reflect and will be directed into the hypothesis in advance of the inquiry of the profile obtaining; On the contrary, level has reflected the profound aspect of observed data set itself.Therefore, the profile obtaining has been caught primary " implication " of the behavior observation in all territories, and is therefore answering from any territory or be useful in about cross-domain inquiry.And, by the hierarchical structure of profile " being taken root in " to the feature that has tool information in statistics, can carry out fast the comparison (discussion referring to ShiShimonoseki in conjunction with Fig. 4) for this profile, even if this profile has represented the observation that a large amount of numbers continues to increase.The in the situation that of being different in " implication " of behavioral data in same area not (or difference has surpassed the scope that statistical threshold allows), territory itself can be as other contextual features in profile.With which, " implication " in same area can not caught as required in profile.The processing that domain information is comprised to profile is can be in the observation of containing a plurality of territories processed or occur by the merged other processing of the profile from independent domains, when comprising domain information and relevant special domain profile, the feature (discussion that the Fig. 7 that vide infra is appended) of tool quantity of information in identification statistics.
In the step 312 of Fig. 3 b, check coverage criterion (if arranging) in the step 304 of Fig. 3 a.If coverage criterion is not satisfied, by turning back to the step 306 of Fig. 3 a, continue this process so, to create next preference level of the hierarchical structure of profile.In step 306, refer in the traversal for the first time of 312 circulation, select in statistics the feature of tool quantity of information.Now, select the feature of next tool quantity of information.By continuing by this way, the level of evolution starts picture one tree, and wherein each node represents to have the feature in the observed data set of less statistical information amount than the feature being located thereon.
More and more lower level is added in level, until coverage criterion is satisfied.A kind of possible coverage criterion is directly " to continue to know that all observations [collected in the step 300 of Fig. 3 a] are expressed in level.”。Yet, utilize very scattered data acquisition, this criterion may cause existing the rank of a large amount of more and more uncorrelated (not that is being, to have very much quantity of information) in level.Other possible coverage criterions are " continue until the observation of specified quantitative be expressed in level " and " continue until level has the rank of given number." more complicated coverage criterion analysis result profile when profile increases, then, when expectation other grades other interpolation has represented the gain of " predictive power " of the final profile under threshold value, stop this process.When level does not expand to each single observation feature of expression, all the other features can be added up gathers this profile.Therefore, this process is the distortion compression of act of execution data intelligently, guarantees in the statistics of observed data set that the feature of tool quantity of information is held.
Optional step 314 represents that the user 102 of filing may even have more quantity of information than the observed data about him of collecting.That is, he can add information to profile (for example, by regular at given Node configuration), and this makes profile have more predictability, but this point does not reflect in observed data set.
Optional step 316 represents conventionally a plurality of improvement of applying between the startup stage of profile (that is, in step 306 to 312 circulation), rather than at the end of this process.Analysis based on to data, the node in profile can represent the statistics gathering of collected behavioral data.For example, a plurality of observations can be added up and be combined, and represent this combination with profile, but not all independent observations.This makes it more available by dwindling profile size, but may have some data degradation.
And in step 316, statistical study can illustrate, two features of data acquisition are comparable, and it has significant multiplicity.Become a node (rather than allowing it to remain on independently in node) can increase the statistical power of these observation of characteristics these two Feature Combinations, and do not make its information observe in features by " dilution " at other.
Optional step 318 has emphasized that profile can create on an equipment, and then by all or part of another equipment that sends to for use.For example, the webserver 106 can be accessed the behavior observation of being collected by much equipment.Server 106 can have sufficient space and processing power, whole observations of its collection are included in very comprehensive level profile.Then, it can forward abstract profile, or the profile of optimizing for the decision-making at special domain or for special entity, for example, for having the equipment (, this user's communication facilities 104) of more limited performance.
In optional step 320, analysis and observation data acquisition, to attempt determining which entity should be archived.Conventionally, this entity is pre-selected, and collects the observation about this entity.Herein, observe and be collected and statistical study, to observe this data acquisition, whether point to the special entity under observation reflecting.When a large amount of observations are available, be particularly included in the observation of making in many territories, this data acquisition can disclose unknown so far entity.For example, comprehensively analysis can disclose the existence of social groups and people wherein.After extracting the knowledge of Liao Gai colony, can create profile to reflect the concrete interest of this colony.
In the situation that having produced level profile, Fig. 4 has presented the exemplary process of using this level profile.Fig. 4 a is that non-normal open is used, and for introducing some useful concepts.Fig. 4 b and Fig. 4 c are more specifically with detailed, show in some cases what can occur.
The method of Fig. 4 a starts from step 400, and wherein, stop criterion is optionally defined.The criterion of below discussing is relevant to step 404.
In step 402, collect the information about current context.Along with behavior observation enters the establishment of profile, current context by feature/value to forming.For example, context can comprise below three, and feature/it is right to be worth: (where? at me, opening on the car of working), (when? Monday Morning), (and who? my dog).It should be noted that many other features and value are possible, still under given context condition, this list will be subject to can be used for collecting the restriction of the sensor type of these data conventionally.Feature known in current context and value and level profile are made comparisons, from the topmost preference level of profile.(in the discussion of below Fig. 4 b and 4c by the details of this processing of considering to change along with the variation of profile context and coverage.)
The comparison of current context and level profile can not carried out step by step in step 404, until stop criterion is satisfied.For example, this stop criterion can show that this relatively continues, until all features of current context are satisfied, or until certain part in them is mated, or until reaches certain rank in this level profile.
In any case, under the condition of the information comprising in given current context, once relatively stop, the node reaching in level profile is of tool quantity of information.Based on this node, in step 406, perform an action.This moves, and for example, to user, recommends a first song, for example sends message, to user (, advertisement), predicts that this user may carry out certain action in the near future, and user behavior is categorized as to certain and moves, or the pattern of shining upon this user behavior.In some of these examples, the more performed action of the current context based on this entity and level profile is for this entity itself.Yet in some other examples, this entity of including profile in is not pointed in the action of execution.On the contrary, its may be directed to entity for filing interested someone (for example, advertiser), or attempt someone of the extensive social patterns of prediction.
Fig. 4 b presents the more specifically version of the conventional method of Fig. 4 a.In the method for Fig. 4 b, can find the coupling of " perfection " (or approaching enough).(this below integrating step 412 explain).This flow process starts from step 408, and wherein, stop criterion is set up.
Current context and level profile relatively start from step 410.Select the feature of the tool quantity of information of context.The tool quantity of information of its which feature do not specified in context itself.On the contrary, this information is from profile.Recall this profile and create from top to bottom, start from the feature of the tool statistical information amount of the behavioral data set (step 306 of Fig. 3 a) of collecting.This information is used now when checking the feature of current context.The example of considering Fig. 4 a, wherein, current context is: (where? in the car that I drive to work), (when? morning Monday), (and who? my dog).When task at hand is automatically selected and is presented media content to user 102, level profile check in three features that can show in current context tool quantity of information be " where? " feature.Clearly, when user 102 is driving, the media of selecting for user 102 should not comprise film.In step 412, find coupling should " where? " level profile in node.Although it should be noted that " where? " the feature of the tool quantity of information of current context, but the feature of the tool quantity of information of this profile not necessarily.This profile possibility, and conventionally will react than more feature contained in any specific context.
Step 412 is described as finding the node of the selection feature of coupling in current context above.Sometimes, there is Optimum Matching.In other cases, this coupling may not be optimum, but enough approaches (for example, in threshold value is set), for the method for Fig. 4 b.Even the type of coupling can not, so also can use the process of 4c.
In step 414, check stop criterion.Can apply the criterion of the same type of discussing in conjunction with the step of Fig. 4 a above.If stop criterion is not yet satisfied, this process turns back to step 410 so, and examines level profile under the node of selecting in step 412, until find the coupling for the feature of the tool quantity of information of the next one of current context.Continue the example presented above, should " when? " feature may not be to have so quantity of information (time in one day is not depended in user's taste), still " and who? " feature may be.The structure of level profile shows, and when user 102 is when being subject to any program, this user's dog is notorious Blues sleuth, and is impatient at the broadcast of at will listening to.Coupling " and who? " the node of feature finds in this profile.
In this example because all three features of current context be considered (in profile, two quilts mate, and " when? " owing to being left in the basket without quantity of information), so stop criterion is satisfied now.This flow process moves to step 416.
In step 416, the last matched node based in profile perform an action (in the step 406 at Fig. 4 a).In this example, stereo " Downhearted Blues (TM) " that starts to play Bessie Smith of automobile.
Fig. 4 c is another concrete example of conventional method shown in Fig. 4 a.This figure has presented may moving of may taking in the time cannot finding " perfection " coupling.
With the method for Fig. 4 a and 4b, start equally, by end condition is optionally set in step 418, the method for Fig. 4 c starts.In step 420, in the method at Fig. 4 b, the feature of the tool quantity of information of current context is mated one by one with the node in level profile.This continues in a looping fashion, until the feature of current context is considered to find " perfection " coupling with it.(if in step 420, until stop criterion finds perfect matching while being satisfied, so, in this, under concrete situation, the method for Fig. 4 c is identical with the method for Fig. 4 b).
When at present considering text feature and approaching distance between node most and be greater than the threshold value of discussing in conjunction with the step 412 of Fig. 4 b above in level profile, enter step 422.At this point, some actions are possible.In the first example, the node approaching most in the profile of the current text feature of considering is selected.The problem of this action is to find that nearest node may need a little time.In the second example, select to be found the first node in the current contextual feature Second Threshold of considering in profile.Although this may not be nearest may mating, can find its than nearest may mate faster.
In step 422, will take the 3rd may move, and finds the combination of node in level profile, and it is together close to the current contextual feature of considering.The structure of profile makes directly to find such node combination.
No matter at which " suboptimum " of step 422 application, move, in step 424, use " suboptimum " coupling, to carry out certain action, as the same in two previous examples of Fig. 4 a and 4b.
In certain embodiments, the use of " suboptimum " coupling can trigger other actions to the founder of level profile or user.Veteran user may be endowed confidence, and it measures the action of taking in step 424 under the imperfect condition of mating of current context and level profile is correct determinacy rank.By collecting other behavioural informations to strengthen profile, the founder of profile can respond this " suboptimum " matching condition, and may prevent the following needs that use " suboptimum " coupling.
Note, in practical embodiments, the method for Fig. 4 a, 4b and 4c can all be carried out with single, complicated flow process.For the ease of discussing, these methods are separated.
The level profile that shall also be noted that structure can be used by not needing to travel through the other mode of level.For example, except mating with context, the information in profile can be for retrieving the value for entity for given feature.Those skilled in the art will admit, for feature, specifically accesses, and traversal profile is only a kind of selection of access characteristic value.Such as the other technologies that create for the other index of profile, be many known, and need to be for the value of single features time, can provide fast access for entity.
Once level profile generates by the method for Fig. 3, conventionally can not keep static.Along with more observations become available, it can be for upgrading level profile.Fig. 5 has presented the method for doing like this.
The method starts from step 500, and now, more observation is collected.These can be the types identical (referring to the discussion of Fig. 3 a) with the observed data of using when first generating level profile.Also possibly, the observation of newtype becomes available, for example, and when disposing new sensor (hardware or software) or when user 102 brings into use new application or accesses new website.
The same with raw observation, new observation comprises that feature/it is right to be worth.These are identified in step 502.
New observation is analyzed and be fed to level in step 504a.There is the method for carrying out in some.If all raw observation data are retained, so new observation and older observation can be imported into individual data set.Then, then in the repetitive process of the creation method of Fig. 3, use this data acquisition.That is, existing level profile can be dropped simply, and then use available up to now all observed data generate one new.
(may be apparent but it should be noted, " available all observed data up to now " may be a kind of euphemistic expressions.Under many situations, observation is with timestamp, and the oldest observation may be no longer correlated with and be dropped owing to being filed the age of entity or the situation of change.Given observation can also be replaced by observation subsequently.When some observe in check or with other observation and comparisons, discovery is vacation or misleading.Therefore, to express be more accurately " all available observed data being not yet dropped because of certain reason up to now " to this phrase.
The in the situation that of given all existing datas, this straightforward procedure that re-creates profile may produce profile the most accurately, but this is normally infeasible.The first reason is that it depends on the fact that all observations have been saved.In the situation that observed data amount raises suddenly, preserve all possible infeasible, even for thering are a large amount of servers and storing the large-scale corporate entity in reservoir area.In the discussion in conjunction with the step 316 of Fig. 3 b above, this consideration has been proposed.Each observation can be aggregated in statistics, and then, each observation is dropped, and conventionally causes the preservation (in generating and use level profile process) of very large memory space and processing power.Therefore, the raw observation data acquisition of Fig. 3 a on the whole may be unrenewable in reanalysing.
Also possible that from newly re-creating level profile, from the angle of computational resource, may be, infeasible, even if all raw data are still available.Repeat to re-create profile and may take too many processing power, especially for the large profile with frequent updating.
Fortunately, in the situation that not re-created, level profile can be updated conventionally.Each new observation is compared with existing profile.When finding suitable position in profile, add new observation to existing structure.Sometimes, this only relates in the bottom of existing layer level structure and adds new node.Sometimes, the in the situation that of step 504b, only can comprise new observation by changing the statistical weight of suitable node.Thus, make existing node represent new observation with and any observation of having represented, weight has been given the importance of these observations.(also, referring to the above-mentioned discussion of the step 316 of Fig. 3 b, wherein, create for representing the new node of the polymerization of observed data.
Sometimes, new observation is different from the observation that existing level profile has represented.In this case, when by new observation and the comparison of existing profile, find new observation and be not easy to agree with existing structure.In step 504c, the structural change of level is to hold new observation.That is, existing node may change the sequence (referring to the discussion of the step 306 of Fig. 3 a) of its " statistical information amount ".Summation based on these observations, along with these nodes are moved to its new position, hierarchical structure is changed.Existing hierarchical structure has kept these to move common enough statistical informations that can be implemented, even if some raw observations are for reanalysing when no longer available.
The above-mentioned discussion of step 504b and 504c causes interesting possibility.If the interpolation of new observation has caused the marked change of profile hierarchical structure, so, about including some interesting thing of the entity of profile in, may change.This kind may be gone and be considered in the method for Fig. 6.
When method starts from and profile detected in step 600a and change.Conventionally, when new observation becomes available and utilizes the method for Fig. 5 to be added in profile, this change occurs.When old observation is no longer relevant and deleted, step 600a also can be punished, and deletes the variation that causes profile.(referring to the discussion of the step 504a of Fig. 5.)
Step 600b to 600e listed the profile that can detect in step 600a some specifically change.These structural factors are discussed in conjunction with Fig. 3 above.
The change detecting triggers the action in step 602.According to the character of the change detecting and amplitude, many possible actions are available.As simple example, if user 102 has started the website that snowblower is sold in access, can send so the snowblower advertisement of sponsor.Similarly, also can carry out health to user 102 recommends.The change detecting also can be included profile user's analysis in for this for upgrading.If the entity of filing is a stack of people, this change can be indicated new social phenomenon so: for example, utilize a large amount of people has been made to very a large amount of observations, a kind of transmission of disease is recognizable.
The discussion (referring to the step 310 of Fig. 3) that relates to territory has above improved single level profile and can cover the possibility that surpasses a territory.The observation of collecting from all territories by technology mentioned above in some cases, from the beginning produces cross-domain.
In other cases, more conveniently, first for this entity set-up profile independently, one, each territory profile, and then, by these independently profile merge.(for example, the collection of observation may be carried out in strict accordance with territory, and can be all in after independently profile is produced, and makes the decision-making that produces unified cross-domain profile.) Fig. 7 presented for merging the method for two level profiles that are pre-existing in.In the method, in step 700, select the feature of the first profile.(in the statistics of the first profile, the feature of tool quantity of information yes root node, therefore, starts normally significant from this node.Yet the method for Fig. 7 does not need this selection.)
In step 702, in the second profile, find comparable feature.In the simplest situation, from the feature of these two profiles, are identical (that is, they are " colored preferences ").More specifically, if two kinds of features differ in meaning, be less than threshold quantity, these two features are comparable.It should be noted that generally in step 702, comparable is these features; When judgement comparability, do not consider these specific occurrences.
In step 704, value that can comparative feature is compared.In the simplest situation, in two profiles that are pre-existing in, these values are identical.Then, the feature that has its value is copied in the merging profile producing simply.
Yet conventionally, the value of these features needs not to be identical, because entity need to be not in full accord in all territories.If it is different that these are worth, but in fact do not conflict, in step 706, these values are merged under this feature so, and the feature with its merging value is added in new profile.For example, when this is characterized as " color preference ", the value in a profile " is liked black " and " likes red " with value in another profile not conflicting, so can merge.
Sometimes, in fact the value in independent domains has conflict.This is no wonder in fact, because a people may like seeing a film at home, but only when driving, listens to the music.When finding conflict value in step 708, the copy of two features with their value is added to new profile.That is, these features are not done to merge.
The method of Fig. 7 shows and how to merge from two each features that are pre-existing in profile.It is apparent that and can expand to more features and Geng Duo profile.In limit range, all features of all profiles that are pre-existing in are processed, and if may, be integrated in new profile, and merge when infeasible when feature, only add in new profile.Can in new profile, the limit be set, to be not that all features of all profiles that are pre-existing in all need to be examined.
Step 710 has proposed important warning.When each level profile being pre-existing in is assumed that by above-mentioned technology establishment, the feature in each profile is how statistical information amount is arranged greatly according to them.This level need to be not identical in all territories, yet: feature may be in a territory quantity of information very large, but in another, quantity of information is very little.Therefore, the new profile creating may need to be reorganized, and makes its level react its all information that comprise now.Step 710 can be carried out after all each features are merged.It is also possible when these features are merged, carrying out this reorganization.In this case, consider " quantity of information " of selected feature, and step 704 is placed in the appropriate location of the level of new formation profile immediately to 708 input.
In some cases, the method for Fig. 7 can be replaced for new observation being added to the method for existing profile by given above.That is,, if enough raw observation data are available, the second profile can be regarded as adding to one group of new observation of existing the first profile so.(referring to above in conjunction with the discussion of Fig. 5.)
