- the present disclosure concerns wireless communications devices that support two-way communication. More particularly various inventive concepts and principles embodied in methods and apparatus for effectively identifying an initiation of a communication message, preferably asynchronous communications message, between two radios, such as portable wireless communication devices, even when a frequency mismatch exists between a receiver and a transmitter, are discussed.
- the wireless communications devices of particular interest are those using frequency shift keying and a frequency hopping protocol, although the inventive principles and concepts apply to various devices using various forms of modulation.
- inventive principles and combinations thereof are advantageously employed to use new and existing facilities within the wireless communication device so as to provide efficient identification of a preamble or specialized preamble message thereby minimizing power drain. This is accomplished while providing a frequency mismatch estimate for adjusting the communications device frequency to match the transmitter originating the transmissions.
- a wireless communication device 100 is able to receive a signal 102 from a fixed transmitter 104 as well as a signal 108 from another wireless communication device.
- the frequency of the received signal 102 , 108 is directly related to or determined by the frequency of a signal provided by a signal source to the transmitters of the wireless communications devices 104 , 106 . This frequency will likely be different from the frequency of a corresponding signal source in the receiver of the wireless communication device 100 .
- the difference between these two frequencies translated to the nominal channel frequency or the frequency that the signal on the channel is supposed to be at is called or referred to as the frequency mismatch between the transmitter and receiver.
- This frequency mismatch in part or in combination with other non-ideal characteristics in the wireless communication device can result in missed communications attempts.
- this frequency mismatch for carriers in the 900 MHz range can be as much as 9 KHz if both signal sources have a 5 part per million tolerance and this is typical for the wireless communication devices 100 , 106 .
- This large frequency offset particularly arises when the wireless communications devices 100 , 106 are engaged in talk around or direct communications as suggested by the signal 108 .
- the large frequency offset encountered in direct communications scenarios is further exacerbated since these communications are ordinarily entirely asynchronous. In asynchronous communications the receiver has no indication when the transmitter will attempt a communication.
- clock synchronization is not routinely available and the wireless communication device 100 must use a methodology to overcome any timing offsets between the respective clocks.
- the infrequent and unpredictable nature of direct communication makes it impractical to use synchronous communication methods, mainly due to the power drain on portable unit batteries to maintain frequency and timing synchronization.
- the burden of identifying a valid signal and correcting for frequency and timing mismatches falls on the receiver.
- the concern for battery life requires that special consideration is paid to minimize the length of time a wireless receiver must be active when detecting an asynchronous communication as well as minimizing the processing steps required to analyze an incoming signal for a message identifier that indicates an asynchronous communication attempt has been made.
- the wireless communication device 100 can be a typical cellular telephone or handset such as those available from manufacturers, such as Motorola.
- One such handset commonly referred to as the model i95, can advantageously utilize the principles and concepts when enhanced as described in the following disclosure.
- the essential elements of the transmitter of FIG. 2 can be used in both fixed transmitters 104 and portable wireless communication devices 106 .
- the transmitter 200 is common to communications infrastructure systems similar to Integrated Digital Enhanced Network equipment available from Motorola and utilized in networks operated by service providers, such as Nextel Communications. Alternatively, the transmitter 200 is included in a second portable wireless handset, wherein both handsets are configured to communicate directly with one another in a direct communication mode as noted above.
- the transmitter 200 comprises a signal generator 202 , a signal source 204 , a transmitter circuit 206 , a control circuit 208 , and an audio/data input 210 inter coupled as depicted.
- the transmitter circuit 206 includes a control circuit 208 that is coupled to and is capable of selecting whether audio/data from the audio/data input 210 or a preamble or preamble signal or message identifier generated by the signal generator 202 will be coupled to and transmitted or broadcast by the transmitter 200 .
- the block diagram is depicted in this fashion for clarity.
- the functions of certain entities such as the signal generator 202 , control circuit 208 and a portion of the audio/data input may be included along with others in a signal processor 212 .
- the control circuit 208 is coupled to and controls the signal source 204 to set the carrier frequency of the transmitter 200 .
- the signal processor 212 outputs I and Q digital signal pairs to drive the digital to analog (D/A) converters 214 , 216 .
- the analog outputs of the D/A converters 214 , 216 are combined in the mixers 218 , 220 with an injection signal from a local oscillator 222 .
- the local oscillator is coupled directly to a mixer 218 and through a phase shifter 224 that shifts the phase of the injection signal by ⁇ /2 radians to a mixer 220 .
- the outputs of the mixers 218 , 220 are added in a summing circuit 226 and the combined output is mixed onto or up converted to a radio frequency signal with a carrier frequency that is established by the signal source 204 .
- An RF filter 230 limits the sidebands and a final amplifier 232 increases the power of the modulated carrier for broadcast from an antenna 234 .
- the components in the transmitter 200 and operation thereof are well known and available, with the exception of the signal generator.
- the signal source 204 may be a fractional-N synthesizer.
- the mixers 218 , 220 , 228 , filter 230 , amplifier 232 , digital to analog converters, 214 , 216 , phase shifter 224 and summing circuit 226 are all commercially available and known in the art.
- the signal processor 212 is or may include a digital signal processor. Such a device, in an exemplary design may be one of several devices from manufacturers such as Motorola, Inc.
- the control circuit 208 and signal generator may be a standalone circuit, such as a commercially available field programmable gate array or, as mentioned above, may be included in the signal processor 212 and implemented in or facilitated by a software program.
- the signal generator 202 can be implemented in hardware using, for example, a field programmable gate array coupled to a system level clock (not shown) to provide the preamble signal according to the details provided below. Alternatively the preamble can be provided at least in part by the signal processor.
- the transmitter 200 is arranged to transmit a preamble signal to wake up target receivers where the transmitter 200 comprises the signal generator 202 for creating the preamble signal.
- the preamble signal comprises a data sequence that is periodic over a preamble period and repeated during a plurality of time periods or time slots.
- the transmitter 200 also comprises the signal source 204 that provides a signal that establishes the transmitter operating frequency as a unique and predetermined frequency during each of the plurality of time slots or periods.
- the transmitter further includes the transmitter circuit or apparatus 206 that is coupled and responsive to the signal source 204 to transmit the signal modulated by the preamble signal during the plurality of time periods.
- the transmitter 200 is an element of a two-way radio system. In one embodiment it may be a part of a standalone, fixed base unit 104 . In another embodiment the transmitter 200 can be part of a portable transceiver 106 arranged for direct portable-to-portable communications.
- the transmitter 200 and the herein described preamble signal are particularly applicable to systems using continuous-phase frequency shift key (CPFSK) modulation of a carrier signal.
- CPFSK continuous-phase frequency shift key
- this type of carrier can as here be used in frequency hopped systems where the frequency of the transmission or frequency of the carrier is changed to a different frequency in a succession of time slots, for example 64 time slots of 90 milliseconds each. Each time slot is used to transmit a coded signal.
- the first three slots are used to transmit the preamble signal with predetermined characteristics for use by a receiver 300 in detecting the presence of the transmission.
- the first three slots for transmitting the preamble signal are always on the same three predefined frequencies.
- the exemplary sequence of the preamble data transmission 402 shows the first three slots of data transmission.
- the first nominal 90 millisecond slot 404 is at frequency f 1
- a second nominal 90 millisecond transmission 406 is made at frequency f 2
- a third nominal 90 millisecond transmission 408 is made at frequency f 3 .
- the frequencies f 1 , f 2 , and f 3 are known by the transmitter 200 and by an exemplary receiver 300 .
- Third order diversity of the preamble detection system is achieved when the frequencies f 1 , f 2 , and f 3 are chosen to be sufficiently well spaced throughout the available frequencies in the set of frequencies or hop set. As is known if the frequencies are sufficiently different from each other cancellation of the signal at one frequency will not be correlated to cancellation at another due to multi-path interference. Another goal of transmitting on three frequencies in an exemplary system is that a receiver 300 monitoring the transmission will have at least one clear signal to analyze for the preamble. FIG. 4 will be explained further below.
- the choice of the preamble waveform or signal or modulation is particularly relevant in an exemplary embodiment.
- the data sequence of the preamble transmission is selected and then adjusted, if required, with a predetermined frequency offset so the preamble signal traverses an integer number of full periods and when using phase shift modulation preferably an integer multiple of 2 ⁇ radians over the preamble period.
- the modulation of the preamble transmission may be a data sequence comprising a tone or plurality of individual tones. The use of two or more tones in an exemplary design reduces the probability of falsely interpreting a spurious signal as a valid preamble signal.
- the data sequence may also be selected or chosen from a code set chosen to exhibit low cross-correlation with other codewords for both time offset and frequency offset.
- a code set comprising a non-binary cyclic Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code of odd length is such a code.
- BCH codes for coding data in a data transmission is common, but the use of such codes for modulation where the code does not represent data as such, but is useful as a preamble signal because of its low cross correlation is novel and especially advantageous.
- u is the transmitted symbol sequence.
- each element u i of the data sequence is contained in the symbol set u i ⁇ [1 ⁇ M,3 ⁇ M, . . . , M ⁇ 3, M ⁇ 1] Eq. 2 It is not required that the data symbol set follow this format, i.e., a non-uniform frequency deviation may be chosen.
- the phase of a continuous-phase FSK (CPFSK) signal at the end of the symbol period is given by
- h referred to as the modulation index
- T is the symbol interval.
- the preamble signal is generated by transmitting a known, length-N symbol sequence u 0 repeatedly through each of the predetermined preamble time slots.
- the change in phase over the duration of one N-symbol interval is
- FIG. 5 a transmitter signal pattern showing in more detail the FIG. 4 transmitter preamble slot and associated receiver sample collection timing will be covered in the context of the current discussion.
- An exemplary preamble time slot 500 is detailed to show a scenario in which a known preamble waveform that is periodic is transmitted repeatedly throughout the slot.
- This known preamble waveform denoted as s 0 (t) 502 has a duration of NT seconds, where T is the symbol duration, in seconds, and N is the preamble detection interval, in symbols.
- the receiver 300 wakes up and collects samples of the signal for at least an integer multiple of NT seconds, i.e., it collects at least one complete period of the preamble signal.
- the receiver 300 will be discussed in more detail in the discussion of FIG. 3 .
- the repeated transmission of the length-N preamble data sequence u 0 through a CPFSK modulator results, in a nominal embodiment, in a waveform with period NT. As will be discussed shortly, from a receiver signal processing point-of-view, it is desirable that the signal have period NT, as illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- the CPFSK signal can be forced to have period NT seconds by applying a small frequency offset to the preamble signal, so that a phase change of 2 ⁇ radians is attained over the course of the length-N data sequence.
- a phase change of 2 ⁇ radians is attained over the course of the length-N data sequence.
- an intentional frequency offset is applied equal to:
- a receiver 300 will be presented with a circular shift 504 of the transmitted preamble signal s 0 (t) 502 , as illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- a simple choice of the data sequence u 0 is a sequence of the same symbol repeated N times, resulting in a single-tone preamble signal. This is not a desirable choice, since any spurious tone, etc., may false the receiver, and incorrectly wake it from a power conservation mode.
- the choice of the symbol value D should be based on the hardware involved, and the frequency error that is expected.
- the symbol value D should be chosen to be small enough, so that the signal does not land in the transition band of the analog filters.
- the signal processing elements described below apply to a tone signal of single or multiple tones, or the BCH code set.
- the wireless receiver 300 is a component of the wireless communication devices 100 , 106 and is comprised of one or more components or elements that in practice can exhibit non-ideal characteristics such as frequency instability. These non-ideal characteristics arise from the statistical nature and variation of the components used in the construction of the wireless receiver 300 , environmental factors such as battery voltage level and temperature, and other unplanned interactions among elements of a real receiver.
- Frequency variation is often the result of the inherent variations of the components comprising and surrounding a signal source and other factors such as temperature and component changes with age. Frequency variation will cause a received signal to be shifted above or below an intended frequency. It is then necessary to mitigate the effects of the frequency variation when processing a received signal.
- Another impact of the wireless receiver 300 that must be overcome, particularly in the asynchronous environment is clock timing synchronization.
- the wireless receiver 300 is arranged for using or detecting the preamble signal as discussed above or a similar specialized preamble message and comprises a receiver 302 coupled to a sampler 304 for providing a plurality of received sample sequences to a controller 306 , normally including a digital signal processor (DSP).
- a preamble detector circuit 308 and power conservation circuit 310 may be standalone circuits or implemented as functions of the controller 306 .
- the preamble detector 308 operates as described below.
- the power conservation circuit 310 operates to reduce the power consumption of the wireless communication device 100 by removing or reducing the power to non-essential circuits or reducing their clock rate to correspondingly reduce their power consumption during periods of inactivity or reduced activity.
- the power conservation circuit 310 operates to reduce power usage when the wireless receiver 300 is only monitoring for a preamble signal or the wireless communication device 100 is in another low power mode.
- the controller 306 is coupled to a memory 314 comprising volatile and non-volatile memory.
- the receiver 302 receives a signal 316 comprising a preamble signal at antenna 318 .
- the received signal is shaped by a radio frequency filter 320 that operates to reject out of band energy of the received signal and this signal is then amplified by an RF amplifier 322 .
- the signal is further processed at a mixer 324 .
- a signal source 326 comprises a synthesizer 328 and voltage controller oscillator 330 .
- the synthesizer 328 is referenced to oscillator (not shown) that is typically specified to be stable within 5 ppm (parts per million).
- the synthesizer 328 controls the frequency of the voltage controller oscillator 330 to produce an injection signal 332 for combining with and down converting the received signal at the mixer 324 .
- the resulting intermediate frequency signal is shaped by an IF filter 334 .
- the signal is split and mixed to two base band signals.
- the frequency of the injection signal 332 may match or nearly match the received signal in the case of a zero intermediate frequency receiver or be deliberately offset an amount equal to an intermediate frequency, such as 13.7 megahertz. It is understood in the discussions below where the signal source is adjusted to allow the injection frequency to correct for a frequency mismatch with the received signal that it is in this context.
- a second oscillator 336 produces a second injection frequency which is provided in a 90 degree shifted version for mixing with the intermediate frequency signal at mixer 340 and an unshifted version for mixing with the intermediate frequency signal at mixer 342 .
- the resulting base band signals normally referred to as I and Q signals are filtered by base band filters 346 and 348 respectively.
- These outputs of the receiver 302 specifically the output signals from the base band filters are provided to the sampler 304 as depicted.
- the sampler comprises analog-to-digital converters 350 and 352 .
- the analog-to-digital converters produce I and Q outputs that are digital signals and that are coupled or sent to the preamble detector 308 and the controller 306 or just the controller 306 depending on the implementation configuration.
- the controller 306 is also coupled to or includes the memory 314 that is used for storing program instructions and configuration data 354 , algorithms, such as correlation routines 358 , as well as waveform samples 356 or information corresponding thereto that is used in the further processing of the received signal as well as a plurality of other routines that will be obvious to one of ordinary skill but that are not relevant for our purposes.
- the controller 306 is coupled to the signal source 326 and is operable to adjust the frequency of the signal source 326 by a control signal 360 .
- the structural elements of the wireless receiver 300 are generally known and available and may be modified to operate and function in accordance with the inventive principles and concepts disclosed herein.
- the signal source 326 may be, for example, a fractional-N synthesizer.
- the mixers 324 , 340 , 342 , filters 320 , 334 , 346 , 348 , amplifier 322 , oscillators 330 , 336 , phase shifter 338 , and analog-to-digital converters 350 , 352 are all commercially available and known in the art.
- the controller 306 is or includes a DSP, various devices are known and available from manufacturers such as Motorola, Inc.
- the memory 314 comprising volatile and non-volatile memory is also commercially available and known and may be included in total or part with the processor.
- the preamble detector 308 if implemented in software, will be implemented in or facilitated by the DSP or processor. When the preamble detector 308 is implemented in hardware a number of commercially available field programmable gate arrays or the like are suitable for performing the tasks, given the principles and concepts disclosed herein. Implementing a DSP task in logic hardware is known in the art and can be accomplished by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation given the discussion and explanations herein.
- the power conservation circuit 310 may be implemented by a commercially available field programmable gate array or in the DSP depending on the number of available controllable outputs on the DSP and the power reduction requirements of the circuitry under control.
- the wireless receiver 300 is arranged to detect a preamble signal, such as the preamble described above and to exit a standby low power mode or the like when the preamble is detected.
- the wireless receiver 300 comprises a receiver 302 for scanning, asynchronously and sequentially during a wakeup time, a plurality of predetermined frequencies for the preamble signal. Referring briefly to FIG. 4 , the representative receiver (Rx) sample timing 410 will be discussed.
- the receiver 302 collects three samples or sample sequences at time interval 412 , 414 , and 416 at the three predetermined preamble frequencies, in this case, labeled f 1 , f 2 , f 3 .
- the actual frequencies depend on the band of the receiver and the diversity considerations discussed above but can be experimentally determined given appropriate governmental regulations and the like.
- the receiver 302 may take these samples, for example for 2.5 milliseconds each, beginning at an unknown time relative to the beginning of the transmit cycle, as shown by the offset 420 . While the drawing is not to scale for readability it can be seen that if the receiver collected samples at exactly the same period as the transmitted slot, in this case 90 milliseconds, and the offset 420 was such that the sample sequences were taken during the transmission gap between frequencies, one or more of the sample sequences taken in time intervals 412 , 414 , 416 might be taken at a time when there was no transmission and the preamble signal would be missed.
- the receiver 302 sampling period is set to a slightly shifted rate, in this case every 80 milliseconds, so the subsequent sample periods are shifted from the transmission periods, that is 422 and 424 are closer to the beginning of the corresponding transmitter transmission period, helping to ensure that each of the preamble frequencies will be available to the receiver 302 in at least one of the transmission periods.
- the wireless receiver 300 also comprises the sampler 304 , coupled to the receiver 302 , for collecting a plurality of received sample sequences, with one received sample sequence collected at each of the plurality of predetermined frequencies.
- the 3 time periods 412 , 414 , 416 are each 2.5 milliseconds (ms) long and this corresponds to an integer number of periods of the preamble signal or waveform 502 .
- the received signal or preamble signal when present in the digital receiver embodiment is comprised of a sequence of samples, specifically I/Q sample pairs taken over the 2.5 ms window at a sampling rate of, preferably, 51,200 samples per second or 128 I/Q sample pairs in each 2.5 ms time period or observation interval.
- a received signal sample sequence is comprised of a multiplicity of samples of a received waveform or a received sample sequence that is collected over one of the 2.5 ms time periods.
- the wireless receiver 300 also comprises the controller 306 coupled to the receiver 302 and sampler 304 for performing a correlation based on stored routines 358 between data corresponding to the preamble signal stored in memory 356 and data corresponding to a received sample sequence to provide a correlation result and for comparing the correlation result to a threshold value, also stored in memory 314 to determine when the preamble signal has been detected.
- a power conservation circuit 310 coupled to the controller 306 operates to reduce the power consumption of the wireless receiver 300 until notified by the controller, specifically preamble detector, that the preamble signal has been detected.
- the sampler 304 is operable to collect one of the plurality of received sample sequences during each of the times 412 , 414 , 416 or for a predetermined time period, in an exemplary case 2.5 milliseconds.
- the preamble signal is periodic over an integer multiple of N symbols thus predetermined time period as shown above in the discussion related to Eq. 4 and Eq. 5.
- the controller 306 is operable to estimate a frequency offset between one of the received sample sequences and a nominal frequency of the signal source 326 by locating a peak of a correlation of a magnitude squared value of a Fast Fourier Transform of the received sample sequence and a magnitude squared value of a Fast Fourier Transform of an expected preamble signal where the expected preamble is stored in the memory 356 .
- This peak in the correlation results in or provides a frequency offset or estimate that can be used to adjust the received sample sequence according to the frequency offset to create an adjusted received sample. Then a a circular time-domain correlation between data corresponding to the preamble signal and the adjusted received sample sequence is calculated to provide the correlation result.
- the preamble detection algorithm or process works on a fixed number NN s of complex samples of the received signal, where N is the preamble period in symbols, and N s is the number of samples per symbol.
- NN s should be chosen to be a power-of-2, so that standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques can be employed.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- the controller 306 first computes a zero-padded FFT of the received signal or received sample sequence, and takes the magnitude-squared:
- the magnitude squared value of the expected preamble signal is pre-computed.
- the length of this template matches the zero-padded length of the received signal, 2NN s .
- the matched filter correlation in the frequency domain is computed:
- P s ′ ⁇ ( l ) P s ⁇ ( l ) ⁇ 0 ⁇ ⁇ if ⁇ ⁇ P s ⁇ ( l ) > ⁇ s if ⁇ ⁇ P s ⁇ ( l ) ⁇ ⁇ s Eq . ⁇ 11
- ⁇ s is a predetermined threshold value. While this dramatically decreases the number of computations, there is no noticeable degradation in the accuracy of the frequency offset estimate, especially for the case of the 2-tone preamble.
- the preamble signal is constructed at the transmitter 200 such that the received preamble signal exhibits a circular shift of the preamble signal with arbitrary starting phase as was noted above.
- the controller 306 using correlation routines 358 , performs a circular time-domain correlation between the data corresponding to the preamble signal, in this case a conjugate of ⁇ s 0,k ⁇ , and the adjusted received sample sequence ⁇ x k ⁇ to provide the correlation result. Both sequences are complex, so a brute-force computation would be computationally intensive.
- the use of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) may be used to reduce the complexity of the computation. Take a pre-computed DFT of the desired signal
- the correlation result is compared to metrics for the preamble signal using threshold tests.
- the controller 306 is operable to compare the correlation result to a first threshold value corresponding to a wide-band noise metric defined as:
- the normalization factor is defined as the relevant power in the received samples, accounting for the frequency offset of the received samples:
- the only requirement for threshold testing is: C 1 ⁇ 1 P n Eq. 19 where ⁇ 1 is a pre-determined threshold based on system implementation criteria and experimental results. The low cross correlation between undesired codes is relied upon to reduce false detections.
- the controller 306 is operable to compare the correlation result to a second threshold value corresponding to a narrowband noise metric when, for example, the preamble signal comprises a plurality of tones. This extra test reduces false detections on narrowband signals.
- a narrowband metric in such an embodiment may be:
- C 2 max l ⁇ L ⁇ (
- a transmitter 200 is arranged for sending a preamble signal as part of a transmission sequence 402 .
- the transmission sequence is divided into equal time slots where the signal at each time slot is broadcast at a different frequency.
- the identical preamble signal is broadcast during the first three 90 millisecond time slots 404 , 406 , 408 of a transmission at known frequencies f 1 , f 2 and f 3 .
- Other applications are easily envisioned where the duration of time slots vary and the number dedicated to the preamble may change based on frequency band, criticality of the message being sent and environmental considerations.

The Yes branch at 806 is taken and processing continues at 608 .
- Such adjustments and innovative combinations include but are not limited to: adjusting the preamble modulation to ensure periodicity over the proper time period and mod 2 ⁇ radians in a phase shift system such that a circular time-domain correlation can be applied for a minimum length of time in the receiver using a minimal received sample, zero-padding to achieve better frequency offset calculations and limiting the number of non-zero elements of data corresponding to the expected preamble signal to reduce the number of calculations required for frequency offset calculation. In this last example, calculations are reduced by as much as a factor of 13 in some representative embodiments.
- the use of a predetermined, restricted number of hop frequencies for preamble signal transmission further reduces the burden on the receiver and if chosen according to the environment, increases the system diversity with respect to preamble detection.
Abstract
Description
s(t,u)=exp[jφ(t,u)] Eq. 1
where u is the transmitted symbol sequence. For M-ary FSK, each element ui of the data sequence is contained in the symbol set
ui ∈[1−M,3−M, . . . , M−3, M−1] Eq. 2
It is not required that the data symbol set follow this format, i.e., a non-uniform frequency deviation may be chosen. In any case, the phase of a continuous-phase FSK (CPFSK) signal at the end of the symbol period is given by
where h is referred to as the modulation index, and T is the symbol interval. In this expression the assumption is that the preamble transmission begins at time t=0 and, without loss of generality, that the phase at time t=0 is zero radians.
For example, one embodiment may use an odd-length, M-ary sequence with h=1 that will have a phase change of φ(NT, u0)=π radians while any M-ary sequence with h=2 will have a phase change of φ(NT, u0)=2π radians.
u 0 =[+D+D+D+D−D−D−D−D] Eq. 6
which toggles between two tone frequencies. The choice of the symbol value D should be based on the hardware involved, and the frequency error that is expected. For example, if large local oscillator errors are expected, and an
This computation has a frequency resolution that is twice that of the standard non-zero-padded FFT, where the frequency resolution of the standard FFT or DFT is equal to the inverse of the observation interval or time period over which the sequence of samples are collected. Where this time period is 2.5 msec the standard resolution is 400 Hz and using the zero padded FFT this is improved to 200 Hz. It has been experimentally shown that doubling the frequency resolution to 2NNs points over the actual samples collected during the sampling period provides a dramatic performance improvement in the ad hoc frequency estimation.
The matched filter correlation in the frequency domain is computed:
where Lmax is chosen according to a pre-determined frequency offset range based on system parameters contributing to a expected maximum frequency offset. The frequency offset is then estimated as:
where the “fracargmax” denotes the fractional argument of l which maximizes Cf(l) or the peak of the correlation in Eq. 9. One simplification of the correlation in Equation 9 is available. The data corresponding to the preamble signal can be clipped to limit the number of non-zero elements thereby reducing the number of computations to estimate the frequency offset as follows:
where ηs is a predetermined threshold value. While this dramatically decreases the number of computations, there is no noticeable degradation in the accuracy of the frequency offset estimate, especially for the case of the 2-tone preamble.
x k =r k e −j{circumflex over (ω)} e k k=0,1, . . . , NsN−1 Eq. 12
A Fast Fourier Transform is used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform of the frequency corrected signal {xk}:
Thus, computing an inverse Discrete Fourier Transform of the product of a Discrete Fourier Transform of the adjusted received sample and a conjugate Discrete Fourier Transform of the data corresponding to the preamble signal gives the circular time-domain correlation of the two:
By insuring that the preamble signal is periodic over the proper time frame, it enables the use of a circular correlation over time, which is efficiently calculated using the DFT. The fact that the correlation may start on any point in the signal allows correlation of N symbols with the minimum receiver “on” time, reducing the battery requirements for preamble detection.
This metric is normalized by the power in the received samples. Using Parseval's relation:
the normalization factor is defined as the relevant power in the received samples, accounting for the frequency offset of the received samples:
If all the energy is used, the metrics get small when the signal-to-noise ratio is low so this allows use of a high threshold, avoiding problems in distinguishing undesired signals received at high signal-to-noise ratios.
C1≧η1Pn Eq. 19
where η1 is a pre-determined threshold based on system implementation criteria and experimental results. The low cross correlation between undesired codes is relied upon to reduce false detections.
where L is the relevant subset of the received signals frequency spectrum. Passing the narrowband metric requires that
C1≧η2C2 Eq. 21
where η2 is a second predetermined threshold that is implementation specific and based on system configuration and environmental factors.
