- I. Overview
- The subject technology provides a means for detecting the availability of sensitive or personal user information and for detecting the fraudulent use of such information. In certain aspects, the subject technology comprises a method for building a predictive model based on various types of user/customer information. In certain aspects, the predictive model can be based on user location information and/or information indicating the public availability of sensitive or personal user information, such as sensitive financial information (e.g., credit card or bank account numbers) and/or personal identification information.
- By way of example, a predictive user model can be constructed (and updated) based on historic and new/recent user information. Although the predictive model may incorporate various types of information for a particular user (or group of users), in certain aspects, the predictive model can include user location information indicating the most recent and/or historic physical locations of a user. For example, user location information may include information indicating the physical location of the user, such as, IP geo-location information inferred from the user's present or past online activity.
- The predictive model may also be based on an index search response that indicates the availability/unavailability of personal or sensitive user information on a publicly available computer database or network, such as the Internet. Personal user information may include a variety of personal or sensitive data about one or more users, such as sensitive financial information (e.g., credit card or bank account numbers) and/or personal identification information. By building a predictive model based on user location information and evaluating transaction events using an index search response, the user's commercial transactions can be evaluated to determine the likelihood of fraudulent activity.
- Transaction events determined to be at a high risk for fraud can be flagged and provided to the user via one or more online communication channels. For example, fraud alerts may be provided via email, text message alerts or information provided directly into an online stream or social media feed, etc.

As such, each of multiple users, for example, users associated with first, second and third user devices (102, 104 and 106). - Various types of information can be used to build and update
predictive model 116. In certain implementations,predictive model 116 will be based, at least in part, on user payment history information 112 and user location information 114. As used herein, “user payment information” can refer to various information or data related to purchases made by one or more users. For example, user payment information can include credit card or bank transaction information for purchases made by a particular user, including payment recipient information, payment amounts and/or transaction location, etc. User payment information can also include data regarding transactions for multiple users. - As used herein, “user location information” can refer to any information or data that can be used to identify the location of a user or a group of users. User location information 114 can comprise a variety of information indicating the physical location of a particular user, for example, geo-positioning system (GPS) data and/or location information inferred from transactions made at physical retail locations, etc.
- In some implementations, user payment history information 112 and user location information 114, can be received by
remote server 110 from first, second and third user devices (102, 104 and 106) associated with different users. Subsequently, received payment history information 112 and user location information 114 can be used to buildpredictive model 116 for one or more users, such as those associated with first, second and third user devices (102, 104 and 106). -
FIG. 1B illustrates a block diagram of an example system for implementingpredictive model 116 for a user associated withsecond user device 104. By way of example,predictive model 116 can be based on payment history information 112 and user location information 114 for the user associated withsecond user device 104. Subsequently, each payment transaction made by the user can be evaluated bypredictive model 116, for example, to determine the likelihood that the payment transaction is fraudulent. - In certain implementations, after being presented with a payment transaction,
predictive model 116 will return a numeric result indicating the determined likelihood of fraudulent payment activity. This result will then be compared to a threshold to determine whether or not the transaction is suspicion and the user should be alerted. In some implementations, payment transactions that have a low likelihood of being fraudulent (e.g., those significantly less than the threshold) will be completed without providing any notification to the user. Furthermore, non-suspect payment transactions may be used to updatepredictive model 116, for example, using a machine-learning technique. - Any type of information may be used to update
predictive model 116, or may be used bypredictive model 116 for evaluating a particular transaction. In some implementations, an index search response indicating the availability of personal information for a user may be used bypredictive model 116 to determine the likelihood that a particular transaction is fraudulent. - By way of example, a transaction for a user associated with
second user device 104 may be evaluated bypredictive model 116, concurrently with an index search response indicating that personal information for the user is not available on the public network (e.g., the Internet). Accordingly, the determined likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent may be relatively low, and no notice will be provided to the user. - In contrast, the same transaction event may be evaluated by
predictive model 116, with an index search response indicating that personal information for the user is available, for example, via one or more publicly accessible online resources. Accordingly, the likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent may be determined to be relatively high, and the user will be notified of the suspect transaction. - III. Example Processes for Evaluating Transaction Events

FIG. 2 illustrates anexample method 200, for implementing some aspects of the subject technology.Method 200 begins withblock 202 in which user location information is received. As discussed above, user location information can include various types of information indicating the location of a user. Furthermore, user location information can include information that may be used to infer the location, or an approximate location of the user. For example, user location information can include time and location information for a purchase made by a user at a physical store or retail establishment. - In certain aspects, user location information may include IP location information (or inferred IP location information) for Internet activity associated with a particular user, e.g., an authenticated user. For example, when the user is authenticated or signed into one or more online services (such as an email account, social networking service, etc.) location information for the user's current and/or past Internet usage may be received as user location information.
- In block 204, user payment history information is received. User payment history information can include various types of data related to the user's transaction history. By way of example, payment history information can include information related to products or product categories for items that have been purchased by the user. Payment history information may also include information regarding the frequency of recurring purchases or trends in user purchasing behavior, etc.
- In certain aspects, other types of information may be received. For example, (e.g., upon the user's consent and/or after proper notice) user demographic information may be received that includes demographic information for one or more users. By way of example, user demographic information can include various types of demographic information for a user.
- Although certain examples provided herein can describe a user's information being stored in memory, the user can delete the user information from memory. In example aspects, the user can adjust appropriate privacy settings to selectively limit the types of user information stored in memory, or select the memory in which the user information is stored (e.g., locally on the user's device as opposed to remotely on a server). In example aspects, the user information does not include and/or share the specific identification of the user (e.g., the user's name) unless otherwise specifically provided or directed by the user.
- In
block 206, a predictive model is built based on the user location information and the user payment history information received inblocks 202 and 204, described above. In certain implementations, the predictive model will be built and/or updated using machine learning techniques. As such, the predictive model may be continuously altered and/or updated as new or more accurate information becomes available. It is understood that any type of information (in addition to user location information and user payment history information) may be used to build and/or update the predictive model. For example, demographic information may be used to build and/or update the predictive model. - In some implementations, an index search response may also be used to build, tune and/or update the predictive model. As described above, an index search response can comprise an indication as to whether or not sensitive and/or private user information is publicly accessible, for example, via the Internet. By way of example, if a user's credit card information were to become available on a publicly accessible database or website, the index search response can indicate that sensitive or private user information was available on the Internet.
- In block 208, user status information is received in addition to a transaction event. User status information can comprise an indication as to a status of the user. By way of example, user status information may be generated as a result of the user logging into one or more online accounts or resources, such as an email account or social networking service. As such, user status information can include any type of information regarding a user's status, including but not limited to indications as to the user's current location and/or activities.
- The received transaction event will include information related to one or more monetary transactions of the user. Transaction events may comprise information regarding a recent purchase made by the user, such as credit card purchases. Transaction events may also comprise information related to the movement or transfer of funds by the user, for example, the transfer of funds from one electronic account into another. By way of example, a transaction event may be generated each time a user makes a purchase, or moves funds from one account into another.
- In block 210, the transaction event is evaluated using the predictive model to determine a likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent. The evaluation of a transaction event can be made using various types of information in addition to user location information, user payment history information, user status information and/or an index search response.
- The evaluation of the transaction event using the predictive model may result in a quantifiable indication of the likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent. For example, the result of the evaluation of the transaction event using the predictive model may produce a numeric quantity such an integer or real number value. In certain aspects, the result of the evaluation may include multiple numeric values, such as a vector quantity.
- The result of the evaluation of the transaction event can be compared to a threshold for determining the likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent. In certain aspects, if the result of the evaluation exceeds the threshold, the occurrence of the transaction event will be flagged as potentially fraudulent. Depending on implementation, different actions may be triggered by the detection of a potentially fraudulent transaction event. For example, the detection of a potentially fraudulent transaction event can cause a notification to be sent to the user, e.g., via email, text message or notification delivery to a social networking service.

In example aspects, the user can adjust appropriate privacy settings to selectively limit the types of user information stored in memory, or select the memory in which the user information is stored (e.g., locally on the user's device as opposed to remotely on a server). In example aspects, the user information does not include and/or share the specific identification of the user (e.g., the user's name) unless otherwise specifically provided or directed by the user.
- In certain aspects, server 310 (either alone, or in conjunction with one or more processor based systems) may be configured to perform operations for receiving an index search response indicating the availability of user information on a computer network, wherein evaluating the transaction event is also based on the index search response. Furthermore,
server 310 can be configured to send a notification to a user if the likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent exceeds a threshold. - V. Example Systems for Evaluating Transaction Events Using a Predictive

Although the system memory can be either volatile or non-volatile, in some examples thesystem memory 404 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as a random access memory.System memory 404 can store some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. - In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored in
system memory 404,permanent storage device 402,ROM 410 and/or one or more memory locations embedded with processor(s) 412. From these various memory units, processor(s) 412 retrieve instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations of the instant disclosure. -
Bus 408 also connects to theinput device interface 414 andoutput device interface 406.Input device interface 414 enables a user to communicate information and select commands toelectronic system 400. Input devices used withinput device interface 414 may include for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”) and/or wireless devices such as wireless keyboards, wireless pointing devices, etc. - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 4 ,bus 408 also communicatively coupleselectronic system 400 to a network (not shown) throughnetwork interface 416. It should be understood thatnetwork interface 416 can be either wired, optical or wireless and may comprise one or more antennas and transceivers. In this manner,electronic system 400 can be a part of a network of computers, such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or a network of networks, such as the Internet (e.g., thenetwork 308, as discussed above). - Certain aspects of the subject technology can be carried out by
electronic system 400. In some aspects, instructions for performing one or more processes of the present disclosure will be stored on one or more memory devices such as thestorage 402 and/or thesystem memory 404. - As such,
electronic system 400 can be used for detecting a fraudulent payment transaction. For example,processors 412 can be configured to perform operations including receiving demographic information for a user, receiving user location information,receiving user payment history information and building a predictive model, for a user, based on the demographic inforamation, the user location information and the user payment history information. In certain aspects,processors 412 may be further configured to perform operations for receiving user status information in addition to a transaction event and evaluating the transaction event using the user status information and the predictive model to determine a likelihood that the transaction event is fraudulent. - In this specification, the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
