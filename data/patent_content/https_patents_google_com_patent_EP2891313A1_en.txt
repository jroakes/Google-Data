Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to social media services and content programming viewable via television or online.
- Users of social media services may create posts that correspond to, e.g., television or internet-based shows that they are watching, particularly with the rise of more television content that is directly or exclusively available online.
- a user may be watching a television program, for example, and upon hearing a particularly interesting piece of dialogue or watching a particularly memorable or notable moment, may post a message or status update on a social media service quoting the dialogue or summarizing the moment.
- there may not be a convenient way to organize social media messages or status updates pertaining to television or internet-based shows.
- content discovery across many sites that broadcast media programs may be difficult because no single web site has all the content.
- a computerized method, system for, and computer-readable medium operable to retrieve program details data about at least one media program.
- each of the at least one media program with at least one micropost comprises a link to the original social media page hosting the social media post and a video deeplink that plays a time off-set video, the time off-set video comprising video from the at least one media program starting from the stored time offset data.
- FIG. 1 A is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. IB is one component of the block diagram in FIG. 1 A in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of a display showing an example web page, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is an example process for analyzing and organizing social media to discover the most interesting content and conveniently providing it to a user, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4A is an example illustration of content showing social media organized by a social media tool on a website, for example, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4B is another example illustration of content showing social media organized by the social media tool on a website, for example, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is another example process for analyzing and organizing social media to discover the most interesting content and conveniently providing it to a user, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- social media activity may be analyzed and organized in order to aid in the discovery of content, and also used to provide deep-links (for example video deeplinks) into the most interesting moments so as to make those moments "watchable" for helping users decide what to watch.
- social media activity may refer to posts, messages and other status updates made on various social media programs or websites, either via a computer or a phone.
- Deeplinks may refer to a link to a media source where a program may be viewed over the internet or demand, and may be played back beginning at a particular time index.
- the most interesting moments may correspond to the number of social media posts pertaining to a particular moment in a media program.
- a tool that analyzes social media to identify a quotation from a media program such as a television series, an online-based web series, a podcast, or other broadcast media program, herein referred to as a program, television program, show or television show for simplicity.
- Users of social media services may create posts that correspond to, e.g., programs that they are watching.
- a user may be watching a program and, upon hearing a particularly interesting piece of dialogue, post a message on a social media service quoting the dialogue or summarizing a portion of the program.
- the analysis tool in turn, can monitor social media services for new messages, posts or activity as they are published.
- the analysis tool can then identify that the quote corresponds to dialogue from the television program by matching the quotation to caption or subtitle information corresponding to a transcript of the program.
- the caption or subtitle information also includes time index information. Using the time index information, a match against a particular section of the program transcript can be used to determine a time index into the television program corresponding to the quoted dialogue matched from the user's social media post.
- the analysis tool can use the time index into the television program to generate a "deeplink.”
- a deeplink links to a media source where the television program, for instance, may be viewed over the internet on demand.
- the deeplink may be configured such that, when followed, it causes the selected portion of the television program to be played back on demand, beginning at a time index into the program corresponding to the quotation.
- a deeplink may be provided, e.g., to portions of the program that are determined to be especially interesting. The relative interest of viewers in portions of the program may be determined by analyzing the social media data that is collected.
- the system may include all, some of, or combinations of: a program details importer, a related micropost importer, a quote detector, an offset deeplink calculator, a program ranker, a frontend and an user interface.
- a process may use any, all, some or combinations of the above components in any order in order to analyze and organize social media to discover the most interesting content and providing it to a user in a convenient fashion, such as through a simple-to-use user interface on a webpage or other display.

For example, social media analysis tool 104 may determine the strength of association between the set and a particular signal using a point-wise mutual information (PMI) score, a Hamming distance analysis, a term- frequency inverse- document-frequency (TF-IDF) score, a mutual information score, a Kullback-Leibler divergence score, any other statistical measure of association, or combinations thereof.
- PMI point-wise mutual information
- TF-IDF term- frequency inverse- document-frequency
- social media analysis tool 104 may find a way to rank programs or television shows by popularity based on the activity of the set of one or more user identifiers, and an analysis of a wide set of user identifiers. For example, the set of user identifiers that watches television at a particular time of the week. Based on this analysis, the social media analysis tool 104 may select relevant content for client 102 that would most likely be the content that client 102 would wish to watch.
- Relevant content may be provided to client 102 by content sources 108, 110 or social media analysis tool 104.
- social media analysis tool 104 may select relevant content from content source 110 to be included with a web page served by content source 108.
- social media analysis tool 104 may provide the selected content to client 102, via a deep link or video deep link.
- social media analysis tool 104 may select content stored in memory 114 of client 102. For example, previously provided content may be cached in memory 114, content may be preloaded into memory 114 (e.g., as part of the installation of an application), or may exist as part of the operating system of client 102. In such a case, social media analysis tool 104 may provide an indication of the selection to client 102.

- FIG. 3 is an example process for analyzing and organizing social media to discover the most interesting content and conveniently providing it to a user, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- process 300 is a process in which the social media analysis tool of the present disclosure can be used to analyze and organize social media to discover the most interesting content and conveniently provide it to a user.
- the program details importer is executed.
- the program details importer is responsible for importing, for example: (a) the airing times (e.g., schedule) of all programs (online-based web series programs, television programs and similar broadcast programs), (b) links to program pages where they can be watched on-demand or online, (c) the subtitles for the programs, and (d) optionally other metadata for the program, such as, for example, the cast list, official hashtags or social media service usernames or identifiers for the program.
- This data may be typically acquired by parsing the web sites of TV/program broadcasters.
- the pipeline of the program details importer is run periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes or another predetermined time period) in order to import the details of all the new programs shortly after they become available to watch online.
- the program details importer outputs and stores the program's airing times, a link to the on-demand version of the program, subtitles, other metadata and possibly more. Note that the subtitles may be time stamped with the
- subtitles may be additionally acquired from the live airing of a program using a digital TV tuner connected to a server that is running software capable of parsing closed caption/subtitle information transmitted within the TV signal.
- closed captions are transmitted as defined by standards EIA-608 and CEA-708, for example, and in Europe they are transmitted as defined by standards ETSI EN 300 743 and ETSI EN 300 472, for example.
- EPG electronic program guide
- XML extensible markup language
- FTP file transfer protocol
- the related micropost importer is executed.
- the related micropost importer may be executed once for each new program found by the above-described program details importer.
- the related micropost importer may be responsible for importing all microposts (or posts, messages, status updates from social media services) that are likely to be about a program, e.g., television show.
- a micropost is about a program when, for example: (a) the micropost was posted during the live airing of a program (as well as +/- N minutes before and after the program, N being determined by case studies and is a predetermined value that may be changed) and (b) the micropost includes a reference to the program name, a character name from the program, an actor name, an official social media service account of the program, an official hashtag or other social media identifier for the program and so on.
- the related micropost importer also outputs and stores all social media microposts that are likely to be about a given program.
- the quote detector is executed.
- the quote detector may be executed once after the related micropost importer is executed for each program.
- the quote detector is responsible for matching a program's microposts against the program's subtitles in order to find the subset of microposts containing "quoted moments" or moments that are actually quoted, spoken or that occur in a program.
- a micropost is considered to contain a quote from a program when X consecutive words from the micropost match X consecutive words from the subtitles or other caption/script data of the program. X may be determined by an algorithm, case studies and is a predetermined value that may also be changed.
- X also may be adjusted according to the variation of subtitles not exactly matching the microposts, or the microposts paraphrasing the content of the subtitles and not exactly matching every single word. For instance, a match could still occur with X consecutive words if every second, third or fourth word there is a match, or if words from the micropost sound or look similar (or contain substantially the same letters) as words from the transcript or subtitle/caption data.
- a match could still occur with X consecutive words if every second, third or fourth word there is a match, or if words from the micropost sound or look similar (or contain substantially the same letters) as words from the transcript or subtitle/caption data.
- There are a variety of alternate approaches to matching that may not involve matching X consecutive words such as overall qualitative comparisons, boolean analysis or any other similar approach. For example, case-insensitive-but-exact matches between the micropost words and the subtitle/caption/script words may be used.
- a Hamming distance analysis or a low Hamming distance between words may be looked at instead of looking for exact matches, wherein the Hamming distance between two strings of more or less equal length may be the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols may be different, or a measurement of the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other or the number of errors that transformed one string to the other.
- X may be a number like 5 for word sequences that include "stop-words" (e.g., the, is, at, which, on), or a lower number like 3, for word sequences of uncommon words (words that are not common "stop-words" and that may be unique to a particular program).
- the quote detector outputs and stores all social media microposts that contain quoted moments as well as a reference to the matching sequence of words in subtitles/caption/scripts that contain the quoted moment.
- subtitles/caption/scripts may be XML, or stored in a particular type of language.
- a time period may be chosen (such as 10 seconds) to perform a detailed comparison.
- the closeness, frequency of subtitles may be used to indicate a conversation for matching purposes.
- the color or formatting of subtitles could be used for matching purposes, the colors or formatting usually indicating a particular type of scene or moment.
- the above-described quote detector may not even be looking for matches in quotes but instead may be looking for matches in subject matter or content, e.g., if the micropost simply describes a summary of what occurred, the quote detector could use its algorithms to find generally what area of the program the summary corresponds to, based on the subtitle/caption data, the actors in the scene, or other time code information that would describe what happens at what time in an episode of a program.
- the offset deeplink calculator is executed.
- the offset deeplink calculator may be run once after the above-described quote detector for each program is run.
- the offset deeplink calculator is responsible for finding the exact time offset of a quote (of the quoted moment found in the quote detector), with respect to the beginning of an online video file corresponding to the specific episode of the program which the quote is spoken in (or where other matched data or action occurs in a program).
- the offset deeplink calculator takes the matching sequence of words and finds the beginning of the sentence containing that sequence.
- the process may works as follows: a search is performed in the program's subtitle data (stored in the program details importer) for the beginning of the sentence.
- the search may be a backwards search, a forwards search, a search starting from the middle and going to both directions, or otherwise an organized search that saves time, such as, for example, a search that narrows down where the given content might be and starts from there - e.g. if there are dialogue heavy scenes and scenes with little to no dialogue, then the search might start from the dialogue heavy scenes only.
- the offset deeplink calculator searches for the beginning of the sentence and finds that the sentence starts as: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.”
- the offset deeplink calculator may then determine the subtitle timestamp for the very beginning of the sentence to ensure that when the video for the moment is played back, the user hears and sees the complete sentence.
- the subtitle timestamp returned may be exactly where the quoted moment begins.
- the complete sentence version may be more of a preferable user experience, however.
- the timestamp may then be stored as an interesting quoted moment for the program.
- the offset deeplink calculator outputs and stores all the time offsets of "quoted moments" in a program, along with the potentially multiple associated microposts corresponding to each of those time offsets.
- the offset deeplink calculator is mentioned as a "deeplink calculator" because those time offsets are eventually used for deeplinks sent to the user, which the user can click on or access to be taken to a program at exactly the time offset value to enjoy the specific portion of the program quoted or summarized by the micropost.
- some programs' subtitled may indicate that a different person has started speaking by (a) changing the color of the subtitles, (b) by including some signs (such as "»" or " - ”) at the beginning of the new person's speech, or (c) by including the person's name before the speech (e.g., "Abe: How are you? Bob: I'm fine”). This information may be used, and going further back to the beginning of the quoted person's speech sometimes provides better context. In one implementation, in some cases (e.g., when the previous person asks a question), it may be preferable to go back to the beginning of the previous person's last sentence.
- the previous person's speech is contextually related to the quoted person's speech (for example, based on the occurrence of common topic keywords). In such a case, it may be preferable to go even further back to the beginning of the contextually-related uttering made by the previous person.
- there may be other information associated with the video such as the beginning of each chapter or scene. It is also possible to estimate scene changes by processing the video and looking for big, or larger, more major changes in background patterns. This information may sometimes be used to go back to the beginning of the scene that contains the quoted moment.
- the user may not be taken back more than N seconds in time, where N can be a small value such as 20 or less.
- the program ranker is run.
- the program ranker may be run
- the program ranker may also be responsible for identifying the most popular programs.
- the program ranker processes each program and determines the number of "quoted moments" in a given program as follows: (1) Each time offset generated by the "offset deep link calculator" is considered a single quoted moment. (2) Multiple microposts referring to the same time offset in the program may be grouped together and counted as quoters of the same moment. (3) Programs may then be ranked by the number of "quoted moments" they have (e.g., the program with the most number of distinct quoted moments is considered to be the most interesting program with the highest rank).
- "Quoted moments" of the same program are ranked by their number of quoters (e.g., the "quoted moment” with the most number of quoters is considered to be the most interesting moment in a program with the highest rank).
- Microposts quoting the exact same moment are ranked by their length (e.g., the longest micropost is considered to be the most interesting micropost for a single moment) or other criteria such as how many indicators it has, how many hashtags it has, how much the micropost is shared or reposted.
- the output of the program ranker may be a list of programs (sorted by interestingness or highest ranked), each program containing a list of moments (sorted by interestingness or highest ranked), and each moment containing a list of microposts (sorted by interestingness or highest ranked).
- the data from the program ranker is provided to the frontend.
- the frontend serves the data generated by the program ranker to the user interface.
- the frontend does any necessary filtering to ensure that the user interface displays programs that can be played on the user's platform. For example, if the frontend is contracted by an iOS device which does not allow flash content be displayed, programs from websites that serve their videos in flash will not be included in the results served by the frontend. Alternatively, for websites that can serve videos in multiple formats (such as both flash and MP4), the frontend will pick the version of the video that may be most compatible with the user's device.
- the user interface displays the output of the frontend.
- the user interface (which may be, for example, a HTML user interface (UI) served from a web page, or a dedicated mobile application) displays the output of the frontend in an user- friendly way.
- the "most interesting" program is listed first, and the others may follow in order of decreasing interestingness (inferred from the number of quoted moments in the program).
- Each program may contain a link to the broadcaster's page where the program may be watched from the beginning, or the specific quoted moment can be watched via a deeplink.
- FIGS. 3-4 illustrate the user interface in more detail.
- each program For each program, a limited number of (for example, three-four) "most interesting" microposts are displayed.
- Each micropost contains two links: the first one is a link to the social media service page hosting the original micropost, and the second is a deeplink into the specific time offset in the video content hosted on the broadcaster's site, e.g., the particular episode of that program. Clicking on the second link takes the user to the "interesting moment" quoted by that micropost which can be played instantly on the UI or another website or device.
- the sense of "freshness" may be increased in the UI by grouping programs by their airing date, for example, and showing the most recent programs first. That is, today's programs are displayed first, then yesterday's programs, etc.
- Each data includes only those programs that have at least N (e.g., three-four) quoted moments.
- Each date's programs are also sorted by the number of "quoted moments" or summaries that they may have.
- subtitles may also be quoted as well, and may be shown instead of the micropost content arranged on the UI.
- a process may proceed with the following, but not limited to any particular order. All the subtitles (or related caption/script data) for all the programs are fetched, the programs being able to be streamed online. All the social media posts from social media services about the programs that have become available to stream online are fetched. All the fetched subtitles and fetched social media posts are joined together and all the "interesting moments" (where the subtitles and the social media posts match) are found. All the programs are ranked by the number of "interesting moments" that they have. All the social media posts are made playable by providing time-offset video deep links to the playable video content of the program.
- the program or parts of the program are personalized, promoted and shared via social media services by allowing other users who use other social media services to see the support/confirmation of the program and also allowing the sharing of such programs, which can all be done via a user interface such as a website.
- FIG. 4A is an example illustration of content showing social media organized by a social media tool on a website, for example, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- Website 400 includes program panel 402, program link 404, affirmation button 406, micropost 408, video deeplink 410, program summary news byte 412, and loading area 414.
- website 400 may be a html page presented on a web browser.
- website 400 may be a dedicated mobile device application, or another software program that loads on any display such as a television connected to any device that provides content and/or an internet connection such as a video game console or other media data player.
- Program panel 402 contains all the relevant information for a given program or television/web-based program.
- the website 400 may organize the program panels 402 by "interestingness" or number of quoted moments or microposts from the program, e.g., the most interesting or popular program gets listed first, in the case of FIG. 4A, the upper, left most corner, and subsequent programs that decrease in "interestingness” or popularity get listed afterwards.
- the website 400 may organize program panels 402 based on a marketing scheme, e.g., listing the programs that have paid for more exposure to be listed first compared to the other programs which have not invested as much afterwards - these programs may also be clearly marked as sponsored results as well.
- the website 400 may organize the program panels 402 in a random order.
- the website 400 may organize the program panels 402 based on how recent a given program is relative to the others, or by their "freshness" or by their airdate, e.g. showing the most recent programs first, then yesterday's programs, and then so on.
- the website 400 may have a date, and each date may only include those programs which have a certain number of microposts or quoted moments, and each date's programs may also be sorted by the number of quoted moments that they have.
- the program panel 402 usually includes a title of the program, at least one program link 404, at least one affirmation button 406, at least one micropost 408 (which in turn includes at least one video deep link 410), and at least one program summary news byte 412.
- the title of the program is the name of the program, and alternate titles (in different countries, for example) may also be used, and what title is used may be chosen by the website 400, the broadcaster, the broadcaster's website, or by other parameters of the social media tool of the present disclosure.
- the program link 404 is a link to the broadcaster's page where the program may be watched.
- the program link 404 links to the broadcaster's page where the most recent episode, the most popular episode or a selected episode can be played, most likely from the very beginning or at another specified timestamp.
- the user clicks on video deep link 410 on a micropost 408 they are taken to a specific offset in a specific episode.
- the user clicks on program link 404 on a micropost 408 then the user is taken to the very beginning of that same specific episode.
- the specific episode contains all of the quoted moments listed in the micropost 408.
- the most recent episode, the most popular episode or a selected episode may be played directly in a small video window directly on website 400 by clicking on the program link 404.
- the most recent episode, the most popular episode or a selected episode may be chosen by the broadcaster, the broadcaster's website, the website 400 or other parameters of the social media tool of the present disclosure.
- the thumbnail that appears where the program link 404 appears may also be selected by the broadcaster, the broadcaster's website, the website 400, or other parameters of the social medial tool of the present disclosure.
- the affirmation button 406 provides a way for users of social media services or viewers of the website 400 to view how many people (or others) support, like or confirm this particular program or episode of the program. For instance, if a user browsing the website 400 is registered with a social media service, then he or she will have the option to affirm, vote, support, like or confirm this show by clicking on the affirmation button 406. The support of this program will then appear in his social media service as either a post or status update, and other users in his or her social network will see it.
- the user will also be able to see which one of their friends from their social network in the social media service have also liked, supported, affirmed or confirmed the given program - both when logged into their social media service and directly on the website 400 itself (e.g., next to the affirmation button 406 it might say "User A, User B, User C and 1,000 more people like/support this" wherein Users A-C are friends or contacts of the user browsing the website 400 in a social media service).
- the affirmation button 406 may also use the affirmation button 406 to "share” or repost this link (the affirmation button 406 might even take the appearance of a "share” or “repost” icon with the word used or similar pictures) in their social media service for other users to see - the link that can be shared may either be a direct link to the broadcaster's site where video can be played, a link to the broadcaster's site about the program generally describing the program, a direct link to the website 400 or just a portion of the website 400 such as the specific program panel 402 of the website 400 (blown up, for example), a direct video link to the linked content playable directly from the social media service or any other such interactive link.
- the affirmation button 406 might even take the appearance of a "share” or “repost” icon with the word used or similar pictures in their social media service for other users to see - the link that can be shared may either be a direct link to the broadcaster's site where video can be played, a link to the broadcaster's site about
- more than one affirmation button 406 may appear, each one linked to a different social media service, and each one performing the functionality described above.
- the social media signals generated by users clicking on affirmation button 406 may also be used to assess the popularity of a program, and therefore change the ordering of the programs. For example, if program 1 and program 2 have the same number of quoted moments, and program 2 has more affirmations than program 1, then program 2 may be considered to be the more popular program, and therefore is displayed before program 1 in the user interface.
- Micropost 408 is a "quoted moment" micropost generated from the above- described processes, and each micropost 408 may also have a link to the social media service page hosting the original micropost and at least one video deep link 410. In one
- microposts 408 listed on program panel 402 may be organized based on interestingness, such as, how many times it was shared or reposted or
- microposts listed may be organized in a completely random fashion.
- the number of microposts may be limited to a lower number like 3-5 in order to only provide users a brief idea of the quoted moments in the program, or a higher number 10+ in order to show users the spectrum of different quoted moments in a program.
- each micropost 408 may contain a link to the social media service page hosting the original micropost and the video deeplink 410.
- Video deeplink 410 is a deeplink into the specific time offset in the video content that may be hosted on the broadcaster's site, determined by the above-described processes and algorithms. By clicking on the video deeplink 410, the user is taken to the "interesting moment" discussed or quoted in that micropost, and is able to view a clip of where exactly in the program the moment begins and also ends. In one implementation, the user can be taken to where exactly in the program the quoted moment begins and be allowed to watch the rest of the program.
- the video deeplink 410 may also link directly to the broadcaster's site where the episode or video content is hosted.
- the video deeplink 410 may allow the time-offset video content to play directly on the website 400, e.g., a window opens up on the website 400 or in the micropost 408 that plays the video, or by another way.
- the video deeplink 410 may link to a specialized media player hosted by the broadcaster or the website 400 that not only allows the user to play the time-offset video content in that selected episode, but also allows the user to play from other episodes related to the one selected by the video deeplink 410.
- Program summary news byte 412 may provide a link to an interesting or much- buzzed about online article involving the program displayed by program panel 402.
- the user is taken to a separate news site where the online article was published and can read it from that website.
- the reader may be able to read the article directly on website 400 either by a separate window opening up and the article being displayed there, or by the article expanding out into the program panel 402 and being able to be read there.
- the way that the program summary news byte 412 may be chosen could be something set by the parameters of the broadcaster, the broadcaster's website, the website 400, or other parameters of the social media tool used by the present disclosure.
- an article or press site that has paid either the broadcaster or the website 400 to display their articles may be the article that pops up in program summary news byte 412.
- an article that is popularly cited or shared the most in various social networks is the article that is shown in the program summary news byte 412.
- Loading area 414 is where the website 400 may load more program panels 402.
- the website 400 may only decide to display a certain pre-selected number of program panels 402 on one page - in the case of FIG. 4A, this is eight, although the number of program panels 402 chosen to be displayed can be any number.
- the loading area 412 is a bar that when clicked displays the next number of program panels 402.
- the previously displayed program panels 402 may disappear (and possibly replaced with a button similar to loading area 414 but saying something instead like "load previous" or "see previous”) and only the presently selected program panels 402 may be visible.
- all of the previously displayed program panels 402 may still be visible but have to be scrolled up in order to see, and now also the newly loaded program panels 402 that result after clicking the loading area 414 are still being displayed.
- the preselected number of program panels 402 to display on one given screen of the website 400 may be determined by the parameters of the device the website 400 is displayed on. For example, the number might be much higher if a computer screen is used to display the website 400 on an internet browser, whereas the number might be much lower if the website 400 is being displayed on a mobile device via a mobile application such as a web browser, for example. In one implementation, more recommendations or items may be loaded on the website 400 by simply scrolling down.
- FIG. 4B is another example illustration of content showing social media organized by the social media tool on a website, for example, in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure.
- Alternate website 420 shows program panel 402, program link 404, affirmation button 406, micropost 408, video deep link 410, program summary news byte 412, and loading area 414.
- the descriptions of the above components for FIG. 4B are identical to the descriptions of the same components for FIG. 4A.
- FIG. 4B and FIG. 4A shows just four program panels 402 as opposed to eight, as shown in FIG. 4A. This therefore illustrates how the number of program panels 402 can be adjusted according to a variety of parameters. The fewer number of program panels 402 shown in FIG.
- the number of program panels 402 displayed does not need to be four and can be any number decided by the parameters or other specifications of the display device.
- the next number of program panels 402 may be displayed, with the previously displayed program panels 402 accessible via a similar button/feature as the loading area 414 but saying something such as "load previous" or "see previous” instead.
- the number of program panels 402 may be smaller or greater than four, but should be around that number or less than 10, and each screen of the alternate website 420 may only show the preselected number of program panels 402 at a time, with the previous/next buttons available as well on the top or the bottom.
