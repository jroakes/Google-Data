Background technology
Use traditional media, for example the advertisement of TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine is widely known by the people.Unfortunately, though have on the demography research and to the fully reasonably supposition of the typical audience of various advertisement approach, the advertiser recognizes that still their a lot of budgets all are wasted.And, be difficult to determine and eliminate this waste.
Recently, catch on having more on the medium of interactivity to advertise.For example, because the number sharp increase of internet usage, the advertiser has come to realise medium and service are provided on the internet is a kind of potential strong advertising.
Interactive Advertising offers an opportunity to the advertiser, arrives the glad audient who receives with the advertisement orientation (target) with them.Just, targeted ads (targeted ad) more may be useful to the terminal user, because advertisement may relevant with some needs of inferring from User Activity (for example, relevant to the search inquiry of search engine with the user, the file content of being asked with the user be relevant).The searched engine of searching keyword orientation is used for relevant ads.For example, mountain scene city, California (Mountain View, CA) the AdWords ad system of Google is thrown in the advertisement be oriented to from the keyword of search inquiry.Similarly, content targeted ad delivery systems (content targeted ad delivery system) has been proposed.For example, u.s. patent application serial number 10/314,427 (comprise it and are used herein to reference, and be referred to as " 427 application "), name is called " METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANTADVERTISEMENTS ", application on Dec 6th, 2002, Jeffrey A.Dean, GeorgesR.Harik and Paul Buchheit is listed in the inventor; And 10/375,900 (comprise it and come in to be used for reference, and be referred to as " 900 application "), name is called " SERVINGADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON CONTENT ", application on February 26th, 2003, Darrell Anderson, Paul Buchheit, Alex Carobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar is listed in the inventor, has described the method and apparatus that is used to distribute the advertisement relevant with document content (for example webpage).Content targeted ad delivery systems, for example the ad system AdSense of Google has been used to serve ads on webpage.
As previously mentioned content can be understood, it is useful distributing the advertisement relevant with text concept in the text because these advertisements estimate may be relevant with active user's interest.The result is that this content-targeted advertisement has become more popular.Yet this advertisement system still has room for improvement.

The example of the policy violation that some are relevant with publisher or source, website comprises the website of being supported by the country in the blacklist (for example Cuba), the web publisher that swindle history is arranged, the web publisher of before having been kicked out of by advertising network.Use the position of the webserver, can determine the part of these policy violation at least.The information that other can be used for helping determining the violation relevant with publisher can comprise the IP address, website name of address, social security number, Email, the webserver etc.
The example of the policy violation of number of site availability comprises, the website of name server (DNS) mistake (for example URL does not exist, URL fault etc.), the website that Break Link is arranged, " off-line " website, " building " website, too much pop-up window or the website, Internet chat sites, non-HTML website (for example directory index, FLASH, WAP), spyware website, homepage adapter website etc. of pop-up window (for example when loading any given webpage, surpassing N (for example) pop-up window/behind pop-up window advertisement) are behind arranged.Other example can comprise to be attempted Malware is installed in website on the subscriber computer, and perhaps back lost efficacy by making, too much pop-up window/behind pop-up window influences the website of availability etc.By identification error code and/or suspicious executable code, can determine the part of these policy violation at least.This can be by attempting to load automatically the website and finishing in browser level or operating system grade " being harmful to " incident of catching in browser.
At last, the example that some relate to the website violations of swindle comprises what is called " pay click " (pay-to-click) website (for example, those fundamental purposes are to make the people select " to each pay-per-click " (pay-per-click) website of advertisement) etc.For example, rubbish is clicked (click-spam) website and is typically had and use template and/or high advertisement to content that text ratio generated.In addition, also exist prior art to detect rubbish index fabricator (index spammer, the website of promptly using illegal means that its rank in result for retrieval is improved).Those website and those websites of being engaged in the rubbish click of being engaged in the rubbish index have been considered to correlativity.By finding rubbish index fabricator, available this correlativity helps find rubbish to click the fabricator.Available any aforementioned information helps find this class violation.In another approach, can find the violation of the above-mentioned type by measuring by the deviation of the actual click-through rate on the audit website to the average click-through rate of all websites.Also can use learning algorithm (naive Bayesian, SVM etc.).For example, use the statistics to some known " pay and click " websites, available this class algorithm comes training network.Then, the network after available this class training is discerned new website.
Use defined quality standard, can determine website quality score.Some examples of website quality standard comprise: from the custom data (for example, the derivation of number of impressions, selection, user geographic position, conversion and these information) in advertising network or other source; The popularity of website (being in or be not in the advertising network) (for example measured) by the Google tool bar; Website rubbish (for example, so-called " chain go to the station to meet somebody group " (link farms), the website that this place is set up has only related content seldom, but a lot of links are each other arranged to promote the score value of search engine, there is invalid content on the page, for example have black background and relate to the porn site of pornographic white text, but the text of black (therefore being hidden) relates to digital camera or other popular inquiry, to be lifted at score value in the search engine etc.); Or the like.The example of number of site rubbish is 10/748 in sequence number, 664 (are included in it and are used for reference herein, and be referred to as " 664 application ") U.S. Patent application in be described, this name of patent application is " INFORMATIONRETRIEVAL BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA ", application on Dec 31st, 2003, Anurag Acharya, Matt Cutts, Jeffrey Dean, Paul Haahr, Monika Henzinger, Urs Hoelzle, Steve Lawrence, Karl Pfleger, Olcan Sercinoglu and SimonTong is listed in the inventor.
§ 4.3.1 exemplary method
Fig. 3 is in mode according to the invention, can be used for the process flow diagram to the exemplary method 300 of the violation of policy of self-verifying website.Shown in event box 305, the main action of executing method 300 comes the request of the website of being checked is responded.Request responds to receiving check, and method 300 can be accepted website (frame 310) and examine its possible violation to policy (frame 315).If do not find violation of policy (decision frame 320), before method 300 is left (node 360) so, method 300 can be checked and approved this website (frame 325) simply and arrange follow-up policy inspection (frame 330) properly.
Later with reference to decision frame 320, if on the other hand, found the violation to policy, method 300 can not checked and not approved website (frame 335).Based on the degree of confidence of determining to policy violation, method 300 can be carried out other operation (frame 340).More specifically, if the degree of confidence of determining to violation of policy is low, before method 300 is left (node 360) so, method 300 can make marks to the website (and/or with its queuing) (recall to be used for manual examination and verification (frame 345), the for example queuing operation 230 of Fig. 2), but and informing network publisher (frame 355).This can manually confirm or overthrow the possible violation to policy.This also can make web publisher, does not in fact have violation of policy to explain to their website, or adopts remedial measures.The frame 340 of reference decision later, if determine the with a high credibility of violation, before method 300 is left (node 360) so, method 300 can make marks to the website and refuse this website (for example, must not carry out manual audit again) (frame 350) with indication.
Later reference event frame 305 is examined and is asked to come from different sources.Especially, method 300 can receive request from the web publisher that hope join advertising network, receives as the request of the part of follow-up routine etc.Request can come from the business development source.For example, as will be described in detail, can be used to help advertising network to estimate also not join advertising network website quality score operation (recalling, for example the unit 220 of Fig. 2), be the candidate website that fine potentiality are arranged but be based on its quality score.The business development source may wish violation of policy is done pre-filtering, does the retrieval of the website of positions vacant to dwindle them to expectation is arranged.
Fig. 4 is in mode according to the invention, the process flow diagram of the exemplary method of being marked in the website 400.Accepted a website (frame 402).Shown in frame 404, in exemplary method 400, can handle dissimilar websites with diverse ways.For example, (for example, before by the policy inspection) may " before be checked and approved " in the website.As another example, the website may still may enter by illegal or unwarranted means in advertising network.As another example, the website may be that first cause is violated the unaccepted website of one or more policies.As another example again, the website may be (for example, never the seeking to join the website of advertising network) that before was not examined.
If received website is the website (for example, being checked and approved by policy compliance 215) of " by checking and approving ", method 400 can be the website and determines one or more quality score (frame 406).Then, whether method 400 can be accepted according to fixed score value, carries out different action (frame 408).If score value is acceptable, before method 400 is left (node 490), method 400 can (for example provide excitation or obstruction according to this score value, about the price collected to the advertiser, with the revenue sharing of web publisher, pay the expense of web publisher etc.), or do not do anything (frame 410) simply.If score value is too low, before method 400 is left (node 490), method 400 can be sent the warning of inferior quality score value to web publisher, and/or (frame 412 and 414) removed in the website from the participant of advertising network.
Reference block 406,420 and 434 later, method 400 can use one or more functions to determine one or more quality score.As previously mentioned, quality score can reflect the measurement of number of site to the value of advertising network.
Or reference block 406,420 and 434, after determining score value, method 400 can be used (for example being scheduled to) threshold value to decide and accept which website and which website of refusal.
Fig. 5 is in mode according to the invention, the website can be arranged the process flow diagram of the exemplary method 500 that is used for manual examination and verification.Especially, method 500 can obtain the website of inferior quality score value or comprise may violation of policy website (recalling, for example the frame 345 of Fig. 3) (frame 520).Next step can join suitable formation with the website of mark, and wherein this formation is made up of the label web of preparing its displaying is used for manual examination and verification.(frame 540)
As another example, can provide formation based on type to the violation of policy.This feasible manual examination and verification specialization that the website of violation of policy is done.For example, one or more people may be responsible for examining and it is believed that being is the website of core with hatred, and one or more other people may be responsible for examining to it is believed that it is the website of selling drinks.This class specialization makes that the application of policy is more unified and more suitable.
Fig. 6 is in mode according to the invention, can be used for handling the process flow diagram through the illustrative methods 600 of the website of manual examination and verification.Especially, method 600 can be accepted human auditor's decision (for example, check and approve or do not check and approve the website of mark, maybe audit heavily may be distributed to another auditor/department) (frame 610).Reference block 620, if the website is is manually checked and approved, so, before method 600 is left (node 690), method 600 can be labeled as the website checks and approves (or the action of carrying out any needs is added to advertising network with the website), and can arrange follow-up policy inspection.In addition, method 600 can take the step of needs to determine quality score (frame 650).
Except above-mentioned, the decision and the learning algorithm (naive Bayesian, SVM etc.) of human operator can be used together, (for example to be used for training, decision according to passing human operator) and regulate the scoring operation (recalling, for example the method 400 of Fig. 4) of website.The result who does like this can make scoring process more effective and accurate, when reducing human intervention (manual examination and verification), makes system more effective thus.
