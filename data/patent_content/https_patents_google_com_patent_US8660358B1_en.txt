Definitions
- This specification relates to data processing and image analysis.
- a map portion i.e., a portion of a map
- a web page can include code that causes a map portion to be presented in a map space (i.e., a portion of the web page in which the map portion is presented).
- a user can interact with the web page and/or the map portion, for example, to request presentation of a particular map location (e.g., a city or latitude/longitude combination) in a map space.
- the user can also interact with the web page, for example, to adjust a scale at which the map portion is presented in the map space.
- Some web page publishers enable users to selectively request additional information that is associated with (i.e., indexed according to and/or stored with a reference to) geographic locations that are represented in the map portion.
- a web page with which a map portion is presented can also include user interface elements that enable a user to request presentation of traffic conditions, live camera feeds, or images that have been identified as relevant to the geographic locations that are represented in the map portion.
- information e.g., traffic indicators, live video, and/or images
- the map portion can become cluttered.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving image data that specify feature values for a plurality of images and location data that specify a geographic location for each of the images; selecting a group of images in which each image has a geographic location that is within a threshold distance of a reference location; selecting pairs of matching images from the group of images, each selection being based on a pair of matching images having an image similarity score that meets a similarity threshold, the similarity score for each pair being based, at least in part, on the feature values of each image in the pair of images; selecting, from the pairs of matching images, a reference image for the geographic location, the reference image being selected based, at least in part, on a number of the matching pairs that include the reference image; determining an image effect to use when presenting the reference image, the image effect determined based on the number of matching pairs; and providing data that cause presentation in a map space of a photo collection image that includes a visual representation of the reference image, the photo collection image being presented
- Selecting a reference image for the geographic location can include selecting, from the pairs of images, the reference image based at least in part on user feedback data specifying popularity scores for images in the pairs. Selecting a reference image for the geographic location can include the actions of ranking the images in the pairs based on the popularity scores, the rank of each image being proportional to the popularity score for the image; and selecting the reference image based on the ranking.
- Providing data that cause presentation of the photo collection image can include providing data that cause presentation of a photo collection image in which a number of photos visually represented by the photo collection image is proportional to the number of pairs that include the reference image.
- Selecting a group of images can include selecting different groups of images based on a zoom level at which a map portion will be presented in the map space, wherein the threshold distance of the reference location is proportional to a size of a geographic region that is represented by the map portion.
- Selecting a reference image can include selecting a reference image for each of a plurality of different geographic locations, the different geographic locations for which a reference image is selected being based, at least in part, on a zoom level at which the map portion will be presented.
- Methods can further include the actions of receiving from a user device, a request for a map space, wherein providing the data comprise providing the data to the user device.
- the relevance of images that are selected by a computer for presentation in a map space can be increased by selecting, from among a set of images that are associated with a geographic location, an image that is visually similar to a highest number of other images in the set.
- a map space can be de-cluttered by limiting the number of images that are presented in the map space, thus lessening the distraction caused by displaying multiple images in juxtaposition in the map space.
- a relative number of images of a particular object can be indicated by a relative height of a photo collection image that is presented with a reference image, thus allowing a user to discern the number of images in the collection without having to select the collection.
- each collection can be selected based on visual similarity, and a top photo representing the collection coveys to the user the types of images in the collection. Accordingly, each collection may better satisfy the user's informational needs that a collection of photos based solely on, for example, location or category classification.

- a collection of images that have been identified as relevant to a particular geolocation can be selected.
- the images that were selected for inclusion in the collection of images can be ranked based on their similarity to other images in the collection of images. For example, pairs of matching images can be identified based on feature values (i.e., values representing visual features) of each image.
- the image that is included in the most pairs of matching images is selected as a reference image for the geographic location area and is selected as a highest-ranked image.
- the highest-ranked image in the collection of images can be selected as a reference image for the geolocation.
- the representative image can be, for example, an image of a landmark, business, or other objects that are located at the geolocation.
- one or more of the images in the collection for that particular geolocation can be selected to be provided with the requested map portion.
- the number of images that are provided with the requested map portion can depend, for example, on display characteristics (e.g., display resolution, map space dimensions, zoom settings, and other display characteristics) of the environment in which the map portion will be presented.
- display characteristics e.g., display resolution, map space dimensions, zoom settings, and other display characteristics
- the collection of images can be represented by a photo collection image (e.g., an image representing a stack of images and the highest ranked image on the top of the stack).
- the highest-ranked image in the collection of images is visually presented as being placed on top of a stack of other images.
- a map portion when a map portion includes a densely-photographed geolocation, such as the area surrounding the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the map portion may become cluttered if all of the photos taken near the Eiffel Tower are provided with the map portion.
- the representative image of the area may be a particular photo of the Eiffel Tower, such that this particular photo of the Eiffel Tower is presented as being on top of a stack of photos, and displayed in the map space of a map application or browser.

- location data e.g., data that specify a relevant geographic location for the image
- an image that is included in the image store 124 can be a photo of the Eiffel Tower that a tourist contributed, and for which the tourist provided a geolocation (e.g., either manually or automatically by use of the tourist's camera) at which the photo was taken.
- the image store 124 can also include data that specify feature values for the images.
- the feature values for each image are values indicative of visual features of the image.
- the feature values of an image may be values resulting from feature detection techniques such as edge detection, scale-invariant feature transform, ridge detection, and can also be values that represent colors of the images textures of the image and other visual features of the image.
- the feature values for each image can be arranged into a vector of feature values, and the similarity of a pair of images can be determined based on a distance between the vectors of feature values for the pair of images.
- the similarity of the pair of images can be represented by a similarity score (e.g., based on a cosine similarity measure, clustering techniques, or other vector similarity measurement techniques) that is computed using the sectors of feature values for the pair of images, stored in the image store 124 , and used to identify matching image pairs.
- the image store 124 also includes data representing the image itself, as well as any metadata or other information associated with the image. Data that are associated with a particular image in the image store 124 are indexed according to and/or stored with data that reference the particular image.
- users can upload images (e.g., photos of the Eiffel Tower) to various webs sites (e.g., photo sharing websites) and provide authorization to make the images publicly available.
- the image store 124 can logically represent a group of image clearinghouses or repositories that are accessible by the image apparatus 122 .

- APIs application program interfaces
- Other implementations can use other ways of accessing images.
- the image apparatus 122 can generate and maintain one or more indices of images that are stored in various remote locations, and the indices can identify the geographic location (e.g., latitude/longitude or some other coordinate system) associated with each image.
- the content management system 110 also includes a map apparatus 126 for accessing map data in a maps data store 128 .
- the map apparatus 126 can include one or more map information servers (or another data processing apparatus) and/or one or more computer applications that are accessible to the content management system 110 .
- the map apparatus 126 and the maps data store 128 can be local to the content management system 110 , or remote from the content management system 110 and accessible using the network 102 .
- the maps data store 128 can store data needed to respond to a map request that requests presentation of a map portion (i.e., a portion of a map). For example, in response to a resource request 112 for a map portion that is received by the content management system 110 , map data that are received from the maps data store 128 can be used to render one or more requested map portions.
- the map requests includes data that specify display characteristics for the environment in which the map portion will be presented. For example, the map requests may specify a display resolution, zoom level, and map space dimensions.
- These display characteristics may be used, for example, to select a map portion that is to be provided in response to the request. Additionally, these display characteristics may be used to determine a number of images that will be presented with the map portion. For example, the number of images may be selected so that no reference images in the map space overlap and/or so that specify areas of the map portion (e.g., road names) are occluded by the images that are provided with a map portion.
- the number of images may be selected so that no reference images in the map space overlap and/or so that specify areas of the map portion (e.g., road names) are occluded by the images that are provided with a map portion.
- the content management system 110 can receive a resource request 112 that originates from the user device 106 .
- the resource request 112 can include a request to display a map portion that includes an area of Paris that includes the location of the Eiffel Tower.
- the resource request 112 can be based on information (e.g., a search query) that the user enters in a browser, and/or the resource request 112 can be based on location information inferred by the user's current geographic location (e.g., based on GPS capabilities of a mobile user device 106 that have been enabled by the user).
- the content management system 110 can access maps data store 128 to obtain map data that are responsive to the request (e.g., map data for the area of Paris near the Eiffel Tower).
- the content management system 110 can also receive image data to select images 118 that will be provided in response to the resource request 112 .
- the content management system 110 can receive image data for a reference image of the Eiffel Tower and/or other reference images having location data that specify a geolocation that is included in the requested map portion.
- the content management system 110 can provide data (e.g., map data and image data) that cause presentation of the requested resource 114 to the user device 106 .
- the user's browser can render the resource content 116 (e.g., the map of Paris) and display the corresponding images 118 at various places on the displayed map (e.g., next to the geographic locations in the map portion to which the images have been identified as relevant based on location data for the images).
- the image apparatus 122 selects the reference image for a photo collection and generates data for a visual representation of a stack of photos with a representation of the reference image on the top of the stack of photos. Selection of the stack of photos at the user device results in the providing of one or more of the photos in the collection to the user device.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing an example data flow 200 for displaying images with a map portion.
- a user device 106 can make a content request 112 , such as a request for map data that cause presentation of a map of Paris and images of points of interest (e.g., points of interest, businesses, etc.) in the area represented by the map.
- the user may be planning a vacation to Paris, and entered, in a browser, search terms related to Paris.
- the user may be located in Paris, and the user's location (e.g., according to GPS data) can be included in the content request 112 .
- images obtained from the image store 124 can be displayed with the map.
- the images can include, for example, images uploaded and authorized for sharing by other users, such as from other user devices 106 .
- the content management system 110 accesses image data for images that have been identified as being relevant to the geographic area that is represented by the requested map portion. For example, if the requested map portion represents an area 202 in Paris, then the image data that the content management system 110 accesses can include images 118 a - 118 d of the Eiffel Tower, images of the Arc de Triomphe, and other images that are associated with the area (e.g., based on location data for the images).
- the image data obtained for the images 118 a - 118 d can include, for each image, location data that specify a geographic location for the image.
- the content management system 110 can group images, such as the images 118 a - 118 d , in groups of one or more.
- the content management system 110 can select a group of images 118 a - 118 d for which the location data associated with the images 118 a - 118 d specifies a geographic location that is within a threshold distance of a reference location. For example, based on a geographic location 204 (e.g., a geographic point in Paris) the content management system 110 can select the images 118 a - 118 d because they are geographically associated with locations that are within a certain pre-determined distance of the geographic location 204 , as represented by a circle 206 .
- the images 118 a - 118 d can be a subset of what may be hundreds of images in the circle 206 .
- the reference location can be selected, for example, to be the centroid of the city, a geolocation of a landmark, or another point of reference. In some implementations, the reference location can be selected based on a number of available images that include location data specifying a particular geolocation. For example, the reference location can be a latitude/longitude pair that is associated with a highest number of images.
- the threshold distance can be selected, for example, based on an image density measure (e.g., a number of images that are associated with an area of a map portion), a maximum number of images that can be presented in a map portion, and/or display characteristics of the environment in which the images will be presented.
- the threshold distance can be inversely proportional to a zoom level at which a map portion is presented. For example, as the zoom level is increased (i.e., the map portion is presented at a larger scale), the threshold distance can be decreased since a larger portion of the display area (i.e., relative to lower zoom levels) will be available for presentation of images that are located within a particular area of the map portion.
- the content management system 110 can identify matching image pairs 208 (i.e., pairs of matching images) from the group of images.
- the matching image pairs 208 can include a matching image pair that includes images 118 a and 118 b , another matching image pair that includes images 118 c and 118 d , another matching image pair that includes images 118 b and 118 c , and still another matching image pair that includes images 118 d and 118 b .
- the matching image pairs 208 can also include other combinations of images 118 a - 118 d and combinations of images not represented in FIG. 2 .
- the content management system 110 can identify matching image pairs, for example, based on an image similarity score for the image pair.
- the pair of images 118 a and 118 b may have an image similarity score that meets a similarity threshold, such that the content management system 110 can determine that the images 118 a and 118 b are images of the same object.
- the similarity score for the images 118 a and 118 b can be based, at least in part, on the feature values of each image in the pair of images, as described above.
- Some computer vision techniques can detect similarities between images that are scaled, rotated, or discolored. For example, epipolar geometry techniques can be used to determine that images of the Eiffel Tower that were captured at different distances from the Eiffel Tower and/or from different viewing angles are images of the same object.
- the content management system 110 can select, from the matching image pairs, a reference image 118 b for the geographic location 204 .
- the content management system 110 selects, as the reference image, an image that was included in a highest number of identified matching image pairs. For example, when the geographic location 204 is a point in Paris near the Eiffel Tower, the content management system 110 may determine that a particular image of the Eiffel Tower (e.g., image 118 b ) was included in the most matching image pairs for the geographic location 204 . Based on this determination, the content management system 110 can select the particular image of the Eiffel Tower as the reference image for the geographic location 204 .
- the content management system 110 can select the reference image based, at least in part, on user feedback data specifying popularity scores for the images.
- Example user feedback data can specify a number of users who have viewed the images, ratings that the users provided after viewing the images, and other indicia of popularity.
- information regarding user feedback for images can be stored in and/or received from the image store 124 .
- user feedback data can be indexed according to and/or stored with a reference to a particular image.
- selecting a reference image based on user feedback on images can comprise ranking the images based on the popularity scores (e.g., where the rank of each image is proportional to the popularity score for the image) and selecting the reference image based on the ranking. For example, while the image 118 b may be selected as the reference image when considering only the number of matching image pairs in which the image 118 b is included, considering user feedback for the images 118 a - 118 d can cause a different image to be selected as the reference image.
- the user popularity of the image 118 c can make it more likely that the content management system 110 selects the image 118 c as the reference image.
- the content management system 110 can group the image 118 b with other images (e.g., images 118 a , 118 c and 118 d ) to create a collection of images 210 .
- the content management system 110 can provide the collection of images 210 for presentation in a map space at the user device 106 .
- the collection of images 210 can be presented as a photo collection image (e.g., an image effect that is a visual representation of a stack of photos).
- the reference image e.g., the image 118 b
- the visual representation of the stack of photos (e.g., the number of photos that appear in the stack) can be proportional to the number of pairs that include the reference image.
- the relative number of photos in the collection can be indicated by the number of edges of images (or photo likenesses) that protrude from the stack.
- the visual representation of the stack of photos is a type of image effect that can be used when presenting a reference image.
- FIG. 3 is a screen shot of an example user interface 300 that includes a map space 302 .
- the map space 302 can be, for example, a map viewport or another section within a map application 304 or within a user's browser that operates on a user device 106 .
- the map space 302 can display a map portion which can include, for example, political boundaries, water features (e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, etc.), roads and highways, transportation routes, satellite imagery, points-of-interest and other features, each of which can be labeled with text, markers and/or presented with various colors, styles, etc.
- the map data that are used to display this type of information can be obtained, for example, from the maps data store 128 of FIG. 1 .
- the map space 302 can also display images, including individual images and photo collection images, such as those representing the collection of images 210 that include the images 118 a - 118 d representing various photos of the Eiffel Tower. Other collections of images can also be represented using individual images and photo collection images.
- FIG. 3 includes representations of a collection of images 308 for the Arc de Triomphe and a collection of images 310 for the Famous Café.
- collections of images can be visually represented by a reference image and a photo collection image icon.
- the photo collection image icon can be an image effect that depicts a slightly disarranged stack of photos with staggered edges showing at the outer edges of the collection image icon.
- the number of edges that are presented to the user can represent a relative number of individual images in the collection of images.
- the collection image icon for the collection of images 210 has four edges showing, which can indicate that there are four (or a multiple of four) images in the collection of images 210 .
- the collection of images 308 has a photo collection image icon with three edges showing, which can indicate that there are three (or a multiple of three) images of the Arc de Triomphe in the collection of images 308 .
- the collection of images 310 has a photo collection image icon with six edges, which can indicate that six (or a multiple of six) images of the Famous Café are in the collection of images 310 .
- image count i.e., a value indicative of the number of images in the collection of images
- a user can use one or more controls to cycle through the collection of images 210 , e.g., to view each of the individual photos of the Eiffel Tower that are represented by the images 118 b , 118 a , 118 c and 118 d .
- the user can view the next image (e.g., the image 118 a “underneath” the image 118 b ), and the next image after that (e.g., the image 118 c ), and so on.
- the order in which the images are presented can be based, for example, on the order in which the images were ranked as described above, a semi-random image selection technique, or another technique for selecting a presentation order.
- a list of viewing options can be displayed as a result of user interaction with a collection of images (e.g., hovering over or clicking on the collection of images 210 , right-clicking on the collection of images 210 , or some other user interaction).
- clicking on or selecting the reference image can cause the reference image to be enlarged and/or cause a display of information about the reference image (e.g., the date that the image was submitted).
- the reference image e.g., the image 118 b representing the representative photo of the Eiffel Tower
- the reference image can be annotated in some way, such as marked with a different (e.g., bolded) outline. In this way, the user can be reminded which image is the reference image.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for providing a collection of images for presentation in a map space.
- the process 400 is a process by which image data that specify feature values for multiple different images are received. A group of the images are selected based on location data that are associated with (i.e. indexed according to and/or stored with a reference to) the respective images. Matching image pairs are then selected from the group of images, and a reference image for the geographic location is selected from the matching image pairs. Data that cause presentation of the reference image and a photo collection image in the map space are provided.
- the process 400 can be used, for example, to display one or more collections of images within the map space of a maps application and/or a browser.
- the process 400 can be implemented, for example, using the content management system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- the process 400 can also be implemented as instructions stored on computer storage medium such that execution of the instructions by data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of the process 400 .
- FIG. 2 is used to provide examples in describing operations of the process 400 .
- Image data that specify feature values for multiple different images are received ( 402 ).
- the feature values for each image are values indicative of visual features (e.g., colors, textures, edges, or other visual features) of the image.
- the image data for each image include location data for the image.
- the location data specify a geographic location for the image.
- the location data can specify latitude/longitude coordinates (or another reference to a geographic location) that was provided by a user that provided the image.
- the image data can be stored, for example, in the image store 122 of FIG. 1 .
- a group of images is selected using the image data ( 404 ).
- each image that is selected for inclusion in the group of images has location data specifying a geographic location that is within a threshold distance of a reference location.
- the content management system 110 can select the images 118 a - 118 d for inclusion in a same group because the images are associated with geographic locations that are within the circle 206 , e.g., within a pre-determined radius of the reference location 204 . Selection of the reference location and/or the threshold distance can be performed as described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- multiple different reference images can be provided with a single map portion.
- the different geographic locations for which a reference image is provided can be determined, for example, based on a zoom level (and/or graphic resolution) at which the map portion and reference images will be presented. For example, if the map portion that will be displayed on the user's user device represents all of Paris, then several geographic locations from around Paris can be selected, including the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame de Paris, Famous Café, and several other sites, restaurants and places of interest can be selected.
- the content management system may select just a few geographic locations, including the Eiffel Tower and any popular restaurants or cafés that are near the Eiffel Tower.
- a reference image that is presented at a map space location that is west of the location of the Eiffel Tower can be an image of the Eiffel Tower as viewed from a western perspective
- the reference image that is presented at a map space location that is east of the location of the Eiffel Tower can be an image of the Eiffel Tower as viewed from an eastern perspective.
- the geographic locations can be selected to prevent overlapping of two or more reference images in the map space. For example, in an area that includes a famous museum, a popular restaurant and a tourist attraction that are all virtually at the same location (e.g., within a few hundred feet), the content management system 110 can select one of the three geographic locations. Doing so can prevent stacks of images from being displayed virtually on top of each other in a map space.
- the content management system 110 can select the three to four geographic locations that have the most matching image pairs (e.g., that may reflect the most popular locations determined by users over time).
- Pairs of matching images are selected from the group of images ( 406 ).
- the selection of each matching image pair is based on an image similarity score for the matching image pair meeting a similarity threshold.
- the similarity score for a pair of images is based, at least in part, on the feature values of each image in the pair of images, as described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- a reference image for the geographic location is selected from the pairs of matching images ( 408 ).
- the reference image is selected based, at least in part, on a number of the matching image pairs that include the reference image. For example, as described with reference to FIG. 2 , the content management system 110 can select the image 118 b as the reference image because the image 118 b is included in more matching image pairs 208 than any of the other example images (e.g., images 118 a , 118 c , 118 d ). In this example, the image 118 b is included in three image pairs, and the other images 118 a , 118 c and 118 d are each included in just two image pairs.
- a reference image can be selected based, at least in part, on user feedback data that specify popularity scores for images, as previously described with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the images can be ranked based on their popularity scores where the rank of each image is proportional to the popularity score for the image.
- the reference image can be selected based on the ranking.
- the reference image can be selected based on a function (e.g., a measure of central tendency such as an average or a weighted average, a logarithmic function, or another function) of the number of matching image pairs in which the image is included and the popularity score for the image.
- Data that cause presentation of the reference image and a photo collection image in a map space are provided ( 410 ).
- the reference image and the photo collection image are presented at a map position for the geographic location that is specified by the location data for the reference image.
- the content management system 110 can provide data that can be used to display the collection of images 210 at a map location corresponding to the geographic location specified by the location data for the reference image 118 b.
