Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to computer systems and specifically to distributed computing and storage mechanisms on networked computer systems.
- PCs personal computers
- each user of a PC in the enterprise has a networked PC at his/her desk or work area.
- the management of resources in the network may become increasingly complex and expensive.
- Some of the manageability issues involved in maintaining a large number of networked computer systems may include ease of installation and deployment, the topology and physical logistics of the network, asset management, scalability (the cost and effort involved in increasing the number of units), troubleshooting network or unit problems, support costs, software tracking and management, as well as the simple issue of physical space, be it floor space or room on the desktop, as well as security issues regarding physical assets, information protection, software control, and computer virus issues.
- a typical computer system has I/O access to one or more volumes on a storage device such as a hard drive.
- a volume generally includes an amount of free (unused) storage space which varies over time. When the number of computers and respective volumes in the networked system becomes very large, the total amount of unused storage may become significant.
- the computer systems may be configured to access virtual network attached storage (referred to herein as a shared storage volume).
- the computer systems may include a first computer, having a first processor and a first storage medium coupled to the first processor, and a peripheral device, e.g., a keyboard, monitor, mouse, or other type of peripheral device.
- the computer systems may further include a second computer having a second processor and a second storage medium coupled to the second processor, in one embodiment, the first computer and the second computer may each be configured on a respective computer blade, also referred to as a “computer on a card.”
- a communication link e.g., a bus, may couple the first computer to the second computer.
- a peripheral switch may be coupled to the first computer, the second computer, and the peripheral device. The peripheral switch may be configured to route signals between the peripheral device and the first computer.
- each computer may have some file server functionality.
- the file server functionality may include some I/O functionality, and may also include functionality for negotiating file write and read protocols. Communicating with the storage medium on the computer may be analogous to communicating with a standard file server attached memory.
- the computer may negotiate information writes similar to a file server, and order and prioritize transactions.
- the computer may also implement striping analogous to that used by RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks).
- the storage mediums on the computers may share memory space using a virtual network attached storage space (VNAS) system incorporating a decentralized peer-to-peer sharing process.
- VNAS virtual network attached storage space
- the VNAS system may be used to aggregate storage capacity from a number of blades and re-expose the aggregated storage to the network as one or more virtual volumes.
- unused network storage capacity may be salvaged, treated as a single shared volume, and provided to network-connected workstations.
- the VNAS solution can stripe a single file across multiple physical drives residing in multiple blades, thus enabling parallel access for a single file-level object, and thus reducing overall access times.
- pooled storage under VNAS may be exposed to the end-user as a simple folder, directory, volume, or other unit of storage. Users may interact with the VNAS folder (e.g., to drag and drop files) just like they would interact with a regular folder.
- VNAS may be managed through a web-browser interface or other graphical user interface. Management of VNAS may include storage usage policies, file finding, node maintenance, node removal, and virtual volume maintenance.
- VNAS may be used as a large scale automated data caching solution.
- a user on one desktop accesses data from the VNAS server, the data is located on one or more of the computers participating in the VNAS array. Once this data has been located it is copied to the VNAS-enabled computer closest to the requesting user's desktop. In this way, popular data items are automatically cached at closer locations to requesting desktops, thereby removing lags associated with traversing multiple network switches and variable capacity network connections.
- VNAS may be used to implement a data restoration and/or security system.
- a fail-over condition may be detected on the first computer, e.g., related to the first processor, the first storage medium, or other component of the first computer.
- the term “fail-over condition” may refer to an impending failure of a component, to the component failure itself, or to a condition of a computer that requires attention.
- a computer that indicates a fail-over condition may be referred to as a “failed” computer, even if an actual component failure has not occurred.
- detection of a fail-over condition may occur before an actual failure, or may occur during or after the failure (detection of the fail-over condition).
- a fail-over condition may indicate failure of a processor, impending failure of a processor, or even that the performance, e.g., the processing capability, of the computer needs to be upgraded or modified.
- various actions may be taken to restore, replace, or improve, functionality of the failed computer, e.g., by switching the user (i.e., the user's interface) to a replacement computer, where the replacement computer has a copy of at least a portion of the contents of the first computer's storage medium, i.e., the first computer's information (which may include programs).
- the information may be copied to the replacement computer prior to, during, and/or after, the detection of the fail-over condition.
- the first storage medium and/or the second storage medium may store program instructions executable by the first processor and/or the second processor to detect a fail-over condition of the first computer and copy information from the first storage medium onto the second storage medium.
- the information from the first storage medium may be copied onto a third computer having a third processor and a third storage medium.
- the information may be copied from the first storage medium prior to or after detection of the fail-over condition.
- the second computer is considered to be the replacement computer.
- the information from the first computer may be stored on the storage mediums of the second and third computers (and/or others of the plurality of computers). If the first computer indicates a fail-over condition, a peripheral switch may switch a peripheral device from the first computer over to the second computer.
- the second computer may access the information for the first computer from the second storage medium and the third storage medium. In other words, the information may be distributed over the second and third computers, but may be accessible as if stored on a single (virtual) storage medium.
- the information on the second computer and the third computer may be organized (e.g., copied) onto either the second computer or the third computer to have the information from the first computer collected onto one computer.
- the peripheral switch may then switch the peripheral device from the first computer over to the computer with the organized copy.

It is noted that the systems shown in FIGS. 4 a , 4 b , 4 c , and 4 d are meant to be exemplary and are not intended to limit the system or method to any particular number of computers. As shown in FIG. 4 a , in one embodiment, to prepare for a failure of computer blade 401 , the information from a storage medium on the computer blade 401 may be copied (i.e., backed up) onto a storage medium on the computer blade 403 .
- a first portion of the information on the computer blade 401 may be located in the random access memory (RAM) of the first computer blade 401 and a second portion of the information may be located on a hard drive of the computer blade 401 .
- RAM random access memory
- Other locations of information from the computer blade 401 may also be within the scope of the invention. If the computer blade 401 fails or indicates a fail-over condition, a peripheral device coupled to the computer blade 401 through a peripheral switch may be switched over to the computer blade 403 through the peripheral switch, thereby enabling a user of computer blade 401 to continue accessing the information (originally) from computer blade 401 (but now on computer blade 403 ).
- the information originating from computer blade 401 may also be copied onto the storage medium of computer blade 405 .
- the peripheral switch may also be operable to switch the peripheral device over to computer blade 405 in the event that both computer blades 401 and 403 fail.
- a backup processor may be switched over to the computer blade 401 to access and run off of the storage medium on the computer blade 401 .
- information from a backup computer blade may be copied over to a backup storage medium, and the components of the computer blade 401 may access the backup storage medium.
- the information on the storage medium of computer blade 403 may be copied onto the storage mediums of computer blade 401 and 405 .
- the information on the storage medium of computer 405 may be copied onto the storage mediums of computer blade 401 and 403 , as shown in FIG. 4 c .
- various of the computer blades may provide backup storage for one another.
- the computer blade 401 may detect and determine identities of one or more local computer blades, such as, but not limited to computer blades 403 and 405 , on a subnet. Once detected, the computer blade identities may be stored and cached for later access on the computer blade 401 .
- the detected computer blades to be used in backing up a computer blade may be assigned automatically or manually. In one embodiment, e.g., through an administration interface, computer blades may be assigned to each other at any time.
- a “replication factor” configuration value may define how many other computer blades to send copies of the information on the computer blade to be backed up.
- the computer blade 405 may detect the computer blades 401 and 403 and then choose the computer blade 401 and the computer blade 403 as computer blades to send backups to. If the computer blade 405 has a fail-over condition, either the computer blade 401 or the computer blade 403 may be used to restore information to the computer blade 405 , or used to send the information originating from the computer blade 405 to a replacement computer blade.
- the computer blades in one subnet may be backed up to computer blades on another subnet.
- the computer blades in one subnet may be able to detect the computer blades in another subnet, and then the configuration of which computer blades are used to back up other computer blades between the two subnets may be performed, e.g., by an administrator or automatically.
- a web based configuration interface may allow computer blades to be assigned or reassigned to remote computer blades, including blades on other subnets.
- Computer blades may backup with neighboring computer blades, computer blades in a same building, and/or computer blades in a remote location.
- computer blades may be backed up to both geographically local computer blades and geographically remote computer blades. The local computer blades may provide quicker restoration on a replacement computer blade and remote computer blades may provide increased security and reliability.
- backed up information can be copied to a replacement computer blade from the local computer blade without having to copy information from the remote computer blade. Copying information from the remote computer blade may take longer than from the local computer blade. If multiple computer blades at a site have a fail-over condition, (e.g., if both the first computer blade and the local computer blade with the backup fail) the remote computer blade may have a copy of the information from the first computer blade to copy to a replacement computer blade.
- several local computer blades may backup to a single remote computer blade.
- the local computer blades may also be backed up to other local computer blades. Having one remote computer blade to backup to may make the remote backups more manageable.
- the single remote computer blade handling multiple backups may be more powerful than a remote computer blade handling one backup.
- the remote computer blade may be managed through a web-based management interface. In one embodiment, the web-based management interface may be used by an administrator to schedule snapshots and manage configuration settings.
- the information on computer blade 401 may be backed up in a snapshot method in which all of the information to be copied is bulk copied at specified refresh times, where refresh times may indicate particular times to refresh (e.g., every hour on the hour, once per day at 3:00 a.m., etc.), or may indicate intervals between successive refreshes.
- a refresh time may be an hour such that the information is bulk copied from the first storage medium onto the second and/or third storage medium once per hour.
- a delta method may be used to copy the information from the first storage medium, where only a difference between a previous copy of the information copied to the second and/or third storage medium and the current information on the first storage medium is added to the second and/or third storage medium.
- the delta method may take less time to update but it is conceivable that space required on the storage medium of computer blade 403 may grow to very large proportions because the delta method may keep adding information without removing deleted information.
- the first time the delta method is used it may function analogously to the snapshot method because the initial copy may encompass all the information from the storage medium on the computer blade 401 .
- the growth of archived data is automatically managed by the “aging” feature which removes archives or deltas older than a user-defined time period.
- the computer blade 401 may continue to backup to the computer blade 403 . If the computer blade 401 is using a delta method, incremental backups on a computer blade may be tagged and archived. If the computer blade 405 becomes functional again, a peersync method may be used to update the last incremental backups from the computer blade 401 to the computer blade 405 . For example, if the computer blade 401 backs up information from the computer blade 401 onto the computer blade 405 using a delta method, the computer blade 405 may have missed several incremental backups (i.e.
- the computer blade 401 may send the computer blade 405 a catalog of past incremental backups.
- the computer blade 405 may compare the catalog to the incremental backups the computer blade 405 currently has and then query the computer blade 401 for the incremental backups the computer blade 405 needs to become current.
- an archive of the past incremental backups may be sent along with the catalog, and the computer blade 405 may not query the computer blade 401 for the incremental backups. Instead, the computer blade 405 may pull the needed incremental backups from the archives.
- information being written to the storage medium of the computer blade 401 may also be written to the computer blade 403 at substantially the same time. In other words, rather than backing up the information after it has been written to computer blade 401 , the information writes may be performed effectively in parallel, or at least in conjunction.
- the peripheral switch may switch the peripheral device over to the computer blade 403 .
- the information on the storage medium on computer blade 403 (which may mimic or replicate the information on the storage medium of the failed computer blade 401 ) may be copied onto the computer blade 405 .
- the peripheral switch may switch the peripheral device from the computer blade 401 over to the computer blade 405 .
- computer blade 405 is used as the replacement computer blade, and so the backed-up information is copied to computer blade 405 and the peripheral device switched from the failed computer blade 401 to the replacement computer blade 405 .
- the hard drives on the computer blades 401 , 403 , and 405 may share memory space using a virtual network storage space (VNAS) system incorporating a decentralized peer-to-peer sharing process.
- VNAS virtual network storage space
- Information stored on the computer blade 401 may also be stored on computer blades 403 and 405 . If the computer blade 401 fails, a peripheral switch may switch a peripheral device from computer blade 401 over to computer blade 403 . For example, computer blade 403 may then access the information originally stored on or associated with the computer blade 401 from the storage medium of computer blade 403 and the third storage medium of computer blade 405 .
- the information originally stored on the failed computer blade 401 may be distributed over the computer blades 403 and 405 , but may be accessible (to replacement computer blade 403 ) as if stored on a single (virtual) storage medium.
- the (backed-up) information stored on the computer blades 403 and the 405 may be organized (e.g., copied) onto the replacement computer blade 403 to have the information from the failed computer blade 401 collected onto one computer.
- the peripheral switch may then switch the peripheral device from the first computer over to the computer with the organized or collected copy.
- failure management software may execute to redirect information reads and information writes directed at the failed hard drive to an operating hard drive until a replacement computer or replacement hard drive is brought into service.
- the backup copy of the lost information may already be on a replacement disk.
- the entire process is transparent to the user, i.e., the user may not notice the failure of the computer blade.
- the computer blades 401 , 403 , and 405 may use failure information backup in a virtual network attached storage (VNAS) system.
- VNAS virtual network attached storage
- the information may exist in multiple locations across the VNAS system composed of computer blades 401 , 403 , and 405 , such that an occurrence of a failed computer blade 403 does not result in the loss of vital information from the failed computer blade 403 .
- Other information backup strategies may also be within the scope of the invention to ensure information redundancy. For example, other RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) levels may be used.
- an underlying distributed computer infrastructure may be used to distribute resources among the computer blades. DCI is further described with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24 .
- Each computer blade may be assigned a number of “peer” or neighbor computer blades that may be used to backup information from the storage medium of a computer blade.
- “Peer” computer blades such as, but not limited to, computer blades 403 and computer blade 405 , may be assigned to a nearby computer blade 401 .
- computer blades may be backed up onto computer blades at a remote location. For example, multiple groups of computer blades at multiple locations may be backed up to a one or more central locations, such as, but not limited to disaster recovery centers, with replacement computer blades.
- backups to the disaster recovery center may be scheduled so that multiple groups of computer blades can coordinate their backups.
- a disaster recovery system may provide a central location for a group of moving computer blades to use for initialization. For example, several moving field hospitals using computer blades with the same set of programs and user preferences may initialize their computer blades from a central location of computer blades.
- FIG. 5 Restoring a Failed Computer Blade Onto a Backup Computer Blade
- an embodiment of restoring or rebuilding a failed computer blade's functionality (e.g., computer blade 403 ) onto a backup computer blade (e.g., computer blade 501 ) is shown.
- the failed computer blade 403 may have a fail-over condition such as a fatal hard drive crash or a short-circuit on the motherboard 207 .
- rebuilding a desktop experience may include identifying a replacement computer blade 501 to use, switching via the connector cable 153 (shown in FIG. 1 ) to the user's desktop connector, and loading failed computer blade information from either the first computer blade 401 or (assuming a previous backup to computer blade 405 ) from third computer blade 405 .
- the fail-over condition of computer blade 403 may be detected and signaled automatically by computer blade 403 , or by computer blades 401 and/or 405 . Other signals and other sources may also be within the scope of the invention.
- the information originating from the computer blade 401 may include user preferences. Including the user preferences with the information to be copied to another computer blade 403 may enable a move manager application and/or a switch manager application (or equivalent) to seamlessly provide a replacement computer blade (e.g., computer blade 501 ) with a similar look, feel, and functionality as a computer blade that has a fail-over condition.
- the move manager as discussed below, may implement the transfer of information from one computer blade to another computer blade.
- the switch manager application may implement switching a first peripheral from a first computer blade to a replacement computer blade.

- reconnecting a user's peripheral devices e.g., keyboard 123 (see FIG. 1 ), mouse 125 , and monitor 127 , may include identifying replacement computer blade 501 , loading the failed computer blade 403 information onto the replacement computer blade 501 from either the first computer blade 401 or the third computer blade 405 , and establishing a connection between the user's peripheral devices and the replacement computer blade 501 , such as via a soft switch (not shown).
- a replacement computer blade 501 may have the standard operating system and applications already stored on it.
- the peripheral device for the user's computer blade may be switched over to the replacement computer blade and the user may begin using the applications already stored on the replacement computer blade.
- Backup information may be restored to the replacement computer blade in the background, and while the user uses applications already stored on the replacement computer blade, writes the user performs may be diverted to the replacement computer blade.
- first computer 401 may have a first processor and a first storage medium coupled to the first processor.
- the first storage medium may be a medium including but not limited to a random access memory and a hard disk drive.
- Second computer 403 may have a second processor and a second storage medium coupled to the second processor.
- a communication link e.g., a bus (not shown), may couple the first computer 401 to the second computer 403 .
- a peripheral switch may be coupled to the first computer 401 and the second computer 403 and may route signals from a human interface, such as but not limited to a first peripheral device coupled to the first computer 401 , to the first computer 401 through a peripheral device port coupled to the first computer 401 .
- the second storage medium on the second computer 403 may store program instructions executable by the second processor to detect a fail-over condition of the first computer 401 and copy information from the first storage medium onto the second storage medium, thereby making the information accessible by the second processor. Part of or substantially all of the information on the first storage medium may be copied onto the second storage medium.
- the peripheral switch may be configured to route signals between the first peripheral device and the second computer to make the second processor and the second storage device accessible by the first peripheral device.
- copying information from the first storage medium to the second storage medium and routing signals from the first peripheral device to the second processor may occur without user input to trigger the copying and routing, i.e., the data fail-over process may be performed programmatically.
- the copying and re-routing may be transparent to a user of the first computer 401 .
- the peripheral switch may switch the signals from the first peripheral device targeted to the first computer 401 over to the second computer 403 without a user input to trigger the switching.
- the first processor may simply access the second storage medium (e.g., of the second computer 403 ) instead of switching the first peripheral device to the second processor (e.g., the second computer blade 403 ).
- the second processor may simply access the first storage medium and the first peripheral switch may be switched over to the second processor.
- the storage medium on the second computer 403 may store program instructions executable by the second processor to copy information from the first storage medium onto the second storage medium to make the information accessible by the second processor before the second processor detects a fail-over condition of the first computer 401 .
- Part of or substantially all of the information on the first storage medium may be copied onto the second storage medium, where the information may be stored (and optionally updated) until a fail-over condition (of the first computer 401 ) is detected.
- the information may be stored on additional storage mediums, e.g., in case the second computer also has a failure, e.g., a hard disk crash.
- the information from the first storage medium may be repeatedly copied onto the second storage medium to keep the information on the second storage medium current with the current state of the first storage medium.
- the information on the first storage medium may be copied over the previously copied information from the first storage medium on the second storage medium.
- the information from the first storage medium may be initially copied onto the second storage medium, and then subsequent changes to the information on the first storage medium may be stored onto the second storage medium over time. The information on the first storage medium may then be reconstructed using the initial copy stored and the subsequent changes. Periodically, the initial copy and subsequent changes may be overwritten with a new copy of the information on the first storage medium, e.g., to prevent the stored subsequent changes from filling up the second storage medium.
- the first storage medium may also use space on the second storage medium to store information not stored on the first storage medium, e.g., may use the space for purposes other than backup.
- the first computer 401 may keep a record of the location of the extra information stored on the second storage medium.
- the information from the first computer 401 may also be stored on other storage mediums, e.g., on other computers.

- the third storage medium may store program instructions executable by the third processor to copy (i.e., backup) information from the first storage medium onto the third storage medium.
- the program instructions may be further executable by the third processor to detect a fail-over condition of the first computer 401 , and to copy information from the third storage medium to the second storage medium so that the information is accessible by the second processor.
- the peripheral switch may then operate to route signals between the first peripheral device and the second processor if the first computer 401 fails.
- the third storage medium may not be comprised in the third computer, e.g., computer 405 , but may be coupled to the communication link as a substantially independent networked resource.
- the second computer 403 may copy information from the first storage medium (e.g., from the first computer 401 ) onto the third storage medium.
- the second computer 403 may backup information from the first computer 401 onto the third storage medium.
- information from the third storage medium (that was originally on the first computer 401 ) may be copied to the second storage medium to make the information accessible by the second processor, i.e., by the replacement computer 403 .
- the peripheral switch may then route the signals from the first peripheral device to the second computer 403 .

- three archives each representing a file or set of files in a backup, may be listed in archive contents listings 1303 , 1305 , and 1307 , along with sizes 1308 , names 1304 , and time of each archive 1306 .
- a “View Contents” button 1309 , 1313 , and 1315 may be placed next to each entry.
- the “View Contents” button 1309 , 1313 , and 1315 may be clicked to view contents of each archives
- a next button may control sequential restoration.
- each archive may represent changes between two points in time (e.g., an archive created at 12 p.m.
- the backups may represent changes that occurred to files between the time of a last backup at 10 p.m. and 12 p.m.).
- the backups may be used to restore a computer blade to the last archived state of the computer blade, or the backups may be used for controlled rollbacks to earlier versions.
- the backups may be used for controlled rollbacks if addition of some information to the backup resulted in the corruption of important files or documents.
- the button when the “Recover Sequentially to this archive” button 1317 , 1319 , and 1321 is clicked for a particular archive in a backup, the button may cause a restoration of each archive up to and including the selected archives. For example, if archives A, B, C, D, E, and F, are displayed (not shown), clicking on archive D may result in A, B, C and D being restored to a replacement computer blade. However, if there are additional archives, E and F, they will not be restored. The administrator may return to this view and choose further restoration for E, or both E and F. In addition, in one embodiment, the restoration to a replacement computer blade may be non-destructive.
- the restoration may overwrite existing files when their names clash with files present in a restored archive
- the restoration may not delete files that do not exist at all in the restored archives. For example, if files X, Y and Z are present in a next archive to restore to a replacement computer blade in a sequential restoration, and prior to restoring the next archive, older versions of X and Y, and a completely different file, W, have already been copied over to the replacement computer blade from previous archives, the restore process may overwrite files X and Y with archived versions of X and Y, may create a new file Z, and may not alter file W.
- the button may cause a restoration of each archive up to and including the selected archives For example, if archives A, B, C, D, E, and F, are displayed (not shown), clicking on archive D may result in A, B, C and D being restored to a replacement computer blade. However, if there are additional archives, E and F, they will not be restored. The administrator may return to this view and choose further restoration for E, or both E and F.
- the restoration to a replacement computer blade may be non-destructive.
- the restoration may overwrite existing files when their names clash with files present in a restored archive
- the restoration may not delete files that do not exist at all in the restored archives. For example, if files X, Y and Z are present in a next archive to restore to a replacement computer blade in a sequential restoration, and prior to restoring the next archive, older versions of X and Y, and a completely different file, W, have already been copied over to the replacement computer blade from previous archives, the restore process may overwrite files X and Y with archived versions of X and Y, may create a new file Z, and may not alter file W.
- files may be replicated throughout the network at various storage devices that participate in the VNAS cluster. If one of the underlying VNAS storage devices fails, any requests for data on the failed device may be redirected to a functioning machine having a copy of the requested data. This redirection may be handled in a way that is transparent to the user. Thus, the information recovery view 1301 may be little-used in many circumstances where VNAS is utilized and the replication factor is sufficient to provide adequate copies of data.

- FIGS. 18 - 21 Move Manager Embodiments
- a move manager may provide the ability to undertake individual, workgroup, or department-level hardware moves. Move manager may be used when a fail-over condition is detected on a computer blade to restore the computer blade to a replacement computer blade. Move manager may also migrate an operating system, applications, and information from a user's old computer blade to a new computer blade without detecting a fail-over condition. In one embodiment, move manager may provide the ability to schedule moves to prevent network saturation during peak work hours.
- a scriptable interface may allow an administrator to control a move process and insert custom tasks or activities they would like to execute prior to initiating the move process, or upon the completion of a move. The move manager may also allow a system administrator to use a scriptable interface to add custom tasks to a move process.
- the move process may include one or more of a one-to-one move, a cascading move, and a swap move, as discussed below.
- FIG. 18 A One-to-one Move
- FIG. 18 illustrates a one-to-one move, according to two embodiments.
- a single user of an existing computer e.g., an old computer blade 1801
- a user of a legacy Whitebox PC 1803 may be moved or switched to new computer blade 1807 .
- the user may be moved for a hardware upgrade or unreliable performance of existing hardware.
- User preferences (such as desktop settings and icons) may be combined with other information and transferred over a network to the new computer blades 1805 and 1807 as a series of backup files (e.g., collected in archives or as “snapshots”).
- the backup files may be compressed packages for network transmission.
- a delta backup method as discussed above, may be used.
- a first computer may be switched to the second computer in a one to one move by copying at least a portion of the information from the first computer to the second computer and switching the first peripheral device over to the second computer using the peripheral switch.
- FIG. 19 Clicking Move
- a cascade move may be performed. For example, if a new powerful computer is added to the network, multiple users may be upgraded to computers more powerful than their currently assigned machines, e.g., based on computation needs, seniority, etc., where, for example, user A gets moved to the new computer, user B gets moved to user A's old computer, user C gets moved to user B's old computer, and so on.
- the information from the first computer may be copied to the second computer (user A's old computer) while the information from the second computer (user A's old computer) is copied onto a third computer (the new computer).
- a peripheral switch may switch the first peripheral (i.e., user B's human interface) over to the second computer and may switch the second peripheral (i.e., user A's human interface) over to the third computer.
- Other switches may also be within the scope of the invention.
- a single peripheral switch may provide switching for all of the human interfaces.
- the system may include a peripheral switch for each of a number of subsets of the computers/human interfaces.
- FIG. 19 illustrates an embodiment of a cascading move where pairs of old computers are upgraded, possibly in parallel.
- old computer blades 1903 and 1909 may be moved to new computer blades 1905 and 1911 , respectively.
- Computers older than old computer blades 1903 and 1909 such as computer blade 1901 and legacy Whitebox PC 1907 , may be moved onto the old computer blades 1903 and 1909 , respectively.
- Other computers may also be within the scope of the invention.
- a cascading move may be managed between a first computer, a second computer, and a third computer.
- a copy of at least a portion of the information from the first computer may be copied onto the storage medium of the second computer.
- Information from the second computer may be copied onto a third computer.
- the peripheral switch may route signals from the first peripheral device to the second computer and from the second peripheral device to the third computer.
- a cascading move may be performed for more than three computers.
- FIG. 20 Shown: Move
- a fail-over condition may include an indication of a need to swap the first computer with the second computer, e.g., to improve performance for a user, or to change environments (e.g., from Microsoft Windows to Apple MacOS). For example, if the second computer is a higher performing computer, and the user of the first computer needs more computational power than the user of the second computer, the computers assigned to each user may be swapped. In other words, the first computer (or another computer) may copy the information from the first computer over to the second computer, and the second computer (or another computer) may copy the information from the second computer onto the first computer.
- a peripheral switch may swap the human interfaces for the respective computers, e.g., by routing signals from a first peripheral device (originally routed to the first computer) to the second computer, and from a second peripheral device (originally routed to the second computer) to the first computer.
- FIG. 20 illustrates a swap move, according to one embodiment.
- a swap move may be used to equalize or adjust the use of resources in a network (e.g., to put more demanding users with faster computer blades).
- the computer blades may be switched by two users, such as computer blades 2001 and 2003 .
- Information such as, but not limited to, applications and settings from one computer blade 2001 , may be present on another computer blade 2003 , post move, and vice-versa.
- information from one of the computer blades 2005 and 2007 performing a switch may be stored in a temporary third location to preserve the target computer blade 2007 while the switching computer blade 2005 overwrites the target computer blade's information.
- an intermediate image server 2009 (based on PXE technology) may be used.
- Large-scale moves may also be within the scope of the invention. In moving multiple computer blades, moves may be scheduled for Operating System settings, profiles, applications, and user information from old computer blades to new computer blades.
- a swap move at least a portion of the information from the storage medium of the first computer may be stored onto the storage medium of second computer, and at least a portion of the information from the storage medium of the second computer may be stored onto the storage medium of said first computer.
- the peripheral switch may switch the signal routing from the first peripheral device to the first computer to route to the second computer and the signal routing from the second peripheral device to the second computer to route to the first computer.
- FIG. 21 Flowchart of a Move Process
- FIG. 21 flowcharts an initiation and process of a single computer move, according to one embodiment. It should be noted that in various embodiments of the method described below, one or more of the steps described may be performed concurrently, in a different order than shown, or may be omitted entirely. Other additional steps may also be performed as desired.
- a move may be initiated, e.g., by a system administrator, or programmatically, i.e., automatically.
- the move may be initiated as a result of one or more operation rules, or the system administrator may initiate the move from a move manager web console or other user interface.
- source and target computer blades may be tagged.
- one or more source/target pairs may be specified where information from each source computer is to be moved to the respective target computer, and/or one or more respective peripheral devices are to be switched from each source computer to the respective target computer.
- a move may be scheduled.
- a schedule may be set to activate an image/backup process and move process at night to avoid any network saturation or other inconveniences during the work day.
- the scheduled move may be performed.
- at least a portion of the information from the source computer may be moved to the target computer, and any peripheral devices comprised in the human interface for the source computer may be switched to the target computer.
- any of the various moves described above may follow a similar process.
- FIGS. 22 and 23 Distributed Computing Infrastructure
- intelligent reconfiguration may be conducted for an enterprise-wide computing resources based on observed usage trends for individual computer blades.
- the latest and most powerful hardware is assigned to the newest employee simply as a function of the employee and the hardware arriving at roughly the same time. This may result in a disparate and inequitable assignment of resources across the enterprise.
- An engineer or developer with greater resource requirements could find himself equipped with an old machine, whereas a casual or non-power user could be using a more capable machine.
- the hardware platform shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 due to its dense configuration and increased manageability, may provide a highly effective clustering solution.
- a Distributed Computing Infrastructure adds to these underlying capabilities by providing a software platform for creating, running, and managing distributed applications.
- the DCI software solution includes a framework that provides a variety of management and deployment functions for creating and running large-scale distributed applications.
- DCI may be implemented using a Java-based framework.
- the infrastructure is not dependent on the presence of a server and therefore eliminates a single point bottleneck that often slows performance of distributed applications.
- the DCI solution is primarily designed to make it easy for domain specialists (biologists, mathematicians, etc.) to re-leverage existing code modules, scripts, and applications and adapt them to make use of the immense power of cluster solutions.
- DCI may provide all or part of the following functionality:
- DCI may provide a windowed, graphical interface that can help visualize computational results or monitor progress of multiple jobs in a single environment.
- applications may make use of the built in communications, directory, and XML routing capabilities of the underlying infrastructure. These applications would ordinarily be large and complex and would have to either utilize cryptic APIs such as MPI or contain implementations of sophisticated message passing and communications technology.
- DCI eliminates most of this development and management overhead and provides a simple and consistent environment to develop, deploy, and manage distributed or cluster capable applications.
- FIG. 22 is a block diagram illustrating a DCI architecture according to one embodiment.
- Each of two or more computer blades 101 runs an operating system (OS) 2302 .
- the OS 2302 handles basic tasks like networking over TCP/IP.
- Each DCI-enabled computer system on the network 115 may include a DCI stack.
- the DCI stack may include the core DCI framework 2304 , one or more peerlet APIs 2306 , and one or more peerlets 2308 .
- Peerlets 2308 are applications that provide functions on DCI-enabled computers. For example, chat, whiteboard, and other collaborative applications may be implemented as peerlets that can take advantage of DCI. In some cases, peerlets can implement functionality themselves. Peerlets may also be “shells” that are used to invoke functionality provided by other pieces of software. Specific peerlet APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 2306 provide an interface between the core DCI framework 2304 and specific peerlets. In one embodiment, peerlets are not network-aware but rather pass requests for network activity to the DCI framework 2304 .
- DCI may enable applications that were not originally designed for distributed computing to be executed in a distributed manner.
- DCI may utilize an existing web browser without new integration code in the following manner.
- a user may request the retrieval of a web page from a remote web server (e.g., a news story from a news website), the combination of that web page with locally generated data (e.g., editorial comments from the user on the news story), and the storage of the combination on a database server.
- the user computer A may unicast a message to a web browser program on computer B to retrieve the web page.
- the output may be returned to computer A.
- Computer A may then combine the news story with the editorial comments in an XML message. This message may then be unicast to a command-line database program on computer C for storage in a database.
- DCI uses peer-to-peer message passing with no intermediary server.
- FIG. 23 is a flowchart illustrating a method for DCI message-passing according to one embodiment.
- a peerlet on computer A generates a message to be sent to computer B.
- a user may instruct a chat peerlet on computer A to request a chat session with a user on computer B or send a chat message in an ongoing, active chat session to a user on computer B.
- messages may include text and/or other data and metadata as well as requests to invoke the functionality of an application on another DCI-enabled computer.
- the DCI framework may transform the message to an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format.
- the XML message may include the “payload” (i.e., the actual message to be delivered to the user on computer B) as well as a plurality of metadata elements.
- the metadata elements may include, for example, the type of application that send the message, the GUID (globally unique ID) of the instance of the application, and the sender.
- the DCI framework may log the XML message.
- all tasks that have been reduced to XML messages may be logged to a message queue in archivable form.
- the XML messages in the queue may be sorted by application type, sender, receiver, etc. Activities may be replayed through the use of the logged XML messages.
- the XML message may be sent over the network from computer A to computer B.
- the XML metadata may include a TTL value indicating the total number of allowable “hops” before the message is considered undeliverable. This value is decremented with each network hop; when the value reaches zero, DCI may consider the message to be expired.
- a value in excess of a maximum value (e.g., 9) may be reset to that maximum value.
- a DCI “listener” in the core DCI framework on computer B may receive the XML message.
- the DCI listener may utilize a UDP server to listen for incoming packets over an IP-based network connection.
- UDP rather than TCP may allow for the rapid shipment of packets without the overhead of TCP.
- the UDP server may be multi-threaded for increased scalability and improved response time.
- the actual communication between DCI-enabled computers may use a more reliable mechanism such as TCP.
- DCI may process the message, for example, to deliver its payload and/or invoke the requested functionality.
- the DCI framework 2304 B may determine the type of application that sent the incoming message using the XML metadata. If there is no application currently executing on computer B that can receive the message, the DCI framework 2304 B may invoke an instance of the relevant application (e.g., a peerlet 2308 B) on computer B. In one embodiment, DCI 2304 B may queue the incoming message until the relevant application has started up. DCI 2304 B may then transmit the queued message to the application.
- FIGS. 24 and 25 Virtual Storage Using Excess Distributed Storage Capacity
- VNAS Virtual Network Attached Storage
- a Virtual Network Attached Storage (VNAS) system may be used to aggregate storage capacity from a number of blades and re-expose the aggregated storage to the network as one or more virtual volumes.
- VNAS may therefore allow the construction of secure and scalable storage solutions. Not only may the mean time between failures (MTBF) for the overall solution be extended as a result of replication, but the ability to stripe data across drives may also result in increased speed of access.
- MTBF mean time between failures
- With storage pooling under VNAS unused network storage capacity may be salvaged, treated as a single volume, and provided to network-connected workstations.
- the VNAS solution can stripe a single file across multiple physical drives residing in multiple blades, thus enabling parallel access for a single file-level object, and thus reducing overall access times.
- the VNAS architecture is based on a collection of “store nodes” which may include ordinary desktops or workstations.
- the store nodes contribute their excess disk capacity to the VNAS volume.
- Mount points including computers such as desktop PCs, may allow a user to point to a single hostname (from a list of several) to “mount” and view the VNAS volume.
- VNAS supports industry-standard protocols (e.g., DAV) which negate the need for any special software to be installed on a typical PC desktop in order for the user to browse the VNAS volume.
- DAV industry-standard protocols
- mount points may also act as local caches. For example, if a user in one department requests a document that is stored on store nodes physically located three switches away, that access may result in a copy of the document being cached on the closest mount point cache.
- This “auto-caching” capability may result in frequently accessed data being replicated at local points of presence, therefore minimizing the load on store nodes, minimizing network traffic, and reducing latencies of access resulting from multiple switch traversals.
- pooled storage under VNAS may be exposed to the end-user as a simple folder, directory, volume, or other unit of storage. Users may interact with the VNAS folder (e.g., to drag and drop files) just like they would interact with a regular folder
- VNAS may be managed through a web-browser interface or other graphical user interface. Examples of browser-based interface screens are shown in FIGS. 9 through 14 . Management of VNAS may include storage usage policies, file finding, node maintenance, node removal, and virtual volume maintenance.
- FIG. 24 illustrates a VNAS architecture according to one embodiment.
- the DCI framework 2304 A discussed with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24 may run on top of an operating system 2302 A.
- VNAS 2320 may utilize the distributed computing infrastructure for communication with other blades.
- custom VNAS software need not be present on clients in one embodiment,
- VNAS uses industry-standard communications protocols 2322 such as DAV and HTTP to enable load balancing and scalability.
- FIG. 25 is a flowchart illustrating a method for using VNAS to assist in data restoration, according to one embodiment.
- the virtual network attached storage system may be configured for use. As discussed above, this configuration may include coupling the computers to the VNAS system and/or configuring a resource manager.
- the resource manager may manage the VNAS system, including write and striping rules.
- the resource manager may be located on one or more of the computers coupled to the VNAS system.
- the data and other configuration may be saved across one or more computers in the VNAS system according to the rules set up by the resource manager.
- Each one of the plurality of computers coupled to the VNAS system may be involved in storing the data for the other computers.
- the VNAS system may check if all of the computers comprised in the VNAS system are functioning properly.
- the VNAS system may determine one or more failed computers as well as one or more replacement computers.
- the vital data on the one or more failed computers is distributed across one or more computers comprised in the VNAS system.
- the VNAS system may access the one or more computers comprised in the VNAS system in order to retrieve the vital data for the one or more replacement computers.
- Suitable carrier media may include storage media or memory media such as magnetic or optical media, e.g., disk or CD-ROM, as well as transmission media or signals such as electrical, electromagnetic, or digital signals, conveyed via a communication medium such as a network and/or a wireless link.
