Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to processing audio signals and, more particularly, to methods and devices for audio signals including voice or speech.
- speech recognition has been around for decades, the quality of speech recognition software and hardware has only recently reached a high enough level to appeal to a large number of consumers.
- One area in which speech recognition has become very popular in recent years is the smartphone and tablet computer industry.
- a speech recognition-enabled device a consumer can perform such tasks as making phone calls, writing emails, and navigating with GPS, strictly by voice.
- Speech recognition in such devices is far from perfect, however.
- the user may need to “train” the speech recognition software to recognize his or her voice.
- the speech recognition functions may not work well in all sound environments.
- An unintended call that is placed may results from inaccurate voice recognition of audio that is captured. Occurrences of these types of calls could result in negative financial, legal and social implications, and may lead to user avoiding the use of a voice recognition system for making calls.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile device, according to an embodiment
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of example components of a mobile device, according to an embodiment
- FIG. 3 , FIG. 4 , and FIG. 5 illustrate a process flow of a method for validating a command phrase that may be performed by the mobile device of FIG. 1 , according to an embodiment
- FIG. 6 is a process flow of a method for automatically dialing a priority contact that may be performed by the mobile device of FIG. 1 , according to an embodiment
- FIG. 7 is a process flow of a method for automatically dialing a phone number that may be performed by the mobile device of FIG. 1 , according to an embodiment.
- Avoidance of placing of unintended calls is particularly relevant for mobile devices that provide an “always on” voice recognition system.
- the mobile device may be configured to monitor or listen for a trigger phrase spoken by a user of the mobile device, followed by a command phrase. Trigger phrases spoken by the user, such as “OK, Google Now” may be previously “learned” in a training session for the mobile device; however, the trigger phrase may be incorrectly identified due to various factors, such as background noise or obstructions between the user and the mobile device.
- the command phrase for placing a call includes a call command and a call parameter.
- the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Call Bob on his cell phone.” In this case, “OK Google Now” is the trigger phrase, “Call” is the call command, and “Bob on his cell phone” is the call parameter.
- the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Call Charlie.” In this case, the trigger phrase and call command are the same as the previous example, but the call parameter is simply “Charlie.”
- the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Dial 1-800-555-1234.” In this case, “OK Google Now” is the trigger phrase, “Dial” is the call command, and “1-800-555-1234” is the call parameter.
- the various embodiments described herein allow a mobile device to validate the command phrase for placing a call. For example, if the call parameter is readily recognized as “Charlie”, the mobile device may validate the command phrase by searching an address book. If the address book includes a frequently called contact with a name of “Charlie”, the mobile device may automatically place a call to that contact without further action by the user. Alternatively, if the call parameter is recognized as spoken digits such as “1-800-555-1234”, the mobile device may validate the digits against a phone numbering plan prior to placing the call.
- a set of target contacts are selected based on respective voice validation scores and respective contact confidence scores.
- a phone call is automatically placed to a priority contact if a voice validation score and contact confidence score for the priority contact meet a validation threshold.
- numeric digits detected in a command phrase are validated as a phone number against a predetermined numbering plan. A call is automatically placed to the phone number if the phone number is validated.

- the command phrase or a portion thereof in one example is buffered in the memory 205 and provided to the processor 203 .
- the command phrase is provided directly to the processor 203 .
- the mobile device 100 determines whether the command phrase includes a call command for a current call. Examples of a call command include “Call”, “Dial”, “Place a call to”, and other words or phrases that will be apparent those skilled in the art.
- the call commands in one example are included in a call command whitelist.
- the mobile device 100 determines a command confidence score for the call command.
- the mobile device 100 analyzes the command phrase or a portion thereof (e.g., only the call command) with a voice recognition engine, such as those provided by Nuance (Nuance Communications, Inc; Burlington, Mass.), or other processing algorithm to determine the command confidence score.
- the command confidence score in this case is a numerical value (e.g., between 0 and 100 with 100 being most confident) that indicates a relative confidence level of the detection of a call command.
- the mobile device 100 in one example provides the call command whitelist and the call command to the voice recognition engine to receive the command confidence score.
- the call command whitelist may be provided to the voice recognition engine prior to the call command (e.g., during installation, configuration, initialization, etc.).
- the mobile device 100 determines ( 304 ) whether the command confidence score meets a command threshold (e.g., is greater than or equal to 40).
- the command confidence score is determined or received as a valid or invalid indication, or a tiered response indication (e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence).
- a command threshold e.g., is greater than or equal to 40.
- the command confidence score is determined or received as a valid or invalid indication, or a tiered response indication (e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence).
- a tiered response indication e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence
- the mobile device 100 may also compare the call command to a list of predetermined words or phrases that may be misidentified as call commands. For example, the mobile device 100 may use a blacklist of words or phrases such as “How tall is . . . ” or “denial” which may be misidentified as “Call” or “Dial”, respectively. If the command phrase is a closer match to the blacklist phrase than to a legitimate call command (e.g., on the whitelist), then the mobile device 100 proceeds to step 306 . Additionally, the mobile device 100 may determine whether the command phrase is located in the middle of a conversation.
- a blacklist of words or phrases such as “How tall is . . . ” or “denial” which may be misidentified as “Call” or “Dial”, respectively. If the command phrase is a closer match to the blacklist phrase than to a legitimate call command (e.g., on the whitelist), then the mobile device 100 proceeds to step 306 . Additionally, the mobile device 100 may determine whether the command phrase is
- the mobile device 100 determines whether an audio length of the command phrase is longer than a predetermined threshold, such as five seconds, to prevent an attempt to validate a user's conversation.
- the mobile device 100 invalidates the call command if the audio length exceeds the predetermined threshold and proceeds to step 306 .
- the mobile device 100 analyzes ( 306 ) the command phrase with a voice command engine (e.g., engines provided by Google Now, Sensory, or Nuance), for example, to provide general command recognition instead of call command validation.
- a voice command engine e.g., engines provided by Google Now, Sensory, or Nuance
- the command confidence score indicates that the call command may have been incorrectly identified. For example, if the command phrase is “How tall is Mount Everest?”, “How tall is” may be recognized as a blacklist phrase, but additional processing by the voice command engine may allow a response to be provided.
- the mobile device 100 determines ( 308 ) whether the call parameter includes spoken digits (e.g., “1-800-555-1234”). If spoken digits are detected (YES at 308 ), the mobile device 100 validates ( 310 ) the spoken digits (e.g., the call parameter) against a predetermined phone numbering plan. Examples of phone numbering plans include the North American Numbering Plan, E.164, satellite phone number plans, or private numbering plans (e.g., for a private branch exchange). The mobile device 100 in one example selects a numbering plan based on its current geographic location (e.g., North America or Europe). In another example, the numbering plan includes a blacklist of phone numbers.
- the blacklist includes phone numbers that should not be automatically dialed, such as emergency response numbers (e.g., 9-1-1), international phone numbers, or phone numbers that may incur additional fees.
- the blacklist may be populated by a wireless service provider, government entity, or by the user of the mobile device 100 . If the call parameter is not validated (NO at 310 ), the mobile device 100 proceeds to step 306 . If the call parameter is validated and thus contains a phone number (YES at 310 ), the mobile device 100 proceeds to step 504 ( FIG. 5 ).
- the mobile device 100 determines a voice validation score for the phone number that indicates a relative confidence level of the detection of phone number (e.g., to avoid mistaken detections such as detecting a “five” as a “nine”).
- the mobile device 100 uses the voice recognition engine for determination of the voice validation score.
- the mobile device 100 validates the call parameter against a set of call contacts, such as an address book associated with the mobile device 100 .
- the mobile device 100 generates ( 312 ) a set of voice validation scores that correspond to the set of call contacts in the address book.
- the voice validation scores indicate a relative confidence level of the detection of the corresponding contact's spoken name.
- the mobile device 100 provides the set of call contacts to the voice recognition engine along with the call parameter.
- the set of call contacts may be provided to the voice recognition engine prior to the call parameter (e.g., during installation, configuration, initialization, etc.).
- the set of voice validation scores in one example are numerical values (e.g., 0 to 100).
- the voice validation score received as a valid or invalid indication, or a tiered response indication (e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence). Other implementations of the voice validation score will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- the mobile device 100 selects ( 314 ) a set of target contacts from the set of call contacts based on the voice validation scores. For example, the mobile device 100 selects only those contacts with a voice validation score within a selected range of a highest voice validation score.
- the user may have call contacts in his address book including Andrea, Brad, Brent, and Charlie. In this case, if the user speaks “OK Google Now, Call Brent at his home”, the voice validation scores may be 0, 85, 95, and 0, respectively. If the selected range is 10, the target contacts are Brad and Brent (Brent having the highest voice validation score of 95). If the selected range is 5, the target contact is only Brent.
- the selected range may be predetermined or dynamically determined by the mobile device 100 (e.g., based on prior voice recognition history). In alternative implementations, the selected range may include “high confidence” voice validation scores or both “high confidence” and “medium confidence” scores. Other selected ranges will be apparent to those skilled in the art, for example, based on the type of voice validation score used.
- the mobile device 100 Once the set of target contacts have been selected (e.g., those with a sufficiently high voice validation score), the mobile device 100 generates a contact confidence score for the target contacts.
- the contact confidence scores indicate a relative importance of the corresponding contact to the user of the mobile device 100 and may be a numbered value (e.g., 0 to 100), a ranked list, or other relative indicator for comparison of the contacts.
- the mobile device 100 in one example generates the contact confidence scores for each of the set of target contacts based on a user context associated with the user.
- the user context of a contact includes one or more of a recency of last communication (e.g., phone calls, text messages, emails, etc.), frequency of communication, placement on a “favorites list” by the user, relation to a calendar event or appointment (e.g., a current calendar event of “Call Brent at 10:00 AM”), or other contextual indicators as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- a recency of last communication e.g., phone calls, text messages, emails, etc.
- frequency of communication e.g., placement on a “favorites list” by the user
- relation to a calendar event or appointment e.g., a current calendar event of “Call Brent at 10:00 AM”
- the mobile device 100 generates the contact confidence scores prior to recognizing ( 312 ) the call command.
- the mobile device 100 may use a context engine that analyzes the user context to update contact confidence scores on a schedule-driven basis (e.g., a predetermined schedule or dynamic schedule) or on an event-driven basis (e.g., when a communication is sent to a contact).
- the mobile device 100 e.g., the context engine
- the context engine in one example is an application or service that is executed by the mobile device 100 .
- the mobile device 100 selects ( 318 ) respective phone numbers for the set of target contacts.
- the call parameter is “Brent at his home”
- the mobile device 100 detects a phone type specified within the call parameter, such as “at his home”.
- the mobile device 100 in one example uses a whitelist of words or phrases that specify phone types, such as for a cell or mobile phone, home phone, business phone, or others as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- the call parameter may not include a phone type and simply identify a contact (e.g., “Call Brent”).
- the mobile device 100 selects a most likely phone number based on the specified phone type (if available) and the user context.
- the mobile device 100 queries the context engine with the specified phone type to receive the most likely phone number. If the specified phone type is not available or if no phone number is received from a query with the specified phone type (e.g., “at his home” but no home phone number is listed in the contact), the mobile device 100 queries without the phone type specified.
- the context engine may provide a most likely number based on user context or selected from a predetermined priority order as available (e.g., mobile phone as highest priority, then home, then work). Where the user context is not available for a contact or if the contact is not on the VIP list, the mobile device 100 selects the phone number based on the predetermined priority order.
- the mobile device 100 determines ( 402 ) whether the set of target contacts contains only a single contact without a specified phone type. In this case (YES at 402 ), the mobile device 100 obtains each of the phone numbers stored (e.g., in the address book) for the single contact and proceeds to step 408 . If the set of target contacts contains more than one contact or has a specified phone type, the mobile device 100 determines ( 406 ) whether a priority contact for the current call has been found, based on the voice validation score, the contact confidence score, or a combination thereof.
- a priority contact is a contact with a voice validation score that meets a validation threshold (e.g., at least 60), a contact confidence score that meets a confidence threshold (e.g., at least 60), or with both thresholds met.
- the mobile device 100 uses a weighting algorithm based on the voice validation score and contact confidence score to provide a higher likelihood of “priority” status for a contact on the VIP list. If the validation and confidence thresholds are met and a priority contact is found, the mobile device 100 proceeds to step 502 ( FIG. 5 ).
- the mobile device 100 sorts the target contacts and phone numbers.

- the mobile device 100 determines ( 502 ) whether the set of target contacts contains a single entry (e.g., a single contact with a single selected phone number). If a single entry is not found (NO at 502 ), the mobile device 100 prompts ( 506 ) the user to indicate that multiple entries (e.g., multiple target contacts or multiple phone numbers) have been found.
- the communication ( 506 ) in one example is a notification that multiple entries have been found and a prompt for further input. In another example, the communication is a list of the multiple entries (or a portion thereof).

- a headset e.g., Bluetooth or wired headset
- the mobile device 100 Upon determination that a priority contact has been found (YES at 504 ), the mobile device 100 communicates ( 516 ) that an automatic call placement is (or will) take place, for example, via the visual or text-to-speech interface (e.g., “Calling Brent at home”). This provides an opportunity for the user to cancel the call prior to automatic placement of the call.
- the mobile device 100 determines ( 518 ) whether the user has canceled the call, for example, within a predetermined timeout period (e.g., four seconds). If the user cancels the call (YES at 518 ), for example, via a spoken command (“Cancel”) or other interaction with the mobile device 100 , the process ends for the current call. If the user does not cancel the call (NO at 518 ), the mobile device 100 automatically places the call to the priority contact.
- a predetermined timeout period e.g., four seconds
- the mobile device 100 prompts ( 520 ) the user with a call confirmation via the visual or text-to-speech interface (e.g., “Should I call Brent at home?” or “Press here to place call”).
- the mobile device 100 determines ( 522 ) whether the user has confirmed the call, for example, within a predetermined timeout period (e.g., ten seconds). If the user confirms the call (YES at 522 ), for example, via a spoken command (“Yes”) or other interaction with the mobile device 100 , the mobile device 100 places ( 514 ) the call. If the user does not confirm the call (NO at 522 ), the process ends for the current call.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates to processing audio signals and, more particularly, to methods and devices for audio signals including voice or speech.
- Although speech recognition has been around for decades, the quality of speech recognition software and hardware has only recently reached a high enough level to appeal to a large number of consumers. One area in which speech recognition has become very popular in recent years is the smartphone and tablet computer industry. Using a speech recognition-enabled device, a consumer can perform such tasks as making phone calls, writing emails, and navigating with GPS, strictly by voice.
- Speech recognition in such devices is far from perfect, however. When using a speech recognition-enabled device for the first time, the user may need to “train” the speech recognition software to recognize his or her voice. Even after training, however, the speech recognition functions may not work well in all sound environments. An unintended call that is placed may results from inaccurate voice recognition of audio that is captured. Occurrences of these types of calls could result in negative financial, legal and social implications, and may lead to user avoiding the use of a voice recognition system for making calls.
- While the appended claims set forth the features of the present techniques with particularity, these techniques, together with their objects and advantages, may be best understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile device, according to an embodiment; -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of example components of a mobile device, according to an embodiment; -
FIG. 3 ,FIG. 4 , andFIG. 5 illustrate a process flow of a method for validating a command phrase that may be performed by the mobile device ofFIG. 1 , according to an embodiment; -
FIG. 6 is a process flow of a method for automatically dialing a priority contact that may be performed by the mobile device ofFIG. 1 , according to an embodiment; -
FIG. 7 is a process flow of a method for automatically dialing a phone number that may be performed by the mobile device ofFIG. 1 , according to an embodiment. - Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, techniques of the present disclosure are illustrated as being implemented in a suitable environment. The following description is based on embodiments of the claims and should not be taken as limiting the claims with regard to alternative embodiments that are not explicitly described herein.
- Avoidance of placing of unintended calls (e.g., “ghost calls”) is particularly relevant for mobile devices that provide an “always on” voice recognition system. In an always-on system, the mobile device may be configured to monitor or listen for a trigger phrase spoken by a user of the mobile device, followed by a command phrase. Trigger phrases spoken by the user, such as “OK, Google Now” may be previously “learned” in a training session for the mobile device; however, the trigger phrase may be incorrectly identified due to various factors, such as background noise or obstructions between the user and the mobile device.
- Validation of the command phrase allows for a reduction in the placement of unintended calls. The command phrase for placing a call includes a call command and a call parameter. As one example, the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Call Bob on his cell phone.” In this case, “OK Google Now” is the trigger phrase, “Call” is the call command, and “Bob on his cell phone” is the call parameter. As another example, the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Call Charlie.” In this case, the trigger phrase and call command are the same as the previous example, but the call parameter is simply “Charlie.” As a third example, the mobile device may detect “OK Google Now, Dial 1-800-555-1234.” In this case, “OK Google Now” is the trigger phrase, “Dial” is the call command, and “1-800-555-1234” is the call parameter.
- The various embodiments described herein allow a mobile device to validate the command phrase for placing a call. For example, if the call parameter is readily recognized as “Charlie”, the mobile device may validate the command phrase by searching an address book. If the address book includes a frequently called contact with a name of “Charlie”, the mobile device may automatically place a call to that contact without further action by the user. Alternatively, if the call parameter is recognized as spoken digits such as “1-800-555-1234”, the mobile device may validate the digits against a phone numbering plan prior to placing the call.
- In one embodiment, a set of target contacts are selected based on respective voice validation scores and respective contact confidence scores. A phone call is automatically placed to a priority contact if a voice validation score and contact confidence score for the priority contact meet a validation threshold.
- In another embodiment, numeric digits detected in a command phrase are validated as a phone number against a predetermined numbering plan. A call is automatically placed to the phone number if the phone number is validated.

In addition, theexample components 200 may include a power source orsupply 217, such as a portable battery, for providing power to the other example components and allow portability of themobile device 100. - The
processor 203 may generate commands based on information received from one ormore communication components 201 and/or one ormore input components 209. Theprocessor 203 may process the received information alone or in combination with other data, such as the information stored in thememory 205. Thus, thememory 205 of theexample components 200 may be used by theprocessor 203 to store and retrieve data. The data that may be stored by thememory 205 include, but is not limited to, operating systems, applications, and data. Each operating system includes executable code that controls basic functions of the mobile device, such as interaction among the components of theexample components 200, communication with external devices via eachcommunication component 201 and/or the device interface (see below), and storage and retrieval of applications and data to and from thememory 205.

FIG. 2 is provided for illustrative purposes only and for illustrating components of a mobile device in accordance with the present invention, and is not intended to be a complete schematic diagram of the various components required for a mobile device. Therefore, a mobile device may include various other components not shown inFIG. 2 , or may include a combination of two or more components or a division of a particular component into two or more separate components, and still be within the scope of the present invention. - Turning to
FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 , process flows 300, 400, and 500 illustrate an embodiment of a method for validation of a command phrase that may be performed by themobile device 100. As a user of themobile device 100 is speaking, themobile device 100 monitors an audio input, such as an audio input from themicrophone 111. Upon detection of a trigger phrase (e.g., “OK Google Now”), themobile device 100 stores a command phrase that follows the trigger phrase. The command phrase or a portion thereof in one example is buffered in thememory 205 and provided to theprocessor 203. In another example, the command phrase is provided directly to theprocessor 203. Themobile device 100 determines whether the command phrase includes a call command for a current call. Examples of a call command include “Call”, “Dial”, “Place a call to”, and other words or phrases that will be apparent those skilled in the art. The call commands in one example are included in a call command whitelist. - When the
mobile device 100 recognizes (302) a call command, themobile device 100 determines a command confidence score for the call command. In one example, themobile device 100 analyzes the command phrase or a portion thereof (e.g., only the call command) with a voice recognition engine, such as those provided by Nuance (Nuance Communications, Inc; Burlington, Mass.), or other processing algorithm to determine the command confidence score. The command confidence score in this case is a numerical value (e.g., between 0 and 100 with 100 being most confident) that indicates a relative confidence level of the detection of a call command. Themobile device 100 in one example provides the call command whitelist and the call command to the voice recognition engine to receive the command confidence score. Alternatively, the call command whitelist may be provided to the voice recognition engine prior to the call command (e.g., during installation, configuration, initialization, etc.). Themobile device 100 determines (304) whether the command confidence score meets a command threshold (e.g., is greater than or equal to 40). In alternative embodiments, the command confidence score is determined or received as a valid or invalid indication, or a tiered response indication (e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence). Other implementations of the command confidence score will be apparent to those skilled in the art. - In addition to determining (304) the command confidence score, the
mobile device 100 may also compare the call command to a list of predetermined words or phrases that may be misidentified as call commands. For example, themobile device 100 may use a blacklist of words or phrases such as “How tall is . . . ” or “denial” which may be misidentified as “Call” or “Dial”, respectively. If the command phrase is a closer match to the blacklist phrase than to a legitimate call command (e.g., on the whitelist), then themobile device 100 proceeds to step 306. Additionally, themobile device 100 may determine whether the command phrase is located in the middle of a conversation. In this case, themobile device 100 determines whether an audio length of the command phrase is longer than a predetermined threshold, such as five seconds, to prevent an attempt to validate a user's conversation. Themobile device 100 invalidates the call command if the audio length exceeds the predetermined threshold and proceeds to step 306. - If the command threshold is not met (NO at 304), the
mobile device 100 analyzes (306) the command phrase with a voice command engine (e.g., engines provided by Google Now, Sensory, or Nuance), for example, to provide general command recognition instead of call command validation. In this case, the command confidence score indicates that the call command may have been incorrectly identified. For example, if the command phrase is “How tall is Mount Everest?”, “How tall is” may be recognized as a blacklist phrase, but additional processing by the voice command engine may allow a response to be provided. - If the command threshold is met (YES at 304), the
mobile device 100 determines (308) whether the call parameter includes spoken digits (e.g., “1-800-555-1234”). If spoken digits are detected (YES at 308), themobile device 100 validates (310) the spoken digits (e.g., the call parameter) against a predetermined phone numbering plan. Examples of phone numbering plans include the North American Numbering Plan, E.164, satellite phone number plans, or private numbering plans (e.g., for a private branch exchange). Themobile device 100 in one example selects a numbering plan based on its current geographic location (e.g., North America or Europe). In another example, the numbering plan includes a blacklist of phone numbers. The blacklist includes phone numbers that should not be automatically dialed, such as emergency response numbers (e.g., 9-1-1), international phone numbers, or phone numbers that may incur additional fees. The blacklist may be populated by a wireless service provider, government entity, or by the user of themobile device 100. If the call parameter is not validated (NO at 310), themobile device 100 proceeds to step 306. If the call parameter is validated and thus contains a phone number (YES at 310), themobile device 100 proceeds to step 504 (FIG. 5 ). Optionally, themobile device 100 determines a voice validation score for the phone number that indicates a relative confidence level of the detection of phone number (e.g., to avoid mistaken detections such as detecting a “five” as a “nine”). Themobile device 100 uses the voice recognition engine for determination of the voice validation score. - If spoken digits are not detected (NO at 308), the
mobile device 100 validates the call parameter against a set of call contacts, such as an address book associated with themobile device 100. Themobile device 100 generates (312) a set of voice validation scores that correspond to the set of call contacts in the address book. The voice validation scores indicate a relative confidence level of the detection of the corresponding contact's spoken name. In one example, themobile device 100 provides the set of call contacts to the voice recognition engine along with the call parameter. The set of call contacts may be provided to the voice recognition engine prior to the call parameter (e.g., during installation, configuration, initialization, etc.). The set of voice validation scores in one example are numerical values (e.g., 0 to 100). In alternative embodiments, the voice validation score received as a valid or invalid indication, or a tiered response indication (e.g., high confidence, medium confidence, low confidence). Other implementations of the voice validation score will be apparent to those skilled in the art. - The
mobile device 100 selects (314) a set of target contacts from the set of call contacts based on the voice validation scores. For example, themobile device 100 selects only those contacts with a voice validation score within a selected range of a highest voice validation score. As one example, the user may have call contacts in his address book including Andrea, Brad, Brent, and Charlie. In this case, if the user speaks “OK Google Now, Call Brent at his home”, the voice validation scores may be 0, 85, 95, and 0, respectively. If the selected range is 10, the target contacts are Brad and Brent (Brent having the highest voice validation score of 95). If the selected range is 5, the target contact is only Brent. The selected range may be predetermined or dynamically determined by the mobile device 100 (e.g., based on prior voice recognition history). In alternative implementations, the selected range may include “high confidence” voice validation scores or both “high confidence” and “medium confidence” scores. Other selected ranges will be apparent to those skilled in the art, for example, based on the type of voice validation score used. - Once the set of target contacts have been selected (e.g., those with a sufficiently high voice validation score), the
mobile device 100 generates a contact confidence score for the target contacts. The contact confidence scores indicate a relative importance of the corresponding contact to the user of themobile device 100 and may be a numbered value (e.g., 0 to 100), a ranked list, or other relative indicator for comparison of the contacts. Themobile device 100 in one example generates the contact confidence scores for each of the set of target contacts based on a user context associated with the user. The user context of a contact includes one or more of a recency of last communication (e.g., phone calls, text messages, emails, etc.), frequency of communication, placement on a “favorites list” by the user, relation to a calendar event or appointment (e.g., a current calendar event of “Call Brent at 10:00 AM”), or other contextual indicators as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. - In an alternative implementation, the
mobile device 100 generates the contact confidence scores prior to recognizing (312) the call command. For example, themobile device 100 may use a context engine that analyzes the user context to update contact confidence scores on a schedule-driven basis (e.g., a predetermined schedule or dynamic schedule) or on an event-driven basis (e.g., when a communication is sent to a contact). In this case, the mobile device 100 (e.g., the context engine) may maintain a “VIP” list of contacts with their respective contact confidence scores. The context engine in one example is an application or service that is executed by themobile device 100. - The
mobile device 100 selects (318) respective phone numbers for the set of target contacts. As one example where the call parameter is “Brent at his home”, themobile device 100 detects a phone type specified within the call parameter, such as “at his home”. Themobile device 100 in one example uses a whitelist of words or phrases that specify phone types, such as for a cell or mobile phone, home phone, business phone, or others as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As another example, the call parameter may not include a phone type and simply identify a contact (e.g., “Call Brent”). - The
mobile device 100 selects a most likely phone number based on the specified phone type (if available) and the user context. In one example, themobile device 100 queries the context engine with the specified phone type to receive the most likely phone number. If the specified phone type is not available or if no phone number is received from a query with the specified phone type (e.g., “at his home” but no home phone number is listed in the contact), themobile device 100 queries without the phone type specified. In this case, the context engine may provide a most likely number based on user context or selected from a predetermined priority order as available (e.g., mobile phone as highest priority, then home, then work). Where the user context is not available for a contact or if the contact is not on the VIP list, themobile device 100 selects the phone number based on the predetermined priority order. - Referring to
FIG. 4 , after selection (318) of the phone numbers, themobile device 100 determines (402) whether the set of target contacts contains only a single contact without a specified phone type. In this case (YES at 402), themobile device 100 obtains each of the phone numbers stored (e.g., in the address book) for the single contact and proceeds to step 408. If the set of target contacts contains more than one contact or has a specified phone type, themobile device 100 determines (406) whether a priority contact for the current call has been found, based on the voice validation score, the contact confidence score, or a combination thereof. In one example, a priority contact is a contact with a voice validation score that meets a validation threshold (e.g., at least 60), a contact confidence score that meets a confidence threshold (e.g., at least 60), or with both thresholds met. In another example, themobile device 100 uses a weighting algorithm based on the voice validation score and contact confidence score to provide a higher likelihood of “priority” status for a contact on the VIP list. If the validation and confidence thresholds are met and a priority contact is found, themobile device 100 proceeds to step 502 (FIG. 5 ). - If a priority contact is not found (NO at 406), or after obtaining (404) the phone numbers, the
mobile device 100 sorts the target contacts and phone numbers. Themobile device 100 in one example sorts the contacts and numbers using a weighting algorithm based on the voice validation score and contact confidence score. After sorting, themobile device 100 proceeds to step 502 (FIG. 5 ). - Referring to
FIG. 5 , themobile device 100 determines (502) whether the set of target contacts contains a single entry (e.g., a single contact with a single selected phone number). If a single entry is not found (NO at 502), themobile device 100 prompts (506) the user to indicate that multiple entries (e.g., multiple target contacts or multiple phone numbers) have been found. The communication (506) in one example is a notification that multiple entries have been found and a prompt for further input. In another example, the communication is a list of the multiple entries (or a portion thereof). - The
mobile device 100 communicates the multiple entries by a visual interface (e.g., on the display 105), a text-to-speech interface (e.g., via the speaker 109), or a combination thereof. In one example, themobile device 100 communicates only a portion of the multiple entries selected based on their relative voice validation scores or contact confidence scores. In a further example, the communication includes a prompt for the user to select one or more user interface options, such as communicating all of the entries found, sequentially listing the entries, or selecting an entry for placement of the current call. If the user selects an option for communicating the entries (YES at 508), themobile device 100 communicates (510) the found entries (e.g., contacts or phone numbers) via the visual or text-to-speech interface. - The
mobile device 100 determines (512) whether an entry has been selected by the user. Upon selection of an entry (YES at 512), themobile device 100 places (514) a call to the selected entry. If the user does not select an entry within a predetermined timeout period such as five seconds (NO at 512), the process ends for the current call. - If a single entry is found (YES at 502), or if a valid phone number is found (YES at 310), the
mobile device 100 determines (504) whether the single entry is a priority contact based on the voice validation score, the contact confidence score, or a combination thereof. As described above, a priority contact may be a contact with a voice validation score that meets the validation threshold or a contact confidence score that meets the contact threshold. Themobile device 100 may determine that a valid phone number (YES at 310) is a priority contact if the corresponding voice validation score meets the validation threshold. However, other thresholds may be used atstep 504 for determination of the priority contact. In one example, themobile device 100 dynamically determines at least one of the validation threshold or contact threshold based on a device context for themobile device 100. In this case, themobile device 100 selects a higher threshold when themobile device 100 is currently stowed (e.g., in a pocket or bag), the user is currently driving, the user is currently in a meeting, whether a headset (e.g., Bluetooth or wired headset) is currently connected, or other criteria, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. - Upon determination that a priority contact has been found (YES at 504), the
mobile device 100 communicates (516) that an automatic call placement is (or will) take place, for example, via the visual or text-to-speech interface (e.g., “Calling Brent at home”). This provides an opportunity for the user to cancel the call prior to automatic placement of the call. Themobile device 100 determines (518) whether the user has canceled the call, for example, within a predetermined timeout period (e.g., four seconds). If the user cancels the call (YES at 518), for example, via a spoken command (“Cancel”) or other interaction with themobile device 100, the process ends for the current call. If the user does not cancel the call (NO at 518), themobile device 100 automatically places the call to the priority contact. - If a priority contact has not been found (NO at 504), the
mobile device 100 prompts (520) the user with a call confirmation via the visual or text-to-speech interface (e.g., “Should I call Brent at home?” or “Press here to place call”). Themobile device 100 determines (522) whether the user has confirmed the call, for example, within a predetermined timeout period (e.g., ten seconds). If the user confirms the call (YES at 522), for example, via a spoken command (“Yes”) or other interaction with themobile device 100, themobile device 100 places (514) the call. If the user does not confirm the call (NO at 522), the process ends for the current call. - Turning to
FIG. 6 , aprocess flow 600 for automatically dialing a priority contact that may be performed by themobile device 100 is shown. Themobile device 100 monitors (602) an audio input (e.g., the microphone 111) for a trigger phrase spoken by a user of themobile device 100. In one example, themobile device 100 performs the monitoring in a low power mode, such as with a low power digital signal processor while an application processor is in a low power state. Themobile device 100 buffers (604) a command phrase spoken by the user after the trigger phrase (604). The command phrase corresponds to a call command and a call parameter. Themobile device 100 in one example wakes from the low power mode (e.g., wakes the application processor) upon detection of the trigger phrase and buffers the command phrase while the application processor is initialized. Themobile device 100 selects (606) a set of target contacts associated with the mobile device based on respective voice validation scores and respective contact confidence scores. The respective voice validation scores are based on the call parameter and the respective contact confidence scores are based on a user context associated with the user. Themobile device 100 determines (608) whether the voice validation score and contact confidence score for a priority contact meet corresponding validation and contact thresholds. Themobile device 100 automatically places (610) the call to the priority contact if the thresholds are met (YES at 608). - Turning to
FIG. 7 , aprocess flow 700 for automatically dialing a phone number that may be performed by themobile device 100 is shown. Themobile device 100 monitors (702) an audio input (e.g., the microphone 111) for a trigger phrase spoken by a user of themobile device 100. In one example, themobile device 100 performs the monitoring in a low power mode, such as with a low power digital signal processor while an application processor is in a low power state. Themobile device 100 buffers (704) a command phrase spoken by the user after the trigger phrase (604). The command phrase corresponds to a call command and a call parameter. Themobile device 100 in one example wakes from the low power mode (e.g., wakes the application processor) upon detection of the trigger phrase and buffers the command phrase while the application processor is initialized. If numeric digits are detected in the call parameter, themobile device 100 validates (706) the numeric digits as a phone number against a predetermined phone numbering plan. If the digits are validated (YES at 708), themobile device 100 automatically places (710) a call to the phone number. - It can be seen from the foregoing that a method and system for validation of a command phrase for placing a call have been described.
