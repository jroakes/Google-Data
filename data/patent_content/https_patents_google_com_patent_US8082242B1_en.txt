Definitions
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly. Search engines assist users in locating desired portions of this information by cataloging web pages. Typically, in response to a user's request, the search engine returns references to documents relevant to the request.
- a web crawler is typically used to find and retrieve documents (e.g., web pages) on the web.
- the web crawler sends a request to, for example, a web server for a document, downloads the entire document, and then provides the document to an indexer.
- the indexer typically takes the text of the crawled document, extracts individual terms from the text, and sorts those terms (e.g., alphabetically) into a search index.
- the web crawler and indexer repeat this process as the web crawler crawls documents across the web.
- Each entry in the search index contains a term stored in association with a list of documents in which the term appears and the location within the document's text where the term appears.
- the search index thus, permits rapid access to documents that contain terms that match search terms of a user supplied search query.
- the indexer typically ignores common words, called stop words (e.g., the, is, on, or, of, how, why, etc.) when creating or updating the search index.
- stop words e.g., the, is, on, or, of, how, why, etc.
- Existing indexers create a single search index that contains terms extracted from all documents crawled on the web.
- search engines may base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) based on the search query using the search index.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to terms contained in the search index, and retrieving a list of documents associated with each matching term in the search index. Documents that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user.
- the “hits” returned by the search engine may be ranked among one another by the search engine based on some measure of the quality and/or relevancy of the hits.
- a basic technique for sorting the search hits relies on the degree with which the search query matches the hits. For example, documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than documents that contain less than every term of the search query or a single occurrence of a term in the search query and, therefore, may be more highly ranked by the search engine.
- a method may include receiving selection of one or more of a set of custom content groups, where each of the custom content groups may be associated with a custom search index that is different from a web search index and a custom search index associated with another one of the custom content groups; receiving a search query from a user; performing a search of the web search index based on the search query to identify web search results; performing a search of one or more custom search indexes associated with the selected one or more the custom content groups to identify custom search results; generating a search result document that includes the web search results, the custom search results, and a plurality of advertisements, where at least one of the custom search results is included among the advertisements in the search result document; and providing the search result document.
- a system may include means for receiving selection of one or more of a set of custom content groups, where each of the custom content groups may be associated with a custom search index that is different from a web search index and a custom search index associated with another one of the custom content groups; means for receiving a search query; means for performing a search of the web search index based on the search query to identify web search results; means for performing a search of one or more custom search indexes associated with the selected one or more the custom content groups to identify custom search results, where one of the custom search results may include a for-pay search result that requires payment of a fee before access to the for-pay search result is permitted; means for generating a search result document that includes the custom search results commingled with the web search results, where the custom search results may include a first visual characteristic in the search result document, the web search results may include a second visual characteristic in the search result document, and the for-pay search result may include a third visual characteristic in the search result document, where the first, second, and third
- a method may include receiving a request to subscribe to a custom content feed, where the custom content feed may identify a new content item that has been added to a custom search index, where the custom search index may be generated based on content uploaded or identified by a first user; periodically publishing the custom content feed, where the custom content feed may include one or more feed items corresponding to one or more new content items; receiving, from a second user, selection of one of the one or more feed items; and providing selective access to new content item corresponding to the selected feed item.
- a method may include receiving, from a first user, a design of a custom content portal that provides access to a custom search index; receiving, from the first user, a set of criteria that may include at least one of criteria for selecting a result of searching the custom search index, criteria for scoring a result of searching the custom search index, or a criteria for presenting a result of searching the custom search index; receiving, from a second user, a search query via the custom content portal; performing a search of the custom search index based on the search query and the set of criteria to identify a set of search results; and presenting the set of search results.

- a content searching system may crawl the web to retrieve web content and then index the retrieved web content to create a web search index.
- One or more users may also upload or otherwise identify custom content to the content searching system, which may then index the custom content to create a custom search index that is different from the web search index.
- the custom search index may store information different from the information stored by the web search index.
- the custom search index may store a subset of the information stored in the web search index. In this case, it may be possible for the custom search index to store pointers to information in the web search index.
- the custom search index may store information that is not present in the web search index.
- the custom search index may be considered different from the web search index in the sense that the custom search index may be searchable separate from the web search index.

For example, content searching system 210 may provide a user interface via which the user may indicate the user's desire for a custom content search or a custom/web search. For example, in one implementation, as shown in FIG.
- the user interface may present a set of selectable items (e.g., tabs), such as a web search tab 810 (for performing a web search), a custom content search tab 820 (for performing a custom content search), and a web+custom content search tab 830 (for performing a custom/web search).
- the user may select the tab corresponding to the type of search the user desires.
- content searching system 210 may provide separate user interfaces (e.g., search engine interfaces or portals) for a custom content search and a custom/web search. The user may access the appropriate user interface by, for example, entering an address (e.g., URL) associated with the user interface in an address box of a browser window.
- an address e.g., URL
- custom content searching system 210 may assume that the user desires to perform a custom/web search (searching the custom content that the user is permitted to access) unless the user expressly indicates a desire to the contrary (e.g., by identifying specific custom content that the user is interested in searching).
- one or more custom content groups may be selected (block 710 ).
- selection of one or more custom content groups may be automatic.
- content searching system 210 may automatically select all of the custom content groups that the user is permitted to access. For example, a custom content group may require that a user subscribe to the custom content group before permitting the user to gain access to the custom content group or a particular piece of content in the custom content group.
- Another custom content group may require that the user pay a fee (e.g., one time, monthly, yearly, etc.) before permitting the user to gain access to the custom content group or a particular piece of content in the custom content group.
- a fee e.g., one time, monthly, yearly, etc.
- Yet another custom content group may permit free access to all of its content.
