- Data presentation process 10 may be configured to allow e.g. user 36 to longitudinally scroll 112 the selected portion (e.g. portion 166 ) of the piece of content (e.g. content 168 ) within the main portion (e.g. main portion 182 ) of display screen 152 in response to a scroll indication from user 36 .
- user 36 may scroll downward (e.g. by swiping their finger in a downward direction within display screen 152 ) so that portion 174 of content 168 is no longer partially skewed (within graphical divider 186 ) and portion 176 of content 168 is no longer hidden (by graphical divider 186 ) and comes into full view.
- portion 176 of content 168 is the uppermost portion of content 168
- graphical divider 186 may disappear as there is no longer a disconnect between header 178 and portion 176 of content 168 (as shown in FIG. 3C ).
- the header portion (e.g. header 178 ) of the piece of content (e.g. content 168 ) may remain stationary within upper portion 180 of display screen 152 while the selected portion (e.g. portion 166 ) of the piece of content (e.g. content 168 ) is longitudinally scrolled 112 within main portion 182 of display screen 152 .
- header 178 (viewable within upper portion 180 of display screen 152 ) may remain stationary, thus providing user 36 with a consistent look and feel regardless of the specific portion of content 168 that they are reviewing.
- GUID Graphical divider 186 may be configured so that, in the event that user 36 taps or pinches graphical divider 186 , the portions of content 168 hidden by graphical divider 186 may reappear (thus resulting in the format shown in FIG. 3C ).
- user 36 may select return arrow 188 and, thus, return to social network 150 (as shown in FIG. 3E ).
- search result set 187 may be generated via a search engine (not shown) utilized by user 38 to execute a query.
- Search result set 187 may include a plurality of links (e.g. links 160 , 162 , 164 ) to identify pieces of content related to the query. Accordingly, content 168 may be identified by e.g., link 162 and, therefore, upon user 38 selecting link 162 , content 168 may be rendered in the fashion shown in FIG. 3B .
- graphical divider 186 may be utilized to represent additional breaks in the continuity of content 168 .
- additional graphical dividers e.g., graphical divider 190
- Data presentation process 10 may divide this article into multiple sections that each focus on different parts of the article. Scrolling through the article without tapping to expand any part of the article may show that there are additional sections found within the article that focus on steak.
- multiple graphical dividers may appear for the portion of content viewable on display screen 152 . Further, scrolling may show more graphical dividers until the bottom of content 168 is displayed.
- Data presentation process 10 may be configured to provide the user with a visual indicator (e.g., indicators 192 , 194 ) indicative of the size of the break in continuity of content 168 .
- indicator 192 may indicate that graphical divider 186 is obscuring 0.7 screens of content and indicator 194 may indicate that graphical divider 190 is obscuring 1.6 screens of content.
- indicators 192 , 194 may indicate the number of words obscured by graphical dividers 186 , 190 .
- Data presentation process 10 may determine that certain parts of content 168 may be relevant/interesting to user 36 based upon e.g., the content of post 156 . Accordingly, data presentation process 10 may identify portions of content 168 that user 36 may wish to jump to (based on e.g., ranking) Data presentation process 10 may provide a visual way to represent the portion(s) of content 168 considered relevant/interesting to user 36 and allow user 36 to navigate those portions of content 168 . Further, data presentation process 10 may allow user 36 to jump to multiple portions of content 168 at once by using graphical dividers (e.g., graphical dividers 186 , 190 ) that allow multiple portions of content 168 to be viewable within display screen 152 .
- graphical dividers e.g., graphical dividers 186 , 190
- a post within social network 150 (made by a friend of user 36 ) includes the text “this bridge is amazing” and also includes a link to a related article (e.g., content 168 ).
- a link to a related article e.g., content 168
- certain portions of content 168 may be considered by data presentation process 10 to be potentially relevant/interesting to user 36 .
- content 168 is considerably long and contains twenty different portions. Further, assume that one of those twenty portions concerns the specific bridge referenced in the post. Further assume that six additional portions of the twenty portions concern other bridges, and the remaining thirteen portions have nothing to do with bridges.
- data presentation process 10 may link to the portion of content 168 identified by the above-described link. Further, one or more graphical dividers (e.g., graphical dividers 186 , 190 ) may be provided by data presentation process 10 to allow user 36 to easily navigate to the six other portions of content 168 that concern bridges. Alternatively/additionally, when determining which other portions of content 168 user 36 may deem relevant/interesting, data presentation process 10 may consider e.g., the likes/dislikes/interests of user 36 , the likes/dislikes/interests of friends of user 36 , and social affinity.
- Data presentation process 10 may also apply the above-described methodologies when e.g., a user selects content from a social network feed when viewing those pages (e.g., clicking and jumping to a part of the page the a friend had scrolled to, linked directly to, automatically determined is the most interesting part of an article and/or is most relevant to the context of the post text provided by the user. For example, a user may scroll three pages to a beautiful photo of the Colorado Mountains. This user may then choose to share this photo. Another user viewing the link (that the above-described user shared) may click on that link and the photo of the Colorado Mountains may appear in the display area with a graphical divider (e.g., graphical divider 186 ) above it and the webpage header at the top. Graphical dividers (e.g., graphical dividers 186 , 190 ) may appear until the bottom of content 168 .
- a graphical divider e.g., graphical dividers 186 , 190
- graphical dividers may continue to be shown for e.g., continued scrolling that may span multiple webpages on e.g., the same website or across multiple search results.
- user 36 may search for “user experience design tutorials” and a number of search results may appear.
- User 36 may select the first search result, graphical dividers may be rendered for the content (in the manner described above).
- User 36 may then continue to scroll and may see e.g., additional webpages (from the same website) that were deemed relevant by data presentation process 10 (based upon the search entered by user 36 ). Additional graphical dividers may be utilized as needed.
- Webpage 196 When visiting a link from a social network, if user 36 continues to scroll, the next webpage (e.g., webpage 196 ) on the website may be shown, separated from the original webpage by divider 198 . Webpage 196 may be deemed relevant/interesting by data presentation process 10 depending upon the context of the comment(s) on the link (or based upon what the user might find interesting).
- clicking on a link shared by a friend about the movie set for the movie “The Hobbit” may show the page from the link, and may then show another page on that website related to “The Hobbit”.
- the next page shown may be the next link as determined by data presentation process 10 based upon the stream ranking order shared by a user on the social network (such as by a different friend or the prior link shared by that particular user).
- the above-described design may appear upon page load.
- the page may load with the traditional design and then data presentation process 10 may render an animation that e.g., may roll the paper like a scroll to reveal the above-described design. Accordingly, the user may learn what the viewable page looks like and may then see what content is believed to be most interesting/relevant for the user.
- data presentation process 10 is described above as being configured to work with content 168 , this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure.
- data presentation process 10 may be configured to work with posts within the social network (e.g. social network 150 ).
- social network 150 may include a plurality of posts (e.g. posts 200 , 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , 214 ) that user 36 may review.
- data presentation process 10 may be configured to utilize graphical divider 186 to partition display screen 152 into upper portion 216 and lower portion 218 so that the first post (e.g. post 200 ) and the last post (e.g. post 214 ) are simultaneously visible within display screen 152 .
- Graphical divider 186 may be configured to illustrate (e.g. through indicators 220 ) which posts are hidden due to the use of graphical divider 186 .
- indicators 220 illustrate that posts 4 -post 6 (e.g.
- Graphical divider 186 may be configured so that, in the event that user 36 taps or pinches graphical divider 186 , the post hidden by graphical divider 186 may reappear (thus resulting in the format shown in FIG. 4A ).
- data presentation process 10 may be configured to perform single axis compression/cropping of posts (or portions of posts) to longitudinally compress/crop a series of posts within social network 150 .
- social network 150 includes a plurality of posts (e.g. posts 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 ) that user 36 may review.
- one or more of the posts e.g. post 208
- includes a photograph e.g. photograph 250
- Data presentation process 10 may be configured to longitudinally crop photograph 250 so that more posts are visible within display screen 152 .
- data presentation process 10 may focus on the interesting part of the photograph. For example, facial recognition technology may be utilized to identify a face within photograph 250 and highlight the face when in cropped form. Accordingly, when user 36 is reviewing the posts included within social network 150 , user 36 may scroll upward to see additional posts and to view the bottom of display screen 152 . Accordingly, when post 208 comes into view within display screen 152 , photograph 250 may be cropped along the direction that the posts are being scrolled (as shown in FIG. 5A ), with the facial portion of photograph 250 being made prominent by data presentation process 10 .
- One or more graphical dividers may be rendered by data presentation process 10 to illustrate that an upper portion and/or a lower portion of photograph 250 are obscured through (in this example) cropping.
- photograph 250 will no longer be cropped along the direction that the posts are being scrolled (as shown in FIG. 5B ) and will be brought into full view (including non-facial features such as the mountains in the background).
- photograph 250 will once again be cropped along the direction that the posts are being scrolled (as shown in FIG. 5C ), with the facial portion of photograph 250 once again being made prominent by data presentation process 10 .
- one or more graphical dividers may be rendered by data presentation process 10 to illustrate that an upper portion and/or a lower portion of photograph 250 are obscured through (in this example) cropping.
- FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate photograph 250 being cropped, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure as other configurations are possible.
- photograph 250 may simply be compressed along a single axis (e.g., along the direction that the posts are being scrolled), resulting in all of photograph 250 still being visible even when in a compressed form.
- data presentation process 10 may be configured to allow for easier navigation of posts within social network 150 .
- social network 150 may include a plurality of posts (e.g. post 250 ).
- one or more users e.g. users 38 , 40 , 42
- may generate one or more replies e.g. replies 252 , 254 , 256
- replies e.g. replies 252 , 254 , 256
- the quantity of replies to a single post may be quite large. Accordingly, if user 36 is scrolling (in the direction of arrow 258 ) through the posts within social network 150 , user 36 will be required to scroll through a large quantity of replies prior to getting to the next post.
- data presentation process 10 may render preview bar 260 that (in this particular implementation) provides shortcuts to upcoming posts.
- shortcut 262 may be linked to the next post (e.g. a post by user 38 ) within social network 150
- shortcut 264 may be linked to a post by user 40 that follows the post by user 38
- shortcut 266 may be linked to a post by user 42 that follows the post by user 40 .
- user 36 may select any of shortcuts 262 , 264 , 266 to jump to the post to which they are linked.
- preview bar 260 is described above as containing shortcuts to upcoming posts, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation disclosure, as other configurations are possible.
- user 36 instead of scrolling through posts, user 36 may be scrolling through the text of an e-book. Accordingly, preview bar 260 may contain shortcuts to upcoming chapters within the e-book.
- data presentation process 10 may be configured to visually prioritize content within social network 150 .
- content may be separated into a plurality of rows (e.g., rows 300 , 302 , 304 , 306 ), wherein the relevancy of a row of content (with respect to row 300 ) decreases the further away that the row is positioned from row 300 .
- rows 300 , 302 , 304 , 306 the relevancy of a row of content (with respect to row 300 ) decreases the further away that the row is positioned from row 300 .
- Row 302 may contain posts that are deemed highly related/relevant to post 300 .
- the manner in which the posts contained within row 302 are deemed highly related/relevant may be based upon a variety of topics, example of which may include (but are not limited to) social affinity/content/location.
- row 302 may contain: post 308 (e.g. another post by user 42 ); post 310 (e.g., a post by user 40 who is a friend of user 36 ): post 312 (e.g., a post by a third party that links to an article concerning Ocean Beach in San Francisco); and post 314 (e.g., a post by a third party that contains a photograph of Ocean Beach in San Francisco).
- Row 304 may contain posts that are deemed moderately related/relevant to post 300 .
- row 304 may contain posts (e.g., post 316 , 318 , 320 ) that concern a beach, but not Ocean Beach in San Francisco.
- row 304 may contain posts (e.g., posts 322 , 324 ) that have higher degrees of separation (e.g., posts by friends of friends of user 36 ).
- Row 306 may contain posts that are deemed slightly related/relevant to post 300 .
- row 306 may contain posts that are more topically distant (e.g., restaurants in San Jose) that do not concern beaches or San Francisco but are geographically proximate.
- row 306 may contain posts that are more socially distant (e.g., posts by a friend of a friend of a friend of user 36 ).
- rows 302 , 304 , 306 are related to row 300
- the posts included within rows 302 , 304 , 306 may change.
- data presentation process 10 may re-render rows 302 , 304 , 306 so that these rows include posts that are related/relevant to the newly-selected post within row 300 (in the manner discussed above).
- FIG. 8 there is shown a diagrammatic view of computing system 12 . While computing system 12 is shown in this figure, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configuration are possible. For example, any computing device capable of executing, in whole or in part, data presentation process 10 may be substituted for computing device 12 within FIG. 8 , examples of which may include but are not limited to client electronic devices 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 .
