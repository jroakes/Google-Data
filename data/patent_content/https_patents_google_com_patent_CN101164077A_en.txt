Description
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertising.Especially, the present invention relates to improve advertisement by the mode that a kind of appraisal that different audients is hived off informs different advertisers.
Background technology
Using traditional media all has been known such as the advertisement of TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine.Regrettably, used demographic data and supposed that about the rational fully of typical audience of various medium their most advertising budget still is pure waste even the advertiser recognizes.And, be difficult to identification and eliminate this waste.
Recently, advertise by the medium of interactivity more and catch on.For example, along with the number of using the Internet increases severely, the advertiser has begun to pay attention to the medium and the service that provide by the Internet, regards it a kind of potential effective and efficient manner of advertisement as.
The interactivity advertisement offers an opportunity for the advertiser, makes them to come advertisement delivery to the audient who takes like a shot as target.Promptly have the advertisement of targeted more may be useful to the final user because these advertisements with according to the demand of inferring in certain user's activity relevant (for example asking content in the document etc. to the search inquiry of search engine, about the user) about the user.Search engine has used the key word of the inquiry target to determine that mode distributes relevant advertisements.For example, general headquarters to be positioned at the AdWords ad system of the Google in California, USA Mountain View city be that target is divided sending advertisement by the key word of search engine.Similarly, having proposed with the content is the ad delivery systems of target.For example, U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/314,427 (incorporating herein as a reference and be called as " 427 application " by reference into), the invention people who submits on Dec 6th, 2002 is be entitled as " method and apparatus that is used to provide relevant advertisements " of Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Buchheit; And 10/375,900 (this as with reference in conjunction with and be called as " 900 " application), the invention people who submits on February 26th, 2003 is being entitled as of Darrell Anderson, Paul Buchheit, Alex Carobus, Claire CUI, Jeffery ADean, Georges R.Harik, Deepal Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar " content-based provide advertisement ", has described to be used to be relevant to the method and apparatus that document (as webpage) content provides advertisement.Determine the ad delivery systems of target by content, be used on webpage, provide advertisement such as the AdSense ad system of Google.
As previously mentioned content can be understood, it is useful advertisement being provided and/or providing advertisement with respect to the key word in the search inquiry with respect to the notion of text document Chinese version, because this advertisement may relate to active user's interest.Although be target with the key word and be that the ad system of target has improved the validity of advertisement and therefore improved their effect (for example according to clicking rate, conversion rate etc.) with the content, still leave some room for improvement.
Just as other advertisement guiding (lead), not every manifesting (impression) and selection (selection) all have equal value.For example, for online advertisement, the local advertising master gives higher appraisal for the guiding from locals or audient (contiguous resident, this city, this county) than the audient of farther place or not on the make native.More particularly, consider that those stride the advertiser of open boundary, for example the advertiser of the Canada and the U.S..Although the advertiser of the U.S. can pay attention to from Canadian guiding, may be not as the guiding from the U.S. being paid attention to so (for example, because extra cost and/or workload that tariff and transportation cause).
Some current ad systems allow the advertiser to select country or other presumptive area to be used for targetedly providing their bulletin.Yet when the advertiser wanted to estimate diverse location discriminatively in target location or each position, this system can encounter problems.U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/654,265 (this as with reference in conjunction with and be called as " 265 application "), the invention people who submits on August 23rd, 2004 has described to be used to have target that the technology of advertisement is provided being entitled as of Leslie Yeh, Sridhar Ramaswamy and Zhe Qian " definite and/or use location information in ad system ".For example, the restaurant thinks to be that target is come advertisement delivery with 30 minutes ranges of driving with interior potential customers only.Drycleaner's thinks to be that target is come advertisement delivery with the potential customers in same cities and towns and a few adjacent cities and towns of possibility only.As another example, the pharmacy of region linkage thinks to be that target is come advertisement delivery with the potential customers that live in their zones only.Even these trade companies have the advertisement that is relevant to search inquiry or webpage, if the final user who watches search result web page or web page contents outside the geographic range of these trade companies, advertisement just can of great use and can not effectively not carried out." 265 application " described the scheme that solves this demand.Yet, even in the target location, qualified advertisement presentation or select for the advertiser neither equal value.Regrettably, for the advertiser, be pretty troublesome thereby the difference of representing these value makes them can be reflected in the advertising campaign.
As another example, all night the public place of entertainment can give than the higher appraisal of the guiding in morning or afternoon for the guiding in evening (for example 5 of Afternoon Local Times between at 9 in afternoon).Also as another example, having abundant advertiser based on video ads can give to give higher evaluation than the mobile phone or the miscellaneous equipment that may not finely present advertisement to manifesting on the desk-top computer.
As can be understood from the above examples, although the advertiser wanted to produce guiding in nonideal hiving off (segment), they may not think to be they payments " full price " (for example they are willing to mean the amount that ideal is hived off and paid).
As above introduced, some ad systems are such as Google AdWord system, allow the advertiser to specify the various audients ratio that hives off, and as by country, date etc., are used for the purpose of definite target.Yet, for the different audients different quotation of management (for example bid) of hiving off also is difficult.
Regrettably, online advertising system do not support to different market hive off (for example different geographic regions, different time, different user devices, different audient's populations etc. are called different " audients hive off (audience segment) " uniformly) specify the ability of different offer values easily.Therefore, the advertiser can perhaps pay significant odd word and come to move different advertising campaign (and bid) for different audients hives off less-than-ideal guiding overpayment.Therefore, simplify that to be used for the target bidding management that has that imperfect audient hives off be useful.

Search engine 220 can combine Search Results with one or more advertisements that provided by Advertisement Server 120/210.The combining information that comprises Search Results and advertisement is committed to subsequently submits to the user of search to be used to present to the user.Preferably, Search Results and advertisement keep separately, thereby can not obscure the user between the neutral Search Results of paid advertisement and supposition.
Finally, search engine 220 can and when, where about advertisement (such as the geographic position) and/or how to present advertisement information (for example the position, whether click, presentation time, whether manifest date, size, conversion, geographical location information, audience segment information etc.) send back Advertisement Server 120/210.Interchangeable or additional, this information can provide by some alternate manners and get back to Advertisement Server 120/210.Meet the present invention, Advertisement Server 120/210 can come stores advertisements to become effective information based on geographical location information and/or audience segment information.
Finally, e-mail server 240 can be taken as content server usually, and the document that wherein provides is simple Email.In addition, email application (such as MicrosoftOutlook) can be used to send and/or receive Email.Therefore, e-mail server 240 or application program can be taken as ad consumer 130.Therefore, Email can be taken as document, and has the advertisement of targeted to provide explicitly with these documents.For example, can among the Email, under, on provide or provide by other means one or more advertisements.
Although above-mentioned example is described as server (i) request advertisement and (ii) they and content is made up, the one or more of these operations carry out by client device (for example terminal user's computing machine).
§ 4.3 examples of implementation
Different audients hives off and can use following one or more the definition: positional information, temporal information, user equipment information and user profile.Different appraisal indications can be hived off with different audients and is associated.The appraisal indication can be expressed as rule, parameter and/or function.The appraisal indication can and/or be determined (for example using each audience segment ad to become effective information) automatically by advertiser's definition.Given basis quote (for example being provided by the advertiser) can use basis quote and determines with this audient appraisal indication that is associated of hiving off for the quotation of particular audience segment.This has simplified the management of the quotation in the online advertisement activity.
Fig. 3 is each operation of carrying out by mode according to the invention of explanation and uses and/or the block diagram of the various information that produce by mode according to the invention.The advertiser can use advertiser user interface operations 305 to import and manage information (by advertising message input and/or bookkeeping 310) in (for example upgrade, deletion, interpolation etc.) advertising message database 325.The advertiser also can utilize advertiser user interface operations 305 to use audient's selection/determine operation 315 of hiving off to select their the employed audient of advertising campaign to hive off (for example be used for target is determined and/or bidding management) automatically.
Automatically offer management operations 330 can be used to by the audient who uses this advertisement to present to hive off, advertiser's definition or parameter, function and/or the rule (heuristic) selected wait and determine automatically or adjust (for example arrangement) quotation information.This quotation adjustment can be in advance and/or is carried out the time of advertisement arbitration or auction (for example) as required.Automatically offer management operations 330 can select to determine or adjust quotation according to the parameter and/or the advertiser of predetermined default rule, function and/or parameter and/or rule, function and/or input.For example, the advertiser can specify offer multiplier (this is an example of parameter), and this multiplication factor is along with apart from the increase index minimizing (this be an example of function) of (this advertisement will be presented to) terminal user to advertiser's position.In this example, need not any intervention (may except initialization step) from the advertiser, advertiser's quotation is adjusted automatically in real time in the terminal user's that ad system can will be presented to along with advertiser's advertisement position.If the advertiser changes its " benchmark " quotation (for example, hiving off for an audient, such as its optimal audience segment), do not need to upgrade separately the quotation of hiving off for other audient.As another example, the advertiser can specify the offer multiplier for one 1.0 of the terminal user of its position in 5 mile radius scopes, and for its position greater than 5 mile radius but less than one 0.7 of the terminal user's in 10 mile radius offer multiplier, and for its position in offer multiplier greater than one 0.1 of the terminal user in 10 mile radius, thereby defined three (3) " grades " according to the position distance definition that the audient hives off, each has the different quotations that is associated.
Audient's selection/determine operation 315 of hiving off can be made by the advertiser and is used for specifying the audient to hive off (for example be used for target determine and/or adjust quotation).This operation 315 can be used to automatically determine the suggestion that the audient hives off and selects as by the advertiser.For example, the commercial audience target determines that selection operation 315 offers the advertiser to the determined suggestion of the one-tenth effective information audient branch group-list of using user behavior feedback operation 320 to follow the trail of.The advertiser can select one or more audients to hive off from the tabulation of suggestion.Interchangeable or additional, the audient hives off and can hive off to come manual definition by the audient that the advertiser specifies characteristic that the audient hives off to produce client definition, and this will be based on one or more user profile (language for example, population, income, occupation, the nationality, the blood lineage, age, sex etc.), location of user equipment (postcode for example, the IP address, cities and towns, the city, the zone, country etc.), end user device information (mobile phone for example, PDA, kneetop computer, personal computer, connection speed, processor speed, communication speed, display size, display resolution etc.), temporal information (for example in one day when, in one week which day, month, season etc.) wait to determine.
At last, advertising message 325 can comprise that identifier, creative information, advertisement landing information, target determine information and/or price (quotation) information.This information can be by advertiser or their representative by hive off selections/determine to operate 315 to import and/or revise of advertising message input and/or bookkeeping 310 and audient.As can be appreciated, pricing information can comprise single " benchmark " quotation.This quotation can be associated with particular audience segment (for example optimal audience segment), but this not necessarily.Being used for other quotation that other audient hives off also can scheduled (for example service regeulations, function and/or parameter) and be stored as advertising message.Interchangeable or additional, being used for other quotation that other audient hives off can be as required the time of the arbitration of using quotation for advertisement (for example) determines (for example service regeulations, function and/or parameter).
Hive off corresponding to the audient with different quotations although target is determined information, this not necessarily.For example, the advertiser can specify its advertisement to be targeted with keyword " footwear " and to be targeted with the end user device of California only, but can specify " working day " and " weekend " audient to hive off, wherein weekend audience segment has 1.0 offer multiplier, and weekday audience segment has 0.4 offer multiplier.Advertisement can have the quotation of Zui Da $1.00 for each selection.Suppose that first terminal user in the Utah State has submitted the search inquiry for " footwear " to.In this example, advertisement can not be provided because this advertisement is a targeted with the terminal user of California by qualified.Therefore, in this example the audient hive off " California user devices " be used to target and determine, rather than be used for firm offer.Suppose to have submitted search inquiry on Tu. for " footwear " second terminal user of California.In this case, advertisement can be by qualified providing, and if second terminal user can in arbitration, use the quotation (=$1.00*1.0) of $1.00 and be used for determining payment when having selected advertisement.At last, suppose to have submitted search inquiry on Saturday for " footwear " the 3rd terminal user of California.In this case, advertisement can be by qualified providing, and if the 3rd terminal user can be in arbitration when having selected advertisement Shi Yong $0.40 ($0.40*0.4) quotation and be used for determining payment.
§ 4.3.1 sample data structure
Fig. 4 illustrates exemplary ad information 325 ' according to the invention.Advertising message 325 ' can comprise such as above-mentioned information.For example, advertising message 325 ' can comprise unique ad identifier, advertising creative content (perhaps pointing to the pointer of this creative content) and/or landing page link (for example URL) etc.In addition, exemplary ad information 325 ' can comprise that the audient divides multiple targets to determine that information and audient hive off pricing information one of at least.The audient hives off into the effective information (not shown) can be tracked and be associated with advertisement.
Audient's locating information of hiving off can comprise one or more positional informations, temporal information, client device information, user profile etc.
Positional information can be to comprise following geographical location information: one or more countries, one or more zone, one or more province, one or more busy areas, first or a plurality of city, one or more cities and towns, one or more postcode and/or one or more area codes etc.Therefore, the for example commercial irrigation system of selling can fix on its advertising objective California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico, and commercial sell snow blower can be with its advertising objective surely to state with more relatively snowfall such as the Maine and the Minnesota State.Drycleaner's can be with its advertising objective due to cities and towns that it was positioned at and adjacent cities and towns and/or each postcode and/or each area code.Occuptional movement team can use it for the advertising objective of admission ticket and commodity due to busy areas.Internal transportation company can be with its advertising objective due to a country.
Temporal information can comprise following one or more: hour scope, date or date range and all several or all several scopes.Therefore, for example, the Pizza pastry shop can be with its advertising objective due to time for eating meals, and football Sunday in season.Flower delivery business can schedule its advertising objective three days before the Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and the These Days.
Client device information can comprise following one or more: whether client device is portable, whether client device moves, whether client device has call function, whether client device has message sending function (instant message for example, Email etc.), client device whether has display and display characteristics is how if any, whether client device has loudspeaker, the characteristic of client device communication link, whether client device has for image, audio frequency, video, sufficient processing power of animation etc. or the like.
User equipment information can comprise following one or more: user demographic information (for example age or age bracket, income or income range, religious belief, marital status, sex, education degree etc.), user behavior information (advertisement selection in for example web page browsing history, past, the on-line purchase in past etc.), mother tongue or the like.
Pricing information can comprise the pricing information that hives off for one or more audients.As mentioned above, the pricing information that hives off for each audient can be determined according to so-called " benchmark " pricing information (it can be associated with (not necessarily) particular audience segment), rule, function and/or parameter.
§ 4.3.2 exemplary method
Fig. 5 uses audience segment information to come the process flow diagram of the definite exemplary method of robotization pricing information by mode according to the invention.Receive advertising message (piece 510).Advertising message divides multiple targets to determine information, (for example each audient hives off) one-tenth effective information (for example selection rate, conversion ratio etc.) etc. except out of Memory can comprise the audient.The reception audient hives off (piece 520) and receives basis quote (it is associated with particular audience segment) (piece 530).Subsequently, shown in circulation 540-560, move for each execution that one or more audients hive off.Especially, some appraisal indications of using basis quote and audient to hive off to be the member's firm offer (module 550) in audient's group.In this way, can determine with respect to basis quote with audient's offer values that is associated of hiving off.
Fig. 6 carries out the hive off process flow diagram (looking back for example operation 315 of Fig. 3) of exemplary method 600 of selection operation of audient by mode according to the invention.Receive advertising message (piece 610).Advertising message can comprise (for example hiving off specific to the audient) one-tenth effective information except out of Memory.As circulate shown in the 620-650, can be for each execution action of one or more advertisements.More special, obtain audient's selections (for example from the system of advertisement providing system, advertiser and/or advertiser's approval is selected) (piece 630) of hiving off, and the audient of selection be associated with this advertisement (piece 640) that hive off.
Still reference block 630, and the audient hives off and can define (may ratify through the advertiser) by system, or is specified by the advertiser.Under preceding a kind of situation, system can use into effective information and define audient's hive off (for example point by determining that the advertisement effect changes, transforms).For example, if the conversion ratio of an advertisement sharply descends for the user outside the California, system can hive off the audient and is defined as (i) in California with (ii) outside California so.The quantity that the audient hives off can come to determine (for example based on the quantity by the intelligible conversion of effect) as the case may be, can be predetermined quantity (for example between 2 and 4 and preferably 3), perhaps can be provided by the advertiser.
Fig. 7 is a process flow diagram (looking back the piece 550 of Fig. 5) of carrying out the exemplary method 700 of automatic offer management operations by mode according to the invention.Receive advertising message (for example basis quote and audient hive off appraisal indication) (piece 710).Method 700 subsequently can be before method 700 finishes (node 730) use the hive off indication (rule, function and/or the parameter that for example produce automatically and/or provide by the advertiser) of appraisal of basis quote that the advertiser provides and audient to be some audient automatic firm offer (piece 720) of hiving off.
As previously discussed, the advertiser can select basis quote (for example being associated with preferred audient).Basis quote can be according to the hive off selection appraisal of (for example geographic area of Zhong Yiing) of the audient that the advertiser likees.How the advertiser has stipulated to bid automatically management method 700 for each audient hives off definite or adjustment (for example classification) quotation, and this will determine by following manner:
(A) each of hiving off for a plurality of audients provides parameter (for example multiplication factor), (B) provides or choice function, and it comprises parameter (quotation=basis quote * 1/ distance for example
n, wherein n is a parameter; Perhaps quotation=quotation * MAX[1, the 0.80+ selection rate
The audient hives off]), (C) rule.
By the effect of comparative advertising in each audient hives off, the advertiser can be known the relative appraisal that each audient hives off.For example, if quotation is by each advertisement presentation, the advertiser wants to know that advertisement is at each audient hives off in the middle of each selection rate or conversion ratio so.As another example, if quotation is by each advertisement selection, the advertiser wants to know that advertisement is at each audient hives off in the middle of each conversion ratio so.
As understood from the foregoing, because the advertiser can specify and how determine or adjust quotation for advertisement, the management method of bidding automatically 700 can be in advertising campaign be determined automatically or is adjusted quotation (for example in real time according to the shown audient who gives of advertisement) further intervention without the advertiser for each audient hive off.And if the advertiser adjusts its basis quote, method 700 also can be adjusted quotation for one or more audients hive off automatically.The example of this operation will be described in following § 4.4.
Fig. 8 is a process flow diagram of carrying out the exemplary method 800 of user behavior feedback operation (for example look back Fig. 3 320) by mode according to the invention.Method 800 is methods that a kind of track ad becomes effective information.When advertisement is provided, can discern this incident by unique procedure identifier (for example Advertisement Server IP address, time in date and one day and/or other constraint information is provided).Procedure identifier can be associated with any audience segment information (for example positional information, temporal information, user equipment information, user profile).In fact, at least some this audience segment information can be encoded as procedure identifier.Advertisement can utilize its procedure identifier that (piece 810) is provided.Shown in event block 820, can come the different branches of manner of execution 80 in response to different event.For example, if received user behavior information, before method 800 is got back to event block 820, the user behavior information of reception (for example by mouse move, hover, drag, select, conversion etc.) (and therefore related with audience segment information) (piece 830) is associated with procedure identifier.If satisfy be used to be updated to effective information condition (for example, become the reception of effective information, the reception of the one-tenth effective information of certain amount, the time limit of final updating arrives, absolute time/date etc.), before method 800 is got back to event block 820, consider that providing the audience segment information of process to upgrade advertisement about advertisement becomes effective information (piece 840) so.
Therefore, method 800 can be used to hive off to come track ad to become effective information according to the audient.It can be the audient of global definition hive off (for example general to all advertisers, general to some advertiser groups, general to all advertisements, general etc. to some advertisement groups) that the audient hives off.Interchangeable or additional, the audient audient that can be defined as corresponding to by particular advertisement master appointment that hives off hives off.Therefore, at least some embodiment according to the invention, the advertisement effect is hived off and is followed the trail of according to (predefine or advertiser's definition) audient.
Similarly, effect can wait based on the set of advertisement, advertiser, advertisement (for example those use same targets to determine information), advertiser's set and follow the trail of.Various all is possible with advertiser's information of hiving off with the variety of way that becomes effective information to be associated.

§ 4.3.4 replaces and refinement
Although bidding management device 330 is described to determine (for example classification) quotation based on advertiser's input automatically, in at least some embodiment according to the invention, any rule, function and/or parameter that automatic offer management operations 330 can not need to follow advertiser's setting are adjusted bid.For example, automatically offer management operations 330 can simply be determined the effect that each audient of advertising campaign hives off (for example by 320 trackings of user behavior feedback operation) and use this information that different quotations is hived off with different audient to be associated.Automatically offer management operations 330 can along with the audient hive off effect change and adjust quotation for some audient hives off.
Although term " audient hives off " can use some to disperse or quantization scale represents that the group of audience members is (for example in 0～5 mile radius, in 5～10 mile radius, outside 10 mile radius), hive off and be interpreted as comprising successive value (for example along with the increase of the quantity of hiving off, hiving off can be continuously approaching).Therefore, quotation can use one or more audience attributes (for example with advertiser's distance, the time that advertisement provides etc.) to determine, thereby can have almost unlimited audient to hive off.
Although some above-mentioned specific embodiments discussed for each audient hive off " automatically " determine or adjust quotation that the information that at least some embodiment according to the invention can simply evaluate relevant (for example relative) of hiving off about different audients is delivered to the advertiser.After obtaining notice, the advertiser can use this information to come to specify different quotations for different audients hive off subsequently.Therefore for example, example system according to the invention can give information to the advertiser, such as " information of having collected based on us, from the user in your shop 2 mile radius select to be worth be from 2 miles outer but the user in 10 miles selects 3 times and be 20 times that select from 10 miles outer users ".At least some embodiment according to the invention can invite the advertiser to carry out system's adjustment or automatically determine their quotation for each audient hives off.Therefore, for example, this example system can give information or " button " gives the advertiser, such as " click here and correspondingly adjust the keyword quotation of hiving off for each audient ".
As mentioned above, how the advertiser can determine or adjust (for example classification) quotation for each audient hives off by following manner stipulate to bid automatically management method 700: (A) each of hiving off for a plurality of audients provides parameter, (B) provide or choice function (can comprise parameter), and/or (C) provide rule.As first example, the advertiser can simply provide (for example quotation of convergent-divergent function for one or more audients hive off
The audient hives off _ i=quotation
Benchmark* the factor
The audient hives off _ i) and multiplication factor parameter (usually less than the 1.0) basis quote that comes convergent-divergent (for example reducing) to hive off for these audients.As second example, the advertiser can be one or more audients and hives off (for example quotation of addition or subtraction function is provided
The audient hives off _ i=quotation
Benchmark+ adjustment the factor
The audient hives off _ i) and adjust factor parameter (for example positive or negative) and increase or reduce the basis quote that hives off for these audients.Therefore, for example, the audient that the advertiser with animated advertising is intended for " having the end user device of " good " resolution " the payment subsidy (for example at every turn manifesting additional $0.25) of hiving off.As the 3rd example, the rule that the advertiser can specify some audient to hive off and hive off better than other audient, thereby the quotation of hiving off based on other audient, light weighting or ignore in quotation is determined or adjusted.Therefore for example, the advertiser of propaganda Ford Mustang restaurant part can hive off to the audient " user=Vintage_Ford_Mustang_Owner " thus high appraisal they will ignore this user's position, if and the audient to hive off be " user=Not_Vintage_Ford_Mustang_Owner ", then use location-based audient to hive off to determine or adjust quotation.
Example of operation in § 4.4 embodiments
Example 1
Following example explanation meets the practicality of the specific embodiment of the present invention.In this example, consider to want local most of local advertising master who propagates its product.
The advertiser can import advertising message by advertising message input and/or bookkeeping 310, and target face is hived off and is initially the audient to wide relatively audient provides a quotation.After input information, ad system can provide advertisement.By user behavior feedback operation 320, divide group time when offering each audient, the advertiser can be known the relative appraisal of its advertisement presentation, selection etc.
For example, the local advertising master can realize from guiding (lead) guiding in the 30-60 kilometer range recently in the zone within 30 kilometers apart from their position more valuable, and recently more valuable, and be not worth from the guiding outside 100 kilometers from the guiding of 60-100 kilometer from the guiding in the 30-60 kilometer range.Therefore, the advertiser can divide multiple targets to determine to define the operation 315 or select three (3) individual audients to hive off from the audient.It can be the terminal user within 30 kilometers apart from advertiser's position that first audient hives off.This audient is also because its best effect can be used as " benchmark " and the advertiser that the advertiser selects can hive off related with first audient with basis quote (for example bid).Suppose that basis quote is every selection $2.00, other audient hives off and will compare with this basis quote.But second audient hives off and can comprise outside 30 kilometers the user within 60 kilometers.But the 3rd audient hives off and can comprise outside 60 kilometers the user within 100 kilometers.(audient within 100 kilometers hives off and can be used as the target of advertisement delivery, thereby if end user device no longer within 100 kilometers advertisement in addition can not be by qualified supply).
Provide basis quote and audient to hive off now, how advertiser's can stipulate to bid automatically bookkeeping 330 is different audients definite (for example classification) quotation of hiving off.The advertiser can be provided with the relative value that rule, function and/or the parameter used by automatic bid manager are adjusted bid.For example, in this example, it is related to suppose that the advertiser hives off 1.00 bid multiplication factor and first audient, and it is related that the bid multiplication factor with 0.80 and second audient hive off, and hive off related with the 3rd audient 0.40 bid multiplication factor.Any intervention that now need not the advertiser, it is that (classification) offer values is determined in its advertisement in real time automatically that system can hive off based on the audient who it is provided advertisement.In this case, the quotation Shi $2.00 of every selection of hiving off for first audient, the quotation Shi $1.60 of every selection of hiving off for second audient, the quotation Shi $0.80 of every selection of hiving off for the 3rd audient.These quotations can be used to advertisement arbitrated procedure (for example determining to provide the auction with the position) and/or the definite advertiser quantity for the advertisement selection payment.If the advertiser changes its basis quote (for example arriving $3.00), can automatically upgrade (for example arriving $3.00, $2.40 and $1.20) for the quotation that three audients hive off so.
Example 2
Following example explanation various (may independently) audient hives off and the parameter that is associated with it makes up as mode according to the invention how.Suppose that truck dealer has the video ads of full screen 600*800 pixel, be used for the small-sized cargo truck of Ford 350SuperDuty open.Supposing in addition one, constraint is provided is that constraint is provided is that end user device should be domestic in the U.S. or Canada for keyword " ford " (basis quote of Ju You $1.50) and another.Be connected by acceptable manner with high-speed Internet and present advertisement because this advertisement request end user device has the large scale screen, the advertiser can hive off at the subscriber equipment audient, for " have and the connect computing machine at a high speed " association factor 1.0 that hives off, for " have low speed and the connect computing machine " association factor 0.05 that hives off, and for the cellular phone association factor 0.00 that hives off.Because this advertisement is compared to women's more attractive for the male sex, the advertiser can hive off at the final user audient, for hiving off " male sex " association factor 1.0 and for " women " association factor 0.10 that hives off.Because the advertiser can obtain more sales volumes at weekend, can hive off at the time audient, to hiving off " weekend " association factor 1.0 and for " working day " association factor 0.75.At last, because the advertiser can obtain more sales volumes to the client in 20 miles, the audient hives off at the position, can be to " 0-20 mile " association factor 1.0 that hives off, to hiving off " 20-60 mile " association factor 0.70 and for "＞60 miles " association factor that hives off (0.7-(distance-60)/100).
Under following situation, suppose that domestic and user input comprises the search inquiry of word " ford " to subscriber equipment in the U.S..Suppose that in first example 26 miles male sex far away (Mon-Fri) on weekdays use and have the computing machine that high-speed Internet connects and imported search inquiry " ford ".Quotation for advertisement in this example can Bei Quedingwei $0.79 (≈ $1.50*1.00*0.75*1.00*0.70).Suppose that in second example 2 miles male sex far away use the computing machine with low speed the Internet connection to import search inquiry " ford " at weekend.In this example, can Bei Quedingwei $0.08 (≈ $1.50*1.00*1.00*1.00*0.05) for the quotation of advertisement.Suppose that in the 3rd example 5 miles women far away use the computing machine inputted search inquiry " ford " with high-speed Internet connection on weekdays, and the quotation for advertisement can Bei Quedingwei $0.11 (≈ $1.50*0.10*1.00*1.00*0.75) in this example.Suppose in the 4th example, women's inputted search inquiry " ford ", but can not determine about the out of Memory (for example position, time, subscriber equipment) of inquiry.Quotation for advertisement in this example can Bei Quedingwei $0.15 (≈ $1.50*0.10).Attention if audience segment information is unknown, is then ignored this information (being that the factor is assumed to be 1.00) in last example.Interchangeable, also can use default factor for unknown audience segment.The value of default factor can be that average, the audient of predetermined value, some factors hives off for genuiner probability estimate etc.
As can be understood from the front above example, the factor that is used for firm offer can be made up of each factor.Although in this example, this combination is the simple product of each factor, and it also is possible being used to produce other function of connector.This connector makes the advertiser can avoid hive off specified rule, function and/or parameter to narrowly-defined combination audient.For example, 3 subscriber equipmenies capable of being combined hive off, 2 tenant groups, and 2 time hives off and hive off and define the individual possible combination audient in 36 (=3 * 2 * 2 * 3) and hive off in 3 positions.
