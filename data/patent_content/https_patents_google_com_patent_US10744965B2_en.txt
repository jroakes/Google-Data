- a transport facilitation system can configure an autonomous vehicle (AV) for a requesting user prior to pick-up.
- the transport facilitation system can provide an application-based transportation arrangement service that can arrange transportation for requesting users throughout a given region.
- the transport facilitation system can receive pick-up requests from users within the given region, and select AVs proximate to the requesting users to service the pick-up requests.
- the transport facilitation system can transmit configuration commands to cause the selected AVs to configure various interior components (e.g., seat positions, individual seat adjustments, seat temperature, air temperature, radio settings, windows, mirrors, lighting, etc.) based on the preferences or requirements of the requesting user.
- a user interface can be generated on a requesting user's mobile computing device, enabling the user to set preference parameters for the AV prior to pick-up.
- the user interface can be generated on a designated application for a transportation arrangement service managed by the transport facilitation system.
- the requesting user can configure a comfort profile indicating preferred AV settings, and the comfort profile can be stored by the transport facilitation system, or locally on the mobile computing device.
- the backend transport facilitation system can select a proximate AV to service the pick-up request, determine the configurable parameters of the AV, and cause the user interface on the requesting user's mobile computing device to generate a preference menu—based on the configurable parameters of the selected AV—that enables the user to make selections to configure various adjustable parameters of the AV prior to pick-up.
- the adjustable parameters can include seat positioning, seat temperature, air temperature, a seating configuration, a home page display on a display screen, a language preference, preferred radio stations, interior lighting (e.g., colors, brightness), and the like.
- the backend transport facilitation system can transmit a notification to the requesting user's mobile computing device to indicate a particular seat of the AV that has been assigned and configured for that user (e.g., with preferred seat adjustments, temperature, audio selections, etc.).
- a notification may be advantageous for AV carpooling in which the transport facilitation system can route a particular AV to make multiple pick-ups and drop-offs while configuring individual seats and user preferences of the AV at the same time.
- accelerometer data from the user's mobile computing device can be analyzed to determine a height, weight, body type, and/or gait of the user to make adjustments to a seat on which the user will travel in the AV.
- the mobile computing device can transmit the raw accelerometer data and location data to the transport facilitation system to analyze for directional acceleration peaks to determine stride length or gait pattern signatures of the user.
- the transport facilitation system can determine the height and/or weight of the user on a high level, and on a lower level, the user's femur length, leg length (and estimated torso length), and/or an estimated posture in order to make adjustments to, for example, a backrest angle, a thigh extension (e.g., cushion edge adjustment), a fore-and-aft position, a headrest angle, a headrest level, a lumbar position, a seat depth, a seat height, an upper seat tilt angle, and a shoulder support element of the user's seat.
- a backrest angle e.g., cushion edge adjustment
- a fore-and-aft position e.g., a headrest angle
- a headrest level e.g., a lumbar position
- seat depth e.g., a seat height
- an upper seat tilt angle e.g., an upper seat tilt angle
- an AV that optimizes timing to configure preference settings when en route to rendezvous with a requesting user.
- the AV can receive a set of configurations for interior systems based on user preferences, and determine an optimal timing schedule to configure each of the interior systems such that the AV is configured for the requesting user as the AV arrives at the pick-up location.
- the AV can execute the user's preferences just prior to pick-up (e.g., 15-20 seconds prior to arriving at the pick-up location).
- the AV can determine a time frame necessary to achieve the preferred temperature(s), and can perform an optimization operation to initiate the climate control system and/or seat temperature system to achieve the desired temperature(s) just prior to arriving at the pick-up location in order to optimize power consumption.
- some or all of the timing characteristics for optimizing timing to configure the AV may be performed by the transport facilitation system. Accordingly, the optimal timing schedule can be determined by the transport facilitation system, and transmitted to the AV for execution prior to pick-up.
- the transport facilitation system can store preference logs or comfort profiles in a database that indicate setup preferences—corresponding to the adjustable interior component of the AV—for users of the transportation arrangement service.
- the transport facilitation system can receive a pick-up request from computing device running a designated application of the transportation arrangement service.
- the pick-up request can include a unique identifier identifying the requesting user of the computing device, and a pick-up location.
- the transport facilitation system can perform a lookup in the database for a comfort profile indicating AV setup preferences for the user. Based on the pick-up location, the transport facilitation system can select an AV to service the pick-up request.
- the transport facilitation system can transmit a set of configuration commands to configure the adjustable components of the AV for the user prior to the AV rendezvousing with the requesting user. Accordingly, the interior systems of the AV can be preemptively configured prior to pick-up.
- the transport facilitation system can service pick-up requests for respective users over time and receive configuration data corresponding to the user configuring the interior systems (e.g., seat positioning, radio station selections, browsing data, etc.).
- the transport facilitation system can identify preference patterns in the configuration data and store and update preference data for each of the user in the database based on the preference patterns.
- the preference data for a user may be updated based on feedback provided by the user.
- the transport facilitation system can receive feedback indicating user experience ratings for AV rides. In some aspects, if the rating is below a certain threshold (e.g., two out of five stars), the transport facilitation system can be triggered to analyze AV data for the trip to identify potential causes for the low rating.
- a certain threshold e.g., two out of five stars
- the AV data can include control system inputs and sensor data corresponding to acceleration, braking, and steering of the AV during the trip and/or data indicating an operational mode of the AV during the trip (e.g., a normal mode or high caution mode).
- the transport facilitation system can identify anomalous instances indicating potential causes for the rating being below the predetermined threshold. For example, the transport facilitation system can identify instances of anomalous braking, anomalous acceleration, anomalous steering, over-caution, under-caution, speeding, and/or driving too slowly by the AV.
- the transport facilitation system can identify certain patterns and learn the user's preferences based on ratings information, and update the preferences of the user to mitigate anomalous instances in future rides. For example, using the ratings data, the transport facilitation system can learn that the user prefers more expedient travel as opposed to more highly cautious travel.
- the examples described herein achieve a technical effect of providing comfort to users of a transportation arrangement service by preemptively configuring the interior systems of an autonomous vehicle (AV) prior to pick-up.

- An AV refers to any vehicle which is operated in a state of automation with respect to steering and propulsion. Different levels of autonomy may exist with respect to AVs. For example, some vehicles may enable automation in limited scenarios, such as on highways, provided that drivers are present in the vehicle. More advanced AVs can drive without any human assistance from within or external to the vehicle. Such vehicles are often required to make advanced determinations regarding how the vehicle behaves given challenging surroundings of the vehicle environment.
