Multiple location information may be received from a mobile device. For some location information of the multiple location information, POIs associated with the location information may be identified. A location history based on the identified POIs may be generated. The location history may comprise a POI list including one or more POIs visited by a user of the mobile device. A rating interface may be generated based on the location history to enable rating of one or more POIs of the POI list subsequent to a time associated with a received location coordinate for which the at least one POI was identified. The system, in one aspect, may include a communication module, an identification module, a location history module, an interface module, memory, and a display device.
Description
- Several systems may allow users to rate points of interest (POIs). Some systems may allow users to search for the points of interest based on the user's current location. However, in order for a user to rate a point of interest that the user is visiting, the user may have to take the time and effort to pull out a mobile device, search for the POI, and rate the POI. Frequently the user is no longer at the POI when she has the time to input a rating. The user may need to search through numerous possibilities in order to recall the POI that the user has visited in the past. The POI may be a branch of a chain with many similarly or identically named stores near the location that the user has been at. In that case (and others), it may be difficult for the user to identify the particular point of interest, at which the user has been some time ago.
- According to one aspect of the subject technology, a system for rating points of interest (POIs) using a mobile device location history is provided. The system may include a communication module, memory, an identification module, a location history module, and an interface module. The communication module may be configured to receive location information for a plurality of locations at which the mobile device was present from a mobile device associated with a user. The memory may store a database of location information based on the plurality of location information received from the one or more mobile devices. The identification module may be configured to identify, using the received location information, POIs associated with some of the locations. The location history module may be configured to generate a location history based on the identified POIs. The location history may comprise data objects identifying the identified POIs.

Communication module 220 may be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware, software and/or firmware.Communication module 220 may receive location information frommobile device 120, e.g., a number of location information from one or moremobile devices 120. The location information may represent the location information of the places at whichmobile device 120 has been in the last predetermined period of time (e.g., last 3 minutes, or 3 weeks). Themobile device 120 may report its location in predetermined periods of time (e.g., every 3 minutes). In one aspect,communication module 220 may also receive each location coordinate with an associated time indicating a time that themobile device 120 was located near that location coordinate and the user of themobile device 120 was presumably in a near vicinity of that location coordinate.Communication module 220 may further receive each location coordinate with an associated time duration indicating a time duration that themobile device 120 was not moving substantially from that location coordinate. This may indicate that the user of themobile device 120 was presumably staying in a near vicinity of that location coordinate for that time duration. The location information and their associated times and time durations may be stored in alocation data 235 ofmemory 230.Encryption module 285 may encrypt location information prior to storing the information in thelocation data 235. - Still referring to
FIG. 2 ,database 240 may be a local server database stored in a memory ofserver 110, for example, inmemory 230, or instorage 250. In some aspects,database 240 maybe external toserver 110, for example, stored in a remote server or a client device or be distributed on a number of servers as a distributed database.Database 240 may store information relating to a number of POIs. The information may include identification information (e.g., a name, such as a museum name), geographic location information (e.g., country, state, city, etc.), location information boundary information (e.g., some location information that specify boundaries of the POI location), category (e.g., public place, business place, event place, tourist attraction, etc), and the like.Database 240 may be indexed by various indices such as identification information, geographic location information, category and the like. -
Server 110 may receive location information from multiple mobile devices and store the received location information ondatabase 240.Server 110 may provide the location information and rankings received from other mobile devices that relates to one or more POIs to a user ofmobile device 120 and solicit rating of that POIs by the user ofmobile device 120. The server may useprocessor 210 to process the rating results related to a POI received from multiple users, for example, to generate various aggregated or average ratings based on the rating results.Server 110 may communicate the average rating or an overall rating based on the aggregated values of the rating results to the user of themobile device 120 or users of other mobile devices. - In an aspect,
communication module 220 may receive location information from a plurality of mobile devices (e.g., mobile device 120). Each of the mobile devices may be associated with a user.Server 110 may store each location history in a secure format with information associating the location history with the corresponding user.Communication module 220 may receive location information for those locations at which the user has interacted with the mobile device to record the user's presence at the respective location. In an aspect,server 110 may limit the location history to POIs corresponding to such locations. -
Identification module 270 may use thelocation data 235 and the POI information stored indatabase 240 to identify one or more POIs visited by the user of mobile device 120 (hereinafter “the user”). The identification module may include known search methods that for each location coordinate stored in thelocation data 235query database 240 to search for an associated POI. If a POI is found for a location coordinate or a group of location coordinates, then it can be assured, based on an associated time durations stored for that location coordinate of the group of location coordinates that the POI was visited by the user. For example,identification module 270 may list a POI in the POI list of thelocation history 160 as a visited POI by the user, if the associated duration times satisfy a condition, for example, are longer than a predetermined period of time (e.g., 10 minutes), indicating that the user most likely spent at least 10 minutes in that POI.Identification module 270 may be able to obtain boundary location coordinate associated with a POI fromdatabase 240.Identification module 270 can then determine the associated time duration associated with the POI based on the associated times of location coordinates within that boundary. - In some embodiments, the location history can be generated in response to user triggers (e.g., user initiated check-ins).
Server 110 may receive the check-in information associated with the POI from the website. Identification module may use the checking information as an evidence that the user visited the POI. This is particularly useful when a POI includes a number of sub-locations of interest, for example, when the user visits Eiffel Tower and spends some time in a specific coffee shop or gift shop in the Tower, it may not be easy to identify the location of the coffee shop or the gift shop from the location coordinates alone. The check-in information, for example, can help theidentification module 270 to specifically identify the sub-locations of interest visited by the user or to gauge a threshold interest of the user in locations. In some embodiments, the user grants an authorization to the mobile device or an application running on the device to provide location information, e.g., from a location manager on the mobile device to the server. - In an aspect, the
identification module 270 may determine a POI visited by the user of the mobile device by identifying a WiFi hotspot, known to be associated with the POI, in a WiFi connection records of the mobile device. A WiFi hotspot may be uniquely identified by, for example, a service set identifier (SSID) and a media access control (MAC) address. The identification module may query a database of SSID or MAC addresses to obtain SSID or MAC address of the WiFi hotspot. So, when the user of the mobile device is traveling in a location where GPS signal is weak, the position of the mobile device may be determined based on connection information recorded in the mobile device showing that user has connected to a hotspot, which can be identified based on a SSID or MAC address available form the database. -
Location history module 280 may be configured to generate a location history based on the identified POIs. The location history may comprise data objects that identify the POIs that are identified by theidentification module 270. Each data object may comprise a unique identifier (e.g., POI1, POI2 POIM, ofFIG. 3 ) that references the POI in a POI database (e.g., database 240).Location history module 280 may comprise a POI list that includes a list of one or more POIs visited by the user. The information stored in a POI list may also include the time duration associated with each POI visited by the user and/or one or more times or time intervals when the user was at the POI. As mentioned above, some of the information relating to a visited POI may be obtained from check-in services. In cases where the user has visited a POI or one or more sub-location of the same POI (e.g., POI being the Eiffel Tower and the sub-location being a coffee shop in the Eiffel Tower) for a number of times,location history module 280 may include only the first visit to that POI or the sub-location of the same POI inlocation history 160. The location history may also comprise chronological information that indicates whenmobile device 120 was present at the POIs. The chronological information may be received with the location information for at least some of the locations. The chronological information may also indicate the duration that the mobile device was present at the POIs. - Still discussing
FIG. 2 , theinterface module 290 may be configured to generate a rating interface base onlocation history 160. The rating interface may include one or more user interfaces that allow the user to rate, in a later time, one of more POIs visited by the user from a location far from the location of the visited POIs. The user interfaces may include one or more maps or charts (e.g., tables) showing or listing the location of the POIs. The user interface, for each shown or listed POI, may also allow the user to confirm that the user has actually visited the POI and wish to rate that POI. - In some aspects,
communication module 220 may prompt the user (e.g., transmit electronic messages (e.g., email, text message, etc.) to the user), after one or more POIs are identified as most likely visited by the user, to inquire whether the user is willing to provide a user response, such as a rating for those POIs. In some aspects, the user may initiate rating of the visited POIs by activating a user interface or navigating to a website associated withserver 110. The website can provide a user interface (see examples inFIGS. 4 and 5 ) to rate the POI or POIs the user wishes to rate. - In an aspect,
communication module 220 may transmit tomobile device 120 or a device authorized by the user of mobile device 120 (e.g., another mobile device or other device) portions oflocation history 160 and instructions for causing themobile device 120 or the authorized device to display a graphical user interface and prompt the user to provide responses to POIs inlocation history 160. The portion oflocation history 160 transmitted tomobile device 120 my be limited the POIs for whichserver 110 does not have a response from the user or POIs for which the server does not have at least a threshold number of (e.g., three) responses from users. - Referring to
mobile device 120 ofFIG. 2 , location manager 123 may be configured to obtain location information for the mobile device.Communication unit 122 may be configured to communicate with thecommunication module 220 and provide location information and associated time and associated time durations toserver 110.Communication unit 122 may also be configured to receive signals from a location monitoring system such as a number of satellites (e.g., three satellites) of a global positioning systems (GPS). In one aspect,communication unit 122 may transmit the GPS signals to thecommunication module 220, forserver 110 to process the GPS signals and obtain the location information including location coordinates, the associated times and the associated time durations. In another aspect, location manager 123 may obtain the location information, the associated times and the associated time durations from the received GPS signals. In yet another aspect, the location manager 123 may obtain the location information from signals received from a number of (e.g., at least three) cellular towers, for which themobile device 120 may have position information. - In yet another aspect, location manager 123 may receive location information from a location service on the mobile device.
Mobile device 120 may useprocessor 126 to identify POIs associated with at least some of the locations.Mobile device 120 may query a database (e.g., database 240) or a remote server (e.g., server 110) to provide information toprocessor 126 to identify the POIs.Mobile device 120 may also store in memory 125 a location history based on the identified POIs. The location history may comprise data objects that can identify the POIs. Each data object may comprise a unique identifier (e.g., POI1, POI2 . . . POIM, ofFIG. 3 ) that references the POI in a POI database (e.g., database 240). -
Mobile device 120 may useprocessor 126 to process the GPS signals or cellular tower signals and obtain location information. In some aspects,mobile device 120 may utilize firmware or software applications executable byprocessor 126 to process the GPS signals or cellular tower signals. For example, the firmware or software applications may use a well-known triangulation method to obtain the location information ofmobile device 120. The location information ofmobile device 120 may include location coordinates including a latitude, a longitude, and an altitude (xyz, for example in tall structures with multiple levels); or polar coordinates. For calculating an associated time duration for a location coordinate, mobile device may rely on location information sampled over time or an accelerometer data for example, the duration of time that the mobile device is not moving substantially or stays in a nears vicinity (e.g., within a zone with a predetermined radius such as 300 feet) of a location coordinate. In an aspect, the location manager 123 may provides information indicating that the location has not changed. Alternatively,mobile device 120 may analyze signals from location systems such as GPS to detect lack of movement characterized by a substantially slow down of the movement of the signals or no movement of the signal out of a certain boundary associated with the POI, indicating that themobile device 120 has not moved out of that boundary. Themobile device 120 may store information such as the location information inmemory 125. -
