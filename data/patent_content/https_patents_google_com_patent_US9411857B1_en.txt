Definitions
- This specification relates to Internet search engines, and more particularly to providing information about groups of entities related to an entity identified by a search request.
- a search system can provide one or more knowledge panels in response to a received search request.
- a knowledge panel is a user interface element that provides information related to a particular entity referenced by the search query.
- the entity may be a person, place, country, landmark, animal, historical event, organization, business, sports team, sporting event, movie, song, album, game, work of art, concept, or any other entity.
- a knowledge panel provides information about the entity.
- a knowledge panel for a famous singer may include the name of the singer, an image of the singer, a description of the singer, facts about the singer, content that identifies songs and albums recorded by the singer, and/or links to searches related to the singer.
- Other types of information and content can also be presented in the knowledge panel.
- Information presented in a knowledge panel can include content obtained from multiple disparate sources, e.g., multiple different web pages accessible over the Internet.
- a search system can maintain an entity database that stores information about various entities.
- the system assigns a unique entity identifier to each entity.
- the entity database is curated.
- the system can assign one or more text string aliases to each entity.
- the Statue of Liberty can be associated with aliases “the Statue of Liberty” and “Lady Liberty.” Aliases need not be unique among entities.
- “jaguar” can be an alias for both an animal and a car manufacturer.
- the system can also store information about an entity's relationship to other entities.
- the system can define a “located in” relationship between two entities to reflect, for example, that the Statue of Liberty is located in New York City.
- the system stores relationships between entities in a representation of an entity graph in which entity nodes in the entity graph represent distinct entities and links between nodes represent relationships between the entities.
- the system can maintain an entity node representing the Statue of Liberty, an entity node representing New York City, and a link between the entity nodes to represent that the Statue of Liberty is located in New York City.
- This specification describes how a system can provide information about groups of entities related to a particular entity identified by a search request.
- the system can group related entities according to a type of relationship with a particular entity and rank the groups of related entities.
- the system can generate groups of related entities according to paths in an entity graph that lead to the same entity node and have a same path type.
- the groups of related entity nodes can be ranked using various criteria.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search request that includes query text that identifies a first entity; identifying a first entity node in an entity graph that represents the first entity, wherein entity nodes in the entity graph each represent respective entities, wherein links between entity nodes in the entity graph each represent respective relationships between entities, and wherein each link has a particular relationship type; identifying a highest ranked first group of related entity nodes from a ranking of a plurality of groups of related entity nodes, wherein each related entity node in the first group is connected to the first entity node by a respective path from the related entity node through one or more links in the entity graph, and wherein each respective path from each related entity node to the first entity node has a same path type that is defined by relationship types of one or more links in the path; obtaining information associated with one or more entity nodes in the first group of related entity nodes; generating a presentation that includes the information associated with one or more entity nodes in the first
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the actions include determining a plurality of paths in the entity graph from a plurality of seed entity nodes in the entity graph to the first entity node; and generating the plurality of groups of related entity nodes from the plurality of paths from seed entity nodes to the first entity node, wherein seed entity nodes in each group of related entity nodes have a same path type to the first entity node, wherein a path type is defined by one or more relationship types for links between entity nodes on the path.
- Determining a plurality of paths in the entity graph comprises determining a first path having a first path type from a first seed entity node to the first entity node; and assigning a second path type to the first path based on two or more individual path types between the first seed entity node and the first entity node.
- the second path type represents a generalization of multiple individual path types in the first path.
- the ranking of the plurality of groups of related entity nodes is based on a respective measure of popularity of a relationship type of each group of related entity nodes.
- the ranking of the plurality of groups of related entity nodes is based on a respective measure of a number of user selections, from a first entity presentation, to other entity presentations having a relationship type corresponding to each group of related entity nodes.
- the actions include determining individual measures of relationship strength between the first entity node and entity nodes in each of the plurality of groups of related entity nodes; determining a respective an aggregate measure of relationship strength for each group of related entity nodes based on the individual measures of relationship strength between the first entity node and each entity node in the group of related entity nodes; and determining the ranking of the plurality of groups of related entity nodes based on the aggregate measures of relationship strength. Determining individual measures of relationship strength between the first entity node and entity nodes in each of the plurality of groups of related entity nodes comprises determining one or more relationship independent metrics of relationship strength.
- the one or more relationship independent metrics include a measure of co-occurrence, in a collection of documents, of a first text string alias that identifies the first entity and a respective alias that identifies each entity in the group of related entity nodes.
- the one or more relationship independent metrics include a measure of co-occurrence, in a plurality of received search queries, of a first text string alias that identifies the first entity and a respective text string alias that identifies each entity node in the group.
- the one or more relationship independent metrics include a measure of co-occurrence between a first text string alias that identifies the first entity occurring in search queries and a respective text string alias that identifies each entity node in the group occurring in search results for the search queries.
- Generating groups of related entities provides users with more intuitive information about relationships between entities and provides access to more related entities.
- Grouping related entities provides information about more entities in a compact presentation that requires less screen space.
- Ranking groups of related entities can help users find the most popular or most relevant groups of related entities, which can facilitate user exploration of related entities.
- Providing a text description with each of the groups of related entities can provide users with additional and easy-to-understand information about how the related entities are related to a particular entity.

- the knowledge panel 130 also includes two groups of entities that are related to Abraham Lincoln.
- Group 136 includes images of other presidents of the United States. User selection of one of the images will cause the application to request information for that particular entity.
- the search system can provide a knowledge panel for a selected one of the other U.S. presidents in the group 136 in response to the user selection.
- Group 138 includes a list of family members of Abraham Lincoln in the form of text links. User selection of the text links will cause the application to request information for that particular entity, and, in response, the search system can provide a corresponding knowledge panel.
- Other presentation formats to present groups of related entities can also be used.
- the knowledge panel can include entity images presented in a stack of images in which only the first image is visible.
- User selection of the first image in the stack can open the group, e.g. by linking to a presentation that shows other entities in the group. User selection can also cause the application to navigate to a knowledge panel of the first entity or to a web site that includes more information about the entity in the first image.

- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 .
- the system includes a user device 210 coupled to a search system 230 over a network 220 .
- the search system 230 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- the user device 210 transmits a query 212 to the search system 230 , e.g., over the network 220 .
- the query 212 includes one or more terms and can include other information, for example, a location of the user device 210 .
- the search system 230 generates a response, generally in the form of a search results page 216 .
- the search results page 216 can include search results 213 that the search system 230 has identified as being responsive to the query 212 . If the search system 230 determines that the query 212 includes an alias of an entity, the search system can generate a knowledge panel 214 that presents information about the entity, including one or more groups of entities related to the entity, and include the knowledge panel 214 in the search results page 216 .
- the search system 230 transmits the search results page 216 over the network 220 back to the user device 210 for presentation to a user.
- the user device 210 can be any appropriate type of computing device, e.g., mobile phone, tablet computer, notebook computer, music player, e-book reader, laptop or desktop computer, PDA (personal digital assistant), smart phone, a server, or other stationary or portable device, that includes one or more processors 208 for executing program instructions and memory 206 , e.g., random access memory (RAM).
- the user device 210 can include non-volatile computer readable media that store software applications, e.g., a browser or layout engine, an input device, e.g., a keyboard or mouse, a communication interface, and a display device.
- the network 220 can be, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or Wi-Fi network, a mobile telephone network or other telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination of such networks.
- WLAN wireless local area network
- Wi-Fi Wireless Fidelity
- the search system 230 can be implemented as computer programs installed on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each through a network.
- the search system 230 includes a search system front end 240 , a search engine 250 , and a knowledge panel engine 260 .
- the search system front end 240 receives the query 212 from the user device 210 and routes the query 212 to the search engine 250 and the knowledge panel engine 260 .
- the search system front end 240 also provides the resulting search results page 216 that includes the search results 213 and the knowledge panel 214 to the user device 210 .
- the search system front end 240 acts as a gateway, or interface, between user devices and the search system 230 .
- the search engine 250 receives the query 212 and generates search results 213 that are responsive to the query.
- the search engine 250 will generally include an indexing engine for indexing resources in a collection of resources.
- the search engine 250 can index web pages found in a collection of web pages, e.g., web pages on the Internet.
- a collection of resources indexed by the indexing engine may, but need not, be stored within search system 230 , e.g., in index database 252 .
- the search engine 250 can rank the search results 213 using conventional methods and route the ranked search results 213 back to search system front end 240 for inclusion in the search results page 216 .
- the knowledge panel engine 260 receives the query 212 and determines whether the search system 230 should provide a knowledge panel in a response to the query.
- the knowledge panel engine 260 can determine whether the search system 230 should provide a knowledge panel 214 using a data structure of the entity database 262 that maps a text alias to one or more entities, e.g. an entity alias index.
- the alias “Bush” can be mapped to a set of entities having that alias, e.g., the entity “George W. Bush,” the entity “George H. W. Bush,” the entity for the rock band “Bush,” and the entity for a category of plants having that alias.
- the entity alias index may also include a score for each entity that represents a likelihood that the alias refers to each particular entity.
- the knowledge panel engine 260 can use some or all of the query 212 as input to the entity alias index to identify a corresponding entity node in an entity graph.
- the knowledge panel engine 260 can then generate a knowledge panel 214 using information associated with the entity node in the entity graph, including information about one or more groups of related entities.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for determining groups of related entities.
- the system can process relationships between entity nodes in an entity graph and group entities have a same relationship type. The system can then rank the groups of related entities using various criteria.
- the process can be implemented by one or more computer programs installed on one or more computers. The process will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers, e.g. the knowledge panel engine 260 processing information in entity database 262 of FIG. 2 .
- the system identifies a reference entity node ( 310 ).
- the system can select any appropriate entity node in the entity graph to rank groups of entities that are related to the reference entity node.
- the system iterates over a subset of all entity nodes in the entity graph. For example, the system can compute search request statistics to identify a number of the most popular entity nodes in the entity graph and then iterate over the most popular entity nodes to determine groups of related entities.
- the system determines paths from seed entity nodes to the reference entity node ( 320 ).
- the system can analyze links in the entity graph from one or more seed entity nodes to the reference entity node.
- Each seed entity node is an entity node from which the system starts a path.
- the system can use a subset of entity nodes in the entity graph as seed entity nodes to determine paths to the reference entity node.
- Each link in the entity graph represents a relationship of a particular type between one entity node and another entity node. For example, the system can determine a path from a seed entity node representing the movie “True Lies” through a link representing the relationship [leading actor] to a reference entity node representing Arnold Schwarzenegger. Similarly, the system can determine a path from the entity node that represents the movie “Terminator” through a link representing the relationship [leading actor] to the reference entity node representing Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- Links between entity nodes in the graph may also have an associated direction, and the system can determine paths in both link directions between nodes. For example, the system can also determine a separate path from the reference entity node representing Arnold Schwarzenegger through a link representing the relationship [leading actor in] to the destination entity node representing the movie “True Lies.”
- the system can characterize each path by a path type that is defined by the individual relationship types of links in the path. For example, the system can characterize a path having a [son of] relationship between two entity nodes to have a path type [son of]. The system can characterize a path through two [son of] relationships to have a path type [son of, son of].
- the system can assign multiple path types to a single determined path.
- the system can generate other path types according to a set of templates, which may be manually curated or generated automatically.
- the system can generate a path type [grandson of] from an original [son of, son of] path type.
- the system can similarly generate a [other president] path type from an original [president of, president] path type.
- the system can also generalize certain path types. For example, a path type [son of, brother of, father of], e.g. a cousin relationship, can be generalized to be a [family member] path type.
- the entity graph may, but need not, already include an explicit link between seed and destination entity nodes for a particular path.
- the system groups seed entity nodes by path type ( 330 ).
- the system can consider seed entity nodes to be in a same group of related entities if connected to a same destination entity node by a same path type. For example, the path from the entity node representing “True Lies” to the destination entity node for Arnold Schwarzenegger has the same path type, e.g. [leading actor] as a path from the entity node representing “Terminator” to the same destination entity node representing Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- the system can generate a group that includes the seed entity nodes “True Lies” and “Terminator.” Similarly, paths from seed entity nodes that represent Tad Lincoln and Robert Todd Lincoln to the destination entity node for Thomas Lincoln will have a same path type [son of, son of]. Therefore, the system can group the seed entity nodes for Tad Lincoln and Robert Todd Lincoln.
- the system associates with each group a text string that describes the path type.
- the text string can be used to describe the relationship of the related entities with a particular entity and may be used to generate a presentation of the related entities, e.g. a knowledge panel.
- the system can generate the text strings automatically based on the path type used to group the related entities. For example, for the group having entities “True Lies” and “Terminator,” the system can generate a text string “Arnold Schwarzenegger Movies” based on the path type [leading actor]. For the group having entities Tad Lincoln and Robert Todd Lincoln, the system can generate a text string “Grandchildren of Thomas Lincoln.”
- the system can also generate multiple versions of the text string in different languages, either from the relationship type or by translating an initial version of the text string into another language.
- the system can also enforce minimum and maximum group sizes, based on the number of entity nodes in each group. For example, the system can discard groups that have fewer than a minimum number of entity nodes, e.g. fewer than 3 entity nodes. The system can also discard larger groups that have more than a maximum number of entity nodes, e.g. more than 1000 entity nodes.
- the system can alternatively break up large groups into multiple smaller groups based on other information in the entity graph. For example, if an entity node for a particularly prolific author is linked to 200 distinct books written by the author, the system can cluster the group of books into smaller subgroups based on dates of publication, books in a particular series, or books on a particular topic.
- the system determines a ranking of groups of related entity nodes ( 340 ).
- a reference entity node can be associated with multiple groups of related entity nodes.
- the entity node for Abraham Lincoln can be associated with a first group of entity nodes representing other presidents of the United States, as well as a second group of entity nodes representing family members of Abraham Lincoln.
- the system can rank groups of related entity nodes in order to select one or more of multiple groups for presentation in a knowledge panel.
- the system can generate a ranking of the groups based on a variety of criteria.
- One example criteria for ranking groups is a measure of relationship popularity for the path type.
- the system can compute a measure of relationship popularity according to how often the relationship of a particular path type occurs in the graph. For example, the entity graph may include many more links corresponding to a [lead actor] relationship than links corresponding to a [favorite food] relationship.
- the system can compute a score that represents relationship popularity for a path type p by analyzing paths k in the graph, given by:
- the system can alternatively compute a weighted score based on measure of the popularity of the individual entities linked by each path, given by:
- weight(p, e1 k , e2 k ) is a measure of popularity of entities e1 k and e2 k .
- the system can compute a measure of popularity for each individual entity, e.g. as measured by counts or frequency of occurrences of entity aliases for entities e1 k and e2 k in web documents or search queries.
- the system can then compute a combined weight by computing a measure of central tendency between the individual measures of popularity, e.g. an arithmetic or geometric mean.
- the system can also compute a measure of relationship popularity according to user selections that result in navigation from first entity presentations to other entity presentations of entities having a particular relationship type with the first entities. For example, the system can compute a count of user selections that result in navigation from a first entity presentation to a second entity presentation of an entity having a particular relationship type with the first entity, e.g. a user selection that results in a navigation from a knowledge panel for Abraham Lincoln to a knowledge panel for Thomas Jefferson.
- the system can also rank groups of related entity nodes according to a measure of relationship strength between the reference entity node and individual related entity nodes in a group. Thus, the system can rank a group of entity nodes having stronger individual relationships with the reference entity node higher than a group of entity nodes having weaker individual relationships with the reference entity node.
- the system can compute a measure of relationship strength between two entity nodes based on occurrences of entity aliases in a collection of documents, e.g. documents found on the Internet. For example, the system can analyze a collection of web documents to compute a measure of co-occurrence in the web documents between aliases for Abraham Lincoln and aliases for Thomas Jefferson. The system can alternatively or in addition compute a measure of co-occurrences of entity aliases in the same paragraph or same sentence in the web documents.
- the system can also compute the measure of relationship strength based on occurrences of entity aliases in search queries. For example, the system can analyze records of search queries to compute a measure of co-occurrence in the search queries between an alias for Abraham Lincoln and an alias for Thomas Jefferson.
- the system can also compute the measure of relationship strength based on occurrences of entity aliases in search queries and search results provided for the search queries. For example, the system can analyze records of search queries and search results provided for search queries to compute a measure of co-occurrence between an alias for Abraham Lincoln occurring in a search query and an alias for Thomas Jefferson occurring in search results provided for the search query.
- the system can also combine one or more of the measure of relationship strength into a single score representing the relationship strength between the entities. For example, the system can compute weights for each of the measures of relationship strength, where the weights indicate a relative importance of each particular measure. The system can use the weights to compute a weighted measure of relationship strength between the entities.
- the system can further compute an aggregate measure of relationship strength for a group based on individual measures of relationship strength between the reference entity node and each related entity node in a group.
- the system can compute any appropriate measure of central tendency for the individual measures of relationship strength in a group, e.g. an arithmetic mean or geometric mean, a median, a mode, a minimum, or a maximum.
- the system can combine any particular combination of relationship-dependent metrics, e.g. relationship popularity, and relationship-independent metrics, e.g. query co-occurrence frequency, to compute a score for each group of related entities.
- relationship-dependent metrics e.g. relationship popularity
- relationship-independent metrics e.g. query co-occurrence frequency
- the system associates a highest-ranked group with the entity node ( 350 ).
- the system can associate the results of ranking the groups of related entities with the reference entity node.
- the system can store a representation of the highest-ranking group with the reference entity node, which can be, e.g. a set of related entity node identifiers.
- the system can also store the generated text string that describes the relationship of the reference entity node with the group of related entities, e.g. “Other U.S. Presidents.”
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for providing a knowledge panel having a group of related entities.
- the system receives a search request and identifies an entity corresponding to the search request.
- the system provides a knowledge panel for the entity that includes information about a group of entities related to the entity corresponding to the search request.
- the process can be implemented by one or more computer programs installed on one or more computers. The process will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers, e.g. the search system 230 of FIG. 2 .
- the system receives a search request that identifies an entity ( 410 ).
- the search request can be a received search query that includes an alias for the particular entity.
- the search request can also be an explicit web page request for information about a particular entity.
- the system identifies a first entity node that represents the entity ( 420 ).
- the system obtains a first group of related entity nodes associated with the first entity node ( 430 ).
- the system obtains the group of related entity nodes and can also obtain a text string that describes the relationship between the entity node and the group of related entity nodes.
- the system generates a presentation that includes information associated with one or more entity nodes in the first group of related entity nodes ( 440 ).
- the system can generate a knowledge panel that includes information about the related group of entities, e.g. as a list of related entities as shown in FIG. 1 .

Abstract
Description
where delta(p, e1k, e2k) is 1 if the path type p exists between entities e1k and e2k and 0 otherwise. The system can alternatively compute a weighted score based on measure of the popularity of the individual entities linked by each path, given by:
where weight(p, e1k, e2k) is a measure of popularity of entities e1k and e2k. For example, the system can compute a measure of popularity for each individual entity, e.g. as measured by counts or frequency of occurrences of entity aliases for entities e1k and e2k in web documents or search queries. The system can then compute a combined weight by computing a measure of central tendency between the individual measures of popularity, e.g. an arithmetic or geometric mean.
