Specific implementation mode
The present disclosure relates generally to the systems for adjusting the reference constellation for solving dim signal at coherent optical receiver
And method.The complicated modulated optical signal of coherent light communication transmission.The symbol being present in sophisticated signal modulation technique can have
It is indicated in the Euclidean space for having lineups and quadrature axis.Each symbol can be defined as the position in Euclidean space
(that is, limited, continuous region).The layout of all possible symbol is referred to as constellation.By by digitized signal with reference
Constellation is compared to solution code sign.
Coherent light communication can provide several benefits, including improved spectrum efficiency and the tolerance to optical defect.However,
Harsh cost, size and power requirement can limit the voltage driving that can be used for generating optical signal and swing.In addition, many light tune
Device processed uses Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM).MZM has limited extinction ratio (ER), is defined as opening and closing
Modulator output power ratio between state.Exact Solutions tune can be made sensitive to MZM ER the low driving voltage of MZM.However,
If it is possible, then high ER requires to use available inexpensive integrated optic modulator challenging.Therefore, the disclosure
The system and method for being adjusted to reference constellation are proposed, low ER will be mitigated to the harmful of the bit error rate of demodulated signal
It influences.
Typically, optimization reference constellation is related to high-dimensional search problem；Such as each of constellation may one of symbol or
Multiple dimensions.System and method presented herein can use the certain observations being distorted about modulation constellation or assume to search higher-dimension
Suo Wenti is reduced to one-dimensional search or a series of independent one-dimensional problems.Then demodulation can be adjusted using search process
Parameter is to minimize or maximize the measuring signal mass measurement of demodulated signal.Dimensionality reduction is based on the assumption that：In reduction
Under modulator driving is swung, limited MZM ER make its constellation being distorted show linear constellation displacement.Therefore, search process can
For finding the best same phase deviation of reference constellation, then find best quadrature shift (vice versa).In the disclosure, make
The value of the parameter of the maximum value for causing to correspond to measurement amount, nearly maximum value or local maximum is described with " optimal " or " best ".
For example, same phase deviation or the quadrature shift of reference constellation can be adjusted according to the system of the disclosure to realize that peak value or nearly peak value are believed
Number mass measurement.It can be adjusted with limited granularity, so that only tests the certain amount in range of interest can
It can deviant.In some embodiments, best offset value can be selected as to the signal quality measured with highest (or minimum)
Measure corresponding deviant.In some embodiments, system can based on by two measure it is signal quality measured it
Between the theoretical peak that occurs it is signal quality measured come optimized migration of extrapolating.Instantiation procedure can carry out as follows.
For received signal, reference constellation can be initially set to ideal constellation；That is, in same phase and orthogonal direction
On be all zero offset.System can add same phase deviation to reference constellation, and in a certain range of value (typically, in same phase
In a +/- half range for the minimum range between symbol center on direction) on scan same phase deviation.Best same phase deviation is
By signal quality measured, --- such as signal-to-noise ratio or the bit error rate --- proves to generate the offset of optimizer system efficiency.It is finding most
After good same phase deviation, quadrature shift can be added to reference constellation.The system can scan the range of quadrature shift value
And best quadrature shift is selected in a similar way.In some embodiments, system can determine most preferably in reverse order
Orthogonal and same phase deviation.Including most preferably with phase deviation and best quadrature shift reference constellation can be used for receiver just
Often demodulated signal during operation.
In some embodiments, system can monitor modulation constellation (usually in acquisition phase) in the normal operation period.
In some embodiments, system can carry out input signal sub-sampling, and it includes that adaptive equalization and carrier wave are extensive to use
The coherent digital signal processing unit of multiple simplification changes to track modulation constellation.System can by adjusting same phase deviation and just
Offset is handed over to update reference constellation, to solve the reception signal caused by the fluctuation of transmitter modulation device or the defect of optical link
Variation.In some embodiments, modulation constellation data can be sent back to transmitter.Transmitter can adjust electric drive signal
And/or the optical signal predistortion so that at transmitter is arranged in modulator biasing, for being easier to demodulate at receiver.
In some embodiments, the optimization of demodulation reference constellation can be executed in the processor logic of separation.For example,
Demodulation can be executed in logic in high speed processor to enable to demodulate the optical signal within the scope of tens of gigabits per second.So
And reference constellation optimization need not be executed with so high speed, therefore can in logic be executed in low speed processor.At high speed
Reason device logic and low speed processor logic can reside in same digital signal processor (DSP) chip, can also exist on
In different DSP.

64QAM and other modulation schemes.Modulation constellation 300,310,400 and 410 is by being based on a Mach Zeng De (Mach-Zehnder) modulation
The quadrature quadrature modulator of device (MZM) generates under different drive conditions：The MZM extinction ratios (ER) of 30 or 20dB and 0.5
Peak value inputs volt (Vpi) or the driving of 1.0Vpi is swung.Modulation constellation 300 and 310 illustrates the simulation for the MZM that ER is 30dB
As a result.There is modulation constellation 310 driving higher than modulation constellation 300 to swing；I.e. 1.0Vpi is to 0.5Vpi.Modulation constellation 300 is opened up
