Although show discrete public content index 140 and private content index 150, in some implementations, index engine 132 can produce the single index for index private content 155 and public content 145, instead of generates discrete index 140 and 150.
Search system 130 receives the search inquiry 102 that user submits to through client device 100.In some implementations, query processing engine 134 can determine individual position's inquiry of the expectation from the search inquiry 102 of client device 100 being whether the relevant information of the previously mutual one or more physical locations of indicating user.In some implementations, determine whether search inquiry is that individual position inquires about the one or more words whether comprising instruction individual position inquiry based on search inquiry.Such as, the word of instruction individual position inquiry can comprise clear and definite word, such as " I ", " I ", " registering ", " access ", " access ", " last week ", " last month ".And such as, the word of instruction individual position inquiry can comprise the classification of word, such as past tense verb (" access ", " stop ", " eating ", " having dinner ").
In some implementations, search inquiry 102 whether be confirmed as individual position inquiry arrange based on the syntax of one or more words of search inquiry 102.Such as, the instruction being identified as individual position's inquiry can be arranged in some syntax of word.Such as, " I " that exist as the first word of search inquiry can indicate individual position to inquire about.And, such as, as after connect the entity class (such as " place ", " restaurant ", " hotel ") of one or more definition, " my " that first word of search inquiry of the noun (such as, " register ", " access ") of definition exists and/or instruction time section one or more words (such as " last month ", " last week ", " January ") instruction individual position inquire about.In some implementations, weights assigned can be arranged to some syntax alternatively.Such as, the first weighting not indicating individual position to inquire about compared with " I " that " I " (the haveing nothing to do with the layout of other words in search inquiry) existed as the first word of search inquiry can exist with the first word of the search inquiry of the entity class as the one or more definition of heel is associated.
In some implementations, whether search inquiry 102 is confirmed as individual position's inquiry based on the existence of the semantic section in one or more positions in search inquiry 102 and/or layout.It can mapping definition be one or more words of the search inquiry of the classification of the classification of instruction individual position inquiry that the semantic section in each position comprises.It is one or more that the semantic section in position can comprise in type of action section, position entities classification section, geographic area section, time period and business location alias section.
One or more actions of the user that the previous intercorrelation of user and physical location joins by type of action instruction.The action of the user that the previous intercorrelation of user and physical location joins can comprise that such as user registers at given position, user comment given position, user to the past of given position subscribe, user is to subscribing the future of given position, for the receipt of the user of given position, the position data indicating the user of the access to given position etc.The word that can be mapped to type of action section comprises such as " registering ", " registering ", " access ", " access ", " comment ", " comment ", " alternately ", " position data ", " reservation " etc.
Position entities classification is each identifier jointly with the set of the entity be associated with physical location of one or more attribute.Such as, all restaurants can belong to the position entities classification in " restaurant ", and only provide the restaurant of Pizza can belong to the position entities classification in " Pizza shop ".The word that can be mapped to position entities classification section can comprise such as " hotel ", " airport ", " park ", " barber shop ", " bookstore ", " shopping center ", " department store " etc.
Geographic area is the region be associated with one or more geographic position.The word that can be mapped to geographic area section comprise one or more another names in such as city (such as " New York ", " NYC "), rural area (such as, " ORANGE COUNTRY "), area (such as " South America ", " near "), street (such as " Wrigleyville "), state (such as " Kentucky "), country (such as " France "), postcode (such as " 90210 "), coordinate (such as lat/lon to) etc.
Time period comprises one or more words that date of determining with at least one or more and/or time correlation join.The word that can be mapped to the time period comprises such as " last week ", " this year ", " April ", " summer ", " breakfast ", " before noon ", " dinner " etc.In the search inquiry of not appointed day and/or time clearly, clear and definite date and/or time can be determined and be used as the time period.Such as, just the date range from the fortnight before current date by the 7th day can be defined as by phrase " last week ".And, such as, word " this year " can be defined as until and comprise any date of current date.And such as, " before 3 hours " can be confirmed as comprising from the current time time of about 3 hours.
Business location another name is the another name be associated with business entity, the trade (brand) name such as used by business entity.In some implementations, business entity can have multiple business location another name.Such as, cafe can have the first another name " A'sBrewedCoffee " and the second another name " ABCoffee ".The word that can be mapped to business location another name comprises such as " Starbucks ", " Hilton " etc.In some implementations, can call through the database determination business location of such as entity data bak 160.
In some implementations, the semantic section in position comprised in the search query is more, and search inquiry more may be confirmed as individual position's search inquiry.Such as, the search inquiry of the semantic section in position and geographic area that only comprise type of action comparatively can not be confirmed as individual position's search inquiry than the search inquiry comprising the semantic section in those positions and local entity class position semanteme section.In some implementations, can alternatively to some position semanteme section weights assigned.Such as, there is type of action section in the search query more can indicate individual position to inquire about than life period section.
In some implementations, can determine whether the one or more words inquired about are the semantic sections in position with reference to the database of possibility word.Such as, based on the mapping of word in the database of such as entity data bak 160 to the semantic section of ad-hoc location, one or more words of inquiry can be identified as the semantic section of ad-hoc location.In some implementations, one or more word whether be identified as the semantic section of ad-hoc location can in addition and/or as an alternative based on the form of one or more word.Such as, can will be formatted as the date in (such as year; Month; The moon and sky; Month, sky and year) any word can be confirmed as the semantic section of time location.In some implementations, one or more word whether be identified as the semantic section in position can in addition and/or alternatively based on existence and/or the position of other words in the search query.Such as, one or more word whether be identified as occurring before and after word that whether the semantic section in position can occur in queries, in queries based on word what word, how much other words be present in inquiry and/or what word immediately this word in queries occur.Can utilize in addition and/or alternative technology to determine the semantic section in position and/or to determine whether inquiry is that individual position inquires about.
In some implementations, query processing engine 134 can determine one or more search parameter based on search inquiry 102 in addition and/or alternatively.In some implementations, search parameter comprises one or more synonyms of one or more word of search inquiry 102 and/or one or more words of search inquiry.In some implementations, search parameter is based on the semantic section in position of the determination of search inquiry.In some implementations, the semantic section in position based on the determination of search inquiry, one or more items of the private content 155 of indicating user access physical location can be associated with the semantic section in one or more positions of the time of the effective query of such as type of action, position entities classification, geographic area and enable item like this.Such as, the item of private content 155 can comprise the relevant information of section semantic with one or more positions and/or indexed in private content index 150 based on the semantic section in one or more positions.
In some implementations, search parameter is explained based on the expansion of the semantic section in one or more positions determined of search inquiry.Such as, the semantic section in the position of the determination of search inquiry can be the type of action of the class as the type of action comprising multiple member.Such as, " access " can be the class of type of action of multiple members comprising such as " registering ", " reservation " and " position data instruction scope ".Such member of the class of type of action can be included as search parameter.And such as, the semantic section in position of the determination of search inquiry can be the geographic area comprising other geographic area.Such as, " New York " comprises other geographic area, such as " Manhattan ", " Queens ", " Brooklyn " etc.The geographic area comprised like this can be included as search parameter.And such as, " California " comprises other geographic area, such as " LosAngeles ", " SanFrancisco ", " Oakland " etc.The city comprised like this can be included as search parameter.And such as, the semantic section in position of the determination of search inquiry can be the geographic area representing multiple geographic area.Such as, " near " other geographic area can be represented, the current national of the current city of such as user, the current postcode of user and/or user.And such as " in 20 miles " can represent other geographic area, any geographic area such as in 20 miles of the current location of user.Other geographic area like this can be included as search parameter.In the expansion of the semantic sections in the positions determined based on search inquiry one or more explains that some determining search parameter realize, the explanation of amplification can cause identifying can not be based on such as in such item and/or there is the response item of the private content 155 identified based on word only limited in the index entry of such item.Multiple search parameter determined can be combined in the search inquiry of single separation alternatively.
In some implementations, one or more search parameter can clearly or specify the index entry of any user interactions of indicating user whether should be considered response to search inquiry based on its content, or only indicates the mutual index entry of access in the past still to indicate the mutual index entry of the access in non-past to be considered response.Such as, based on exist in the search query such as " access " one or more word and/or based on the one or more type of action sections that there is instruction actual access in the search query, search parameter can be specified and only be indicated the mutual index entry of access to be in the past considered response.And, such as, based on there is such as one or more word of " alternately " in the search query and/or accessing mutual one or more type of action sections based on there are the actual access in the past of instruction mutual and other non-past in the search query, search parameter can specify the index entry indicating any past mutual to be considered response.
Rank engine 136 uses search parameter to search for one or more index entries of private content index 150, identifies the item of the private content 155 of response search inquiry 102 to use such as conventional and/or other information retrieval techniques.In some implementations, only when query processing engine 134 determine search inquiry 102 be individual position inquire about and/or indicate another inquiry of expectation of access private content index 150, rank engine 136 can search for one or more index entries of private content index 150.In some implementations, rank engine 136 can only be searched for clear and definite or based on the index entry of its content aware private content index 150, as the index entry that the physical location previously mutual with user is relevant.
In some implementations, rank engine 136 can based on user profile 103 determine to search in one or more index entries of private content index 150 which.User profile 103 specifies the identity of the user submitting search inquiry 102 to, and can be used for determining which index entry authorized user accesses.In some implementations, user profile 103 can be provided with and/or be included in search inquiry 102.Such as, user profile 103 can be stored in and submit to together with search inquiry 102 and/or be included in the cookie in search inquiry 102.Such as, the user of client device 100 can access and comprise for submitting the website of the webpage of search inquiry 102 to and this website can use cookie to identify user.Before submission search inquiry 102, website can comprise another webpage that prompting user fills up a form with the identifying information of user.Based on identifying information, cookie can be provided to the Web browser performed on client device 100, and when user submits search inquiry 102 to, by Web browser, this cookie can be sent to search system 130.Use the information in cookie, search system 130 can be determined to submit to the user of search inquiry 102 can access which index entry of private content index 150.Such as, search system 130 can compare by the information in cookie and with the visit information that the index entry of private content index 150 is associated, and determines to comprise those index entries with the visit information of the information matches of cookie by user's access.
Rank engine 136 such as uses one or more rank signal to carry out calculated response in the score value of the item of the private content 155 of inquiry alternatively.Each signal provides the information about item itself and/or the relation between item and search inquiry.Based on the index entry of the item of the item and/or private content 155 itself of quoting private content 155, determine the signal of the item of private content 155.An exemplary signal is the tolerance of the total quality of item.Another exemplary signal is the tolerance of the number of times that the quantity of the search parameter occurred in item and/or search parameter occur in this.Signal that is other and/or alternative can also be used.Such as, the rank of user be associated can be used as signal with item, such as with the user comment being used to indicate the restaurant of user with the mutual item in restaurant and being associated.And such as, the rank of other users be associated with item also can be used as signal, and such as other users are to the comment in this restaurant.And, such as, to user's instruction and the mutual item of physical location, the date joined with the intercorrelation of user and physical location can be used as signal.Such as, up-to-dately can rank to obtain significantly higher than comparatively early mutual alternately, every other rank signal is all equal.Then, rank engine 136 uses score value to carry out the response item of rank private content 155.Such as, based on score value, rank response item.
Present engine 138 to use and to be identified by rank engine 136 and the item of rank generates response search inquiry 102 and comprises the Search Results 108 of the personal search result of the previously mutual physical location of identification user.Such as, Search Results 108 can comprise the Search Results of physical location for user's access, comprise one or more another names of this physical location, physical location position entities type, with user, date of being associated and/or time are accessed to the one or many of physical location, type of action user be associated with to the access of physical location, the geographic area of physical location, the user of physical location grade, the grading of other users of physical location, the map of physical location and/or this physical location relevant other information.Search Results 108 is sent to client device 100 with the form of the form that can be supplied to user.Such as, Search Results 108 can be transmitted as by search result web page that the browser run on a client device shows and/or through audio delivery to one or more Search Results of user.
In some implementations, present engine 138 to use and to be identified by rank engine 136 and to determine about the additional content for being included in the response item in personal search result with the item of rank.Such as, the response item of private content 155 can access restaurant A in city 1 by indicating user before 2 months.But the item of the private content 155 identified can not comprise any additional information about restaurant A.Present engine 138 and can access at least one resource except private content 155 to determine additional information.Such as, present engine 138 can identify and the entity that the restaurant A in city 1 is associated by access entity database 160.Present the bells and whistles that engine 138 can determine entity that be mapped to the entity in entity data bak 160, that be associated with restaurant A, the picture of the website of the address of such as restaurant A, the telephone number of restaurant A, restaurant A, the grading be associated with restaurant A, restaurant A, will search inquiry of the Search Results of special concern restaurant A etc. be retrieved.The additional information be associated with restaurant A like this can be included in personal search result.In some implementations, entity data bak can comprise the unique identifier be associated with one or more entity, the entity be such as associated with one or more position entities classification.Each in sole entity identifier can be mapped to the one or more characteristics be associated with entity respectively.Such as, the unique identifier for the entity be associated with the Official hotel in city can be associated with the title in " hotel 1 " or alias property, the address properties of " 123 main street " and the phone number property of " 123-1234-12345 ".Additional and/or alternative attribute can be associated with the entity in one or more databases of such as entity data bak 160.
In some implementations, rank engine 136 is also to the item of the public content 145 of public content index 140 search response search inquiry 102.For the item of public content 150 being identified as response search inquiry 102, rank engine 136 can the such Search Results of rank.Present engine 138 can use and identify by rank engine 136 the common search result generated with the item of the public content 155 of rank for being included in Search Results 108.In some implementations, common search result can be provided to show together with personal search result.In some implementations, personal search result and common search fruiting area can be separated.Such as, personal search result can be formatd and common search result is come visually personal search result and common search fruiting area to be separated.Such as, in more outstanding position, such as at the top of Search Results, personal search result can be presented.And, such as, personal search result can be identified as text (the such as personal search result of " only you can see these results ", " these are the results in the place that you access ", " these are results of you individual " etc. had with personal search result
Fig. 2 is diagram generates the illustrative methods of personal search result process flow diagram in response to the search inquiry of user.Other realizations can perform step with different orders, omit some step and/or perform and step different and/or other shown in Fig. 2.Conveniently, the aspect of Fig. 2 is described with reference to the one or more system for computer performing this process.System can comprise the engine of the search system 130 of such as Fig. 1.
In step 200, receive the search inquiry of user.Such as, inquiry " cafe that I accessed in Brussels " can be received.In some implementations, search system 130 can receive inquiry.
In step 205, determine whether search inquiry is that individual position inquires about.Individual position's inquiry is the inquiry of the expectation of the information indicated the previously mutual one or more physical locations of associated subscriber.In some implementations, determine whether search inquiry is that individual position inquires about the one or more items whether comprising instruction individual position inquiry based on search inquiry.Such as, the word that " cafe that I accessed in Brussels " comprises such as " I " and " access " of instruction individual position inquiry is inquired about.In some implementations, whether search inquiry is confirmed as the semantic section of individual position's inquiry based on one or more words of search inquiry.Such as, inquire about " cafe that I accessed in Brussels " and be included in provider location classification (" cafe ") afterwards and immediately preceding the word " I " after " access ".Such layout can indicate individual position to inquire about.In some implementations, whether search inquiry is confirmed as individual position's inquiry based on the existence of the semantic section in one or more positions in the search query and/or layout.Such as, inquire about that " cafe that I accessed in Brussels " comprises the position entities classification section " cafe " of common instruction individual position inquiry, type of action section " was accessed " and geographic area section " Brussels ".In some implementations, query processing engine 134 can determine whether search inquiry is confirmed as individual position's inquiry.In some implementations, one or more steps of the illustrative methods of Fig. 2 can depend on and determine whether search inquiry is that individual position inquires about.Such as, in some implementations, if determine that this inquiry is that individual position inquires about, what can only perform in step 225,230 and/or 235 is one or more.During other realize at some, step 205 can be omitted.
In step 210, based on search inquiry, determine at least one search parameter.In some implementations, search parameter comprises one or more words of search inquiry.Such as, for search inquiry " cafe that I accessed in Brussels ", word " cafe " and " Brussels " can be used as search terms.In some implementations, search parameter based on as described in (in the illustrative methods such as at Fig. 3) inquiry basis on the semantic section in the position determined.In some implementations, query processing engine 134 can determine at least one search parameter.
In step 215, receive the user profile of user.In some implementations, user profile can be provided with the search inquiry received in step 200.Such as, user profile can be affixed to search inquiry and/or provide search inquiry, but is separated with search inquiry (cookie such as, through transmitting together with search inquiry).User profile is specified and is submitted the identity of the user of search inquiry to and can be used for determining which index entry authorized user accesses.In some implementations, search system 130 can receive user profile.
In step 220, based on the user profile received in step 215, the private content of calling party.Such as, user profile can be utilized determine and submit to the user of search inquiry can access which index entry in private content index 150.Such as, those index entries in the private content index 150 be associated with the visit information being confirmed as mating with user profile can only be accessed.And, such as, can user profile be utilized determine in addition and/or as an alternative submit to search inquiry user can directly and/or through private content index 150 access private content 155 which.In some implementations, rank engine 136 can visit the private content of user based on the user profile received in step 215.
