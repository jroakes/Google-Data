Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to determining and/or adjusting online advertisement statistics.
- Online content can include web pages and advertisements displayed with the web pages.
- An online advertisement service can provide online advertisements on behalf of advertisers and measure statistics about the advertisements. For example, the online advertisement service might measure and record statistics about how often an advertisement displayed on web pages is clicked by a user viewing the web pages.
- the presence of real-world conditions may affect the way in which the user interacts with advertisements, and so the statistics may vary in accuracy depending on the presence of such conditions.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that includes receiving a prediction value for a click-through rate for an online advertisement, the prediction value indicating a probability that the online advertisement will be accessed when displayed in an online medium, the prediction value based on a ratio of a number of times the advertisement has been accessed by users to a number of times the advertisement has been displayed to users, identifying at least one condition that is present when the online advertisement is to be displayed, the condition affecting accuracy of the prediction value, and generating a corrected prediction value based on at least one stored shift value associated with the at least one condition.
- the corrected prediction value differs from the prediction value by a quantity independent of the prediction value.
- the corrected prediction value differs from the prediction value by a quantity that depends upon a quantity of the prediction value.
- the online advertisement includes a hyperlink, and the probability that the online advertisement will be accessed includes a probability that the hyperlink will be clicked, and the number of times the advertisement has been accessed by users includes the number of times the advertisement has been clicked by users.
- Generating the corrected prediction value includes adjusting the prediction value based on a value f1 used to uniformly adjust the prediction value associated with the online advertisement independent of a quantity associated with the prediction value, and a value f2 used to adjust the prediction value based on a particular quantity associated with the prediction value.
- the at least one condition includes at least one of a physical location at which the online advertisement is displayed, a location within a web page at which the online advertisement is displayed, a time of day at which the online advertisement is displayed, a characteristic of text of the online advertisement, a characteristic of search results associated with the particular advertisement, and relevance of the advertisement to a keyword used in a search query.
- the aspect also includes using the corrected prediction value to select an advertisement to display to a user.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that includes receiving a set of a prediction values each corresponding to an online advertisement and based on a measured click-through rate when the corresponding online advertisement was displayed in an online medium, identifying at least one condition present when the online advertisements were displayed, receiving a first set of data values each indicating a number of times the advertisements have been accessed by users when the at least one condition occurs, receiving a second set of data values each indicating a number of times the advertisements have been displayed to users when the at least one condition occurs, and based on the prediction values, the first set of data values, and the second set of data values, calculating at least one shift value for adjusting prediction values when the condition is present.
- the stored shift value is calculated based on data including a ratio of a first click-through rate occurring when the at least one condition is present and a second click-through rate occurring when the at least one condition is not present, the data collected during prior occurrences of the at least one condition.
- the stored shift value is calculated based on a regression analysis of data collected during prior occurrences of the at least one condition.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary online environment.
- FIG. 2 is an example of a web browser displaying online content, including advertisements.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary table of advertisements.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary chart of prediction values and the ratio between the prediction values and actual measured click-through rates.
- FIG. 5A is a flowchart of an exemplary process for adjusting prediction values based on bias and skew.
- FIG. 5B is a flowchart of an exemplary process for calculating shift values for adjusting prediction values based on bias and skew.
- FIG. 6 is block diagram of an exemplary computer system that can be used to facilitate the display of advertisements.
- the prediction can be made more accurate by accounting for particular conditions that tend to alter the actual likelihood that the online advertisement will be clicked on.
- the conditions can be identified and statistics about the conditions can be measured and recorded to identify how the conditions affect the rate at which an advertisement is clicked. These conditions may include factors such as the country in which the online advertisement is displayed, the location within a Web page at which the online advertisement is displayed, the time of day at which the online advertisement is displayed, a characteristic of the text of the online advertisement, a characteristic of search results associated with the particular advertisement such as the rank or relevance of the search result, the relevance of the advertisement to a keyword used in a search query, or any other factor for which statistics can be compiled. If the prediction is not adjusted, the conditions are prone to bias or skew the prediction relative to actual results (e.g., the actual click-through rate).
- the online advertisement when the condition is present the online advertisement is less likely or more likely to be clicked on than if the condition were not present, causing the prediction to have an optimistic or pessimistic bias, respectively, relative to the actual results.
- the online advertisement when a condition is present the online advertisement may be both less likely and more likely to be clicked on depending on the actual value of the prediction (for example, a 10% likelihood of being clicked on versus an 80% likelihood of being clicked on), skewing the prediction relative to the actual results.
- bias causes a prediction value to be either more optimistic or more pessimistic based on the presence of a condition
- skew causes a variation in bias among prediction values for the same condition.
- the effect of bias is independent of the prediction value, and the effect of skew depends upon the prediction value.
- the rate at which an advertisement is clicked can be predicted with more accuracy by accounting for bias and skew.
- the corrected prediction value can be used to more accurately select an advertisement to display to the user that is likely to be clicked on by the user.
- the corrected prediction value can also be used to improve the advertisement or set pricing for the advertisement.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary online environment 100 .
- the online environment 100 facilitates the serving of content items for display on user devices 102 .
- content items can include web pages 104 and advertisements 106 (e.g., advertisements related to the web pages 104 ).
- web pages 104 can be provided by a web server 116 for display on a user device 102
- advertisements 106 can be provided by an advertisement server 110 for display on the user device 102 for viewing by a user 101 .
- Web pages 104 and advertisements 106 can be provided to user devices 102 through the network 108 .
- the network 108 can be a wide area network, local area network, the Internet, or any other public or private network, or combination of both.
- User devices 102 can connect to the web server 116 (or the advertisement server 110 ) through the network 108 using any device capable of communicating in a computer network environment and displaying retrieved information.
- Exemplary user devices 102 include a web-enabled handheld device, a mobile telephone or smartphone, tablet device, a set top box, a game console, a personal digital assistant, a navigation device, or a computer.
- the advertisements 106 can be displayed with the web page 104 on a web browser 118 of a user device 102 .
- the advertisements 106 can also be requested as part of the delivery of a web page 104 in response to a user device 102 requesting the web page 104 from a web server 116 .
- the advertisements 106 are provided directly to the web server 116 by the advertisement server 110 , and the web server 116 then provides the advertisements 106 to the user devices 102 in association with one or more particular web pages 104 , e.g. web pages which are related to the advertisements 106 .
- the web server 116 queries the advertisement server 110 for advertisements 106 related to one or more particular web pages 104 , and the advertisement server 110 evaluates a pool 109 of advertisements and chooses one or more advertisements 106 that are likely to be clicked on if displayed with the web page 104 .
- the advertisement server 110 may have access to statistics 112 maintained by the advertisement service 114 and describing the rate at which advertisements 106 within the pool 109 are clicked by users 101 and use the statistics 112 to estimate or predict the likelihood that an advertisement 106 will be clicked if it is displayed with the web page 104 .
- the statistics may include prediction values 113 which may be each associated with an advertisement 106 in the pool 109 or associated with a category of advertisements in the pool 109 , for example.
- the prediction values 113 indicate a probability that an advertisement 106 will be acted upon by a user (e.g., clicked).
- the advertisement service 114 can receive data 111 describing the rate at which advertisements 106 are clicked by users (e.g., users like user 101 ).
- the data 111 can be data describing particular instances in which users clicked one or more advertisements 106 and can also describe conditions present when the advertisement or advertisements were clicked.
- the data 111 can be provided by the web server 116 , the advertisement server 110 , another component of the online environment 100 , or some combination of these things.
- the data 111 can be used to compile the statistics 112 (e.g., used to generate prediction values 113 ) and the data 111 can also be used enhance the accuracy and precision of the statistics as more data 111 is collected.
- the prediction values 113 each indicate a probability that an advertisement 106 will be clicked on by a user.
- a prediction value 113 associated with an advertisement 106 may indicate that the advertisement 106 has a 50% chance of being clicked on if the advertisement 106 is displayed to a user 101 .
- a prediction value 113 indicating a probability that an advertisement 106 will be clicked on by a user can be useful if the probability is accurate in predicting an actual click-through rate (e.g., if the prediction value 113 is close to an actual click-through rate).
- the probability that an advertisement 106 will be clicked can be the actual rate at which the advertisement 106 has been clicked in the past based on the statistics 112 . If an advertisement 106 is clicked 50% of the time, the probability that the advertisement 106 will be clicked can be recorded in the statistics 112 as a prediction value 113 of 50%.
- the prediction value can be based on a measured click-through rate when the corresponding online advertisement was displayed to a user.
- a prediction value 113 can be used to choose an advertisement 106 that is likely to be clicked on when displayed, or the prediction value 113 can be used to determine how well an advertisement is performing (for example, to determine which advertisements should be modified to improve the rate at which the advertisement is clicked).
- the accuracy of the prediction value 113 e.g., how close the prediction value 113 is to an actual click-through rate
- the accuracy of the prediction value 113 may vary if certain conditions are present in the online environment 100 that can affect the data (e.g., data 111 ) used to calculate prediction value 113 .
- a click-through may be said to occur when a user selects a presented ad by clicking on the ad, embedded hypertext links, executable code, and/or any type of user selection related to the presented ad, where the click or another type of selection typically directs the user to the advertiser's web site or the advertiser's online or real world presence.
- the advertisement service 114 may analyze the data 111 to determine a click-through rate for the advertisements within the advertisement pool 109 (e.g., a group of advertisements associated with a single advertiser). In some examples, the advertisement service 114 can determine the click-through rate of a particular advertisement 106 by dividing the total number of clicks associated with that advertisement 106 by the total number of impressions associated with that advertisement 106 . Thus, the click-through rate for an advertisement is a ratio of clicks to impressions for that advertisement. The advertisement service 114 can use the click-through rate to make decisions such as which advertisements to show most frequently and calculate a prediction value 113 that is a predicted click-through rate for future advertisements being displayed to users.
- a prediction value 113 that is a predicted click-through rate for future advertisements being displayed to users.
- FIG. 2 is an example of a web browser 200 displaying online content, including advertisements.
- the web browser 200 can be an example of the web browser 118 shown in FIG. 1 as a component of the online environment 100 .
- the way in which the web browser 200 displays information and other conditions related to the use of the web browser 200 or the advertisement itself can affect the accuracy of a prediction value 113 .
- the conditions may be conditions associated with the web browser 200 , conditions associated with the online environment of the web browser 200 , conditions associated with a user of the web browser 200 , or other conditions that affect the likelihood that an advertisement will be clicked.
- the web browser 200 includes a browsing portion 202 for displaying requested content (e.g., a web page 104 or search results presented in response to a user-entered query) and an advertisement portion 204 , e.g., for displaying advertisements 106 a - 106 h related to the web page or search request.
- the web page 104 is a presentation of search results 206 representing references (e.g., hyperlinks to uniform resource locators) to other web pages selected by a search engine (not shown) to be related to a search query 208 (“Search Query”) previously entered by a user of the web browser 200 .
- the advertisements 106 a - 106 h may have been identified (e.g., by an advertisement server 110 as shown in FIG. 1 ) in response to the particular content displayed within the web page 104 .
- the advertisements 106 a - 106 h may be related to the search results 206 .
- advertisements can appear in multiple locations within the web browser 200 .
- other advertisements 106 i can be displayed in the browsing portion 202 in an upper area of the web browser 200 .
- advertisements are displayed in a lower area of the web browser 200 or on the left-hand side of the web browser 200 .
- advertisements are displayed in-line with text displayed in the web browser 200 .
- the likelihood that any of the advertisements 106 a - 106 i will be clicked on by a user of the web browser 200 may be recorded in prediction values (e.g., prediction values 113 as shown in FIG. 1 ). Also, a user's interaction with these advertisements 106 a - 106 i may be used as data (e.g., data 111 as shown in FIG. 1 ) to calculate prediction values or improve the accuracy of the prediction values. However, the probability that any of these advertisements 106 a - 106 i will be clicked may be affected by conditions associated with the web browser 200 , conditions associated with the online environment of the web browser 200 , conditions associated with a user of the web browser 200 , or other conditions that affect the likelihood that an advertisement will be clicked.
- prediction values e.g., prediction values 113 as shown in FIG. 1
- data e.g., data 111 as shown in FIG. 1
- the probability that any of these advertisements 106 a - 106 i will be clicked may be affected by conditions associated with the web
- one such condition could be the country in which the advertisement is displayed. Users in some countries may be more likely to click on certain online advertisements, while users in other countries may be less likely to click on the same online advertisements.
- Another such condition could be the location within a Web page at which the advertisement is displayed. For example, if an advertisement 106 a is displayed in the advertisement portion 204 of the web browser 200 , then the advertisement may be less likely to be clicked on than an advertisement 106 i displayed in the browsing portion 202 of the web browser 200 .
- Another such condition could be the time of day at which the online advertisement is displayed. For example, an advertisement may be less likely to clicked on in the morning, and more likely to be clicked on in the evening.
- Another such condition could be a characteristic of the text of the online advertisement. For example, an advertisement containing proper nouns may be more likely to be clicked on than an advertisement containing no proper nouns. In another example, an advertisement containing at least one French word may be more likely to be clicked on than an advertisement containing no French words.
- Another such condition could be a characteristic of search results associated with the particular advertisement. For example, if the search results 206 returned by the search query 208 are highly relevant to the search query 208 , the advertisements 106 a - 106 i may be more likely to be clicked on by a user than if the search results 206 returned by the search query 208 are less relevant to the search query 208 . This may occur, for example, if highly relevant search results are of greater interest to a user than less relevant search results, and advertisements associated with the highly relevant search results are also of greater interest to the user due to their relationship with the highly relevant search results.
- Another such condition could be whether keywords used in a search query 208 are an exact match to search results 206 returned by the search query 208 .
- the search results 206 returned are relevant to the search query 208 , but the search results 206 do not contain all of the exact keywords used in the search query 208 .
- Advertisements 106 a - 106 i may be less likely to be clicked on by a user if the search results 206 do not contain all of the exact keywords used in the search query 208 , and the degree to which they are likely to be clicked on may exhibit bias or skew.
- search results 206 are displayed over multiple pages, e.g., multiple web pages 104 .
- Advertisements 106 a - 106 i may be more likely to be clicked on by a user if the user is viewing the first page of search results 206 , and less likely to be clicked on by the user if the user is viewing a later page of search results 206 .
- the degree to which they are likely to be clicked on may exhibit bias or skew.
- Another such condition could be a characteristic of a particular user viewing an advertisement.
- information may be known about a user, such as information entered by the user into an online profile of the user. Different characteristics about the user may tend to bias or skew a prediction of whether the user will click on advertisements 106 a - 106 i.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary table 300 of advertisements.
- the table 300 could represent data stored by an advertisement service such as statistics 112 stored by the advertisement service 114 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the table 300 lists the advertisements 302 , prediction values 304 that indicate a probability that an advertisement will be accessed by a user (e.g., clicked), actual click-through rates 306 that indicate what percentage of advertisements displayed to users were accessed by users, and conditions 308 present when the actual click-through rates 306 were determined or measured.
- the actual click-through rates 306 could be determined by analyzing data 111 received by an advertisement service 114 and stored in advertisement statistics 112 , as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the table 300 includes information relating to three advertisements 320 a - 320 c .
- the particular condition 308 identified is the country where a user was viewing the advertisements 302 when the actual click-through rates 306 were determined or measured.
- the actual click-through rates 360 a - 360 c associated with the advertisements 320 a - 320 c are ten percent lower than the prediction values 340 a - 340 c associated with the same respective advertisements 320 a - 320 c .
- the condition 308 is “US” 380 a then the actual click-through rates 360 a - 360 c have a bias of 10% lower than the prediction values 340 a - 340 c .
- individuals in the United States may be less likely to click on advertisements than individuals in other parts of the world.
- the prediction values 340 a - 340 c can be shifted down by 10% to better predict the actual click-through rate of an advertisement displayed in the United States.
- an advertisement service 114 FIG. 1
- the shift value 310 can then be used with prediction values used to predict click-through rates in the United States.
- the actual click-through rates 360 d - 360 e associated with the advertisements 320 a - 320 b are higher than the prediction values 340 d - 340 e associated with the same respective advertisements 320 a - 320 b .
- the actual click-through rates 360 d - 360 e are not higher by a particular quantity. Instead, the actual click-through rates 360 d - 360 e are dependent on the value of the respective associated prediction values 340 d - 340 e . For example, when the prediction value 340 d is 50% then the actual click-through rate 360 d is 10% higher than the prediction value. When the prediction value 340 e is 40% then the actual click-through rate 360 d is 30% higher than the prediction value.
- the prediction values 340 d - 340 e can be shifted up to better predict the actual click-through rate of an advertisement displayed in the United Kingdom.
- an advertisement service 114 FIG. 1
- the shift value may take the form of an equation containing a variable representing the prediction value to adjust, and containing a coefficient, for example, a coefficient determined by regression analysis. The shift value can then be used with prediction values used to predict click-through rates in the United Kingdom.
- the actual click-through rates 360 d - 360 e have a skew, which is a bias that depends on the value of the respective prediction values 340 d - 340 e .
- the prediction values 340 a - 340 c can be shifted to better predict the actual click-through rate of an advertisement displayed in the United Kingdom.
- a prediction value 304 can be shifted to account for both bias and skew (equation 1).
- Equation 1 uses two shift values, f1 which shifts the prediction value by a quantity independent of the prediction value, and f2 which shifts the prediction value by a quantity that depends upon a quantity of the prediction value.
- the values of f1 and f2 can be calculated by performing regression analysis on a graph of the prediction values as compared to actual click-through rates. For example, a regression analysis such as a Poisson regression could be used.
- X _corrected X*e f1 *X f2 Equation 1
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary chart 400 of prediction values 402 and the ratio 404 between the prediction values and actual measured click-through rates.
- the chart 400 shows information about multiple advertisements. Each data point represents an advertisement, and the location of each point depends on a prediction value associated with one of the advertisements.
- the ratio 404 indicates the accuracy of a prediction value for an advertisement relative to a corresponding actual measured click-through rate for the advertisement.
- a ratio 404 of 1.0 indicates that the prediction value is exactly the same as the corresponding actual measured click-through rate, and so the prediction value can be considered to be accurate in predicting the actual measured click-through rate.
- a ratio 404 of less than 1.0 indicates that the prediction value predicts a click-through rate lower than the actual measured click-through rate, and so the prediction value can be considered to be pessimistic.
- a ratio 404 of greater than 1.0 indicates that the prediction value predicts a click-through rate higher than the actual measured click-through rate, and so the prediction value can be considered to be optimistic.
- One set of data points 406 shows that the prediction values have a ratio 404 to actual measured click-through rates of higher than 1.0, indicating that the actual measured click-through rates are lower than the corresponding prediction values.
- the set of data points 406 is characterized by a higher ratio of prediction values to actual measured click-through rates when the prediction values are low.
- a regression analysis can generate a fitted curve 408 which defines this correlation in a way that can be represented by a set of shift values.
- the fitted curve 408 could be defined by values determined by regression analysis, for example, values such as f1 and f2 as shown above in equation 1.
- the set of data points 406 will be determined at least partially by values of X in equation 1, where X represents a prediction value.
- the fitted curve can be used to determine values of f1 and f2.
- a new set of corrected data points 410 can be generated by applying equation 1 to values of X and generating values of X_corrected.
- the corrected set of data points 410 is therefore based on values of X_corrected.
- the corrected set of data points 410 exhibits a ratio of prediction values to actual measured click-through rates of about 1.0. The ratio varies between 0.99 and 1.01, indicating that the prediction values of the corrected set of data points 410 are optimistic or pessimistic by about 1% compared to actual measured click-through rates.
- the prediction values of the set of data points 406 were optimistic by as much as 13%. This indicates that the corrected prediction values corresponding to the values of X_corrected are very close to actual measured click-through rates.
- the corrected set of data points 410 has been corrected for bias and skew present in the original set of data points 406 .
- FIG. 5A is a flowchart of an exemplary process 500 for adjusting prediction values based on bias and skew.
- the process 500 can be used, for example, by the advertisement service 114 of FIG. 1 to correct or modify prediction values 113 associated with advertisement statistics 112 .
- the advertisement service receives a prediction value for a click-through rate.
- the prediction value can indicate a probability that an online advertisement will be accessed when displayed to users.
- the prediction value can be based on a ratio of a number of times the advertisement has been accessed by users to a number of times the advertisement has been displayed to users.
- the advertisement service identifies at least one condition that is present when the online advertisement is to be displayed in an online medium.
- the condition could be a condition affecting an actual click-through rate relative to the prediction value.
- Some examples of such a condition are a physical location that the online advertisement is displayed in, a location within a web page that the online advertisement is displayed at, a time of day at which the online advertisement is displayed, a characteristic of the text of the online advertisement, a characteristic of search results associated with the particular advertisement, and relevance of the advertisement to a keyword used in a search query.
- the advertisement service generates a corrected prediction value based on at least one stored shift value (a value for correcting the accuracy of a prediction value relative to an actual click-through rate) associated with the at least one condition.
- the advertisement service can calculate a corrected prediction value by applying an equation that takes into account at least one of bias and skew caused by the condition and uses the shift value (or values) in calculating the corrected prediction value.
- FIG. 5B is a flowchart of an exemplary process 510 for calculating shift values for adjusting prediction values based on bias and skew.
- the process 510 can be used, for example, by the advertisement service 114 of FIG. 1 to calculate values such as f1 and f2 (equation 1) based on data 111 received from a network 108 .
- the advertisement service receives a set of a prediction values each for predicting a click-through rate.
- the prediction values can indicate a probability that an online advertisement will be accessed when displayed to users.
- the prediction values can be based on a measured click-through rate when the corresponding online advertisement was displayed in an online medium.
- the advertisement service identifies at least one condition present when the online advertisements were displayed.
- the condition could be a condition affecting an actual click-through rate relative to the prediction value.
- Some examples of such a condition are a physical location at which the online advertisement is displayed, a location within a web page at which that the online advertisement is displayed, a time of day at which the online advertisement is displayed, a characteristic of the text of the online advertisement, a characteristic of search results associated with the particular advertisement, and relevance of the advertisement to a keyword used in a search query.
- the advertisement service receives a first set of data values each indicating a number of times the advertisements have been accessed (e.g., clicked on) by users when the condition or conditions occur.
- the data values may be collected by an advertisement server 110 ( FIG. 1 ) based on the way users 101 interact with a web browser 118 .
- the advertisement service receives a second set of data values each indicating a number of times the advertisements have been displayed to users when the condition or conditions occur.
- the data values may be collected by an advertisement server 110 ( FIG. 1 ) based on the way the advertisement server 110 has provided advertisements 106 to a web browser 118 for viewing by a user 101 .
- the advertisement service calculates at least one shift value for adjusting prediction values when the condition is present.
- the shift value can be calculated based on the prediction values, the first set of data values, and the second set of data values.
- the ratio of the sets of data values e.g., a ratio of clicks to impressions for advertisements
- the prediction values may exhibit bias and skew when this condition is present.
- the advertisement service can perform a regression analysis to generate one or more shift values that can be applied to an equation for calculating corrected prediction values based on the uncorrected prediction values.
- the shift value or values can be used to correct bias and skew in any other prediction values at a later time, for example, using the process 500 shown in FIG. 5A .
- FIG. 6 is block diagram of an exemplary computer system 600 that can be used to facilitate the correction of bias and skew.

- the processor 610 is capable of processing instructions for execution within the system 600 .
- the processor 610 is a single-threaded processor.
- the processor 610 is a multi-threaded processor.
- the processor 610 is capable of processing instructions stored in the memory 620 or on the storage device 630 .
- the memory 620 stores information within the system 600 .
- the memory 620 is a computer-readable medium.
