- the camera in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to a Night mode, the camera generates by the controller a second voltage that is distinct from the first voltage (in some implementations, the camera disables the first voltage, i.e., setting the second voltage to 0V), and applies the second voltage on the electrochromic glass layer of the electrochromic glass layer to disable electrochromic filtering.
- the electrochromic glass layer passes by the a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths and a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light incident on the camera, thereby exposing the sensor array exposed to the ambient light via the lens assembly without interference by electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer.
- use of the electrochromic glass layer may introduce additional benefits, e.g., enabling a high dynamic range (HDR) mode.

- the camera 118 when operating in Day mode, uses the ambient lighting sources to illuminate the scene and capture surveillance video.
- the minimum lux level at which the camera captures 118 video in Day mode is between 0.1 to 1 lux depending on the color temperature of the dominant illuminant. Once the minimum lux level is reached, the camera automatically switches to Night mode. Switching to Night mode includes disabling electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer 332 and enabling a set of IR LEDs 336 to provide illumination for the scene. Night mode is maintained until the camera 118 detects an external illuminant.
- FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a front portion of a camera 118 based on electrochromic filtering in accordance with some implementations.
- the camera 118 includes a controller 333 , memory storing instructions for execution by the controller (e.g., mode control module 320 b ), a sensor array 334 including a plurality of sensor elements, an aperture 453 and a lens assembly 330 that is configured to focus light on the sensor array.
- Lens(es) and filter(s) of the lens assembly 330 are disposed on an optical path, and aligned with respect to an optical axis. Incident light travels along the optical path to pass the lens assembly 330 and the aperture 453 and reach the image sensor array 334 .
- the lens assembly 330 includes an electrochromic glass layer 332 disposed on the optical path of the incident light and at a location in front of the sensor array 334 .
- the electrochromic glass layer 332 has optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the electrochromic glass layer 332 .
- the lens assembly 330 include a first transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer 332 A is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths, and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths.
- the camera 118 operates in two modes, a Day mode in which there is enough ambient light to capture color video of a scene, and a Night mode in which the camera captures video of a scene using onboard LED illumination when there is not enough ambient light.
- IR filtering is enabled to block a substantial portion of the IR components of the incident light.
- the controller 333 when the camera 118 determines to transition the camera mode to a Day mode, the controller 333 generates a first voltage. The first voltage is applied to the electrochromic glass layer 332 to cause the lens assembly 330 to enter the first transmission state. Prior to this transition of the camera mode to the Day mode, the camera operates in a Night mode, and the lens assembly 330 was in the second transmission state.
- the electrochromic glass layer 332 removes a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, and simultaneously passes by the electrochromic glass layer 332 a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array 334 to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light via the lens assembly 330 .
- the magnitude of the first voltage is not greater than 5V, and induces a limited amount of current consumption.
- the first voltage is sustained on the electrochromic glass layer at the first transmission state.
- the first voltage is applied on the electrochromic glass layer for a predetermined duration of time and is removed after the predetermined duration of time.
- IR filtering is disabled so a sensor array 334 of the cameras can receive incident IR light from a scene illuminated by the camera's onboard IR illuminators or external IR illuminators.
- the controller 333 when the camera 118 determines to transition the camera mode to the Night mode, the controller 333 generates a second voltage that is distinct from the first voltage. The second voltage is applied on the electrochromic glass layer 332 to cause the lens assembly 330 to enter the second transmission state.
- the electrochromic glass layer 332 In response to the second voltage, the electrochromic glass layer 332 passes a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths and a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, thereby exposing the sensor array exposed to the ambient light via the lens assembly without interference by electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer.
- the second voltage is substantially equal to zero, i.e., the first voltage is removed or disabled from the electrochromic glass layer 332 .
- the onboard IR illuminators 336 include one or more infrared light emitting diodes (e.g., as described in the cross-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/723,276, filed on May 27, 2015, entitled, “Multi-mode LED Illumination System.”).
- the infrared light emitting diodes are powered on to illuminate a field of view while electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer 332 is disabled.
- the lens assembly 330 includes one or more optical lenses 452 in addition to the electrochromic glass layer 332 , and the one or more optical lenses 452 are configured to focus incident light of the camera 118 onto the sensor array 334 .

- the electrochromic glass layer 332 therefore includes the first optical lens 452 A, which is also configured to filter the substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in the ambient light when the camera 118 determines to transition its camera mode to the Day mode.
- the camera 118 includes a mode control module 320 b that decides when to switch from Night mode to Day mode using one or more of: illuminant detection (detecting the type of ambient light based on R/G and B/G component ratios of the ambient light), lux detection (detecting the ambient light level), and tiling (performing illuminant detection and/or lux detection for sub-regions of an image sensor array so as to detect localized/point light source that only impact a portion of the image sensor array).

- the mode control module 320 b determines whether the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source, detects an ambient light level, and initiates a change of the camera mode to the Day mode when it is determined that the ambient light that is not filtered by the electrochromic glass layer 332 is due to other than an IR light source and that the ambient light level exceeds a first lux threshold.
- the mode control module 320 b maintains the camera 118 in the Night mode if it is determined that the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source and that the ambient light threshold does not exceed the first lux threshold.
- the sensor elements of the sensor array 334 include first, second and third pixels each of which has respective peak responses at different respective visible light frequencies (e.g., for green, red and blue colors, respectively).
- the mode control module 320 b detects a first light component, a second light component and a third light component of the ambient light by averaging output signals from the first, second and third pixels, respectively. Respective values of the first, second and third light components are further used to determine whether the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source. Additionally, in some implementations, the mode control module 320 b is also configured to determine whether the ambient light is due to sunlight or an incandescent light source based on values of the first, second and third light components.
- the camera 118 After it is determined that the ambient light is due to sunlight or an incandescent light source, the camera 118 initiates a change of the camera mode to the Day mode only when the ambient light level exceeds a second lux threshold higher than the first lux threshold. More details on detection and switching of Day mode and Night mode are described in the cross-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/738,225, filed on Jun. 12, 2015, entitled, “Day and Night Detection Based on One or More of Illuminant Detection, Lux Level Detection, and Tilting.”

Abstract
Description
- This application is related to the following applications, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/723,276, filed on May 27, 2015, entitled, “Multi-mode LED Illumination System,” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/738,225, filed on Jun. 12, 2015, entitled, “Day and Night Detection Based on One or More of Illuminant Detection, Lux Level Detection, and Tilting.”
- The disclosed implementations relate generally to controlling a camera with Day and Night modes, including, but not limited to, integrating electrochromic filtering into optical apparatus of the camera and automatically removing/passing infrared light component in ambient light incident on the camera.
- Some security cameras operate in one of two modes (i.e., Day mode and Night mode) depending on the ambient lighting conditions. Day mode is used when there is sufficient ambient light to adequately illuminate the scene. Night mode (also called infrared mode) is used when there is not enough ambient light to adequately illuminate the scene, in which case the camera relies on additional infrared illumination (e.g., using onboard infrared light emitting diodes). A security camera configured to operate in both Day mode and Night mode often includes an infrared (IR) filter that is disposed at two distinct locations associated with Day and Night modes, respectively. Specifically, in Day mode, the IR filter is disposed with a first position in which it is interposed between a lens assembly and a sensor array of the camera, while in Night mode, the IR filter is disposed with a second position in which it is not interposed between the lens assembly and the sensor array. As part of initiating a change of the camera mode to Night mode, the IR filter has to be mechanically moved from the first position to the second position, and as part of initiating a change of the camera mode to Day mode, the IR filter has to be mechanically moved from the second position to the first position.
- One challenge for such security cameras is mechanical failure of the IR filter due to constant switching of the security cameras between Day mode and Night mode. These security cameras often have to operate constantly over days, months and even years (e.g., switch between the day and Night modes at least twice every day), and a mechanical motor that drives the IR filter could fail in the long term due to such constant operation. Thus, it would be beneficial to use a more reliable filtering mechanism in a security camera than the current mechanically driven IR filter.
- Accordingly, there is a need for a security camera that implements more effective methods for controlling IR filtering when the camera switches between a Night mode to a Day mode.
- In accordance with one aspect of the application, a method for controlling a camera system is performed at a camera including a controller, a sensor array including a plurality of sensor elements, and a lens assembly that is configured to focus light on the sensor array. The lens assembly includes an electrochromic glass layer disposed in front of the sensor array and having optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the electrochromic glass layer. The lens assembly further includes a first transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths, and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths.
- The method for controlling the camera mode includes, in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to a Day mode, generating by the controller a first voltage, and applying the first voltage to the electrochromic glass layer to cause the lens assembly to enter the first transmission state. Prior to the transition of the camera mode to the Day mode, the lens assembly was in the second transmission state. The method for controlling the camera mode further includes in response to the first voltage, removing by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, and simultaneously passing by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light via the lens assembly.
- In accordance with another aspect of the application, some implementations include a camera for controlling a camera system. The camera further includes: a controller, a sensor array comprising a plurality of sensor elements, and a lens assembly that is configured to focus light on the sensor array. The lens assembly includes an electrochromic glass layer disposed in front of the sensor array and having optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the electrochromic glass layer. The camera is configured to perform any of the methods described herein (e.g., any of the methods described above).

The method for controlling the sensor mode includes in accordance with a determination to transition the sensor mode to a Day mode, generating a first voltage, and applying the first voltage to cause the electrochemical glass layer to enter the first transmission state. Prior to the transition of the sensor mode to the Day mode, the lens assembly was in the second transmission state. The method for controlling the sensor mode further includes in response to the first voltage, removing by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the image sensor device and simultaneously passing by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the image sensor array to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light.
- In accordance with another aspect of the application, some implementations include an image sensor array for controlling a sensor mode. The image sensor array includes an electrochromic glass layer and an image sensor array having a plurality of sensor elements. The electrochromic glass layer is disposed in front of the sensor array and has optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the glass. The electrochromic glass layer include a first transmission state in which transmission of a predefined band of IR wavelengths is substantially reduced and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths. The image sensor array is configured to perform the method described above.
- Thus, a camera and an image sensor device are provided to implement more effective methods for controlling IR filtering when the camera and the image sensor device switch between Night mode to Day mode. Such methods may complement or replace conventional methods for controlling IR filtering associated with various operation modes.
- Further, in accordance with another aspect of the application, a method is implemented at a camera for controlling a lens assembly. The camera includes a controller, an image sensor array including a plurality of sensor elements, and the lens assembly configured to focus light on the sensor array, and the lens assembly further includes an electrochromic glass lens disposed in front of the sensor array and having an index of refraction that is variable and responsive to voltage applied on the electrochromic glass lens. The method for controlling the lens assembly includes determining that the camera mode of the camera is a first mode, and in the first mode, the index of refraction of the electrochromic glass lens has a first index value associated with a first focal length. The method for controlling the lens assembly further includes in accordance with a determination that the camera mode at the first mode, generating by the controller a first voltage and applying the first voltage on the electrochromic glass lens, thereby changing the index of refraction of the electrochromic glass lens to a second index value associated with a second focal length that is distinct from the first focal length.
- In accordance with another aspect of the application, a method is implemented at a camera for controlling a filtering effect. The camera includes a controller, a sensor array comprising a plurality of sensor elements, and a lens assembly configured to focus light on the sensor array. The lens assembly includes an electrochromic glass layer disposed in front of the sensor array and having optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the electrochromic glass layer. The lens assembly includes a first filtering mode in which the electrochromic glass layer is configured to band-transmit a first predefined band of wavelengths. The method for controlling the filtering effect of the camera includes, in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to an operation mode, determining a magnitude of a first voltage and generating by the controller the first voltage. In the operation mode, the camera is configured to capture media content in a field of view illuminated with light having the first predefined band of wavelengths. The method for controlling the filtering effect of the camera further includes applying the first voltage to cause the lens assembly to enter the first filtering mode, and in response to the first voltage, passing by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of the first predefined band of wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array to the substantial portion of the first predefined band of wavelengths of the ambient light via the lens assembly.

- Reference will now be made in detail to implementations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various described implementations. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various described implementations may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the implementations.
- One or more network-connected cameras could be set up in a smart home environment to provide video monitoring and security therein. In some implementations, the cameras operate in two modes, a Day mode in which there is enough ambient light to capture color video of a scene, and a Night mode in which the camera captures video of a scene using onboard LED illumination when there is not enough ambient light. A program module of the camera may decide when to switch between Night mode and Day mode using one or more of: illuminant detection, lux detection, and tiling. When the camera is in Day mode, IR filtering is enabled to block a substantial portion of the IR components of the incident light. When the camera is in Night mode, IR filtering is disabled so an image sensor array of the cameras can receive incident IR light from a scene illuminated by the camera's onboard IR illuminators or external IR illuminators.
- To overcome mechanical failure issues associated with conventional mechanically driven IR filters, an electrochromic glass layer is applied in a camera to control filtering of the IR components of the incident light. Specifically, in accordance with a determination to transition a camera mode to a Day mode, the camera generates a first voltage which is applied to the electrochromic glass layer to enable electrochromic filtering. In response to the first voltage, the electrochromic glass layer removes a substantial portion of a predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, and simultaneously passes a substantial portion of visible wavelengths of the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light via a lens assembly of the camera. Alternatively, in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to a Night mode, the camera generates by the controller a second voltage that is distinct from the first voltage (in some implementations, the camera disables the first voltage, i.e., setting the second voltage to 0V), and applies the second voltage on the electrochromic glass layer of the electrochromic glass layer to disable electrochromic filtering. In response to the second voltage, the electrochromic glass layer passes by the a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths and a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light incident on the camera, thereby exposing the sensor array exposed to the ambient light via the lens assembly without interference by electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer.
- Further, in some implementations, use of the electrochromic glass layer may introduce additional benefits, e.g., enabling a high dynamic range (HDR) mode. When two distinct voltages are applied sequentially on the electrochromic glass layer, distinct filtering effects associated with visible wavelengths of the incident light are enabled, and result in two images captured under two different exposure conditions. Image information of these two images can be combined to provide a high quality image that has an enhanced dynamic range.

FIG. 1 is an examplesmart home environment 100 in accordance with some implementations. TheSmart home environment 100 includes a structure 150 (e.g., a house, office building, garage, or mobile home) with various integrated devices. It will be appreciated that devices may also be integrated into asmart home environment 100 that does not include anentire structure 150, such as an apartment, condominium, or office space. Further, thesmart home environment 100 may control and/or be coupled to devices outside of theactual structure 150. Indeed, one or more devices in thesmart home environment 100 need not be physically within thestructure 150. For example, a device controlling apool heater 114 orirrigation system 116 may be located outside of thestructure 150. The depictedstructure 150 includes a plurality ofrooms 152, separated at least partly from each other viawalls 154. Thewalls 154 may include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room may further include afloor 156 and aceiling 158. Devices may be mounted on, integrated with and/or supported by awall 154,floor 156 orceiling 158. - In some implementations, the integrated devices of the
smart home environment 100 include intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices that integrate seamlessly with each other in a smart home network and/or with a central server or a cloud-computing system (e.g., a smart home provider server system 190) to provide a variety of useful smart home functions. Thesmart home environment 100 may include one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected thermostats 102 (hereinafter referred to as “smart thermostats 102”), one or more intelligent, network-connected, multi-sensing hazard detection units 104 (hereinafter referred to as “smart hazard detectors 104”), one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedentryway interface devices 106 and 120 (hereinafter referred to as “smart doorbells 106” and “smart door locks 120”), one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected alarm systems 122 (hereinafter referred to as “smart alarm systems 122”), one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected wall switches 108 (hereinafter referred to as “smart wall switches 108”), and one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected wall plug interfaces 110 (hereinafter referred to as “smart wall plugs 110”). In some implementations, thesmart home environment 100 includes a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected appliances 112 (hereinafter referred to as “smart appliances 112”), such as refrigerators, stoves, ovens, televisions, washers, dryers, lights, stereos, intercom systems, garage-door openers, floor fans, ceiling fans, wall air conditioners, pool heaters, irrigation systems, security systems, space heaters, window AC units, motorized duct vents, and so forth. The smart home may also include a variety ofnon-communicating legacy appliances 140, such as old conventional washer/dryers, refrigerators, and the like, which may be controlled by smart wall plugs 110. Thesmart home environment 100 may further include a variety of partially communicatinglegacy appliances 142, such as infrared (“IR”) controlled wall air conditioners or other IR-controlled devices, which may be controlled by IR signals provided by thesmart hazard detectors 104 or the smart wall switches 108. Thesmart home environment 100 may also include communication with devices outside of the physical home but within a proximate geographical range of the home. For example, thesmart home environment 100 may include a pool heater monitor 114 and/or anirrigation monitor 116. - In some implementations, the
smart home environment 100 includes one or more network-connectedcameras 118 that are configured to provide video monitoring and security in thesmart home environment 100. In some implementations,cameras 118 also capture video when other conditions or hazards are detected, in order to provide visual monitoring of thesmart home environment 100 when those conditions or hazards occur. Thecameras 118 may be used to determine occupancy of thestructure 150 and/orparticular rooms 152 in thestructure 150, and thus may act as occupancy sensors. For example, video captured by thecameras 118 may be processed to identify the presence of an occupant in the structure 150 (e.g., in a particular room 152). Specific individuals may be identified based, for example, on their appearance (e.g., height, face) and/or movement (e.g., their walk/gait). For example,cameras 118 may additionally include one or more sensors (e.g., IR sensors, motion detectors), input devices (e.g., microphone for capturing audio), and output devices (e.g., speaker for outputting audio). - The
smart home environment 100 may additionally or alternatively include one or more other occupancy sensors (e.g., thesmart doorbell 106, smart door locks 120, touch screens, IR sensors, microphones, ambient light sensors, motion detectors,smart nightlights 170, etc.). In some implementations, thesmart home environment 100 includes radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers (e.g., in eachroom 152 or a portion thereof) that determine occupancy based on RFID tags located on or embedded in occupants. For example, RFID readers may be integrated into thesmart hazard detectors 104. Thesmart home environment 100 may include one or more sound and/or vibration sensors for detecting abnormal sounds and/or vibrations. These sensors may be integrated with any of the devices described above. The sound sensors detect sound above a decibel threshold. The vibration sensors detect vibration above a threshold directed at a particular area (e.g., vibration on a particular window when a force is applied to break the window). - By virtue of network connectivity, one or more of the smart home devices of
FIG. 1 may further allow a user to interact with the device even if the user is not proximate to the device. For example, a user may communicate with a device using a computer (e.g., a desktop computer, laptop computer, or tablet) or other portable electronic device 130 (e.g., a mobile phone, such as a smart phone). A webpage or application may be configured to receive communications from the user and control the device based on the communications and/or to present information about the device's operation to the user. For example, the user may view a current set point temperature for a device (e.g., a stove) and adjust it using a computer. The user may be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure. - As discussed above, users may control smart devices in the
smart home environment 100 using a network-connected computer or portableelectronic device 130. In some examples, some or all of the occupants (e.g., individuals who live in the home) may register theirdevice 130 with thesmart home environment 100. Such registration may be made at a central server (e.g., a smart home provider server system 190) to authenticate the occupant and/or the device as being associated with the home and to give permission to the occupant to use the device to control the smart devices in the home. An occupant may use theirregistered device 130 to remotely control the smart devices of the home, such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation. The occupant may also use their registered device to control the smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the home, such as when the occupant is sitting on a couch inside the home. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registeringdevices 130, thesmart home environment 100 may make inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and whichdevices 130 are associated with those individuals. As such, the smart home environment may “learn” who is an occupant and permit thedevices 130 associated with those individuals to control the smart devices of the home. - In some implementations, in addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities,
devices - In some implementations, the smart devices serve as wireless or wired repeaters. In some implementations, a first one of the smart devices communicates with a second one of the smart devices via a wireless router. The smart devices may further communicate with each other via a connection (e.g., network interface 160) to a network, such as the
Internet 162. Through theInternet 162, the smart devices may communicate with a smart home provider server system 190 (also called a central server system and/or a cloud-computing system herein). The smart homeprovider server system 190 may be associated with a manufacturer, support entity, or service provider associated with the smart device(s). In some implementations, a user is able to contact customer support using a smart device itself rather than needing to use other communication means, such as a telephone or Internet-connected computer. In some implementations, software updates are automatically sent from the smart homeprovider server system 190 to smart devices (e.g., when available, when purchased, or at routine intervals). - In some implementations, the
network interface 160 includes a conventional network device (e.g., a router), and thesmart home environment 100 ofFIG. 1 includes ahub device 180 that is communicatively coupled to the network(s) 162 directly or via thenetwork interface 160. Thehub device 180 is further communicatively coupled to one or more of the above intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices (e.g., smart devices of the smart home environment 100). Each of these smart devices optionally communicates with thehub device 180 using one or more radio communication networks available at least in the smart home environment 100 (e.g., ZigBee, Z-Wave, Insteon, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and other radio communication networks). In some implementations, thehub device 180 and devices coupled with/to the hub device can be controlled and/or interacted with via an application running on a smart phone, household controller, laptop, tablet computer, game console or similar electronic device. In some implementations, a user of such controller application can view status of the hub device or coupled smart devices, configure the hub device to interoperate with smart devices newly introduced to the home network, commission new smart devices, and adjust or view settings of connected smart devices, etc. In some implementations the hub device extends capabilities of low capability smart device to match capabilities of the highly capable smart devices of the same type, integrates functionality of multiple different device types—even across different communication protocols, and is configured to streamline adding of new devices and commissioning of the hub device. - It is to be appreciated that “smart home environments” may refer to smart environments for homes such as a single-family house, but the scope of the present teachings is not so limited. The present teachings are also applicable, without limitation, to duplexes, townhomes, multi-unit apartment buildings, hotels, retail stores, office buildings, industrial buildings, and more generally any living space or work space.

FIG. 2 illustrates arepresentative operating environment 200 in which a video server system 208 provides data processing for monitoring and facilitating review of video streams (including motion events and alert events) captured byvideo cameras 118. As shown inFIG. 2 , the video server system 208 receives video data from video sources 222 (including cameras 118) located at various physical locations (e.g., inside homes, restaurants, stores, streets, parking lots, and/or thesmart home environments 100 ofFIG. 1 ). Each video source 522 may be bound to one or more user (e.g., reviewer) accounts, and the video server system 208 provides video monitoring data for thevideo sources 222 toclient devices 204 associated with the reviewer accounts. For example, the portableelectronic device 130 is an example of theclient device 204. - In some implementations, the smart home
provider server system 190 or a component thereof serves as the video server system 208; the video server system 208 is a part or component of the smart homeprovider server system 190. In some implementations, the video server system 208 is a dedicated video processing server that provides video processing services to video sources andclient devices 204 independent of other services provided by the video server system 208. - In some implementations, each of the
video sources 222 includes one ormore video cameras 118 that capture video and send the captured video to the video server system 208 substantially in real-time. In some implementations, each of thevideo sources 222 optionally includes a controller device (not shown) that serves as an intermediary between the one ormore cameras 118 and the video server system 208. The controller device receives the video data from the one ormore cameras 118, optionally performs some preliminary processing on the video data, and sends the video data to the video server system 208 on behalf of the one ormore cameras 118 substantially in real-time. In some implementations, each camera has its own on-board processing capabilities to perform some preliminary processing on the captured video data before sending the processed video data (along with metadata obtained through the preliminary processing) to the controller device and/or the video server system 208. - In some implementations, a
camera 118 of avideo source 222 captures video at a first resolution (e.g., 720P and/or 1080P) and/or a first frame rate (24 frames per second), and sends the captured video to the video server system 208 at both the first resolution (e.g., the original capture resolution(s), the high-quality resolution(s) such as 1080P and/or 720P) and the first frame rate, and at a second, different resolution (e.g., 180P) and/or a second frame rate (e.g., 5 frames per second or 10 frames per second). For example, thecamera 118 captures a video 223-1 at 720P and/or 1080P resolution (thecamera 118 may capture a video at 1080P and create a downscaled 720P version, or capture at both 720P and 1080P). Thevideo source 222 creates a second (or third), rescaled (and optionally at a different frame rate than the version 223-1) version 225-1 of the captured video at 180P resolution, and transmits both the original captured version 223-1 (i.e., 1080P and/or 720P) and the rescaled version 225-1 (i.e., the 180P version) to the video server system 208 for storage. In some implementations, the rescaled version has a lower resolution, and optionally a lower frame rate, than the original captured video. The video server system 208 transmits the original captured version or the rescaled version to aclient 204, depending on the context. For example, the video server system 208 transmits the rescaled version when transmitting multiple videos to thesame client device 204 for concurrent monitoring by the user, and transmits the original captured version in other contexts. In some implementations, the video server system 208 downscales the original captured version to a lower resolution, and transmits the downscaled version. - In some implementations, a
camera 118 of avideo source 222 captures video at a first resolution (e.g., 720P and/or 1080P) and/or a first frame rate, and sends the captured video to the video server system 208 at the first resolution (e.g., the original capture resolution(s); the high-quality resolution(s) such as 1080P and/or 720P) and first frame rate for storage. When the video server system 208 transmits the video to aclient device 204, the video server system 208 may downscale the video to a second, lower resolution (e.g., 180P) and/or second, lower frame rate for the transmission, depending on the context. For example, the video server system 208 transmits the downscaled version when transmitting multiple videos to thesame client device 204 for concurrent monitoring by the user, and transmits the original captured version in other contexts. - In some implementations, the
camera 118 operates in two modes, a Day mode in which there is enough ambient light to capture color video of a scene, and a Night mode in which the camera captures video of a scene using onboard LED illumination when there is not enough ambient light (e.g., as described in the cross-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/723,276, filed on May 27, 2015, entitled, “Multi-mode LED Illumination System.”). As described herein, in some implementations, thecamera 118 includes a program module that decides when to switch from Night mode to Day mode using one or more of: illuminant detection (detecting the type of ambient light based on R/G and B/G component ratios of the ambient light), lux detection (detecting the ambient light level), and tiling (performing illuminant detection and/or lux detection for sub-regions of an image sensor array so as to detect localized/point light source that only impact a portion of the image sensor array). - Referring to
FIG. 2 , in accordance with some implementations, each of theclient devices 204 includes a client-side module 202. The client-side module 202 communicates with a server-side module 206 executed on the video server system 208 through the one ormore networks 162. The client-side module 202 provides client-side functionalities for the event monitoring and review processing and communications with the server-side module 206. The server-side module 206 provides server-side functionalities for event monitoring and review processing for any number of client-side modules 202 each residing on arespective client device 204. The server-side module 206 also provides server-side functionalities for video processing and camera control for any number of thevideo sources 222, including any number of control devices and thecameras 118. - In some implementations, the server-
side module 206 includes one ormore processors 212, avideo storage database 214, device and account databases 216, an I/O interface to one ormore client devices 218, and an I/O interface to one ormore video sources 220. The I/O interface to one ormore clients 218 facilitates the client-facing input and output processing for the server-side module 206. In some implementations, the I/O interface toclients 218 or a transcoding proxy computer (not shown) rescales (e.g., downscales) and/or changes the frame rate of video for transmission to aclient 204. The databases 216 store a plurality of profiles for reviewer accounts registered with the video processing server, where a respective user profile includes account credentials for a respective reviewer account, and one or more video sources linked to the respective reviewer account. The I/O interface to one ormore video sources 220 facilitates communications with one or more video sources 222 (e.g., groups of one ormore cameras 118 and associated controller devices). Thevideo storage database 214 stores raw video data received from thevideo sources 222, as well as various types of metadata, such as motion events, event categories, event category models, event filters, and event masks, for use in data processing for event monitoring and review for each reviewer account. - In some implementations, the server-
side module 206 receives information regarding alert events detected by other smart devices 204 (e.g., hazards, sound, vibration, motion). In accordance with the alert event information, the server-side module 206 instructs one ormore video sources 222 in thesmart home environment 100 where the alert event is detected to capture video and/or associate with the alert event video, received from thevideo sources 222 in the samesmart home environment 100, that is contemporaneous or proximate in time with the alert event. - Examples of a
representative client device 204 include, but are not limited to, a handheld computer, a wearable computing device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a cellular telephone, a smart phone, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, a game console, a television, a remote control, a point-of-sale (POS) terminal, vehicle-mounted computer, an ebook reader, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. For example, client devices 204-1, 204-2, and 204-m are a smart phone, a tablet computer, and a laptop computer, respectively. - Examples of the one or
more networks 162 include local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) such as the Internet. The one ormore networks 162 are, optionally, implemented using any known network protocol, including various wired or wireless protocols, such as Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, Long Term Evolution (LTE), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Wi-MAX, or any other suitable communication protocol. - In some implementations, the video server system 208 is implemented on one or more standalone data processing apparatuses or a distributed network of computers. In some implementations, the video server system 208 also employs various virtual devices and/or services of third party service providers (e.g., third-party cloud service providers) to provide the underlying computing resources and/or infrastructure resources of the video server system 208. In some implementations, the video server system 208 includes, but is not limited to, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices.
- The server-
client environment 200 shown inFIG. 2 includes both a client-side portion (e.g., the client-side module 202) and a server-side portion (e.g., the server-side module 206). The division of functionalities between the client and server portions of operatingenvironment 200 can vary in different implementations. Similarly, the division of functionalities between thevideo source 222 and the video server system 208 can vary in different implementations. For example, in some implementations, client-side module 202 is a thin-client that provides only user-facing input and output processing functions, and delegates all other data processing functionalities to a backend server (e.g., the video server system 208). Similarly, in some implementations, a respective one of thevideo sources 222 is a simple video capturing device that continuously captures and streams video data to the video server system 208 with no or limited local preliminary processing on the video data. Although many aspects of the present technology are described from the perspective of the video server system 208, the corresponding actions performed by theclient device 204 and/or thevideo sources 222 would be apparent to ones skilled in the art without any creative efforts. Similarly, some aspects of the present technology may be described from the perspective of the client device or the video source, and the corresponding actions performed by the video server would be apparent to ones skilled in the art without any creative efforts. Furthermore, some aspects of the present technology may be performed by the video server system 208, theclient device 204, and thevideo sources 222 cooperatively. - The electronic devices, the client devices or the server system communicate with each other using the one or
more communication networks 162. In an example smart home environment, two or more devices (e.g., thenetwork interface device 160, thehub device 180, and the client devices 204-m) are located in close proximity to each other, such that they could be communicatively coupled in thesame sub-network 162A via wired connections, a WLAN or a Bluetooth Personal Area Network (PAN). The Bluetooth PAN is optionally established based on classical Bluetooth technology or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This smart home environment further includes one or more otherradio communication networks 162B through which at least some of the electronic devices of the video sources 222-n exchange data with thehub device 180. Alternatively, in some situations, some of the electronic devices of the video sources 222-n communicate with thenetwork interface device 160 directly via thesame sub-network 162A that couplesdevices network 162C), both the client device 204-m and the electronic devices of the video sources 222-n communicate directly via the network(s) 162 without passing thenetwork interface device 160 or thehub device 180. - In some implementations, during normal operation, the
network interface device 160 and thehub device 180 communicate with each other to form a network gateway through which data are exchanged with the electronic device of the video sources 222-n. As explained above, thenetwork interface device 160 and thehub device 180 optionally communicate with each other via asub-network 162A. In some implementations, thehub device 180 is omitted, and the functionality of thehub device 180 is performed by the video server system 208, video server system 252, or smart homeprovider server system 190. - In some implementations, the video server system 208 is, or includes, a dedicated video processing server configured to provide data processing for monitoring and facilitating review of alert events (e.g., motion events) in video streams captured by
video cameras 118. In this situation, the video server system 208 receives video data from video sources 222 (including cameras 118) located at various physical locations (e.g., inside homes, restaurants, stores, streets, parking lots, and/or thesmart home environments 100 ofFIG. 1 ). Eachvideo source 222 may be bound to one or more user (e.g., reviewer) accounts, and the video server system 252 provides video monitoring data for thevideo source 222 toclient devices 204 associated with the reviewer accounts. For example, the portable electronic device 166 is an example of theclient device 204. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating arepresentative camera 118 in accordance with some implementations. In some implementations, thecamera 118 includes one or more processing units or controllers (e.g., CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs, microprocessors, and the like) 302, one ormore communication interfaces 304,memory 306, one ormore communication buses 308 for interconnecting these components (sometimes called a chipset), alens assembly 330 including anelectrochromic glass layer 332, acontroller 333, animage sensor array 334, and infrared illuminators 336 (e.g., IR LEDs). In some implementations, thelens assembly 330 focuses incident light on theimage sensor array 334, which captures respective color components (e.g., R, G and B components) of the incident light focused on respective sensor array locations. When the camera is in Day mode, thecontroller 333 generates a first voltage and applies the first voltage on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. Electrochromic filtering of theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is thereby enabled for blocking a substantial portion of the IR components of the incident light. Alternatively, when the camera is in Night mode, thecontroller 333 removes the first voltage or generates a second voltage applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. Electrochromic filtering of theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is therefore disabled, allowing theimage sensor array 334 to receive incident IR light from a scene illuminated by the camera'sonboard IR illuminators 336 or external IR illuminators. In some implementations, thecamera 118 includes one ormore input devices 310 such as one or more buttons for receiving input and one or more microphones. In some implementations, thecamera 118 includes one ormore output devices 312 such as one or more indicator lights, a sound card, a speaker, a small display for displaying textual information and error codes, playing audio, etc. - Communication interfaces 304 include, for example, hardware capable of data communications using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols (e.g., IEEE 402.15.4, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Thread, Z-Wave, Bluetooth Smart, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, MiWi, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (e.g., Ethernet, HomePlug, etc.), or any other suitable communication protocol, including communication protocols not yet developed as of the filing date of this document.

Memory 306 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM, or other random access solid state memory devices; and, optionally, includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, one or more optical disk storage devices, one or more flash memory devices, or one or more other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 306, or alternatively the non-volatile memory withinmemory 306, includes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some implementations,memory 306, or the non-transitory computer readable storage medium ofmemory 306, stores the following programs, modules, and data structures, or a subset or superset thereof: -
-
Operating system 316 including procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; -
Network communication module 318 for connecting thecamera 118 to other computing devices (e.g., hub device server system 208, video server system 252, theclient device 130, network routing devices, one or more controller devices, and networked storage devices) connected to the one ormore networks 162 via the one or more communication interfaces 304 (wired or wireless); -
Video control module 320 for modifying the operation mode (e.g., zoom level, resolution, frame rate, recording and playback volume, lighting adjustment (e.g., performed by auto white balance (AWB)program module 320 a), AE and IR modes, etc.) of thecamera 118, enabling/disabling the audio and/or video recording functions of thecamera 118, changing the pan and tilt angles of thecamera 118, resetting thecamera 118, enabling/disabling electrochromic filtering of theelectrochromic glass layer 332, and/or the like; Thevideo control module 320 also includes a modecontrol program module 320 b that determines when to switch from Night mode to Day mode and vice-versa in accordance with some implementations; Themode control module 320 b also generates a voltage generation control signal to control thecontroller 333 to enable or disable electrochromic filtering in theelectrochromic glass layer 332 in accordance with a determination to transition to Day mode or Night mode, respectively; -
Video capturing module 324 for capturing and generating a video stream and sending the video stream to the video server system 208 as a continuous feed or in short bursts, and optionally generating a rescaled version of the video stream and sending the video stream at the original captured resolution and the rescaled resolution; -
Video caching module 326 for storing some or all captured video data locally at one or more local storage devices (e.g., memory, flash drives, internal hard disks, portable disks, etc.); - Local
video processing module 328 for performing preliminary processing of the captured video data locally at thecamera 118, including for example, compressing and encrypting the captured video data for network transmission, preliminary motion event detection, preliminary false positive suppression for motion event detection, preliminary motion vector generation, etc.; and -
Camera data 340 storing data, including but not limited to:-
Camera settings 342, including network settings, camera operation settings (such asframe rate 342 a,analog sensor gain 342 b, and Day/Night mode setting 342 c), camera storage settings, etc.; and -
Video data 344, including video segments and motion vectors for detected motion event candidates to be sent to the hub device server system 208 or video server system 252. - Raw sensor data 3460 (e.g., R, G and B components) captured from sensor pixel locations in the
sensor array 334 and saved as a raw image frame; in some implementations, the sensor is a “Bayer” sensor, where R, G and B pixels are captured from alternate sensor pixel locations in such a way that two times more G component values are captured than R or B component values; some implementations employ different types of sensors to provide theRaw sensor data 3460, including sensors with other arrangements of R, G and B color filters (e.g., a sensor producing an equal number of R, G and B components), and sensors that employ different color filters (e.g., a sensor with cyan (C), yellow (Y) and magenta (M) color filters, which produces C, Y and M components). Implementations described herein may employ data (e.g., color component values or ratios thereof) from all or a portion of thesensor array 334; accordingly, a reference herein to a “sensor array” or a “color sensor array” may refer to all or a portion of thesensor array 334. In some implementations, a group of sensor arrays, including a sensor array subdivided into tiles, may be referred to as a “sensor array system” or a “color sensor array system.” - Auto white balance (AWB)
data 3462, including data derived from theraw sensor data 3460 used to identify and compensate for the color temperature of the ambient light condition (e.g., sunlight vs. incandescent light vs. fluorescent light, etc.); in some implementations, theAWB data 3462 includes R/G and B/G ratios for respective pixel locations derived from the corresponding rawBayer sensor data 3460; in some implementations, these ratios are used directly to determine whether to switch from Night mode to Day mode. - All_lights lookup table (LUT) 3464, a table used in the Night mode to Day mode switching method of the present application to identify based on pairs of R/G and B/G ratios from the AWB table 3462 whether the associated ambient light is due to other than an IR illuminant; the majority of the table is filled with 1s (meaning the light is due to other than an IR-only illuminant), except for a small region around R/G=1, B/G=1 associated with 0 lux (IR only) light sources.
- Sunlight lookup table (LUT) 3466, a table used in the Night mode to Day mode switching method of the present application to identify based on pairs of R/G and B/G ratios from the AWB table 3462 whether the associated ambient light is due to sunlight, incandescent or similar light sources that are comparatively heavy emitters of IR light as compared to visible light; this table corresponds to a small region of the All_lights table—and is filled with 1s to represent where the corresponding R/G and B/G values are associated with sunlight and incandescent light.

- Each of the above identified elements may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices, and corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various implementations. In some implementations,
memory 306, optionally, stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore,memory 306, optionally, stores additional modules and data structures not described above. - In some implementations, the
camera 118 captures surveillance video using a digital imaging system. Digital images (frames) are captured as a sequence at aparticular frame rate 342 a, compressed, and then sent to the “cloud” (e.g., the video server system 208) for storage and retrieval. In some implementations, each frame (e.g., the raw sensor data 3460) is composed of 1280 by 320 pixels (1280×720) and each pixel location has 3 color components, red, green and blue. Thecamera 118 operates in one of two modes (e.g., indicated by the Day/Night mode value 342 c) depending on the ambient lighting conditions. Day mode is used when there is sufficient ambient light to adequately illuminate the scene. Night mode is used when there is not enough light to adequately illuminate the scene. - In some implementations, when operating in Day mode, the
camera 118 uses the ambient lighting sources to illuminate the scene and capture surveillance video. In some implementations, the minimum lux level at which the camera captures 118 video in Day mode is between 0.1 to 1 lux depending on the color temperature of the dominant illuminant. Once the minimum lux level is reached, the camera automatically switches to Night mode. Switching to Night mode includes disabling electrochromic filtering of theelectrochromic glass layer 332 and enabling a set ofIR LEDs 336 to provide illumination for the scene. Night mode is maintained until thecamera 118 detects an external illuminant. - As explained above, one challenge for using a mechanically driven IR filter is a risk of mechanical failure of the IR filter caused by constant switching of the camera between Day mode and Night mode. There has been a need for a camera that applies a more reliable filtering mechanism than the mechanically driven IR filter when the camera constantly switches between a Night mode to a Day mode.

FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a front portion of acamera 118 based on electrochromic filtering in accordance with some implementations. Thecamera 118 includes acontroller 333, memory storing instructions for execution by the controller (e.g.,mode control module 320 b), asensor array 334 including a plurality of sensor elements, anaperture 453 and alens assembly 330 that is configured to focus light on the sensor array. Lens(es) and filter(s) of thelens assembly 330 are disposed on an optical path, and aligned with respect to an optical axis. Incident light travels along the optical path to pass thelens assembly 330 and theaperture 453 and reach theimage sensor array 334. - In some implementations, the
lens assembly 330 includes anelectrochromic glass layer 332 disposed on the optical path of the incident light and at a location in front of thesensor array 334. Theelectrochromic glass layer 332 has optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to theelectrochromic glass layer 332. As such, thelens assembly 330 include a first transmission state in which theelectrochromic glass layer 332A is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths, and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths. - The
camera 118 operates in two modes, a Day mode in which there is enough ambient light to capture color video of a scene, and a Night mode in which the camera captures video of a scene using onboard LED illumination when there is not enough ambient light. When the camera is in Day mode, IR filtering is enabled to block a substantial portion of the IR components of the incident light. More specifically, when thecamera 118 determines to transition the camera mode to a Day mode, thecontroller 333 generates a first voltage. The first voltage is applied to theelectrochromic glass layer 332 to cause thelens assembly 330 to enter the first transmission state. Prior to this transition of the camera mode to the Day mode, the camera operates in a Night mode, and thelens assembly 330 was in the second transmission state. Then, in response to the first voltage, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 removes a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, and simultaneously passes by the electrochromic glass layer 332 a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing thesensor array 334 to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light via thelens assembly 330. - In some implementations, the magnitude of the first voltage is not greater than 5V, and induces a limited amount of current consumption. In some implementations, the first voltage is sustained on the electrochromic glass layer at the first transmission state. In some implementations, when the camera transitions to the camera mode to the Day mode, the first voltage is applied on the electrochromic glass layer for a predetermined duration of time and is removed after the predetermined duration of time.
- Alternatively, when the camera is in Night mode, IR filtering is disabled so a
sensor array 334 of the cameras can receive incident IR light from a scene illuminated by the camera's onboard IR illuminators or external IR illuminators. More specifically, in some implementations, when thecamera 118 determines to transition the camera mode to the Night mode, thecontroller 333 generates a second voltage that is distinct from the first voltage. The second voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332 to cause thelens assembly 330 to enter the second transmission state. In response to the second voltage, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 passes a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths and a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, thereby exposing the sensor array exposed to the ambient light via the lens assembly without interference by electrochromic filtering of the electrochromic glass layer. In some implementations, the second voltage is substantially equal to zero, i.e., the first voltage is removed or disabled from theelectrochromic glass layer 332. - In some implementations, the
onboard IR illuminators 336 include one or more infrared light emitting diodes (e.g., as described in the cross-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/723,276, filed on May 27, 2015, entitled, “Multi-mode LED Illumination System.”). In accordance with the determination to transition the camera mode to the Night mode, the infrared light emitting diodes are powered on to illuminate a field of view while electrochromic filtering of theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is disabled. - In some implementations, the
lens assembly 330 includes one or more optical lenses 452 in addition to theelectrochromic glass layer 332, and the one or more optical lenses 452 are configured to focus incident light of thecamera 118 onto thesensor array 334. Optionally, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is a standalone optical filter disposed between the one or more optical lenses 452 and the sensor array 334 (as shown inFIG. 4B ), between two of the one or more optical lenses 452 or in front of the one or more optical lenses 452. Optionally, the one or more optical lenses 452 include a firstoptical lens 452A configured to focus light on thesensor array 334. The firstoptical lens 452A is integrated with a layer of electrochromic glass coating to form theelectrochromic glass layer 332. Theelectrochromic glass layer 332 therefore includes the firstoptical lens 452A, which is also configured to filter the substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in the ambient light when thecamera 118 determines to transition its camera mode to the Day mode. - As described herein, in some implementations, the
camera 118 includes amode control module 320 b that decides when to switch from Night mode to Day mode using one or more of: illuminant detection (detecting the type of ambient light based on R/G and B/G component ratios of the ambient light), lux detection (detecting the ambient light level), and tiling (performing illuminant detection and/or lux detection for sub-regions of an image sensor array so as to detect localized/point light source that only impact a portion of the image sensor array). Specifically, when the camera mode is a Night mode, themode control module 320 b determines whether the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source, detects an ambient light level, and initiates a change of the camera mode to the Day mode when it is determined that the ambient light that is not filtered by theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is due to other than an IR light source and that the ambient light level exceeds a first lux threshold. In contract, themode control module 320 b maintains thecamera 118 in the Night mode if it is determined that the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source and that the ambient light threshold does not exceed the first lux threshold. - Further, in some implementations, wherein the sensor elements of the
sensor array 334 include first, second and third pixels each of which has respective peak responses at different respective visible light frequencies (e.g., for green, red and blue colors, respectively). Themode control module 320 b detects a first light component, a second light component and a third light component of the ambient light by averaging output signals from the first, second and third pixels, respectively. Respective values of the first, second and third light components are further used to determine whether the ambient light is due to other than an IR light source. Additionally, in some implementations, themode control module 320 b is also configured to determine whether the ambient light is due to sunlight or an incandescent light source based on values of the first, second and third light components. After it is determined that the ambient light is due to sunlight or an incandescent light source, thecamera 118 initiates a change of the camera mode to the Day mode only when the ambient light level exceeds a second lux threshold higher than the first lux threshold. More details on detection and switching of Day mode and Night mode are described in the cross-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/738,225, filed on Jun. 12, 2015, entitled, “Day and Night Detection Based on One or More of Illuminant Detection, Lux Level Detection, and Tilting.” - Referring to
FIG. 4B , theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is disposed in front of thesensor array 334 either as a standalone filter or a layer of electrochromic glass coated on anoptical lens 452A. Moreover, in some implementations, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 can be integrated on theimage sensor array 334 of thecamera 118. -
FIG. 5 is animage sensor device 500 integrated with an electrochromic glass layer in accordance with some implementations. Theimage sensor device 500 includes an electrochromic glass layer 502 and animage sensor array 504 formed at or mounted on a substrate 506 (e.g., a glass or silicon die, a printed circuit board). Theimage sensor array 504 further includes a plurality of sensor elements and is configured to capture images or video clips. The electrochromic glass layer 502 is disposed in front of the sensor array and has optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the glass. The electrochromic glass layer 502 includes a first transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer 502 is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths, and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer 502 is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths. Theimage sensor device 500 operates in two modes, a Day mode in which there is enough ambient light to capture color video of a scene, and a Night mode in which theimage sensor device 500 captures image of a scene using IR illumination when there is not enough ambient light. - In accordance with a determination to transition the sensor mode to a Day mode, the
image sensor device 500 generates a first voltage, and applies the first voltage to cause the electrochromic glass layer 502 to enter the first transmission state. Prior to the transition of the sensor mode to the Day mode, the electrochromic glass layer 502 was in the second transmission state. In response to the first voltage, theimage sensor device 500 removes by the electrochromic glass layer 502 a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the image sensor device, and simultaneously passes by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing theimage sensor array 504 to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light. - In some implementations, the
electrochromic glass layer 502A is monolithically coated on the sensor elements of the image sensor array directly. In some implementations, the electrochromic glass layer (not shown inFIG. 5 ) is integrated on a transparent packaging cover that is assembled onto a top surface of theimage sensor device 504. In some implementations, theelectrochromic glass layer 502B (also shown as theelectrochromic glass layer 332 inFIG. 4B ) is disposed as a separate and standalone optical filter in the optical path of ambient light incident on theimage sensor device 500. In some implementations, the electrochromic glass layer is integrated on an optical lens 452 configured to focus light on the image sensor array 500 (as shown inFIG. 4B ). - The
image sensor device 500 can be part of a camera (e.g., the camera 118). Theimage sensor device 500 can also be used as a motion sensor that detects motion of an object in a field of view associated with theimage sensor device 500. - In some implementations, transitions of the sensor mode to Day mode or Night mode can be similarly decided by one or more programs associated with the
image sensor array 500. In some implementations, theimage sensor array 500 can also be configured to implement an HDR mode. More details on determination of the camera mode and the HDR mode are described above with reference toFIGS. 3 and 4B . For brevity, they are not repeated herein. -
FIG. 6A is anelectrochromic glass layer 332 that is not biased and passes both visible and infrared wavelengths of ambient light incident on a camera in accordance with some implementations.FIG. 6B is anelectrochromic glass layer 332 that is biased under a first voltage and removes a substantial portion of a predefined band of IR wavelengths of ambient light incident on a camera in accordance with some implementations.FIG. 6C is anelectrochromic glass layer 332 that is biased under a second voltage and removes a substantial portion of both a predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths of ambient light incident on a camera in accordance with some implementations. In some implementations, the second voltage is substantially larger than the first voltage. - The
electrochromic glass layer 332 includes anelectrolyte layer 602, afirst electrode 604 and acounter electrode 606 that are configured to act as an electrochemical cell. The first and second voltages are applied on thefirst electrode 604 at the Day mode and at the Night mode, respectively, while thecounter electrode 606 is optionally grounded. Nanoparticle-in-glass composite material is deposited on a first side of theelectrolyte layer 602 and forms thefirst electrode 604. For example, thefirst electrode 602 may include a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals in glass made out of niobium oxide. The ITO nanocrystals are combined with niobium-containing ions (also called polyoxometalate (POM) clusters) in solution, and the first electrode is formed when the solution covers a surface of theelectrochromic glass layer 332. In some implementations, the ITO nanocrystal solution is optionally evaporated or spray coated onto the first side of theelectrolyte layer 602 to form thefirst electrode 604. - In some implementations, when no electrical voltage is applied between the
first electrode 604 and thecounter electrode 606, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 operates at a second transmission state in which it is transparent to a predefined band of IR wavelengths (e.g., near-infrared wavelengths) and visible wavelengths of incident light. This second transmission state could be activated in accordance with a determination to transition a camera mode to a Night mode, when IR illumination is necessary for capturing images. - Referring to
FIG. 6B , in some implementations, when a first voltage having a substantially intermediate magnitude (e.g., 0-5V) is applied, charge carrier (e.g., lithium ions and electrons) migrates in this electrochemical cell, which chemically reduces nanoparticles in thefirst electrode 604 and therefore blocks a substantially portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths (e.g., near-infrared wavelengths) in ambient light incident on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. Under these circumstances, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 operates at a first transmission state in which transmission of the predefined band of IR wavelengths is substantially reduced. This first transmission state could be activated in accordance with a determination to transition a camera mode to a Day mode, when there is enough visible light to capture color images of a scene. - Referring to
FIG. 6C , the camera mode includes a third mode. In accordance with a determination that the camera mode is the third mode, a third voltage is generated and applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. In response to the third voltage, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 removes a substantial portion of the predefined band of the ambient wavelengths while reducing the intensity of the visible wavelengths in the ambient light to a first visible light intensity, thereby exposing the sensor array to the visible wavelengths of the ambient light having the first visible light intensity. The first visible light intensity is distinct from the visible light intensity to which the electrochromic glass layer is exposed when the first voltage is applied thereon. In some implementations, the third voltage is substantially larger than the first voltage. - In some implementations, two images could be captured for a scene when the first and third voltages are applied on the
electrochromic glass layer 332 to enable two different exposure conditions for thecamera 118. Specifically, the third mode includes a high dynamic range (HDR) mode. Thecamera 118 captures a first image of a scene when the first voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332, and captures a second image of a substantially identical scene when the third voltage is applied on the electrochromic glass layer. For a recorded video clip, thecamera 118 captures the first and second images for each frame of the recorded video clip. Thecamera 118 or a remote server then combines at least the first and second images to obtain a HDR image (or a HDR frame of the recorded video clip). The HDR image would have a higher dynamic range and thereby enables a better image quality than either one of the first and second images, because the HDR image combines dynamic ranges associated with the exposure conditions of the first and second images. - In some implementations, when the third mode includes the HDR mode, the first voltage does not have to be one of at least two voltages used to create the different exposure conditions for the
camera 118. Thecontroller 333 of thecamera 118 generates a fourth voltage in addition to the third voltage as described above. The fourth voltage is distinct from the third voltage. The fourth voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. In response to the fourth voltage, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 removes a substantial portion of the predefined band of the wavelengths while reducing the intensity of the visible wavelengths in the ambient light to a second visible light intensity. The second visible light intensity is distinct from the first visible light intensity to which the electrochromic glass layer is exposed when the third voltage is applied thereon, thereby enabling two distinct exposure conditions for the same scene. - In this HDR mode, the
camera 118 captures a first image of a scene when the third voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332, and a second image of the substantially identical scene when the fourth voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332. For a recorded video clip, thecamera 118 captures the first and second images for each frame of the recorded video clip. Thecamera 118 or a remote server then combines at least the first and second images to obtain a HDR image (or a HDR frame of the recorded video clip). In some implementations, thecamera 118 or the remote server combines more than two images of the scene to obtain the HDR image. - In some implementations, the first voltage is sustained on the
electrochromic glass layer 332 at the first transmission state. In some implementations, when the camera transitions the camera mode to the Day mode, the first voltage is applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332 for a predetermined duration of time, and removed after the predetermined duration of time. Similarly, each of the other voltages (e.g., the second, third or fourth voltage) is optionally sustained on theelectrochromic glass layer 332 or applied on theelectrochromic glass layer 332 for a respective duration of time, in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to a respective camera mode (e.g., the Night mode and the HDR mode). -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of amethod 700 of controlling electrochromic filtering of a camera (e.g., the camera 118) according to a camera mode in accordance with some implementations. Referring toFIG. 3 , the camera includes acontroller 333, asensor array 334 including a plurality of sensor elements, and alens assembly 330 that is configured to focus light on thesensor array 334. Optionally, the camera includesmemory 306 storing instructions for execution by thecontroller 333. Thelens assembly 330 further includes anelectrochromic glass layer 332 disposed in front of thesensor array 334 and having optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to theelectrochromic glass layer 332. The lens assembly includes a first transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths. - In accordance with a determination (706) to transition the camera mode to a Day mode, the
controller 333 generates (708) a first voltage, and the first voltage is applied (710) to theelectrochromic glass layer 332 to cause thelens assembly 330 to enter the first transmission state. Prior to the transition of the camera mode to the Day mode, thelens assembly 330 was (712) in the second transmission state. In response to the first voltage,electrochromic glass layer 332 removes (714) a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the camera, and simultaneously passes by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light via the lens assembly. In some implementations, themode control module 320 b includes one or more programs having instruction for controlling thecontroller 333 to generate the first voltage in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to the Day mode. - More details on a Night mode, a HDR mode and characteristics of the
electrochromic layer 332 are discussed above with reference toFIGS. 1-6 . -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of amethod 800 of controlling electrochromic filtering of an image sensor device (e.g., thesensor array 334 or 500) according to a sensor mode in accordance with some implementations. Specifically, theimage sensor device 500 includes an electrochromic glass layer 502 and animage sensor array 504, and the image sensor array further includes a plurality of sensor elements. The electrochromic glass layer 502 is disposed in front of the sensor array and has optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to the glass. The electrochromic glass layer further includes a first transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially opaque to a predefined band of IR wavelengths and a second transmission state in which the electrochromic glass layer is substantially transparent to the predefined band of IR wavelengths and visible wavelengths. - In accordance with a determination to transition (806) the sensor mode to a Day mode, the
image sensor device 500 generates (808) a first voltage, and applies (810) the first voltage to cause the electrochromic glass layer to enter the first transmission state. Prior to the transition of the sensor mode to the Day mode, the electrochromic glass layer was (812) in the second transmission state. In response to the first voltage, the electrochromic glass layer 502 removes (814) a substantial portion of the predefined band of IR wavelengths in ambient light incident on the image sensor device, and simultaneously passes by the electrochromic glass layer a substantial portion of visible wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the image sensor array to the substantial portion of the visible wavelengths of the ambient light. Likewise, more details on a Night mode, a HDR mode and characteristics of theelectrochromic layer 332 are discussed above with reference toFIGS. 1-6 . -
FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of amethod 900 of controlling electrochromic filtering of a lens assembly (e.g., the lens assembly 330) in accordance with some implementations. Thelens assembly 330 is part of acamera 118 further including acontroller 333 and animage sensor array 334 having a plurality of sensor elements. Thelens assembly 330 is configured to focus light on thesensor array 334, and further includes an electrochromic glass lens disposed in front of the sensor array and having an index of refraction that is variable and responsive to voltage applied on the electrochromic glass lens. Optionally, thecamera 118 further includesmemory 306 storing instructions for execution by thecontroller 333. - The
camera 118 determines (904) that the camera mode is a first mode in which the index of refraction of the electrochromic glass lens has a first index value associated with a first focal length. In accordance with a determination (906) that the camera mode at the first mode, thecontroller 333 generates (908) by the controller a first voltage, and applies (910) the first voltage on the electrochromic glass lens, thereby changing the index of refraction of the electrochromic glass lens to a second index value associated with a second focal length that is distinct from the first focal length. - In some implementations, it is determined that the camera mode is the first mode when ambient temperature of the camera exceeds a thermal threshold, and the first voltage is applied to compensate a variation of a focal length of either the electrochromic glass lens or one or more optical lens 452 of the
lens assembly 333 that is caused by a corresponding temperature increase. This temperature increase often happens to an outdoor surveillance camera. -
FIG. 10 is a flow diagram 1000 of a method of controlling a filtering effect of a camera (e.g., thecamera 118 or 118) in accordance with some implementations. Thecamera 118 includes acontroller 333 and animage sensor array 334 having a plurality of sensor elements, and alens assembly 330 configured to focus light on thesensor array 334. Optionally, thecamera 118 includesmemory 306 storing instructions for execution by thecontroller 333. Thelens assembly 330 includes anelectrochromic glass layer 332 disposed in front of the sensor array and having optical transmission properties that are responsive to voltage applied to theelectrochromic glass layer 332. The lens assembly includes a first filtering mode in which theelectrochromic glass layer 332 is configured to band-transmit a first predefined band of wavelengths. More specifically, in accordance with a determination to transition the camera mode to an operation mode, the camera 118 (e.g., themode control module 320 b) determines (1004) a magnitude of a first voltage, and thecontroller 333 then generates the first voltage. In the operation mode, thecamera 118 is configured (1006) to capture media content in a field of view illuminated with light having the first predefined band of wavelengths. The camera 452 then applies (1008) the first voltage to cause the lens assembly to enter the first filtering mode. In response to the first voltage, theelectrochromic glass layer 332 passes (1010) a substantial portion of the first predefined band of wavelengths in the ambient light, thereby exposing the sensor array to the substantial portion of the first predefined band of wavelengths of the ambient light via the lens assembly. In some implementations, the first predefined band of wavelengths is associated with one of red, blue and green colors. - It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
FIGS. 7-10 have been described are merely exemplary and are not intended to indicate that the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to implement therespective methods methods methods - In summary, in accordance with various implementations in this application, nanoparticles are suspended in a crystal matrix to form an electrochromic glass layer that can switch between an IR blocking/filtering state and an IR transmission state without any moving part. A thin coating of nanocrystals embedded in glass can provide selective control over wavelengths of ambient light that can pass through the glass. A small jolt of electricity is needed to switch the electrochromic glass layer between the IR blocking/filtering state and the IR transmission state. Further, due to the use of the electrochromic glass layer in the optical path of a camera, the camera is configured for switching between a traditional visible light image capture mode and IR image capture mode, and this mode switching activity does not involve any moving part (such as a filter motor).
- When the Nanocrystal-based electrochromic glass layer is used as an IR filter for a camera operating at Night and Day modes, it is compatible with many sensors that have greater dynamic range and sensitivity than an RGB-IR sensor.
- More importantly, the electrochromic glass layer does not involve any moving parts and reduces space required by a camera module that relies on a mechanically driven filter. This helps improvement of the form factor of the camera module, and eliminates a risk of creating particle contamination in the camera module.
- In some implementations, electrochromic filtering actually increases a dynamic range in Day mode by darkening in the visible range. This feature could be useful in outdoor imaging, where direct sunlight can saturate a sensor. Referring to
FIG. 10 , in some implementations, nanocrystals in the electrochromic glass layer can be tuned to specific wavelengths needs of the system. - Referring to
FIG. 9 , in some implementations, improvement to the technology allows a refractive index change in glass, and therefore, focal length compensation in a camera system (particularly in a fixed focus camera). - It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are, in some instances, used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first voltage could be termed a second voltage, and, similarly, a second voltage could be termed a first voltage, without departing from the scope of the various described implementations. The first voltage and the second voltage are both voltage levels, but they are not the same voltage level.
- The terminology used in the description of the various described implementations herein is for the purpose of describing particular implementations only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the description of the various described implementations and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term “and/or” as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms “includes,” “including,” “comprises,” and/or “comprising,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
- As used herein, the term “if” is, optionally, construed to mean “when” or “upon” or “in response to determining” or “in response to detecting” or “in accordance with a determination that,” depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase “if it is determined” or “if [a stated condition or event] is detected” is, optionally, construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “upon detecting [the stated condition or event]” or “in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]” or “in accordance with a determination that [a stated condition or event] is detected,” depending on the context.
- Although some of various drawings illustrate a number of logical stages in a particular order, stages that are not order dependent may be reordered and other stages may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, so the ordering and groupings presented herein are not an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.
- The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific implementations. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the scope of the claims to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The implementations were chosen in order to best explain the principles underlying the claims and their practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best use the implementations with various modifications as are suited to the particular uses contemplated.
