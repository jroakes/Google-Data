- A system consistent with this disclosure collects metadata about a query (e.g., a text query and/or an image query) and displays the metadata and contents of the query in an activity stream. Generally, an activity stream includes a graphical user interface that displays data published by users of a system, e.g., a social networking system. In an example, the data published by users of the system are stored in data objects. Generally, a data object includes a data structure for storage of data.
- In an example, the system generates data objects for numerous types of data, including, e.g., a data object for an update to a profile page, a data object for a post to a web page, a data object for a picture displayed in a web page, a data object for a query requested by a user (“query data object”), and so forth. In this example, the system is configured to display contents of the data objects in the activity stream. Using the query data object displayed in the activity stream, a user may post comments about the query and share the query with other users of the system.
- In an example, the user submits to the system a request to search for resources related to a celebrity, e.g., a celebrity named “Joe Jones.” In this example, the request includes the search query “Joe Jones.” Using the search query, the system generates a query to identify in the system and/or in the World Wide Web resources related to Joe Jones. In this example, the system also generates search results for the resources. A search result includes data generated by the system that identifies a resource and that includes a link to the resource.
- Using the search query and the search results, the system generates a query data object for the query. The query data object includes the contents of the query, e.g., the search query “Joe Jones.” The query data object also includes the search results. The query data object also includes metadata about the query, including, e.g., data indicative of a number of search results that the system identified in response to the query. The query data object is displayed in activity streams of users of the system.

FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram of an example ofsystem 100 for generatingquery data object 114.System 100 includesserver 102,client devices network 110.Client devices server 102 overnetwork 110. Users (not shown) may useclient devices graphical user interfaces -
Server 102 includesdata engine 106, which is configured run numerous services, including, e.g., a social networking service, an Internet crawl service, and so forth. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,data engine 106 crawlsresources 140 ofweb sites 142. In an example,web sites 142 may be hosted by servers (not shown) that are external tosystem 100. In another example,web sites 142 may be hosted byserver 102. - Based on the crawling of
resources 140,data engine 106 identifies content inresources 140. Using content inresources 140,data engine 106 generates data objects for display in activities streams of users of the social networking service. A data object may identify a query and include a link to search results of the query. In an example, the data object includes information specifying search query in the query, a URL (Unified Resource Location) to a web page that displays the search results of the query, and metadata about the query. - In an example,
server 102 includes a search engine with various components, including, e.g., a component for crawlingresources 140, a component forindexing resources 140, anddata engine 106. In this example,data engine 106 may receive from the other components of the search engine data that is used to generate the data objects. In this example,data engine 106 may be a separate component in the search engine. - As previously described,
server 102 includes another component for receiving information from social networking services and/or web sites (“social networking component”). In this example,web sites 142 are hosted byserver 102, andresources 140 include a web page that is accessible to users of the social networking service. In this example, the web page includes a posting inviting users of the social networking service to an event, e.g., a movie preview. The social networking components receives contents of the web page for the event and passes the content todata engine 106. Using the contents,data engine 106 generates a data object for the event (“event data object 116”). - Event data object 116 may be displayed in activity streams of users of the social networking service based on affinities of the users to other users, e.g., when the users have a connection to other users that have viewed the event. Generally, a connection includes a relationship among items of data, including, e.g., among an item of data representing a user and items of data in a web page, among the item of data representing the user and another item of data representing another user, and so forth. In this example, the connection may be established based on performance of actions, including, e.g., viewing the web page, endorsing the web page, posting a comment on the web page, being connected to another user that has performed one of the foregoing actions, and so forth.
-
Data engine 106 may also be configured to generate other types of data objects, including, e.g., query data object 114.Data engine 106 may use contents ofgraphical user interface 120 in generating data query data object 114. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,client device 104 accessesgraphical user interface 120 fromserver 102. In this example,graphical user interface 120 includes a web page withfield 122 for input of search query. - By inputting a search query into
field 122, a user (not shown) ofclient device 104 may request thatserver 102 perform a search ofresources 140 for content related to the search queries input intofield 122. In this example, the user inputs the search query “Joe Jones” intofield 122 ofgraphical user interface 120. The user selectscontrol 123 to request thatserver 102search resources 140 for content related to the search query “Joe Jones.” - In response,
data engine 106 generatesquery 105 to search inresources 140 for content related to the search query “Joe Jones.”Data engine 106 also generates search results (not shown) to identify the resources including content related to the search query “Joe Jones.” - Using contents of
query 105 and the search results,data engine 106 generates query data object 114 for storage ofquery 105, search results ofquery 105, and metadata pertaining to query 105. Using query data object 114, users may post comments regarding an effectiveness ofquery 105. Using query data object 114, users may also sharequery 105 among other users of the social networking service. Through query data object 114, users may also view metadata pertaining to query 105 and may view search results ofquery 105. - In an example, the search results accessed through query data object 114 include cached search results generated by
data engine 106 during a prior execution ofquery 105. In another example, the search results are refreshed search results generated bydata engine 106 through an execution ofquery 105, e.g., when the search results requested through query data object 114. -
System 100 also includesdata repository 112 for storage of query data object 114 and event data object 116.Data repository 112 also includesobject index 118 for storing information that indexes data objects, including, e.g., query data object 114 and event data object 116. - In an example, query data object 114 includes a timestamp specifying a time in which
data engine 106 performedquery 105. Event data object 116 also includes a timestamp specifying a time in which the event for event data object 116 was posted onresources 140 inwebsites 142. In this example,data engine 106 indexes query data object 114 and event data object 116 inobject index 118 based on the respective timestamps. - In an example,
data engine 106 also indexes query data object 114 and event data object 116 inobject index 118 based on respective permission levels. Generally, a permission level includes data specifying identities of users of the social networking service that are authorized to access a data object. - A user may specify the permission level for a data object. In an example, the user of
client device 104 may use controls (not shown) ingraphical user interface 120 to specify thatquery 105 is accessible to users connected in the social networking service to the user ofclient device 104. In another example, the user ofclient device 104 may specify thatquery 105 is accessible to the users of the social networking service. Using the specified accessibility forquery 105,data engine 106 generates a permission level for query data object 114.Data engine 106 stores the permission level as metadata in query data object 114. - In some implementations, users may also specify whether data objects should be generated for their queries, e.g., by opting-in or opting-out of generating data objects for their queries. In some implementations, the data in the data objects can be anonymized to promote privacy of users. In this example, the system implements a hashing function to encrypt the data and other content that the system identifies to anonymize. For example,
data repository 108 stores the data for the attributes in an encrypted form to promote secure storage of the data. - In the example of
FIG. 1 , a user (not shown) ofclient device 108 usesclient device 108 to accessgraphical user interface 124 fromserver 102.Graphical user interface 124 includes a web page that displaysactivity stream 128 for the user ofclient device 108. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,data engine 106 accesses objectindex 118 to determine data objects for display inactivity stream 128. In an example,data engine 106 is configured to display inactivity stream 128 recently generated data objects that the user ofclient device 108 is authorized to access. Generally, recently generated data objects include data objects with timestamps with increased proximity to a time thatdata engine 106 generates data stream 128 (“generation time”), e.g., relative to a proximity of timestamps of other data objects to the generation time. Using timestamps in query data object 114 and event data object 116,data engine 106 identifies query data object 114 and event data object 116 as recently generated data objects. - In the example of
FIG. 1 , event data object 116 has a permission level specifying that users connected to the user that published the event may viewevent data object 116. Query data object 114 has a permission level specifying that users connected to the user that submitted the request forquery 105 may view query data object 114. In this example, the user ofclient device 108 is connected in the social networking service to both the user that published the event and the user that submitted the request forquery 105. - Using the permission levels of query data object 114 and event data object 116,
data engine 106 determines that the user ofclient device 108 has permission to access query data object 114 and event data object 116.Data engine 106 selects query data object 114 and event data object 116 for display inactivity stream 128. To display contents of query data object 114 and event data object 116 inactivity stream 128,data engine 106 generates data forvisual representation 113 of query data object 114 and data forvisual representation 115 of event data object 116. -
Visual representation 113 includesportion 117 that displays the search query of query 105 (e.g., “Joe Jones”).Portion 117 ofvisual representation 113 also includes data specifying a type of data object for query data object 114. In the example ofFIG. 1 , query data object 114 is a “search query” type of data object. - In an example,
portion 117 includes selectable data, e.g., the search query. When the search query are selected by the user ofclient device 108,data engine 106 retrieves from query data object 114 the original search results forquery 105. In another example, when the search query is selected by the user ofclient device 108,data engine 106 generates new search results byre-executing query 105.Data engine 106 sends toclient device 108 the search results for display ingraphical user interface 124. In another example, the selectable data includes one or more images. - In the example of

These metrics may include measures of a number of users that has requested thatdata engine 106perform query 105, measures of a number of users that has commented onquery 105, measures of a number of users that has viewed search results forquery 105, and measures of a number of users that has endorsedquery 105. The metrics may be initialized to pre-defined values, including, e.g., a value of zero. - As actions are performed on
query 105,data engine 106 may increment indata query object 114 values of the metrics pertaining to the performed actions, as described in further detail with regard toFIG. 4 . As searches are performed usingquery 105,data engine 106 also increments in query data object 114 the value of metrics pertaining to numbers of users that have requested thatdata engine 106perform query 105. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example ofprocess 400 for analyzing performance of actions onquery 105. In operation,data engine 106 receives (402) a request (not shown) for performance of an action onquery 105, e.g., following selection of one ofcontrols 126 by the user of client device 108 (FIG. 1 ). As previously described, the user ofclient device 108 may request thatdata engine 106 perform numerous actions onquery 105. The actions include posting a comment to query 105, endorsingquery 105, and sharingquery 105 with other users of the social networking service running onserver 102. - In the example of
FIG. 4 ,data engine 106 performs (404) the action requested by the user ofclient device 108.Data engine 106 also updates (406) metrics in query data object 114 to reflect performance of the action. In an example,data engine 106 performs an action of posting a comment to query 105. Following the posting of the comment,data engine 106 accesses in query data object 114 a metric specifying a number of comments that have been posted to query 105.Data engine 106 increments by a value of one a value of the metric. - Using the techniques described herein, a system in configured to use contents of a query in generating a query data object that stores metadata about the query and search query in the query. The system can display a visual representation of the query data object in an activity stream.
