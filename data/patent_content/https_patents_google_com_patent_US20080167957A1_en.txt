- FIG. 1 shows an example architecture of a communication system 100 according to an aspect of the present invention.
- Communication system 100 may include a network 110 to communicatively couple third-party data sources 120 , at least one subscriber 130 , at least one regional broadcast studio 140 , and a broadcasting hub 150 .
- at least one regional studio 140 may be further communicatively coupled to at least one radio transmitter 160 .
- the network 110 is the Internet.
- the network 110 can be any network, such as a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network.
- third-party data sources can be any database, data mart, or other data source that provides data of interest to a subscriber 130 relevant to the scheduling of their advertisement.
- the third-party data may be Arbitron ratings and demographic breakdowns for each station in a broadcast network.
- third-party data may be the weather forecast, current weather conditions, or news events such as stock prices, sports scores, data from a syndicated data feed such as an RSS feed, or any other data relevant to a subscriber's desire to play an advertisement.
- information or data is received or collected directly by the broadcasting hub 150 rather than from third-party sources. Regardless of the source, the broadcasting hub 150 uses the information in evaluating whether criteria are met for the play of an advertisement.
- a subscriber 130 is also communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 150 . This allows the subscriber 130 to purchase, schedule, and upload an advertising spot using a user interface of the broadcasting hub 150 that is describe in detail below.
- Subscriber 130 may access hub 150 via a connection to Internet 110 .
- the connection to Internet 110 may be any conventional connection that allows access to hub 150 .
- subscriber 130 may access hub 150 using TCP/IP and a conventional dial-up connection over a modem, or a dedicated connection that provides constant access.
- Hub 150 may have a unique HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address, a unique FTP address, or any other addressing scheme that allows subscriber 130 to identify hub 150 .
- HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Subscribers 130 can be advertisers, agencies, stations, or any other entity that interacts with the broadcasting hub 150 . In some embodiments subscribers 130 have an account with the broadcasting hub 150 and are charged a fee for use of the broadcasting hub 150 . In other embodiments, subscribers can access the broadcasting hub 150 free of charge.
- a regional broadcast studio 140 is also communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 150 , such that the broadcasting hub 150 is capable of forwarding an advertisement to the regional broadcast studio 140 for play.
- a subscriber 130 is capable of submitting to the broadcasting hub 150 an advertisement for play along with specific criteria for the play of that advertisement, and the broadcasting hub 150 will forward the advertisement to a regional broadcasting studio 140 for play as appropriate.
- Stations may desire and may be able to isolate themselves from the Internet for a myriad of reasons.
- stations may isolate mission critical on-air work stations from the public Internet.
- the present system may enable on-air workstations to connect securely to a data center over the Internet without the on-air workstation being connected directly to the Internet.
- Such a configuration may be achieved by using encryption and secure protocols, including, but not limited to outbound-originating protocols.
- the identification of when a radio advertisement or radio program was broadcast may be achieved. This identification may be performed within the broadcasting hub 150 .
- a data collector may identify verification of broadcast information related to an audio file associated with an advertising campaign or radio program, and may forward that information to networked environment 110 .
- Hub 150 may include software for tabulating and formatting the information into a serviceable report, such as in response to a request by subscriber 130 .
- the information in, for example, such a report may be presented based on many different criteria, such as, for example, the total number of advertising or programming broadcasts per campaign, a listing of which stations the radio advertisement or program was broadcast over, an hourly breakdown of the broadcasts, the demographics of the broadcast audience, the geography of the broadcast audience, and/or the format of the radio stations.
- the reports available to subscriber 130 may reflect the latest information available.
- the verification of broadcast information may be forwarded from the data collector to networked environment 110 , such as when the verification of broadcast information becomes available from broadcast hub 150 .
- Such a substantially real-time report may provide subscriber 130 with substantially real-time data regarding the delivery of radio advertisements and radio programs.
- a substantially real-time report may provide subscriber 130 with real-time data regarding the delivery of advertisements or other media plays over VoIP, Internet streaming, or other media.
- the verification of broadcast information associated with advertising campaigns or programs may be combined with other information, and may be stored in additional databases or memories either resident on or accessible by network 110 , to produce reports of demographic information about the audience of the advertising campaign or program.
- Such other information for combination with the verification information may be obtained, for example, from relevant Internet or intranet sites, either automatically in response to an instruction included with the submission of the program to be broadcast, or manually upon receipt of a subscriber request.
- FIG. 2 shows a system according to an aspect of the present invention.
- Subscriber 130 may conduct one or more advertising campaigns by purchasing audio advertisements across several local and regional radio stations, for example.
- Subscriber 130 may distribute audio commercials to the radio stations for scheduling by a regional broadcast studio 140 .
- Subscriber 130 may verify the delivery and track the broadcast of each of the one or more advertising campaigns and associated audio commercials. It may be beneficial for subscriber 130 to engineer the one or more advertising campaigns with a unique and corresponding file name.
- each audio commercial digital file may have a subscriber—associated unique file name.
- the audio files associated with the advertising campaigns are referred to in this discussion as “campaign creative.”
- Regional broadcast studio 140 may broadcast a campaign creative for subscriber 130 .
- Regional broadcast studio 140 may initiate a broadcast of the campaign creative by scheduling broadcast delivery within its trafficking system 210 or programming system 220 .
- the campaign creative may be loaded onto radio automation software 230 of station 140 .
- Radio automation software 230 may include the scheduling and/or “flight” information as provided by trafficking system 210 and programming system 220 .
- Broadcast hub 150 may forward scheduling information regarding the campaign creative, captured from radio automation software 230 , to data collector.
- radio automation software 230 may stream the campaign creative to a station transmitter 160 for subsequent broadcast over the air.
- Broadcast hub 150 may forward verification of broadcast information regarding the campaign creative, captured from radio automation software 230 , to data collector.
- the data collector may accumulate and/or store the information passed from broadcast hub 150 .
- data collector may isolate the verification of broadcast information related to campaign identifiers, for example, by including a table identifying the campaign identifiers.
- the data collector may forward that verification of broadcast information (“campaign information”) to hub 150 .
- the data collector may forward the campaign information as it arrives, or on a timed basis, such as in fifteen minute increments, one-hour increments, several-hour increments, or other increment known to those skilled in the pertinent arts.
- the rate at which the campaign information is passed from the data collector to hub 150 may limit how current, or real-time, a report may be.
- the data collector may be configured to provide the campaign information to hub 150 in real-time, such as not later than a few hours after the campaign information becomes available at the data collector.
- a portion of hub 150 may include a web server that receives the verification of broadcast information associated with each campaign identifier (the campaign information) from the data collector and stores that information on a permanent storage medium, such as a hard disk drive.
- the web server may tabulate the campaign information based on each campaign identifier.
- the table containing the campaign information may be as current as the rate at which the data collector provides the campaign information to the web server. Consequently, hub 150 via the web server may be able to generate reports of the broadcast of radio advertisements and radio programming in substantially real-time.
- Hub 150 may provide access to the tabulated data over Internet 110 .
- Internet 110 may be described as a wide area network for making the reports available to subscribers, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system and method of the present invention encompasses any wide area network that allows access by subscribers to data stored on hub 150 .
- Hub 150 may include server software, such as within a web server, that may allow subscriber 130 to request a report of a particular radio advertisement broadcast or radio program broadcast at any time. For example, subscriber 130 may connect to Internet 110 in the middle of the day on a Tuesday. At that time, subscriber 130 may log on to hub 150 using a secure access protocol and issue a request to the web server to provide a report. The issued request identifies the particular radio advertisement or radio program of interest by campaign identifier. Hub 150 may respond to the request by reading the data stored in the table of campaign information associated with the campaign identifier provided by subscriber 130 . Software resident on the web server may tabulate the report in accordance with the request. Finally, the web server publishes, such as in HTML or XML format, for example, the report to subscriber 130 . In this manner, subscriber 130 may access and query the web server as frequently as desired to determine the broadcast of a particular advertising campaign or radio program.
- server software such as within a web server, that may allow subscriber 130 to request a report of
- Hub 150 and the web server may be configured to transmit reports to subscriber 130 at predetermined intervals, such as immediately, hourly, daily, weekly, or other time frame.
- software may be configured to simulate a subscriber request and cause the web server to generate and transmit the report to subscriber 130 .
- Alternative means of delivery may also be employed, such as via electronic mail.
- Hub 150 and the web server may be configured to generate the report in response to a triggering event.
- a triggering event may be a confirmation of broadcast for a select advertisement or program, or of a situation wherein an advertisement or program was scheduled to broadcast, but failed to deliver, or of an advertising campaign reaching a dollar cap value, for example.
- the web server may be configured to analyze the campaign information as it is received from the data collector. If the campaign information reflects that an advertisement with a specified campaign identifier was scheduled to broadcast at a certain time, but failed to broadcast, the web server may respond by issuing a flag to subscriber 130 .
- the web server may be configured to extract from the campaign information the advertising client's telephone number, email, fax, or the like associated with the campaign identifier and transmit the broadcast information directly to subscriber 130 or someone associated with the subscriber, such as to follow up on the failed broadcast.
- the campaign information may be transmitted by digital or voice pager, by e-mail message, by human interaction, or by any other mechanism for alerting subscriber 130 . In that manner, subscriber 130 may be substantially immediately notified that an advertisement failed to broadcast, and be provided with the radio station's contact information and advertising client information.
- a myriad of reports can be created.
- reports may include campaign delivery by station, campaign delivery by market, campaign delivery by date, campaign delivery by hour, broadcast failure, and demographic reports.
- a campaign delivery by station report may identify upon which station a selected radio advertisement or radio program was broadcast. This report may enable subscriber 130 to verify delivery across a certain station, or within an associated geographic region.
- a campaign delivery by market report may identify the geographic market across which the campaign was broadcast. This report may enable subscriber 130 to verify delivery and coverage within a certain market.
- a campaign delivery by date report may provide subscriber 130 with per-day totals of broadcasts associated with a specified campaign. Subscriber 130 may use this type of report to easily identify those days with the heaviest advertising and programming response, such as for support planning purposes.
- a campaign delivery by hour report may provide subscriber 130 with per-hour totals of broadcasts associated with a specified campaign. Subscriber 130 may use this type of report to identify those dayparts with the heaviest advertising and programming response for support planning purposes.
- a broadcast failure report may provide subscriber 130 with a listing of the campaigns that were scheduled but failed to broadcast. This information allows subscriber 130 to attempt to manage sales support, and take action to remedy failure.
- a demographic report may be provided. For example, the advertising campaign, broadcast across a specific market, may be mapped to area code or zip code to provide subscriber 130 with a broad overview of geographic locations of the receiving broadcast audience. Additional databases, such as those available from Census information, may be employed to generate financial, ethnic, and age-related demographic information which may be of use to subscriber 130 .
- Networking models may be designed to minimize the impact on existing network configurations.
- two prevalent radio automation systems found in the industry are Scott Studios and Maestro. Connection to each of these legacy systems without necessitating the redesign of either system may be beneficial.
- Any networking model may be used, such as a local proxy or local connection, for example.
- Connecting using a local proxy need not require Internet connectivity, and instead may require only connection to a local area network (LAN).
- LAN local area network
- One computer on the LAN may have two network cards, one of which communicates with the local proxy which in turn communicates with the data center via an encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating connection.
- a direct connection may require on-air workstations to have Internet connectivity and may provide an outbound-originating connection to the data center.
- a local proxy may provide an encrypted/unencrypted connection to the data center and a reduction in the overall network traffic.
- Local proxy may use the Scott Studios and Maestro along with the local proxy to create an encrypted/unencrypted and secure connection to the data center.
- Scott Studios or Maestro may be present on each of the on-air automation workstations along with a local proxy module within the network.
- the modules may rely on the station to have a dedicated internal automation system LAN and a separate corporate LAN with Internet connectivity. There may also be one machine that is multi-homed, meaning it has two network cards and is aware of both networks.
- the multi-homed machine is usually a dispatch computer or a server.
- This configuration has been and continues to be a hardware deployment by Scott Studios with both modules and hardware/network configuration in place, the Scott Studios and Maestro will automatically attempt to connect to the local proxy.
- Local proxy may, in turn, attempt to establish an encrypted/unencrypted connection with the data center.
- Local proxy may be designed to make use of the default network settings of the multi-homed machine for both the automation system LAN and the corporate LAN. Therefore, these network settings may remain largely unchanged. Additionally, the local proxy need not rely on a host name to connect to the data center but rather uses an IP address; therefore no DNS configuration should be necessary.
- Local proxy network settings may be modified if any of the default settings have been changed to block outbound Internet traffic from the multi-homed machine over the corporate LAN or if inbound traffic from the automation system LAN has been blocked to the multi-homed computer. If these defaults have been modified, additional changes may be needed, such as: the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 443 (HTTPS), for example; the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 10 , 000 , for example; the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 80 , for example; on-air workstations connecting outbound over the internal automation system LAN to the multi-homed computer, such as on port 10 , 000 , for example; multi-homed computer accepting inbound traffic from the internal automation system LAN, such as on port 10 , 000 , for example.
- HTTPS HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
- local proxy module may use specific ports to direct encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating traffic over the Internet. For example, ports 443 (HTTPS) and 10 , 000 may be used for transmitting encrypted/unencrypted station information and module control traffic. Selection between these ports may be optimized to preserve system resources. Port 80 may be used for downloading unencrypted media files from the data center. After configuring a station's network, the on-air automation workstations may connect to the data center through the local proxy module automatically.
- HTTPS HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
- direct connection may be used for stations and station clusters that do not follow the automation system hardware deployment recommended for Scott Studios and Maestro equipment, stations that already have Internet connectivity at each on-air workstation, or for stations that either cannot or choose not to deploy the local proxy model.
- Direct connection may use the Scott Studios and Maestro Modules on each on-air work station to create a secure connection to the data center.
- each on-air automation workstation may have access to a network with a direct connection to the Internet. With the proper communication modules installed and an Internet connection present, the modules may automatically attempt to connect out to the data center.
- Direct connection may be designed to make use of the default network settings of the on-air workstations and instead of relying on host names to connect to the data center may use an IP address. As would be evident to those possessing an ordinary skill in the pertinent arts, using an IP address may prevent the need for a DNS configuration.
- On-air workstations may connect outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 10 , 000 , for example.
- On-air workstations may connect outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 80 , for example.
- Direct connection may use these specific ports to direct encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating traffic over the Internet. For example, HTTP traffic may be sent on port 80 and may be used for transmitting station information and for downloading media files from the data center. Port 10 , 000 may be used for transmitting communications information.
- the on-air automation workstations may connect directly to the data center automatically.
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of an advertising buying environment in the present invention.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a local, a national, and a network advertising buyer.
- the local buyer buys individual ads on particular stations.
- the national buyer can pinpoint specific buys within a particular group of affiliate radio stations. Alternatively, a national buyer can directly or indirectly contact individual stations to do multiple local buys where the buys are not within a particular group.
- the network buyer buys advertising for all affiliates within a network, such as in a radio syndication show environment.
- an advertising buyer buys an insertion order, and the advertiser request correspondent to the purchase order goes into “traffic”. Radio traffic is scheduled by the trafficking system 210 .
- the trafficking system 210 may schedule the play of a particular ad in three slots at three assigned times each day during the weekdays of Monday through Friday. Obviously, once advertising inventory builds, conflicts arise between advertising requests, particularly during rush hour or high desirability playtimes.
- the trafficking system 210 shuffles the requested advertising to maximize the revenue generated from particular ads at particular times (of course, advertising at premium times and on premium days brings premium revenue).
- the trafficking system 210 compiles a list of items to be played, wherein each item on the list is assigned a cut number that links the plays on the list together.
- a text file consisting of the traffic log is manually reconciled at least once per day.
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of a radio play environment 600 .
- the environment of FIG. 6 includes a traffic log 660 such as that discussed above, a program log 662 , a merge application 664 , an automation for play 666 , a master schedule 668 , a play log 669 , and may include remote applications, including external inputs 620 such as voice tracking, satellite, and FTP, for example.
- the traffic log 660 , the program log 662 , and the master schedule 668 as illustrated preferably include identifications of the plays that are to occur in accordance with each.
- the traffic log 660 is such as that handled by the trafficking system 210 as discussed hereinabove.
- the program log 662 may include programs, such as songs, that are to be played over the air.
- the master schedule 668 may include a validation of the media to be played, such as verification that the identification numbers included in the traffic log 660 and program log 662 are valid play items.
- the merge application 664 merges the traffic log 660 and the program log 662 and manages the filling of any holes, such as by the automation 666 , to create the master schedule 668 .
- the master schedule 668 is directed to the automation 666 , and the automation 666 monitors the inputs and outputs to and from the radio station for play over airwaves.
- the play log 669 is generated based on the output of the automation as that output is generated over the airwaves. The output of the play log 669 may be monitored before billing to advertisers to ensure that ads have properly been played by the automation 666 .
- the automation 666 controls the final output over the airwaves of a radio play.
- the automation 666 may switch for example from a satellite channel to a local channel, or to an Internet channel, and back again to obtain play from various locations for incorporation into the automation 666 play.
- Such plays, as received by the automation 666 may include a metadata channel that does not include the radio plays, but rather includes information regarding the radio plays in the traffic log.
- a metadata channel may infer that a remote radio feed is about to have a “hard break” or a “soft break”.
- a soft break is one which is at the option of, for example, a radio personality, and a hard break is non-optional.
- a syndicated radio show may arrive for local play in the form of a compact disc, or may arrive by a satellite to the automation and may include a metadata channel including the information regarding the satellite play. Consequently, in an embodiment wherein the play originates from a remote point, the metadata channel may allow for a local station to insert particular items for an otherwise remotely generated play.
- the automation 666 may switch back to the local play generation point for a limited set time, during which the local play point may generate local play items into the otherwise remotely generated play.
- the automation 666 may switch back to, for example, the satellite channel for a renewal of the remote play.
- all plays, from all locations are controlled by the automation 666 , and further, the automation 666 provides validation, via the play log 669 , that all plays have properly occurred.
- the traffic log 660 fed to the automation 666 may include one or more “dummy” files.
- Such “dummy” file positions can include the place holders that allow for mapping of information, such as mapping of remote information over the Internet and/or via FTP.
- Such a mapping may include the bundling of remote files and/or local files into a mapped position.
- Such mapped positions are not held as open, but rather are held as closed play positions in spite of the fact that it is unknown to the local automation 666 precisely what plays will occur in the position of the “dummy” file.
- ads may be inserted via channel switching instructions fed over one or more metadata channels.
- a plurality of regional ads each dedicated to specific one or more regions of the country, may be simultaneously playing on a series of channels incoming to the automation 666 , such as channels 4 through 8 .
- a syndicated radio program may be playing simultaneously on, for example, channel 3 incoming to the automation 666 .
- the metadata channel may include instructions for each region to switch during the break to its correspondent incoming regionalized advertising channel. For example, a station playing the syndicated program on channel 3 in Philadelphia, Pa.
- a station in Los Angeles, Calif. may be instructed, via the metadata, to switch to channel 8 in order to play regionalized advertising for that region then playing on channel 8 .
- all stations then participating in a syndicated play of channel 3 are instructed via the metadata to have the automation 666 switch back to channel 3 for continuation of the syndicated play.
- advertising may be cashed on a particular channel to play in a particular order, and, when a break occurs on the channel then playing, a switch may be made to the cashed advertising channel to allow for whatever numbers of cashed ads to play that are capable of play during an allotted break window on the play channel.
- the automation 666 may be instructed to switch from a cashed advertising channel back to the play channel, and may pick up on the next switch to the advertising channel with the next keyed cashed advertisement.
- metadata may be shipped on a particular channel, and programming may be shipped on a plurality of other channels.
- the metadata channel may be keyed to the play occurring on another channel and the metadata itself may call for insertion of data on the metadata channel or another channel onto the current play channel when a break, such as a soft break, occurs according to the metadata channel.
- a local feed may, for example, insert local advertising onto the current play channel, such as via switching to a local channel for the duration of the break according to the metadata channel.
- Switching of the automation 666 in accordance with the switching policies described hereinabove allows for a preemption of a radio play.
- a break is called for at a particular time, such as at noon on a Friday, the channel on which the break is to occur must be continuously monitored, and the metadata of the channel on which the break is to occur must be continuously monitored, to ensure that the break occurs at the prescribed time.
- a monitoring of, for example, channels such as the metadata channel may occur in real time, and as such assigned time plays, particularly of advertising or information spots, are no longer necessary.
- a monitoring of the metadata channel even during a play incoming remotely on a separate channel, provides sufficient information to switch to an advertising or alternative play channel in accordance with the incoming metadata.
- the knowledge of the occurrence of a break must be pre-existent, and any movement of that break must be monitored.
- no pre-existent knowledge of breaks is necessary.
- the system of the present invention learns and gains knowledge of when preemption is to occur, and elects the proper preemption in real time based on the break then occurring as it occurs during the play.
- traditional methods and systems merely insert at a defined time, while in some embodiments, the system described herein preempts in real time based on learning from the programming as it is playing.
- the present invention may include a learning module and a preemption module, which modules may be placed at any of a plurality of points within the radio play system discussed hereinabove.
- the modules may be placed at the traffic log 660 , at the master schedule 668 , at the merge application 664 , or at the automation 666 .
- the modules can be used to replace unsold or underpaid advertising spots with more lucrative advertising spots, the operation of a rule set from within the modules can be available at the point of placement of the modules.
- modules may be placed within the traffic log 660 or master schedule 668 , advertising payment rate data is not typically available at either location, and cannot be used to operate at either location without being affected by the merge 664 . Further, placement of the modules at the merge 664 might allow the rules of the merge 664 to replace certain unsold or otherwise empty play spots with songs, or other information, thus eliminating the ability of the modules to replace the unsold or otherwise empty spots with more lucrative advertising. Consequently, it may be highly useful to place the modules within or in association with the automation 666 , in order to allow the automation 666 to follow a series of metadata rules on the replacement and reevaluation of a merged traffic log.
- Modules placed within the automation 666 may allow for a remote viewing of the real time automated play, in order to allow for real time reevaluation of the current play, and a comparison of the evaluation of the current play with a locally or remotely located rate and rate time chart, and for modification or replacement, via preemption, of information in the real time play list.
- Such preemptions may be based on cost rules or other rules applied through the add-in module or modules to the automation 666 .
- the modules may preferably have available a secondary feed showing real time output data of the plays occurring on a radio location then being monitored by the modules.
- the modules may estimate a proper play location for preemption, and may then monitor to ensure that the preemption location receives preemption at the proper point.
- This secondary feed showing real time plays may be received from a variety of locations.
- the play log 669 may be monitored in real time to assess the plays then occurring.
- the play log 669 may be subject to certain delays or flaws, and as such may not give a true illustration of real time plays.
- the modules may view, from within the automation 666 itself, real time play inventory requests as they occur.
- the automation 666 may call a particular play from a given location at a given time and that location and time may be viewed by the modules and compared with the play list in order to assess, precisely and in real time, the comparison of the play list with the play then occurring, and any preemptions may be modified according to any delays or improprieties assessed.
- the merge 664 may eliminate much of any available unsold or empty play slots, it may be preferable to insert the modules at the merge 664 , rather than waiting for the automation 666 to occur.
- the merge 664 would still require availability of, among other things, rate listings and the rates of currently assigned plays.
- play does not occur from the merge 664 but rather occurs from the automation 666 , a built-in delay would need to be assessed from the automation 666 back to the merge 664 , in order to allow a real time monitoring of inventory requests at the automation 666 to be applied to the modules performing preemption back at the merge 664 .
- the modules, whether at the merge 664 or at the automation 666 may be subject to any number of local or remote rules.
- the availability of such rules at the merge 664 may allow for the variation of preemption rates at the merge 664 , thereby allowing the merge 664 to vary the amount of unsold or empty slots filled by the merge 664 , such as by dependence on the time or day. For example, it may be more cost effective to a given station to fill more unsold or empty slots during rush hour than during the remainder of the day, because rush hour may bring higher premium rates from advertisers. As such, the amount of unsold or empty slots desired to be filled during rush hour at the merge 664 may be higher from the radio station viewpoint, or may be lower from an advertiser's viewpoint, based on the controller of the modules performing preemption at the merge 664 .
- FIG. 7 illustrates an embodiment of media play capabilities, wherein the media played is varied based on the status of certain external factors as provided by information input to the hub 750 , and/or based on the actions of one or more receivers of media that was played.
- the terms “radio content” and “broadcast” or “broadcast content” include any type of media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the output, and that is presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play.
- nonradio content or “nonbroadcast” or “broadcast nonspecific content” include any media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the content, for example via a media feed, and that is not presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play.
- media feed includes any transmission of any media to one or more receivers of the media, including but not limited to terrestrial or satellite radio broadcasts; voice over IP; Internet streaming; podcasts, webpages; video games with a communication connection, such as console, online and handheld video games; video players with a communication connection; and mobile phones.
- the term “media play” refers to the audio, visual or computerized output transmitted in the media feed.
- a hub 750 can also access a variety of content 770 , including nonradio and radio content.
- content 770 may be local to the hub 750 , or may be available to the hub 750 from any of a variety of sources, including but not limited to intranet, Internet, satellite channel, FTP or zipped files that may be accessed by the hub 750 in accordance with one or more commands associated with the hub 750 directing media play 772 .
- the hub 750 may have multiple portions. More specifically, the hub 750 may be any number of modules resident at any number of locations, so long as all such locations are accessible by at least one module resident at the location from which the media play 772 is to occur.
- the hub 750 can also access a plurality of secondary information 774 , certain of which information 774 may be available in real time.
- the information 774 may be relevant to criteria for the play of certain advertisements, and may be data from a third-party data source 120 , for example.
- the information 774 comprises current weather conditions, weather forecasts, temperature, pollen counts, precipitation, current events, sports scores, broadcast topics/radio guests, terror-alert color, traffic conditions, stock market data, interest rates, gas prices, or other financial indicators, or any other information 774 available to the hub 750 that is relevant to deciding when listeners 773 would be most receptive to a media play message and most likely to undertake a targeted response 777 . Examples of the use of this information 774 in scheduling advertisements are described herein below with reference to the user interface.
- the hub 750 can access a play list 776 for at least one radio studio in at least one marketing region. Multiple radio stations may be available to a single hub 750 , and a marketing region may be any geographic region including but not limited to a city, a county, or state, for example.
- the hub 750 may, in part, direct the play list 776 of the one or more radio stations, such as by preempting that which was to be played by the radio station in accordance with the play list 776 with an intelligent insertion that is more likely to bring success in accordance with the predetermined criteria than would the preempted play on the play list 776 .
- the play list 776 of a radio station may generally include advertising plays and music plays.
- listenership generally decreases when ads begin to play and increases during a continuous music play on a radio station. There are exceptions, such as wherein listenership falls for a radio station during play of an unpopular song, for example. Further, listenership even during advertising may not fall if the advertising is popular, such as wherein the advertisement is amusing or of significant interest to listeners.
- Information about listeners 773 can be used as feedback 778 to the hub 750 , such as real time monitoring of numbers of listeners 773 to one or more stations. For example, as is known to those skilled in the art, vehicles can be monitored at a heavy intersection to determine the station to which they are tuned.
- the hub 750 may modify the radio station play list 776 in real time according to certain predetermined criteria. For example, if listenership of the particular radio station begins to fall, the hub 750 may preempt certain advertising that was to play with popular music. Consequently, listenership for that radio station will rise.
- an advertiser may desire to have an advertisement run only when listenership is above 100,000, regardless of the time of day.
- the hub 750 may modify the radio station play list 776 in real time to intelligently preempt music play, for example, once the 100,000 listener threshold set by the advertiser has been met or exceeded.
- the hub 750 may return to music play or continue with running advertisements.
- Various criteria for the play of advertisements can be set, and examples will be described below in the context of the user interface for scheduling a media buy.
- the hub may also limit certain content to control the price of advertising by, for example, playing only a limited amount of the most popular music in a given time period.
- advertising rates may be set according to actual listenership either measured in real time or estimated based on broadcast content.
- Listeners 773 to a radio station may respond to certain advertising by undertaking the activity advised by the advertisement, such as by stopping for food at a food establishment, shopping at a particular retail establishment, using an advertised coupon, visiting an advertised website for more information, calling a particular customer service number, and the like.
- the activity advised or encouraged by the advertisement is known as the targeted response 777 . Measures of this targeted response 777 assist the advertiser in assessing the efficacy of the advertisement.
- the targeted response 777 may vary significantly based on the circumstances of the advertisement placement. Advertisers desire to play advertisements when it is perceived or known that the greatest targeted response 777 will be achieved. Techniques in accordance with the present invention for observing the targeted response 777 are described herein below.
- Measures of the targeted response 777 may be collected and provided to the hub 750 to inform whether a given campaign creative should be played again, or alternatively, which campaign creative among two or more alternatives should be played. As such, subsequent media plays 772 may be varied in accordance with the success or failure of proceeding radio plays.
- a variety of techniques can be used for observing the targeted response 777 . These techniques include but are not limited to tracking phone calls, coupon usage, SMS coupons, website hits, and sales. In various embodiments, these techniques can be used separately or in combination with each other to observe the targeted response 777 , and ultimately the efficacy of a campaign.
- a campaign creative provides a particular phone number to call to obtain more information about an advertised product or service.
- the number of phone calls is tracked directly by the call center.
- phone calls to a phone number are routed through a tracking module that registers incoming calls, for example by tracking caller ID information to determine the location of the caller, to one or more numbers before routing the calls to a call center.
- calls to one number routed through a tracking module can be correlated to the advertisement played most recently in the caller's geographic market. Over time, the effectiveness of advertisements played in prompting listeners to call can be measured for various creatives, at various times, in various markets.
- more than one phone number is used to measure the number of calls in response to one creative compared to the number of calls in response to another creative that advertises a different phone number.
- the number of calls in response to the play of one creative on one station can be compared to the number of calls in response to the play of that creative on a different station merely by advertising different phone numbers for each.
- targeted response 777 can be tracked by tracking coupon usage.
- Different coupon codes can be advertised in each creative played or each station can play an advertisement having a different coupon code.
- the seller is able to track by which advertisement the customer was influenced.
- the coupon code can be sent back to listeners who respond to an advertisement in SMS format, and the coupon code can be unique on a customer by customer basis and/or can be correlated to a particular play of an advertisement.
- the coupon code is used at a point of sale, whether it be at a website, through a call center, or at a store, the sale can be matched to the inquiry and/or ultimately to the played advertisement.
- the number of website hits that a particular site receives can be tracked and correlated to media plays.
- advertisers can use different web addresses to measure the relative effectiveness of two or more advertisements.
- the IP addresses of computer visitors can be used to determine the geographic location of those that access an advertised website.
- advertisers can track sales figures for advertised goods, services, businesses, or the like. They can then correlate sales numbers with campaign creatives played, for example, on a temporal basis or on a geographic market basis. For example, data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in one geographical area can be compared to data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in another geographical area. Alternatively, data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in the days following the play of one campaign creative can be compared to data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in the days following the play of a different campaign creative. However the targeted response 777 is measured, the data collected can be used as a feedback to the hub 750 to inform which creative within a campaign are most effective.
- intelligent insertion may be performed in any media play context, including any audio source into a media feed.
- insertion may be made in a radio station or streaming Internet radio context, a cellular telephone context, in a Voice over IP (VOIP) context, an SMS context, a WiMax context, a downloadable audio file context such as for iPods or other MP3 players, videogame systems, or the like.
- the media play insertion may include a song, a message, a news, traffic, sports, or weather update, one or more coupons, or an instant message, for example.
- FIG. 8 shows a schematic diagram of the flow of information within the communication system of FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- FIG. 8 shows information flow 300 , which includes two principle regions, Radio Automation Software (“RAS”) 230 and workflow 310 .
- RAS 230 may include schedule file 320 and audio file 330 .
- Workflow 310 may include audio advertisement files 340 , publisher 350 , and master controller 360 . The flow of information will be described with reference to the numerals labeling the arrows representing the flow of information.
- RAS 230 may include a flow of information for a new schedule file 1 .
- New schedule file may originate with schedule file 320 and be transmitted to a first chain agent 370 . This transmission may occur by an external software that publishes a new schedule file to the RAS 230 file system.
- a first chain agent 370 via a directory watcher process, detects new schedule file 320 , and reads it off of disk.
- This new schedule file 320 may originate or be taken from several systems within the radio station and or from a location outside the studio itself (in the case of remote network programming).
- schedule file 320 may be created while remaining unpublished to RAS 230 .
- the filling methods may be local, and the rules for filling the inventory may not be dynamic nor take into consideration a revenue maximization function. For example, 3rd party groups today will “buy” unsold inventory in advance and give the station 1 -N ads, that the station can “fill” unsold inventory. The station in this case is selling unsolds in advance without a guaranteed schedule.
- First chain agent 370 residing in RAS 230 may pass information to a workflow 310 .
- This retrieval of a new schedule file 320 may be seen in FIG. 8 as link 4 .
- This information may be passed to a parse and store step located within workflow 310 .
- the RAS chain agent 370 reads schedule file 320 , the file may be transmitted to workflow 310 .
- the dD preemptable ad avails (dD Avails) may be parsed from schedule file 320 and stored for further processing.
- the original schedule file 320 may be stored for billing, accounting, and auditing purposes. This parsing and storing, shown and described to occur within workflow 310 , may be achieved at studio 140 .
- the information is transmitted to the Inventory Management System (“IMS”) where the campaign is assigned to schedule file 320 .
- IMS Inventory Management System
- This transmission is shown by label 5 and may occur within workflow 310 .
- the central location which tracks ad effectiveness, may publish results to each station and the local station software may use this information to make “intelligent” insertion over unsold inventory.
- the available ads may need to be published or delivered to station 140 and station 140 may need to receive performance data on those campaigns, so that the local engine may make decisions.
- a validator checks for possible scheduling errors.
- the transmission of information to the validator is shown by label 6 .
- the validator may input this information and analyze schedule file 320 for errors in tag structure, frequency of tags, station contractual obligations, such as minimum number of spots per period, and other errors known to those possessing an ordinary skill in the pertinent arts.
- This validation while shown to occur within workflow 310 , may occur local to hub 150 .
- the validator may output information to IMS on whether the schedule file 320 is validated. This validity feedback is shown by label 23 .
- IMS may process the new dD Avails, by assigning dD advertisements and specific creative to specific dD Avails. This IMS, while shown to occur within workflow 310 , may occur local to hub 150 .
- dD Avails are specific to each station. This creation, while shown to occur within workflow 310 , may occur local to hub 150 .
- the master controller 360 may operate as the brains behind “trafficking” the unsold spots slated for preemption within the dB schedule file.
- the master controller 360 receives the song feed, including ads, as to what is being played currently on a station.
- the master controller 360 uses this feed to determine where in the current schedule file a station is.
- the master controller 360 manages the replacement of the ads, and the swapping back of the original ad, once the spot has run.
- the master controller 360 while shown to occur within workflow 310 , may occur local to hub 150 .
- a feedback system may be created for creating new schedules as shown by labels 8 , 9 , and 2 .
- This transmission path may transfer information from the master controller 360 to the publisher 350 , label 8 , from the publisher 350 to the second chain agent 380 , label 9 , and from the second chain agent 380 to the first chain agent 370 , label 2 .
- master controller 360 instruction to pre-empt a spot
- the master controller 360 interrogates the dB Schedule file for a given station, identifying the names of all of the creative that are scheduled to run, and publishes these creative to the station via the 8-9-2 pathway.
- the chain agent examines a cache of previously stored ads to determine that it has stored all creative.
- the master controller if it determines that a spot is ready to be pre-empted, may send a notification via the 8-9-2 pathway, to instruct the chain agent to swap creative one for creative two.
- the chain agent 370 may confirm receipt of this message via the 2-30 pathway.
- the chain agent may manage the physical preemption process. Instructions to preempt an ad may be delivered via path 18 to audio files 330 .
- the chain agent may preserve the original audio file X by either renaming it or moving it to a different directory on the file system.
- the original file, the dD spot and the slated pre-emption may be copied into a directory of the same file name.
- the header information within the file, used to populate the RAS screen may be different and reflects the actual ad that will run even though the file name is the same.
- the header information may identify what is written to the RAS log files for billing purposes and the station may be aware that the preemption occurred. Once this preemption has been completed or failed due to some error, status may be published via pathway ( 2 - 30 ).
- the chain agent which may be responsible for sending the song feed, known as the log, of what is actually playing on the station, such as by pathway labeled 22 , may monitor the feed to see the pre-empted spot run. Once it has run, the chain agent may swap the original ad back and notifies the master controller.
- the feedback pathway labeled 2 , 31 may enable the chain agent 370 to determine if the audio file is available.
- the chain agent may request the publisher, via pathway 31 , to send it a specific creative.
- the publisher responds by sending the file along with a checksum to confirm the file was not corrupted in transmission via pathway 9 , 2 .
- the chain agent 370 may also prompt the song feed across pathway 22 .
- the chain agent depending on the RAS configuration, may either watch the log file on the RAS to determine what is being played over the air, or may receive a data feed from the RAS directly containing play history.
- the chain agent may scrub the feed and publish it to workflow 310 .
- the song feed may be exported directly over the WAN to workflow 310 and a local agent may not be required.
- the event ad may be played.
- the information derived hereinabove may be transmitted to the gateway.
- the information may be transmitted to a radio tower across pathway 19 .
- Radio tower broadcasts to an audience across channel 20 .
- workflow 310 traps the caller ID or is notified from the call center, in substantially real time, or on a daily basis, for example.
- New calls may be logged, and the information may be provided to IMS across paths 13 , 12 . As calls are logged, the calls may be tracked against the dB schedule file. Revenues and performance metrics may be tracked given audience size, Arbitron data, and other factors. This information may be used by IMS to optimize ad targeting.
- Campaign performance in addition to being transmitted to IMS, may be transmitted across pathway 14 to a forecaster.
- Forecaster may compare actual performance with predicted performance and revenues.
- the IMS methods may be evaluated based upon the accuracy of the predications.
- the forecaster may project future revenues based on inventory flow and ad campaigns scheduled in the system.
- the forecaster may provide automated notification to station traffic managers that the present invention may result in income.
- a verification may occur.
- the pathway labeled 40 , 42 may demonstrate the availability of verification.
- the master control in addition, may instruct the local chain agent at the station to pre-empt a spot and, responsive to the notification, may notify a digital radio that can receive the broadcast of the station to record the ad scheduled by the master controller, such as by sending a schedule or a real time notification to start/stop recording.
- the audio may be streamed over the WAN and recorded within the workflow 310 environment. Verification may occur across transmission path 41 demonstrating an ad spot recorded off the air. Once the file is recorded, it may be transmitted to workflow 310 to verify. The verify process may compare the audio file recorded to the audio file that was shipped to the station.
- the ad spot may be logged as verified. If no match exists, the file may be routed to a human capable of listening to the original and the recorded file to determine if the spot matches. If no match still exists, further action may be taken. Subscriber 130 may opt to listen to the recorded spots and the original in one of several verification reports. This audio may be streamed over the WAN and recorded within the workflow 310 environment.
- FIG. 9 is an example of an integrated user interface that allows an advertiser to place ads in multiple media from a single initial user interface 900 .
- the advertiser can place ads in a first media, such as online in a web-based venue in connection with search terms entered by potential customers or in connection with website content.
- the user interface 900 initially starts in a mode that allows the advertiser to place ads of a first media type.
- the advertiser must first click on a tab or other type of user interface selector to indicate that he wishes to place ads in the first media.
- the first media is a service that allows advertisers to place ads in connection with displayed search results or website content.
- Example of such a media include Google AdWords or AdSense.
- Google AdWords is a quick and simple way to purchase highly targeted advertisements on a cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) basis.
- AdWords ads are displayed along with search results.
- ads are placed on a search results page when advertiser-specified search terms are entered by a potential customer.
- ads are placed on a search results page when the search results contain a particular site.
- Google AdSense for content automatically, based on the content of a website, delivers ads that are relevant to the audience of the website.
- ads are placed on webpages when advertiser-specified terms related to the ad are also related to the content of those webpages. Thus, ads that are relevant to the content of the webpage are displayed.
- the advertiser has a choice with respect to new ad campaigns.
- a keyword-targeted ad campaign 910 he chooses keywords for which an ad will appear and specify the maximum amount he is willing to pay for each click.
- the advertiser only pays when someone clicks on the ad.
- the advertiser creates a site-targeted ad campaign 912 he chooses the exact sites where an ad will appear and specifies the maximum amount he is willing to pay for each thousand page views on that site. The advertiser pays whenever someone views the ad, whether the viewer clicks on the ad or not.
- the user interface of FIG. 9 allows an advertiser to access a single user interface to place ads in multiple types of media.
- an advertiser can also place ads in a second medium such as a broadcast medium, which includes a radio station or streaming Internet radio context, a cellular telephone context, a Voice over IP (VOIP) context, an SMS context, a WiMax context, a downloadable audio file context such as for iPods or other MP3 players, videogame systems, or the like.
- VOIP Voice over IP
- SMS context a WiMax context

- FIG. 12 is an architecture diagram of an Ad Management System 1200 showing data passing between a data center 1204 and radio stations 1202 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the described embodiment of the Ad Management System is designed to be able to serve ads to several thousand radio stations and several hundred thousand campaigns.
- the present invention is described in particular detail in the context of terrestrial radio environments, it is recognized that the present invention can also be used in, for example, satellite radio, Internet streaming, podcasts, cellular telephone, videogames, and other contexts without departing from the principles of embodiments of this invention.
- the radio station's automation software sends the station's play schedule for the following day to Audio Ads. See numerals 1 - 5 in FIG. 12 .
- the play schedule may come at varying times or at regular intervals or periods other than evenings. This schedule will contain the spots that Audio Ads is expected to fill. Audio Ads matches creative to these spots and sends the revised schedule back to the radio station, to be played by the station's automation software. See numerals 6 - 9 in FIG. 12 .
- the station's automation software Audio Ads the actual schedule from the prior period or day, which can be compared against the expected schedule to determine if ads actually played. See numerals 10 - 12 of FIG. 12 .
- Audio Ads On-Air Recording system listens to the actual station's broadcast of select stations and through audio fingerprinting techniques verifies that the ads were actually broadcast. See numerals 13 and 14 of FIG. 12 . Play failures are fed back into the Audio Ads system for reporting to advertisers. History has shown that roughly 15% of scheduled spots fail to play, either because of technical failures or because the DJ “talked over” the ad. This problem exists even outside of automation, so the industry has developed a “make good” practice to adjust for play failures, by playing the ad at a later, equivalent time.
- the Ad Management system 1200 supports three models for buying available advertising slots: Guaranteed, reserved based on urgency, and Open (also called Auction).
- Guaranteed campaigns are promised specific spots on a specified station, date, and daypart. In one embodiment, once the campaign books the spots, it will lose the spot only via play failure or if the forecasted inventory is not published by the station, not through preemption from another campaign booked through the system. Guaranteed campaigns can range in length anywhere up to several months in length, and can be booked up to several months in advance. At times, advertisers place value on knowing that a particular spot will run at a particular time.
- Guaranteed campaigns are not simply an inventory reservation, however, because of the way that the advertisers specify their campaigns. For example, they may not specify which stations and times to play on, instead they provide targeting criteria, such as the number of listeners, listener demographics, the times of day to run, the markets play in, and so forth. Audio Ads then compares those criteria against the available inventory and presents a proposal for meeting those criteria.
- guaranteed campaigns specify a maximum CPM to pay. Each guaranteed campaign takes as much inventory as it needs to satisfy its campaign goals while keeping within its spending limits and other user-specified criteria. If the advertiser is happy with the station and time mix then they approve the campaign and Audio Ads books it. Specifying campaign goals, viewing the proposal, and finalizing or booking the campaign are all done online through the Audio Ads front end.
- the system should take no more than a few seconds (say, 10 seconds) to prepare a proposal once the criteria have been specified.
- the user must review the proposal and can book it within a few minutes. If the user waits too long to book the proposal, in one implementation, a new proposal will be generated to prevent staleness of the proposal in light of inventory changes.
- campaigns can reserve inventory as in the guaranteed model. However, campaigns with a higher urgency take precedence over campaigns with lower urgency.
- spots are presented to the campaign with the highest “urgency”. Each spot is auctioned off in turn.
- urgency is defined as being first in time to book, with one approach simply assigning earlier-booked campaigns the highest urgency.
- Open campaigns play on inventory that has not been filled by guaranteed campaigns and can be preempted by guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns are booked according to desired demographics and market criteria and the maximum CPM the advertiser is willing to pay. In one implementation, inventory spots not filled by guaranteed campaigns are filled with open campaigns at the last moment. In one embodiment, a system administrator can set a percentage inventory to set aside for open campaigns that will not be sold to guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns compete among themselves for spots, with the “highest bidder” winning. The “bid” from an open campaign can be based on how well a spot meets the campaign goals in addition to the CPM. Every campaign determines what the spot is worth in terms of the campaign's goals.
- each campaign evaluates each spot according to the relevant target demographic information for the campaign and adjusts the bid according to the campaign goals based on other criteria, such as time of day, market, etc.
- the auction process for open campaigns can be run at various intervals, for example, hourly, several times a day, once a day, or at other intervals.
- Audio Ads often only receives the precise schedule, for example, one day in advance but spots can be sold months in advance, it is possible that spots will be sold to a guaranteed campaign that ends up not being made available. Ads also may fail to play because of play failures. Audio Ads addresses the first issue by forecast inventory, though the forecasting may not be precise. The second issue is addressed after the fact. Since it is a goal of the system to meet 100% of the guaranteed campaign requirements, Audio Ads monitors guaranteed campaigns in progress and adds additional “make good” spots whenever spots are lost or fail to play. In one embodiment the user can enable or disable make goods.
- the Audio Ads Inventory Management System (IMS) 1300 is responsible for matching advertising campaigns to available advertising spots on the radio stations or other broadcast technologies serviced.
- Campaigns are usually specified as a set of constraints or criteria that the campaign must meet, such as markets the ad will play in, demographics it should reach, the number of listeners who should hear it, and the times of the day (dayparts) during which it should run.
- Radio stations typically publish the available spots one day in advance. In one embodiment, this inventory is then matched to the campaigns to satisfy the maximum number of campaigns. Since spots will be more valuable to some campaigns than to others (for example, the demographics of a certain spot may match one campaign but not another), it is desirable to optimize the allocation of spots across multiple campaigns.
- inventory is known just one day in advance, but campaigns generally are booked days, weeks, or months in advance. Campaigns are frequently timed to match external events such as sales or movie releases, so predictability can be important.
- the Audio Ads IMS system 1300 deals with these competing factors by forecasting inventory. Currently, a simple exponential smoothing method is used to forecast inventory many months in advance. In other embodiments, the method accounts for trends or seasonality. Alternatively, different forecasting models are applied on a station by station basis.
- FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing elements in scalable IMS (Inventory Management System) 1300 used to schedule advertisements in a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the system 1300 places radio ads on select radio stations, matching advertiser campaigns and creatives with available advertising spots on radio stations.
- the External Interface 1304 provides external access to the system 1300 through a UI 1302 , examples of which are shown above in FIG. 9 .
- UI 1302 interacts with the rest of system 1300 to create and manage campaigns and for reporting.
- a Station Inventory Manager (SIM) 1314 manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains information about each spot such as whether it is an actual available spot or a forecast spot; whether it is available, reserved, or booked; the priority of the campaign that booked it; when it was booked; who booked it; and so forth.
- a Forecaster 1316 is responsible for updating the inventory based on the radio station schedule. It can provide exact information for upcoming spots or may forecast future spots based on past history.
- a Campaign Manager (CM) 1313 manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play.
- SIMs 1314 record their current allocations to persistent storage.
- a Creative Assigner 1317 assigns creatives to spots (using the allocations produced by the SIMs 1314 ) and produces the final play list.
- Each of the components in the diagram can be implemented as a separate process and could be allocated to its own machine. In other embodiments, however, for efficiency purposes, multiple SIMs will be grouped together in one task, and the Forecaster will be implemented as classes and run within the SIM's JVM (if the SIM is implemented in Java).
- the External Interface provides methods for creating and managing campaigns and for examining inventory. Methods for creating and managing campaigns will be used by the Audio Ads front-end to provide the advertiser user interface. Methods for examining inventory will be used primarily by reporting tools.
- the Station Inventory Manager manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains a list of all known spots for that station and automatically allocates spots to particular campaigns. Since spots are forecasted, it is possible for a campaign to book a spot that later disappears from inventory. Whenever a booked spot is removed from inventory, the Campaign Manager that owns that spot will try to make up the loss.
- Each spot in the inventory has a priority which matches the priority of the campaign that allocated the spot.
- the SIM can allocate unassigned spots or spots with a lower priority than the requesting campaign.
- each campaign has a different view of available inventory that depends on the campaign priority. This feature is intended to allow different campaign types, such as guaranteed campaigns (where specific spots are sold in advance) and open campaigns (where spots can be taken by someone willing to pay more). It also allows urgent, high priority campaigns to take inventory from less important campaigns. If necessary to reduce memory requirements, inventory older than one day may be discarded.
- Spots in the inventory have, among other attributes, a unique identifier, a play date, a play time, a length, an accuracy (actual or forecast), a booking status (available, reserved, or booked), a priority (taken from the priority of the booking campaign), a booking date, and a booking campaign.
- attributes are merely examples. In other embodiments, spots in inventory may have a greater or lesser number of attributes.
- Spots can be reserved on a temporary basis by a campaign so that a potential buy can be displayed to a user for approval. If the spots are not booked within the timeout period they will be returned to inventory in the same state they were in before the reservation. A campaign may only book spots that it has previously reserved. In one implementation, reserved spots cannot be reserved or booked by campaigns at the same or lower priority than the owning campaign.
- Campaigns do not query inventory but instead request to reserve or book inventory. This avoids concurrency issues that would arise if a campaign requests a view of inventory but that inventory is taken by another campaign before the first campaign can reserve it. All reservations and bookings are automatic so that a campaign can be guaranteed that spots that it has booked actually belong to it. Of course, campaigns with a higher priority can still take that inventory from the booking campaign, which will need to book alternate spots to make up for the loss. For reporting and recovery purposes, the SIM will support general queries of existing inventory, but such queries should be infrequent.
- a campaign When a campaign requests spots, it should make a request such as “reserve N spots of this length on this day and in this daypart”.
- the SIM will search its inventory and do the best it can to honor the request while taking into account station rules such as maximum number of spots assigned to a single campaign, no back-to-back spots assigned to a single campaign, and so forth.
- the SIM manages stitching issues by coalescing adjacent shorter spots when possible and by preferentially fulfilling requests with stitched spots. For example, if a SIM has a 60-second spot available, it may assign half of it to a 30-second campaign and then assign the second half to the very next 30-second campaign.
- the reservation is timed so that spots can be restored after the timeout
- the spots are allocated to the booking campaign
- the spot is marked as available
- the spot is returned to its pre-reservation state
- the Campaign Manager manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play.
- a Campaign Manager When a campaign is booked, a Campaign Manager is created for that campaign which then attempts to reserve (and subsequently book) the inventory that will fill the campaign goals. It queries the Metrics Manager 1308 to learn of radio stations, AQH, CPM, etc., and determine which stations it should attempt to buy from. There will be an Inventory Snapshot 1318 available to the Campaign Manager that holds a slightly stale view of inventory. This snapshot can be used to refine the initial inventory request. For example, a campaign may wish to spread its purchases equally across markets and may need to know its chances of getting inventory in specific markets before finalizing the purchases. If any of its purchases are unsuccessful, the Campaign Manager will attempt to buy alternate spots until its goals are met.
- the Campaign Manager will learn of these changes. When inventory is lost the Campaign Manager must attempt to “make good” by buying alternate spots. The Campaign Manager will attempt to buy a spot that is roughly equivalent to the spot that was lost. No other considerations will be taken when buying a “make-good” spot.
- the Campaign Manager does not know the precise state of the inventory when it determines what buys to attempt. It should request N spots from the radio stations in its market within the days and dayparts that meet its criteria, while in one embodiment making a small number of large requests rather than a large number of small requests. Some of those requests will succeed and others will fail or will be only partially fulfilled.
- the Campaign Manager knows the status of all its requests, it will determine if additional buy attempts are needed to meet its goals. It may be possible that, to meet proper market or daypart distribution, a Campaign Manager will want to return spots to inventory. This is allowed if the spots have been reserved but not yet booked, and the returned spots will revert to their prior status. However, this mechanism is expected to be a small fraction of total buys.
- a campaign can be paused, in which case no spots for that campaign will be actually played (unless they have already been queued to the station). The spots will not be returned to inventory unless the campaign is cancelled. If spots from a paused campaign need to be filled, they will be auctioned off by the Auctioneer. When a campaign is resumed it should not lose any of its inventory, except what was auctioned off because its play time has passed. The primary purpose for pausing a campaign would be to temporarily block a campaign because the account holder has not paid its bills. If the account is cancelled, all campaigns for that account should be cancelled; if the account is reactivated, all paused campaigns should be resumed.
- the SIM provides functionality for releasing all inventory belonging to a specific campaign over a range of dates.
- campaign manager 1313 can bid in accordance with a criterion, including an external criterion.
- campaign pricing is currently determined on a campaign-by-campaign basis through negotiation with the advertiser booking the campaign. This is especially true of nationwide campaigns that buy guaranteed spots. In other embodiments, however, pricing is more dynamic and able to be set online or automatically while booking the campaign.
- the Campaign Manager 1313 uses a Pricing Engine to determine the price of spots it buys. The price from the Pricing Engine is passed to the SIM, which uses it to determine which campaigns to prefer when allocating inventory.
- the Pricing Engine associates each spot with a price at which a Campaign Manager can reserve it as part of a guaranteed campaign.
- the pricing set by the engine may vary based on buy type, buyer, and/or other factors.
- the Pricing Engine is part of the Campaign Manager. In other embodiments, the Pricing Engine is a component separate from the CM 1313 .
- the Metrics Manager has the job of maintaining and providing station metrics for all stations supported by IMS 1300 .
- the Campaign Manager can learn all relevant information about potential inventory from the Metrics Manager.
- IMS 1300 also contains a business layer that determines, for example, which stations are online, what is a station's format, and what is a station's market. In other embodiments, these functions are also performed by the Metrics Manager.
- Metrics Manager also tells the Campaign Manager what demographics a station caters to, and what their listener numbers are.
- the Campaign Manager 1313 accesses the Metrics Manager 1308 and business layer 1309 to receive information. For example, the Campaign Manager can request the average listeners as reported by Arbitron for certain dayparts on certain stations. Alternatively, data from other survey or research companies can be used.
- the Campaign Manager can further request from the Metrics Manager 1308 data corresponding only to a specific demographic at which the campaign is targeted.
- the Metrics Manager 1308 holds all its data in a database.
- the Metrics Manager supports various metrics for calculating the value of spots for particular campaigns on alternate research besides Arbitron data.
- the Campaign Manager can indicate which research or metric type to use, and the Metrics Manager finds and normalizes the data before returning the values.
- the Forecaster's primary responsibility is to predict and adjust inventory for a station.
- the Forecaster may run in the same process as the SIM 1314 .
- the Forecaster should recalculate both known and expected inventory for the coming days or periods. This forecast will add new spots to inventory, remove existing spots from inventory, or adjust the play time of existing spots. If inventory is lost, the owning campaign is notified so that it can buy additional, “make-good” inventory. Note that in one embodiment, when determining which spot to eliminate, the spot within the daypart with the lowest priority should be removed.
- Inventory for the immediate future should be known precisely, while inventory further in the future is being predicted.
- the accuracy of the prediction should be marked in the inventory and adjusted as the data becomes more precise. For example, spots for “tomorrow” might be accurate to the minute, while spots for “next month” might be accurate only to a daypart.
- the forecaster also predicts the reliability of the inventory, based on an analysis of prior station performance and the accuracy of the forecast. If a station frequently schedules inventory but then fails to play it, this will be reflected in the reliability. Spot reliability may be used by the campaign buyer to evaluate the quality of the campaign.
- forecaster 1316 uses a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method, which takes into account both trends and seasonality.
- the architecture supports applying different forecasting models on a station by station basis.
- the Forecaster While the actual computation of the forecast is very fast, especially with exponential smoothing methods which can complete their computation with the addition of just a single new number, updating the inventory can be computationally expensive. The reason for this is that the Forecaster must update existing inventory by adding new spots, removing lost spots, or adjusting the play time of existing spots. Therefore, in one embodiment, the Forecaster either maintains its own copy of all existing inventory, or it queries the SIM to learn its inventory. It then calculates deltas from existing inventory to new inventory and applies the changes. For these reasons it is expected that the Forecaster will best be implemented in the same process as the SIM so that expensive, large-payload process-to-process communication is avoided.
- the Play Verifier 1319 examines the play history for each station and determine if spots that were allocated failed to play. The owning Campaign Manager is notified for each failure. In one embodiment, Campaign Managers attempt to make good any play failures.
- creative assigner 1317 can perform copysplitting in accordance with a criterion, such as an external criterion or a criterion based on effectiveness of previous plays.
- the Auctioneer performs an auction on a regular basis when there are spots to be sold to open campaigns that have not be sold to guaranteed campaigns.
- the number of campaigns competing for the spots can potentially be quite large.
- the method for performing the auction is as follows:
- the auction is run on a scheduled basis. Bidding will remain open for a number of minutes determined via configuration, for example about 10 minutes. Open Campaign Managers must examine the schedule and place bids in a timely manner. However, not all campaigns bid at the same time. In one embodiment, Open Campaign Managers will randomize the times at which they will place bids, to reduce peak bandwidth requirements.
- the auction Since the auction is only taking place for unallocated spots within, for example, one single day, the auction is expected to execute quickly.
- Open Campaigns While the above architecture will handle campaigns of all types and requirements, the special requirements of Open Campaigns can cause a rather large flood of inventory grabs and subsequent losses as higher priority campaigns take those spots. Open Campaigns have market and demographics requirements, but they are designed to take only inventory not allocated to guaranteed campaigns.
- an Open Campaign would grab all available inventory in its desired markets, up to its price cap. This can be a large number of spots. Further, current business requirements demand that all Open Campaigns compete fairly for inventory, so as new Open Campaigns book inventory, they must, on a random basis, bump other Open Campaigns from their spots. Finally, Open Campaigns have the lowest priority of all campaigns, so as higher priority campaigns are booked, it is possible that the majority of spots they take will already be owned by an Open Campaign. Therefore, in these cases, a Campaign Manager should be notified.
- Open Campaigns will instead compete in an auction for unallocated spots just prior to the spots being published to the allocation list. It will typically cover all unsold inventory for one single day, but the timeframe can be more or less than one day.
- system 1300 sends more than one ad in the stream to the target (such as a radio station or podcast target). Both ads are initially sent and at a later time, but before either of the ads is played, the system sends an indication of which ad should be played. In another embodiment, both ads are played, but the system 1300 sends an indication of their relative percentage of play time.
- system 1300 sends more than one ad in the stream to the target, such as a radio station or podcast target. Both ads are initially sent and at a later time, but before either of the ads is played, the system 1300 sends an indication of which ad should be played. In another embodiment, both ads are played, but the system 1300 sends an indication of their relative percentage of play time.
- FIG. 14 shows tables used in an embodiment of the invention. These include a campaign table 1402 ; and a campaign events target table 1404 . These events can be feedback based events as described herein.
- FIG. 14 further shows a campaign event target details table 1406 (one for each criterion); a campaign audio targeting table 1408 , an audio targeting timeblocks table 1410 ; a campaign event type table 1412 ; an audio targeting formats table 1414 ; an arb_formats table 1416 ; an audio targeting markets table 1418 ; a timeblocks table 1420 ; and an arb_markets table 1422 .
- the tables supporting use of feedback include the campaign event target details table 1406 , which can occur for each criterion set by the advertiser. These criteria can relate to creative placement (i.e., copysplitting), in which case the system references the campaign audio targeting table 1408 . These criteria can also relate to the campaign and where and when it places ads, in which case, the system references the campaigns table 1402 .
- All campaign events have a campaign event type ID 1412 , which includes a name, description, threshold description, and an upper and lower limit, which are preferably used for error checking. Assume, for example, the advertiser specifies “if the pollen count is above W use a CPM of X and above Y use a CPM of Z. In this example, there would be two instances of an event 1406 : one for a pollen count of W and one for a pollen count of Z. Each event 1406 includes an event type ID 1454 (i.e, pollen count, temperature, sports scores, etc) as discussed above. It also contains a targeting ID 1456 which specifies whether it is related to creatives or campaigns.
- event type ID 1454 i.e, pollen count, temperature, sports scores, etc
- a threshold type flag 1458 which specifies whether the criterion depends on a value being greater than, lesser than, equal to, or some other measurement, as discussed above.
- the threshold type flags would be indicates “greater than.”
- It also contains a threshold value 1460 .
- the values for the first event would be W and for the second event would be Y.
- the table 1406 contains a CPM value 1462 .
- the first event would have a CPM of X and the second event would have a criterion of Z. If the events are campaign based (as in this example), they are used to help schedule campaigns as discussed further below.
- Table 1408 contains a campaign ID 1463 , a file ID 1464 , which identifies the specific creative that will play if the criterion is met (and the rule/event containing the criterion is not trumped by another rule), and a weight 1466 .
- the weight denotes a percentage of total time that the creative is to play in a particular spot.

- The present invention relates to broadcasting and online media, and more particularly to systems for integrating advertisements of multiple media types.
- Currently, advertisers use a number of outlets to inform consumers about their products. For example, a company selling a new electronic product might book print ads in newspapers and magazines and might run ad spots on radio and television stations. The advertiser might also place online advertisements tied to search terms entered in online search engines.
- Currently, the advertisers book their advertisements in different media using a variety of methods. Typically, radio stations book their own ads, as do television networks, magazines and newspapers. Online advertisements may be placed via various online advertisement placement systems, such as Google's AdWords or AdSense.
- Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a system for integrating placement of advertisements in multiple types of media. In one embodiment, an advertiser only accesses a single user interface to place ads in both online venues and broadcast venues. For example, an advertiser may place both online ads and radio ads via a single user interface.

The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications to such elements and methods known to those skilled in the art.
-
FIG. 1 shows an example architecture of acommunication system 100 according to an aspect of the present invention.Communication system 100 may include anetwork 110 to communicatively couple third-party data sources 120, at least onesubscriber 130, at least oneregional broadcast studio 140, and abroadcasting hub 150. In a radio broadcast implementation, at least oneregional studio 140 may be further communicatively coupled to at least oneradio transmitter 160. - As shown in
FIG. 1 , thenetwork 110 is the Internet. In other implementations, thenetwork 110 can be any network, such as a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. - In the example shown in
FIG. 1 , third-party data sources can be any database, data mart, or other data source that provides data of interest to asubscriber 130 relevant to the scheduling of their advertisement. For example, the third-party data may be Arbitron ratings and demographic breakdowns for each station in a broadcast network. In addition, third-party data may be the weather forecast, current weather conditions, or news events such as stock prices, sports scores, data from a syndicated data feed such as an RSS feed, or any other data relevant to a subscriber's desire to play an advertisement. In another embodiment, information or data is received or collected directly by thebroadcasting hub 150 rather than from third-party sources. Regardless of the source, thebroadcasting hub 150 uses the information in evaluating whether criteria are met for the play of an advertisement. - A
subscriber 130 is also communicatively coupled to thebroadcasting hub 150. This allows thesubscriber 130 to purchase, schedule, and upload an advertising spot using a user interface of thebroadcasting hub 150 that is describe in detail below.Subscriber 130 may accesshub 150 via a connection toInternet 110. The connection toInternet 110 may be any conventional connection that allows access tohub 150. For example,subscriber 130 may accesshub 150 using TCP/IP and a conventional dial-up connection over a modem, or a dedicated connection that provides constant access.Hub 150 may have a unique HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address, a unique FTP address, or any other addressing scheme that allowssubscriber 130 to identifyhub 150.Subscribers 130 can be advertisers, agencies, stations, or any other entity that interacts with thebroadcasting hub 150. In someembodiments subscribers 130 have an account with thebroadcasting hub 150 and are charged a fee for use of thebroadcasting hub 150. In other embodiments, subscribers can access thebroadcasting hub 150 free of charge. - A
regional broadcast studio 140 is also communicatively coupled to thebroadcasting hub 150, such that thebroadcasting hub 150 is capable of forwarding an advertisement to theregional broadcast studio 140 for play. Thus, asubscriber 130 is capable of submitting to thebroadcasting hub 150 an advertisement for play along with specific criteria for the play of that advertisement, and thebroadcasting hub 150 will forward the advertisement to aregional broadcasting studio 140 for play as appropriate. - Stations may desire and may be able to isolate themselves from the Internet for a myriad of reasons. According to an aspect of the present invention and pursuant to what may be deemed a best practice for radio stations, stations may isolate mission critical on-air work stations from the public Internet. Specifically, the present system may enable on-air workstations to connect securely to a data center over the Internet without the on-air workstation being connected directly to the Internet. Such a configuration may be achieved by using encryption and secure protocols, including, but not limited to outbound-originating protocols.
- According to an aspect of the present invention, the identification of when a radio advertisement or radio program was broadcast may be achieved. This identification may be performed within the
broadcasting hub 150. Within hub 150 a data collector may identify verification of broadcast information related to an audio file associated with an advertising campaign or radio program, and may forward that information tonetworked environment 110.Hub 150 may include software for tabulating and formatting the information into a serviceable report, such as in response to a request bysubscriber 130. The information in, for example, such a report, may be presented based on many different criteria, such as, for example, the total number of advertising or programming broadcasts per campaign, a listing of which stations the radio advertisement or program was broadcast over, an hourly breakdown of the broadcasts, the demographics of the broadcast audience, the geography of the broadcast audience, and/or the format of the radio stations. - According to an aspect of the present invention, the reports available to
subscriber 130 may reflect the latest information available. The verification of broadcast information may be forwarded from the data collector tonetworked environment 110, such as when the verification of broadcast information becomes available frombroadcast hub 150. Such a substantially real-time report may providesubscriber 130 with substantially real-time data regarding the delivery of radio advertisements and radio programs. In other embodiments, a substantially real-time report may providesubscriber 130 with real-time data regarding the delivery of advertisements or other media plays over VoIP, Internet streaming, or other media. - According to an aspect of the present invention, the verification of broadcast information associated with advertising campaigns or programs may be combined with other information, and may be stored in additional databases or memories either resident on or accessible by
network 110, to produce reports of demographic information about the audience of the advertising campaign or program. Such other information for combination with the verification information may be obtained, for example, from relevant Internet or intranet sites, either automatically in response to an instruction included with the submission of the program to be broadcast, or manually upon receipt of a subscriber request. - In order to more fully describe the interconnectivity, an exemplary embodiment is set forth herein below.
FIG. 2 shows a system according to an aspect of the present invention.Subscriber 130 may conduct one or more advertising campaigns by purchasing audio advertisements across several local and regional radio stations, for example.Subscriber 130 may distribute audio commercials to the radio stations for scheduling by aregional broadcast studio 140.Subscriber 130 may verify the delivery and track the broadcast of each of the one or more advertising campaigns and associated audio commercials. It may be beneficial forsubscriber 130 to engineer the one or more advertising campaigns with a unique and corresponding file name. In this regard, each audio commercial digital file may have a subscriber—associated unique file name. The audio files associated with the advertising campaigns are referred to in this discussion as “campaign creative.” -
Regional broadcast studio 140 may broadcast a campaign creative forsubscriber 130.Regional broadcast studio 140 may initiate a broadcast of the campaign creative by scheduling broadcast delivery within itstrafficking system 210 orprogramming system 220. The campaign creative may be loaded ontoradio automation software 230 ofstation 140.Radio automation software 230 may include the scheduling and/or “flight” information as provided bytrafficking system 210 andprogramming system 220.Broadcast hub 150 may forward scheduling information regarding the campaign creative, captured fromradio automation software 230, to data collector. In one embodiment, at the scheduled time,radio automation software 230 may stream the campaign creative to astation transmitter 160 for subsequent broadcast over the air.Broadcast hub 150 may forward verification of broadcast information regarding the campaign creative, captured fromradio automation software 230, to data collector. The data collector may accumulate and/or store the information passed frombroadcast hub 150. - According to an aspect of the present invention, data collector may isolate the verification of broadcast information related to campaign identifiers, for example, by including a table identifying the campaign identifiers. When verification of broadcast information arrives regarding one of the campaign identifiers in the campaign identifier table, the data collector may forward that verification of broadcast information (“campaign information”) to
hub 150. The data collector may forward the campaign information as it arrives, or on a timed basis, such as in fifteen minute increments, one-hour increments, several-hour increments, or other increment known to those skilled in the pertinent arts. The rate at which the campaign information is passed from the data collector tohub 150 may limit how current, or real-time, a report may be. In this regard, the data collector according to an aspect of the present invention may be configured to provide the campaign information tohub 150 in real-time, such as not later than a few hours after the campaign information becomes available at the data collector. A portion ofhub 150 may include a web server that receives the verification of broadcast information associated with each campaign identifier (the campaign information) from the data collector and stores that information on a permanent storage medium, such as a hard disk drive. The web server may tabulate the campaign information based on each campaign identifier. The table containing the campaign information may be as current as the rate at which the data collector provides the campaign information to the web server. Consequently,hub 150 via the web server may be able to generate reports of the broadcast of radio advertisements and radio programming in substantially real-time. -
Hub 150 may provide access to the tabulated data overInternet 110. AlthoughInternet 110 may be described as a wide area network for making the reports available to subscribers, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system and method of the present invention encompasses any wide area network that allows access by subscribers to data stored onhub 150. -
Hub 150 may include server software, such as within a web server, that may allowsubscriber 130 to request a report of a particular radio advertisement broadcast or radio program broadcast at any time. For example,subscriber 130 may connect toInternet 110 in the middle of the day on a Tuesday. At that time,subscriber 130 may log on tohub 150 using a secure access protocol and issue a request to the web server to provide a report. The issued request identifies the particular radio advertisement or radio program of interest by campaign identifier.Hub 150 may respond to the request by reading the data stored in the table of campaign information associated with the campaign identifier provided bysubscriber 130. Software resident on the web server may tabulate the report in accordance with the request. Finally, the web server publishes, such as in HTML or XML format, for example, the report tosubscriber 130. In this manner,subscriber 130 may access and query the web server as frequently as desired to determine the broadcast of a particular advertising campaign or radio program. -
Hub 150 and the web server may be configured to transmit reports tosubscriber 130 at predetermined intervals, such as immediately, hourly, daily, weekly, or other time frame. For instance, software may be configured to simulate a subscriber request and cause the web server to generate and transmit the report tosubscriber 130. Alternative means of delivery may also be employed, such as via electronic mail. These and other alternatives will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a study of the disclosed embodiments. -
Hub 150 and the web server may be configured to generate the report in response to a triggering event. Examples of such a triggering event may be a confirmation of broadcast for a select advertisement or program, or of a situation wherein an advertisement or program was scheduled to broadcast, but failed to deliver, or of an advertising campaign reaching a dollar cap value, for example. For instance, the web server may be configured to analyze the campaign information as it is received from the data collector. If the campaign information reflects that an advertisement with a specified campaign identifier was scheduled to broadcast at a certain time, but failed to broadcast, the web server may respond by issuing a flag tosubscriber 130. According to an aspect of the present invention, the web server may be configured to extract from the campaign information the advertising client's telephone number, email, fax, or the like associated with the campaign identifier and transmit the broadcast information directly tosubscriber 130 or someone associated with the subscriber, such as to follow up on the failed broadcast. The campaign information may be transmitted by digital or voice pager, by e-mail message, by human interaction, or by any other mechanism for alertingsubscriber 130. In that manner,subscriber 130 may be substantially immediately notified that an advertisement failed to broadcast, and be provided with the radio station's contact information and advertising client information. - A myriad of reports can be created. By way of non-limiting example only, such reports may include campaign delivery by station, campaign delivery by market, campaign delivery by date, campaign delivery by hour, broadcast failure, and demographic reports. A campaign delivery by station report may identify upon which station a selected radio advertisement or radio program was broadcast. This report may enable
subscriber 130 to verify delivery across a certain station, or within an associated geographic region. A campaign delivery by market report may identify the geographic market across which the campaign was broadcast. This report may enablesubscriber 130 to verify delivery and coverage within a certain market. A campaign delivery by date report may providesubscriber 130 with per-day totals of broadcasts associated with a specified campaign.Subscriber 130 may use this type of report to easily identify those days with the heaviest advertising and programming response, such as for support planning purposes. A campaign delivery by hour report may providesubscriber 130 with per-hour totals of broadcasts associated with a specified campaign.Subscriber 130 may use this type of report to identify those dayparts with the heaviest advertising and programming response for support planning purposes. A broadcast failure report may providesubscriber 130 with a listing of the campaigns that were scheduled but failed to broadcast. This information allowssubscriber 130 to attempt to manage sales support, and take action to remedy failure. A demographic report may be provided. For example, the advertising campaign, broadcast across a specific market, may be mapped to area code or zip code to providesubscriber 130 with a broad overview of geographic locations of the receiving broadcast audience. Additional databases, such as those available from Census information, may be employed to generate financial, ethnic, and age-related demographic information which may be of use tosubscriber 130. - Networking models may be designed to minimize the impact on existing network configurations. For examples, two prevalent radio automation systems found in the industry are Scott Studios and Maestro. Connection to each of these legacy systems without necessitating the redesign of either system may be beneficial.
- Any networking model may be used, such as a local proxy or local connection, for example. Connecting using a local proxy need not require Internet connectivity, and instead may require only connection to a local area network (LAN). One computer on the LAN may have two network cards, one of which communicates with the local proxy which in turn communicates with the data center via an encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating connection. On the other hand a direct connection may require on-air workstations to have Internet connectivity and may provide an outbound-originating connection to the data center.
- As may be seen in
FIG. 3 , a local proxy may provide an encrypted/unencrypted connection to the data center and a reduction in the overall network traffic. Local proxy may use the Scott Studios and Maestro along with the local proxy to create an encrypted/unencrypted and secure connection to the data center. For this to happen, Scott Studios or Maestro may be present on each of the on-air automation workstations along with a local proxy module within the network. To establish the encrypted/unencrypted connection with the data center, the modules may rely on the station to have a dedicated internal automation system LAN and a separate corporate LAN with Internet connectivity. There may also be one machine that is multi-homed, meaning it has two network cards and is aware of both networks. In most installations, the multi-homed machine is usually a dispatch computer or a server. This configuration has been and continues to be a hardware deployment by Scott Studios with both modules and hardware/network configuration in place, the Scott Studios and Maestro will automatically attempt to connect to the local proxy. Local proxy may, in turn, attempt to establish an encrypted/unencrypted connection with the data center. Local proxy may be designed to make use of the default network settings of the multi-homed machine for both the automation system LAN and the corporate LAN. Therefore, these network settings may remain largely unchanged. Additionally, the local proxy need not rely on a host name to connect to the data center but rather uses an IP address; therefore no DNS configuration should be necessary. Local proxy network settings may be modified if any of the default settings have been changed to block outbound Internet traffic from the multi-homed machine over the corporate LAN or if inbound traffic from the automation system LAN has been blocked to the multi-homed computer. If these defaults have been modified, additional changes may be needed, such as: the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as on port 443 (HTTPS), for example; the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as onport 10,000, for example; the multi-homed computer connecting outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as onport 80, for example; on-air workstations connecting outbound over the internal automation system LAN to the multi-homed computer, such as onport 10,000, for example; multi-homed computer accepting inbound traffic from the internal automation system LAN, such as onport 10,000, for example. Under such a configuration local proxy module may use specific ports to direct encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating traffic over the Internet. For example, ports 443 (HTTPS) and 10,000 may be used for transmitting encrypted/unencrypted station information and module control traffic. Selection between these ports may be optimized to preserve system resources.Port 80 may be used for downloading unencrypted media files from the data center. After configuring a station's network, the on-air automation workstations may connect to the data center through the local proxy module automatically. - As may be seen in
FIG. 4 , direct connection may be used for stations and station clusters that do not follow the automation system hardware deployment recommended for Scott Studios and Maestro equipment, stations that already have Internet connectivity at each on-air workstation, or for stations that either cannot or choose not to deploy the local proxy model. Direct connection may use the Scott Studios and Maestro Modules on each on-air work station to create a secure connection to the data center. To establish the secure connection with the data center, each on-air automation workstation may have access to a network with a direct connection to the Internet. With the proper communication modules installed and an Internet connection present, the modules may automatically attempt to connect out to the data center. Direct connection may be designed to make use of the default network settings of the on-air workstations and instead of relying on host names to connect to the data center may use an IP address. As would be evident to those possessing an ordinary skill in the pertinent arts, using an IP address may prevent the need for a DNS configuration. On-air workstations may connect outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as onport 10,000, for example. On-air workstations may connect outbound to the Internet over the corporate LAN, such as onport 80, for example. Direct connection may use these specific ports to direct encrypted/unencrypted outbound-originating traffic over the Internet. For example, HTTP traffic may be sent onport 80 and may be used for transmitting station information and for downloading media files from the data center.Port 10,000 may be used for transmitting communications information. Once the station's network has been configured, the on-air automation workstations may connect directly to the data center automatically. -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of an advertising buying environment in the present invention.FIG. 5 illustrates a local, a national, and a network advertising buyer. Of note, the local buyer buys individual ads on particular stations. The national buyer can pinpoint specific buys within a particular group of affiliate radio stations. Alternatively, a national buyer can directly or indirectly contact individual stations to do multiple local buys where the buys are not within a particular group. The network buyer buys advertising for all affiliates within a network, such as in a radio syndication show environment. In the illustrated embodiment, an advertising buyer buys an insertion order, and the advertiser request correspondent to the purchase order goes into “traffic”. Radio traffic is scheduled by thetrafficking system 210. For example, based on an advertiser request, thetrafficking system 210 may schedule the play of a particular ad in three slots at three assigned times each day during the weekdays of Monday through Friday. Obviously, once advertising inventory builds, conflicts arise between advertising requests, particularly during rush hour or high desirability playtimes. - To address these conflicts, in one embodiment the
trafficking system 210 shuffles the requested advertising to maximize the revenue generated from particular ads at particular times (of course, advertising at premium times and on premium days brings premium revenue). Thetrafficking system 210 compiles a list of items to be played, wherein each item on the list is assigned a cut number that links the plays on the list together. In one embodiment, a text file consisting of the traffic log is manually reconciled at least once per day. -
FIG. 6 is an illustration of aradio play environment 600. The environment ofFIG. 6 includes atraffic log 660 such as that discussed above, aprogram log 662, amerge application 664, an automation forplay 666, amaster schedule 668, aplay log 669, and may include remote applications, includingexternal inputs 620 such as voice tracking, satellite, and FTP, for example. Thetraffic log 660, theprogram log 662, and themaster schedule 668 as illustrated preferably include identifications of the plays that are to occur in accordance with each. - The
traffic log 660 is such as that handled by thetrafficking system 210 as discussed hereinabove. Theprogram log 662 may include programs, such as songs, that are to be played over the air. Themaster schedule 668 may include a validation of the media to be played, such as verification that the identification numbers included in thetraffic log 660 and program log 662 are valid play items. In a typical embodiment, themerge application 664 merges thetraffic log 660 and theprogram log 662 and manages the filling of any holes, such as by theautomation 666, to create themaster schedule 668. Themaster schedule 668 is directed to theautomation 666, and theautomation 666 monitors the inputs and outputs to and from the radio station for play over airwaves. Theplay log 669 is generated based on the output of the automation as that output is generated over the airwaves. The output of the play log 669 may be monitored before billing to advertisers to ensure that ads have properly been played by theautomation 666. - In the embodiment discussed above, the
automation 666 controls the final output over the airwaves of a radio play. Theautomation 666 may switch for example from a satellite channel to a local channel, or to an Internet channel, and back again to obtain play from various locations for incorporation into theautomation 666 play. Such plays, as received by theautomation 666, may include a metadata channel that does not include the radio plays, but rather includes information regarding the radio plays in the traffic log. For example, a metadata channel may infer that a remote radio feed is about to have a “hard break” or a “soft break”. A soft break is one which is at the option of, for example, a radio personality, and a hard break is non-optional. As such, in an exemplary embodiment, a syndicated radio show may arrive for local play in the form of a compact disc, or may arrive by a satellite to the automation and may include a metadata channel including the information regarding the satellite play. Consequently, in an embodiment wherein the play originates from a remote point, the metadata channel may allow for a local station to insert particular items for an otherwise remotely generated play. In such an embodiment, theautomation 666 may switch back to the local play generation point for a limited set time, during which the local play point may generate local play items into the otherwise remotely generated play. Upon completion of the metadata instructed local play period, theautomation 666 may switch back to, for example, the satellite channel for a renewal of the remote play. As such, in some embodiments of present radio applications, all plays, from all locations, are controlled by theautomation 666, and further, theautomation 666 provides validation, via theplay log 669, that all plays have properly occurred. - In certain embodiments, the
traffic log 660 fed to theautomation 666 may include one or more “dummy” files. Such “dummy” file positions can include the place holders that allow for mapping of information, such as mapping of remote information over the Internet and/or via FTP. Such a mapping may include the bundling of remote files and/or local files into a mapped position. Such mapped positions are not held as open, but rather are held as closed play positions in spite of the fact that it is unknown to thelocal automation 666 precisely what plays will occur in the position of the “dummy” file. - Further, ads may be inserted via channel switching instructions fed over one or more metadata channels. For example, a plurality of regional ads, each dedicated to specific one or more regions of the country, may be simultaneously playing on a series of channels incoming to the
automation 666, such aschannels 4 through 8. A syndicated radio program may be playing simultaneously on, for example,channel 3 incoming to theautomation 666. Upon the occurrence of a break, in accordance with thetraffic log 660 and metadata channels, onchannel 3, the metadata channel may include instructions for each region to switch during the break to its correspondent incoming regionalized advertising channel. For example, a station playing the syndicated program onchannel 3 in Philadelphia, Pa. may be instructed to switch, via the metadata channel, tochannel 4 during a break in the program ofchannel 3 in order to play a regionalized ad onchannel 4. Simultaneously, and during the same break on the program ofchannel 3, a station in Los Angeles, Calif. may be instructed, via the metadata, to switch tochannel 8 in order to play regionalized advertising for that region then playing onchannel 8. In such an embodiment, upon completion of a break onchannel 3, all stations then participating in a syndicated play ofchannel 3 are instructed via the metadata to have theautomation 666 switch back tochannel 3 for continuation of the syndicated play. Similarly, advertising may be cashed on a particular channel to play in a particular order, and, when a break occurs on the channel then playing, a switch may be made to the cashed advertising channel to allow for whatever numbers of cashed ads to play that are capable of play during an allotted break window on the play channel. Upon closure of the break on the play channel, theautomation 666 may be instructed to switch from a cashed advertising channel back to the play channel, and may pick up on the next switch to the advertising channel with the next keyed cashed advertisement. - In an embodiment, metadata may be shipped on a particular channel, and programming may be shipped on a plurality of other channels. In such an embodiment, the metadata channel may be keyed to the play occurring on another channel and the metadata itself may call for insertion of data on the metadata channel or another channel onto the current play channel when a break, such as a soft break, occurs according to the metadata channel. Upon the occurrence of such a break in accordance with the metadata channel, a local feed may, for example, insert local advertising onto the current play channel, such as via switching to a local channel for the duration of the break according to the metadata channel.
- Switching of the
automation 666 in accordance with the switching policies described hereinabove, allows for a preemption of a radio play. In existing play embodiments, if a break is called for at a particular time, such as at noon on a Friday, the channel on which the break is to occur must be continuously monitored, and the metadata of the channel on which the break is to occur must be continuously monitored, to ensure that the break occurs at the prescribed time. In embodiments described herein, a monitoring of, for example, channels such as the metadata channel may occur in real time, and as such assigned time plays, particularly of advertising or information spots, are no longer necessary. In particular, a monitoring of the metadata channel, even during a play incoming remotely on a separate channel, provides sufficient information to switch to an advertising or alternative play channel in accordance with the incoming metadata. Thus, in prior embodiments, the knowledge of the occurrence of a break must be pre-existent, and any movement of that break must be monitored. However, in embodiments discussed herein, no pre-existent knowledge of breaks is necessary. Rather, in embodiments discussed herein, the system of the present invention learns and gains knowledge of when preemption is to occur, and elects the proper preemption in real time based on the break then occurring as it occurs during the play. As such, traditional methods and systems merely insert at a defined time, while in some embodiments, the system described herein preempts in real time based on learning from the programming as it is playing. - In order to allow for a proper learning and preemption, the present invention may include a learning module and a preemption module, which modules may be placed at any of a plurality of points within the radio play system discussed hereinabove. For example, the modules may be placed at the
traffic log 660, at themaster schedule 668, at themerge application 664, or at theautomation 666. However, because the modules can be used to replace unsold or underpaid advertising spots with more lucrative advertising spots, the operation of a rule set from within the modules can be available at the point of placement of the modules. Consequently, although the modules may be placed within thetraffic log 660 ormaster schedule 668, advertising payment rate data is not typically available at either location, and cannot be used to operate at either location without being affected by themerge 664. Further, placement of the modules at themerge 664 might allow the rules of themerge 664 to replace certain unsold or otherwise empty play spots with songs, or other information, thus eliminating the ability of the modules to replace the unsold or otherwise empty spots with more lucrative advertising. Consequently, it may be highly useful to place the modules within or in association with theautomation 666, in order to allow theautomation 666 to follow a series of metadata rules on the replacement and reevaluation of a merged traffic log. - Modules placed within the
automation 666 may allow for a remote viewing of the real time automated play, in order to allow for real time reevaluation of the current play, and a comparison of the evaluation of the current play with a locally or remotely located rate and rate time chart, and for modification or replacement, via preemption, of information in the real time play list. Such preemptions may be based on cost rules or other rules applied through the add-in module or modules to theautomation 666. - However, since estimated times for plays as assessed at the
merge 664 may vary in accordance with the delays inherent in a radio play, the modules cannot use time estimates, or play identification estimates to assess proper preemption locations. Therefore, the modules may preferably have available a secondary feed showing real time output data of the plays occurring on a radio location then being monitored by the modules. As such, the modules may estimate a proper play location for preemption, and may then monitor to ensure that the preemption location receives preemption at the proper point. This secondary feed showing real time plays may be received from a variety of locations. For example, the play log 669 may be monitored in real time to assess the plays then occurring. However, even the play log 669 may be subject to certain delays or flaws, and as such may not give a true illustration of real time plays. Alternatively, the modules may view, from within theautomation 666 itself, real time play inventory requests as they occur. For example, theautomation 666 may call a particular play from a given location at a given time and that location and time may be viewed by the modules and compared with the play list in order to assess, precisely and in real time, the comparison of the play list with the play then occurring, and any preemptions may be modified according to any delays or improprieties assessed. - In an additional embodiment, because the
merge 664 may eliminate much of any available unsold or empty play slots, it may be preferable to insert the modules at themerge 664, rather than waiting for theautomation 666 to occur. However, in such an embodiment, themerge 664 would still require availability of, among other things, rate listings and the rates of currently assigned plays. Further, because play does not occur from themerge 664 but rather occurs from theautomation 666, a built-in delay would need to be assessed from theautomation 666 back to themerge 664, in order to allow a real time monitoring of inventory requests at theautomation 666 to be applied to the modules performing preemption back at themerge 664. Further, the modules, whether at themerge 664 or at theautomation 666, may be subject to any number of local or remote rules. The availability of such rules at themerge 664 may allow for the variation of preemption rates at themerge 664, thereby allowing themerge 664 to vary the amount of unsold or empty slots filled by themerge 664, such as by dependence on the time or day. For example, it may be more cost effective to a given station to fill more unsold or empty slots during rush hour than during the remainder of the day, because rush hour may bring higher premium rates from advertisers. As such, the amount of unsold or empty slots desired to be filled during rush hour at themerge 664 may be higher from the radio station viewpoint, or may be lower from an advertiser's viewpoint, based on the controller of the modules performing preemption at themerge 664. -
FIG. 7 illustrates an embodiment of media play capabilities, wherein the media played is varied based on the status of certain external factors as provided by information input to thehub 750, and/or based on the actions of one or more receivers of media that was played. As used herein, the terms “radio content” and “broadcast” or “broadcast content” include any type of media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the output, and that is presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play. As used herein, the terms “nonradio content”, or “nonbroadcast” or “broadcast nonspecific content”, include any media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the content, for example via a media feed, and that is not presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play. As used herein, the term “media feed” includes any transmission of any media to one or more receivers of the media, including but not limited to terrestrial or satellite radio broadcasts; voice over IP; Internet streaming; podcasts, webpages; video games with a communication connection, such as console, online and handheld video games; video players with a communication connection; and mobile phones. As used herein, the term “media play” refers to the audio, visual or computerized output transmitted in the media feed. - As illustrated in
FIG. 7 , ahub 750 can also access a variety ofcontent 770, including nonradio and radio content.Such content 770 may be local to thehub 750, or may be available to thehub 750 from any of a variety of sources, including but not limited to intranet, Internet, satellite channel, FTP or zipped files that may be accessed by thehub 750 in accordance with one or more commands associated with thehub 750 directingmedia play 772. Thehub 750 may have multiple portions. More specifically, thehub 750 may be any number of modules resident at any number of locations, so long as all such locations are accessible by at least one module resident at the location from which the media play 772 is to occur. - Further, the
hub 750 can also access a plurality ofsecondary information 774, certain of whichinformation 774 may be available in real time. Theinformation 774 may be relevant to criteria for the play of certain advertisements, and may be data from a third-party data source 120, for example. In various embodiments, theinformation 774 comprises current weather conditions, weather forecasts, temperature, pollen counts, precipitation, current events, sports scores, broadcast topics/radio guests, terror-alert color, traffic conditions, stock market data, interest rates, gas prices, or other financial indicators, or anyother information 774 available to thehub 750 that is relevant to deciding whenlisteners 773 would be most receptive to a media play message and most likely to undertake a targetedresponse 777. Examples of the use of thisinformation 774 in scheduling advertisements are described herein below with reference to the user interface. - In a specific exemplary embodiment, the
hub 750 can access aplay list 776 for at least one radio studio in at least one marketing region. Multiple radio stations may be available to asingle hub 750, and a marketing region may be any geographic region including but not limited to a city, a county, or state, for example. In this embodiment, thehub 750 may, in part, direct theplay list 776 of the one or more radio stations, such as by preempting that which was to be played by the radio station in accordance with theplay list 776 with an intelligent insertion that is more likely to bring success in accordance with the predetermined criteria than would the preempted play on theplay list 776. - In this example, the
play list 776 of a radio station may generally include advertising plays and music plays. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, listenership generally decreases when ads begin to play and increases during a continuous music play on a radio station. There are exceptions, such as wherein listenership falls for a radio station during play of an unpopular song, for example. Further, listenership even during advertising may not fall if the advertising is popular, such as wherein the advertisement is amusing or of significant interest to listeners. - Information about
listeners 773 can be used asfeedback 778 to thehub 750, such as real time monitoring of numbers oflisteners 773 to one or more stations. For example, as is known to those skilled in the art, vehicles can be monitored at a heavy intersection to determine the station to which they are tuned. Thehub 750 may modify the radiostation play list 776 in real time according to certain predetermined criteria. For example, if listenership of the particular radio station begins to fall, thehub 750 may preempt certain advertising that was to play with popular music. Consequently, listenership for that radio station will rise. When listenership reaches a particular level, premium advertising rates may become available, and thehub 750 may at that stage preempt the music play with premium advertising in order to maximize advertising revenues and maximize the number of listeners who hear a given advertisement. Thus, when demand for advertising spots and advertising rates are high, the creation of more advertising spots thusly increases advertising revenues. Further, an advertiser willing to pay only lower rates will be able to place ads during times when the advertising can best be afforded by that advertiser. - As an example, an advertiser may desire to have an advertisement run only when listenership is above 100,000, regardless of the time of day. Using these predetermined criteria, the
hub 750 may modify the radiostation play list 776 in real time to intelligently preempt music play, for example, once the 100,000 listener threshold set by the advertiser has been met or exceeded. Once the advertisement has run, thehub 750 may return to music play or continue with running advertisements. Various criteria for the play of advertisements can be set, and examples will be described below in the context of the user interface for scheduling a media buy. - It will be apparent in light of the description hereinabove that various sources may be mined in order to access any desirable variation in the
play list 776. For example, popular music downloads, as assessed by certain Internet sites, may give excellent guidance on what would be the most popular radio music plays at a given time. Playing not simply music but the most popular music at a given time will have the greatest return in increasing listenership to the radio station at that given time. Further, such an embodiment of intelligent preemption and insertion can make available to thehub 750 even more refined decisions. For example, greater advertising rates can be charged for advertising that plays immediately adjacent to the most popular songs available for play by the radio station. The hub may also limit certain content to control the price of advertising by, for example, playing only a limited amount of the most popular music in a given time period. By way of further example, advertising rates may be set according to actual listenership either measured in real time or estimated based on broadcast content. -
Listeners 773 to a radio station may respond to certain advertising by undertaking the activity advised by the advertisement, such as by stopping for food at a food establishment, shopping at a particular retail establishment, using an advertised coupon, visiting an advertised website for more information, calling a particular customer service number, and the like. The activity advised or encouraged by the advertisement, either directly or indirectly, is known as the targetedresponse 777. Measures of this targetedresponse 777 assist the advertiser in assessing the efficacy of the advertisement. The targetedresponse 777 may vary significantly based on the circumstances of the advertisement placement. Advertisers desire to play advertisements when it is perceived or known that the greatest targetedresponse 777 will be achieved. Techniques in accordance with the present invention for observing the targetedresponse 777 are described herein below. Measures of the targetedresponse 777 may be collected and provided to thehub 750 to inform whether a given campaign creative should be played again, or alternatively, which campaign creative among two or more alternatives should be played. As such, subsequent media plays 772 may be varied in accordance with the success or failure of proceeding radio plays. - According to one aspect of the present invention, a variety of techniques can be used for observing the targeted
response 777. These techniques include but are not limited to tracking phone calls, coupon usage, SMS coupons, website hits, and sales. In various embodiments, these techniques can be used separately or in combination with each other to observe the targetedresponse 777, and ultimately the efficacy of a campaign. - In one embodiment, a campaign creative provides a particular phone number to call to obtain more information about an advertised product or service. In one implementation, the number of phone calls is tracked directly by the call center. In another embodiment, phone calls to a phone number are routed through a tracking module that registers incoming calls, for example by tracking caller ID information to determine the location of the caller, to one or more numbers before routing the calls to a call center. In one embodiment, calls to one number routed through a tracking module can be correlated to the advertisement played most recently in the caller's geographic market. Over time, the effectiveness of advertisements played in prompting listeners to call can be measured for various creatives, at various times, in various markets. In another embodiment, more than one phone number is used to measure the number of calls in response to one creative compared to the number of calls in response to another creative that advertises a different phone number. Alternatively or additionally, the number of calls in response to the play of one creative on one station can be compared to the number of calls in response to the play of that creative on a different station merely by advertising different phone numbers for each.
- In another embodiment, targeted
response 777 can be tracked by tracking coupon usage. Different coupon codes can be advertised in each creative played or each station can play an advertisement having a different coupon code. Thus, as customers identify their coupons upon the purchase of goods or services, the seller is able to track by which advertisement the customer was influenced. In one embodiment, the coupon code can be sent back to listeners who respond to an advertisement in SMS format, and the coupon code can be unique on a customer by customer basis and/or can be correlated to a particular play of an advertisement. Thus, when the coupon code is used at a point of sale, whether it be at a website, through a call center, or at a store, the sale can be matched to the inquiry and/or ultimately to the played advertisement. - In yet another embodiment, the number of website hits that a particular site receives can be tracked and correlated to media plays. In one embodiment, advertisers can use different web addresses to measure the relative effectiveness of two or more advertisements. Alternatively, the IP addresses of computer visitors can be used to determine the geographic location of those that access an advertised website.
- In one embodiment, advertisers can track sales figures for advertised goods, services, businesses, or the like. They can then correlate sales numbers with campaign creatives played, for example, on a temporal basis or on a geographic market basis. For example, data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in one geographical area can be compared to data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in another geographical area. Alternatively, data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in the days following the play of one campaign creative can be compared to data from cash register receipts from stores that sell an advertised product in the days following the play of a different campaign creative. However the targeted
response 777 is measured, the data collected can be used as a feedback to thehub 750 to inform which creative within a campaign are most effective. - In various embodiments of the present invention, intelligent insertion may be performed in any media play context, including any audio source into a media feed. For example, insertion may be made in a radio station or streaming Internet radio context, a cellular telephone context, in a Voice over IP (VOIP) context, an SMS context, a WiMax context, a downloadable audio file context such as for iPods or other MP3 players, videogame systems, or the like. The media play insertion may include a song, a message, a news, traffic, sports, or weather update, one or more coupons, or an instant message, for example.

FIG. 8 shows a schematic diagram of the flow of information within the communication system ofFIGS. 1 and 2 .FIG. 8 showsinformation flow 300, which includes two principle regions, Radio Automation Software (“RAS”) 230 andworkflow 310.RAS 230 may includeschedule file 320 andaudio file 330.Workflow 310 may include audio advertisement files 340,publisher 350, andmaster controller 360. The flow of information will be described with reference to the numerals labeling the arrows representing the flow of information. -
RAS 230 may include a flow of information for anew schedule file 1. New schedule file may originate withschedule file 320 and be transmitted to afirst chain agent 370. This transmission may occur by an external software that publishes a new schedule file to theRAS 230 file system. Afirst chain agent 370, via a directory watcher process, detectsnew schedule file 320, and reads it off of disk. Thisnew schedule file 320 may originate or be taken from several systems within the radio station and or from a location outside the studio itself (in the case of remote network programming). Eventually,schedule file 320 may be created while remaining unpublished toRAS 230. The filling methods may be local, and the rules for filling the inventory may not be dynamic nor take into consideration a revenue maximization function. For example, 3rd party groups today will “buy” unsold inventory in advance and give the station 1-N ads, that the station can “fill” unsold inventory. The station in this case is selling unsolds in advance without a guaranteed schedule. -
First chain agent 370 residing inRAS 230 may pass information to aworkflow 310. This retrieval of anew schedule file 320 may be seen inFIG. 8 aslink 4. This information may be passed to a parse and store step located withinworkflow 310. As theRAS chain agent 370 readsschedule file 320, the file may be transmitted toworkflow 310. The dD preemptable ad avails (dD Avails) may be parsed fromschedule file 320 and stored for further processing. Theoriginal schedule file 320 may be stored for billing, accounting, and auditing purposes. This parsing and storing, shown and described to occur withinworkflow 310, may be achieved atstudio 140. - After parsing and storing the schedule file, the information is transmitted to the Inventory Management System (“IMS”) where the campaign is assigned to
schedule file 320. This transmission is shown bylabel 5 and may occur withinworkflow 310. This represents the delivery of the dD Avails to IMS. Rather than collecting the unsold inventory report in a central location, the central location, which tracks ad effectiveness, may publish results to each station and the local station software may use this information to make “intelligent” insertion over unsold inventory. The available ads may need to be published or delivered tostation 140 andstation 140 may need to receive performance data on those campaigns, so that the local engine may make decisions. - Similarly, after parsing and storing the schedule file, a validator checks for possible scheduling errors. The transmission of information to the validator is shown by
label 6. The validator may input this information and analyze schedule file 320 for errors in tag structure, frequency of tags, station contractual obligations, such as minimum number of spots per period, and other errors known to those possessing an ordinary skill in the pertinent arts. This validation, while shown to occur withinworkflow 310, may occur local tohub 150. The validator may output information to IMS on whether theschedule file 320 is validated. This validity feedback is shown bylabel 23. Once IMS receives an appropriate response from the validator, IMS may process the new dD Avails, by assigning dD advertisements and specific creative to specific dD Avails. This IMS, while shown to occur withinworkflow 310, may occur local tohub 150. - After the IMS assigns campaigns to the schedule file, the processing may be complete, and the information in the schedule transmitted to a publisher as shown by
label 25. The result of the processing of dD Avails is a dB Schedule, which is specific to each station. This creation, while shown to occur withinworkflow 310, may occur local tohub 150. - After publishing the schedule, information may be transmitted to the
master controller 360 as shown bylabel 7. Themaster controller 360 may operate as the brains behind “trafficking” the unsold spots slated for preemption within the dB schedule file. Themaster controller 360 receives the song feed, including ads, as to what is being played currently on a station. Themaster controller 360 uses this feed to determine where in the current schedule file a station is. Themaster controller 360 manages the replacement of the ads, and the swapping back of the original ad, once the spot has run. Themaster controller 360, while shown to occur withinworkflow 310, may occur local tohub 150. - A feedback system may be created for creating new schedules as shown by
labels master controller 360 to thepublisher 350,label 8, from thepublisher 350 to thesecond chain agent 380,label 9, and from thesecond chain agent 380 to thefirst chain agent 370,label 2. Thus, there is a schedule for a given station,master controller 360 instruction to pre-empt a spot, andmaster controller 360 instructions to restore the preempted spot after it has played. Themaster controller 360 interrogates the dB Schedule file for a given station, identifying the names of all of the creative that are scheduled to run, and publishes these creative to the station via the 8-9-2 pathway. The chain agent examines a cache of previously stored ads to determine that it has stored all creative. The master controller, if it determines that a spot is ready to be pre-empted, may send a notification via the 8-9-2 pathway, to instruct the chain agent to swap creative one for creative two. Thechain agent 370 may confirm receipt of this message via the 2-30 pathway. - The chain agent may manage the physical preemption process. Instructions to preempt an ad may be delivered via
path 18 toaudio files 330. The chain agent may preserve the original audio file X by either renaming it or moving it to a different directory on the file system. The original file, the dD spot and the slated pre-emption may be copied into a directory of the same file name. The header information within the file, used to populate the RAS screen, may be different and reflects the actual ad that will run even though the file name is the same. The header information may identify what is written to the RAS log files for billing purposes and the station may be aware that the preemption occurred. Once this preemption has been completed or failed due to some error, status may be published via pathway (2-30). The chain agent, which may be responsible for sending the song feed, known as the log, of what is actually playing on the station, such as by pathway labeled 22, may monitor the feed to see the pre-empted spot run. Once it has run, the chain agent may swap the original ad back and notifies the master controller. - The feedback pathway labeled 2, 31 may enable the
chain agent 370 to determine if the audio file is available. The chain agent may request the publisher, viapathway 31, to send it a specific creative. The publisher responds by sending the file along with a checksum to confirm the file was not corrupted in transmission viapathway - The
chain agent 370 may also prompt the song feed acrosspathway 22. The chain agent, depending on the RAS configuration, may either watch the log file on the RAS to determine what is being played over the air, or may receive a data feed from the RAS directly containing play history. The chain agent may scrub the feed and publish it toworkflow 310. The song feed may be exported directly over the WAN toworkflow 310 and a local agent may not be required. - In the event that the validator determines there to be an error, information may be transmitted across
pathway 16 in order for notification of an error to occur. If errors are found in the schedule file, such as a result of a contractual breach or a technical issue, a set of rules may be set up dependent upon the type or error and the station the error occurred on, to notify both systems and people that are tasked to resolve the errors. - The event ad may be played. As shown in
pathways pathway 19. Radio tower broadcasts to an audience acrosschannel 20. As the audience responds to the pre-empted ad, by calling a telephone number,workflow 310 traps the caller ID or is notified from the call center, in substantially real time, or on a daily basis, for example. - New calls may be logged, and the information may be provided to IMS across
paths - Campaign performance, in addition to being transmitted to IMS, may be transmitted across
pathway 14 to a forecaster. Forecaster may compare actual performance with predicted performance and revenues. The IMS methods may be evaluated based upon the accuracy of the predications. Over time, the forecaster may project future revenues based on inventory flow and ad campaigns scheduled in the system. The forecaster may provide automated notification to station traffic managers that the present invention may result in income. - A verification may occur. The pathway labeled 40, 42 may demonstrate the availability of verification. The master control, in addition, may instruct the local chain agent at the station to pre-empt a spot and, responsive to the notification, may notify a digital radio that can receive the broadcast of the station to record the ad scheduled by the master controller, such as by sending a schedule or a real time notification to start/stop recording. The audio may be streamed over the WAN and recorded within the
workflow 310 environment. Verification may occur across transmission path 41 demonstrating an ad spot recorded off the air. Once the file is recorded, it may be transmitted toworkflow 310 to verify. The verify process may compare the audio file recorded to the audio file that was shipped to the station. If there is a match, then the ad spot may be logged as verified. If no match exists, the file may be routed to a human capable of listening to the original and the recorded file to determine if the spot matches. If no match still exists, further action may be taken.Subscriber 130 may opt to listen to the recorded spots and the original in one of several verification reports. This audio may be streamed over the WAN and recorded within theworkflow 310 environment. -
FIG. 9 is an example of an integrated user interface that allows an advertiser to place ads in multiple media from a singleinitial user interface 900. In the example ofFIG. 9 , the advertiser can place ads in a first media, such as online in a web-based venue in connection with search terms entered by potential customers or in connection with website content. InFIG. 9 , theuser interface 900 initially starts in a mode that allows the advertiser to place ads of a first media type. In other embodiments, the advertiser must first click on a tab or other type of user interface selector to indicate that he wishes to place ads in the first media. - In the example shown in
FIG. 9 , the first media is a service that allows advertisers to place ads in connection with displayed search results or website content. Example of such a media include Google AdWords or AdSense. Google AdWords is a quick and simple way to purchase highly targeted advertisements on a cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) basis. AdWords ads are displayed along with search results. In an embodiment, ads are placed on a search results page when advertiser-specified search terms are entered by a potential customer. In another embodiment, ads are placed on a search results page when the search results contain a particular site. Google AdSense for content automatically, based on the content of a website, delivers ads that are relevant to the audience of the website. In an embodiment, ads are placed on webpages when advertiser-specified terms related to the ad are also related to the content of those webpages. Thus, ads that are relevant to the content of the webpage are displayed. - In one embodiment, the advertiser has a choice with respect to new ad campaigns. When an advertiser creates a keyword-targeted
ad campaign 910, he chooses keywords for which an ad will appear and specify the maximum amount he is willing to pay for each click. In one embodiment, the advertiser only pays when someone clicks on the ad. When the advertiser creates a site-targetedad campaign 912, he chooses the exact sites where an ad will appear and specifies the maximum amount he is willing to pay for each thousand page views on that site. The advertiser pays whenever someone views the ad, whether the viewer clicks on the ad or not. - The user interface of
FIG. 9 allows an advertiser to access a single user interface to place ads in multiple types of media. By way of theuser interface 900 ofFIG. 9 , an advertiser can also place ads in a second medium such as a broadcast medium, which includes a radio station or streaming Internet radio context, a cellular telephone context, a Voice over IP (VOIP) context, an SMS context, a WiMax context, a downloadable audio file context such as for iPods or other MP3 players, videogame systems, or the like. InFIG. 9 , the advertiser can click on atab 904 to indicate a desire to place ads in a second media. - The present invention can integrate ad placement for any number of advertising media. Although the example shown in
FIG. 9 demonstrates ads in online search results and ads in broadcast media, other embodiments of the present invention can include placement of ads in various other media types, including personalized broadcasts such as podcasts; other online venues, such as blogs; print media, such as books and magazines; video and video on demand; wireless telephones; video games; and any other media in which advertisers can place ads. -
FIGS. 10A-J are examples of part of the user interface for placing ads in a second medium.FIG. 10A shows an explanation of an example of the second medium. Here, the second medium is “Audio Ads” which is initiated by way of a selector such astab 904. To create a campaign, the advertiser clicksbutton 1002. -
FIG. 10B shows a list of previously createdaudio campaigns 1006 and a timeframe that a new campaign will exist within 1007. In one implementation, the list of previous createdaudio campaigns 1006 includes the campaign name, the current status of the campaign, the date the campaign was created, the last date the campaign was modified, and the start and end dates of the campaign, among other campaign information. -
FIG. 10C is an interface that allows the advertiser to name thenew campaign 1020 and to enter abudget 1022 for the overall campaign. The advertiser chooses whether to run the campaign on radio stations across theUnited States 1024 or inspecific metro areas 1026. If the user chooses to run the campaign inspecific metro areas 1026, the user interface shown inFIG. 10D allows the advertiser to selectspecific metro areas 1028. - The user interface shown in
FIG. 10D also allows the advertiser to select general station types 1031. The advertiser can optionally selectdetailed station types 1030 using the interface shown inFIG. 10E to display detailed station format types 1034. -
FIG. 10F is an example user interface that allows the advertiser to specify when to play ads from the advertiser'scampaign 1040 and to selectad length 1042.FIG. 10G illustrates acalendar input 1048 that allows an advertiser to input dates. Referring back toFIG. 10F , in the example shown, the advertiser can specify whether the ad is 30 seconds or 60 seconds long. The advertiser sets abid amount 1044, for example $2.50, indicating the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay per thousand impressions. The advertiser can also specify aweekly budget 1046 through the user interface. -
FIG. 10H illustrates a user interface that displays an estimated number of impressions and an estimatedcost 1050 that are predicted for a givenbid amount 1044. These predictions may be calculated, for example, based on historical data gathered from previous campaigns and bid activity, or based on current levels of inventories of available ad space, or on other factors. In some implementations, theweekly budget 1046 is treated as an upper limit to the charges to the advertiser. -
FIG. 10I shows a user interface for selecting an Audio Ad to add to a campaign. Existing ads are displayed inwindow 1060. An advertiser can select an advertisement fromwindow 1060 to add the advertisement to the advertising campaign. After the advertiser has made one or more selections from thewindow 1060, the window can be closed. -
FIG. 10J illustrates a user interface for specifying an ad rotation. The advertiser can run all ads equally often, can choose how often to play each ad, or can set up advanced rules for playing theads 1069.FIG. 10J shows an example in which the advertiser can define arule 1070 relating to, for example, location, station type, and play time (for example, drive time). Other embodiments also include rules relating to listener demographics. -

Reports on the status of an advertiser's campaigns can be organized byradio schedule 1120, locations 1103,station types 1140, andads 1150. The advertiser can also customize the columns of the reports using thecustomization menu 1110.FIG. 11D shows another example of a report. In this example, the report is organized by station types.FIG. 11E shows an example of a customized report 11170. -
FIG. 12 is an architecture diagram of anAd Management System 1200 showing data passing between adata center 1204 andradio stations 1202 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The described embodiment of the Ad Management System is designed to be able to serve ads to several thousand radio stations and several hundred thousand campaigns. Although the present invention is described in particular detail in the context of terrestrial radio environments, it is recognized that the present invention can also be used in, for example, satellite radio, Internet streaming, podcasts, cellular telephone, videogames, and other contexts without departing from the principles of embodiments of this invention. - In the described embodiment, each evening, the radio station's automation software sends the station's play schedule for the following day to Audio Ads. See numerals 1-5 in
FIG. 12 . In other embodiments, the play schedule may come at varying times or at regular intervals or periods other than evenings. This schedule will contain the spots that Audio Ads is expected to fill. Audio Ads matches creative to these spots and sends the revised schedule back to the radio station, to be played by the station's automation software. See numerals 6-9 inFIG. 12 . Periodically, for example each day, the station's automation software Audio Ads the actual schedule from the prior period or day, which can be compared against the expected schedule to determine if ads actually played. See numerals 10-12 ofFIG. 12 . As a final check, Audio Ads On-Air Recording system listens to the actual station's broadcast of select stations and through audio fingerprinting techniques verifies that the ads were actually broadcast. Seenumerals FIG. 12 . Play failures are fed back into the Audio Ads system for reporting to advertisers. History has shown that roughly 15% of scheduled spots fail to play, either because of technical failures or because the DJ “talked over” the ad. This problem exists even outside of automation, so the industry has developed a “make good” practice to adjust for play failures, by playing the ad at a later, equivalent time. - In the described embodiment, the
Ad Management system 1200 supports three models for buying available advertising slots: Guaranteed, reserved based on urgency, and Open (also called Auction). - Guaranteed campaigns (also referred to as Spot-Buy campaigns) are promised specific spots on a specified station, date, and daypart. In one embodiment, once the campaign books the spots, it will lose the spot only via play failure or if the forecasted inventory is not published by the station, not through preemption from another campaign booked through the system. Guaranteed campaigns can range in length anywhere up to several months in length, and can be booked up to several months in advance. At times, advertisers place value on knowing that a particular spot will run at a particular time.
- Guaranteed campaigns are not simply an inventory reservation, however, because of the way that the advertisers specify their campaigns. For example, they may not specify which stations and times to play on, instead they provide targeting criteria, such as the number of listeners, listener demographics, the times of day to run, the markets play in, and so forth. Audio Ads then compares those criteria against the available inventory and presents a proposal for meeting those criteria. In one implementation, guaranteed campaigns specify a maximum CPM to pay. Each guaranteed campaign takes as much inventory as it needs to satisfy its campaign goals while keeping within its spending limits and other user-specified criteria. If the advertiser is happy with the station and time mix then they approve the campaign and Audio Ads books it. Specifying campaign goals, viewing the proposal, and finalizing or booking the campaign are all done online through the Audio Ads front end. In one embodiment, the system should take no more than a few seconds (say, 10 seconds) to prepare a proposal once the criteria have been specified. The user must review the proposal and can book it within a few minutes. If the user waits too long to book the proposal, in one implementation, a new proposal will be generated to prevent staleness of the proposal in light of inventory changes.
- In the reserved based on urgency model, campaigns can reserve inventory as in the guaranteed model. However, campaigns with a higher urgency take precedence over campaigns with lower urgency. In one embodiment, spots are presented to the campaign with the highest “urgency”. Each spot is auctioned off in turn. In one embodiment, urgency is defined as being first in time to book, with one approach simply assigning earlier-booked campaigns the highest urgency.
- Open campaigns play on inventory that has not been filled by guaranteed campaigns and can be preempted by guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns are booked according to desired demographics and market criteria and the maximum CPM the advertiser is willing to pay. In one implementation, inventory spots not filled by guaranteed campaigns are filled with open campaigns at the last moment. In one embodiment, a system administrator can set a percentage inventory to set aside for open campaigns that will not be sold to guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns compete among themselves for spots, with the “highest bidder” winning. The “bid” from an open campaign can be based on how well a spot meets the campaign goals in addition to the CPM. Every campaign determines what the spot is worth in terms of the campaign's goals. For example, each campaign evaluates each spot according to the relevant target demographic information for the campaign and adjusts the bid according to the campaign goals based on other criteria, such as time of day, market, etc. The auction process for open campaigns can be run at various intervals, for example, hourly, several times a day, once a day, or at other intervals.
- One factor that complicates the reservation process is that some of the inventory is not well known in advance. Since Audio Ads often only receives the precise schedule, for example, one day in advance but spots can be sold months in advance, it is possible that spots will be sold to a guaranteed campaign that ends up not being made available. Ads also may fail to play because of play failures. Audio Ads addresses the first issue by forecast inventory, though the forecasting may not be precise. The second issue is addressed after the fact. Since it is a goal of the system to meet 100% of the guaranteed campaign requirements, Audio Ads monitors guaranteed campaigns in progress and adds additional “make good” spots whenever spots are lost or fail to play. In one embodiment the user can enable or disable make goods.
- The Audio Ads Inventory Management System (IMS) 1300 is responsible for matching advertising campaigns to available advertising spots on the radio stations or other broadcast technologies serviced. Campaigns are usually specified as a set of constraints or criteria that the campaign must meet, such as markets the ad will play in, demographics it should reach, the number of listeners who should hear it, and the times of the day (dayparts) during which it should run. Radio stations typically publish the available spots one day in advance. In one embodiment, this inventory is then matched to the campaigns to satisfy the maximum number of campaigns. Since spots will be more valuable to some campaigns than to others (for example, the demographics of a certain spot may match one campaign but not another), it is desirable to optimize the allocation of spots across multiple campaigns.
- In one embodiment, inventory is known just one day in advance, but campaigns generally are booked days, weeks, or months in advance. Campaigns are frequently timed to match external events such as sales or movie releases, so predictability can be important. The Audio
Ads IMS system 1300 deals with these competing factors by forecasting inventory. Currently, a simple exponential smoothing method is used to forecast inventory many months in advance. In other embodiments, the method accounts for trends or seasonality. Alternatively, different forecasting models are applied on a station by station basis. -
FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing elements in scalable IMS (Inventory Management System) 1300 used to schedule advertisements in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Thesystem 1300 places radio ads on select radio stations, matching advertiser campaigns and creatives with available advertising spots on radio stations. - The
External Interface 1304 provides external access to thesystem 1300 through aUI 1302, examples of which are shown above inFIG. 9 .UI 1302 interacts with the rest ofsystem 1300 to create and manage campaigns and for reporting. A Station Inventory Manager (SIM) 1314 manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains information about each spot such as whether it is an actual available spot or a forecast spot; whether it is available, reserved, or booked; the priority of the campaign that booked it; when it was booked; who booked it; and so forth. AForecaster 1316 is responsible for updating the inventory based on the radio station schedule. It can provide exact information for upcoming spots or may forecast future spots based on past history. A Campaign Manager (CM) 1313 manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play. On a regular basis,SIMs 1314 record their current allocations to persistent storage. ACreative Assigner 1317 then assigns creatives to spots (using the allocations produced by the SIMs 1314) and produces the final play list. - Each of the components in the diagram can be implemented as a separate process and could be allocated to its own machine. In other embodiments, however, for efficiency purposes, multiple SIMs will be grouped together in one task, and the Forecaster will be implemented as classes and run within the SIM's JVM (if the SIM is implemented in Java).
- An overview of each of the components of
system 1300 is given below. - All external access to the
system 1300 goes through the External Interface. The External Interface provides methods for creating and managing campaigns and for examining inventory. Methods for creating and managing campaigns will be used by the Audio Ads front-end to provide the advertiser user interface. Methods for examining inventory will be used primarily by reporting tools. - The Station Inventory Manager (SIM) manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains a list of all known spots for that station and automatically allocates spots to particular campaigns. Since spots are forecasted, it is possible for a campaign to book a spot that later disappears from inventory. Whenever a booked spot is removed from inventory, the Campaign Manager that owns that spot will try to make up the loss.
- Each spot in the inventory has a priority which matches the priority of the campaign that allocated the spot. When a campaign requests spots from the SIM, the SIM can allocate unassigned spots or spots with a lower priority than the requesting campaign. In this way, each campaign has a different view of available inventory that depends on the campaign priority. This feature is intended to allow different campaign types, such as guaranteed campaigns (where specific spots are sold in advance) and open campaigns (where spots can be taken by someone willing to pay more). It also allows urgent, high priority campaigns to take inventory from less important campaigns. If necessary to reduce memory requirements, inventory older than one day may be discarded.
- Spots in the inventory have, among other attributes, a unique identifier, a play date, a play time, a length, an accuracy (actual or forecast), a booking status (available, reserved, or booked), a priority (taken from the priority of the booking campaign), a booking date, and a booking campaign. These attributes are merely examples. In other embodiments, spots in inventory may have a greater or lesser number of attributes.
- Spots can be reserved on a temporary basis by a campaign so that a potential buy can be displayed to a user for approval. If the spots are not booked within the timeout period they will be returned to inventory in the same state they were in before the reservation. A campaign may only book spots that it has previously reserved. In one implementation, reserved spots cannot be reserved or booked by campaigns at the same or lower priority than the owning campaign.
- Campaigns do not query inventory but instead request to reserve or book inventory. This avoids concurrency issues that would arise if a campaign requests a view of inventory but that inventory is taken by another campaign before the first campaign can reserve it. All reservations and bookings are automatic so that a campaign can be guaranteed that spots that it has booked actually belong to it. Of course, campaigns with a higher priority can still take that inventory from the booking campaign, which will need to book alternate spots to make up for the loss. For reporting and recovery purposes, the SIM will support general queries of existing inventory, but such queries should be infrequent.
- When a campaign requests spots, it should make a request such as “reserve N spots of this length on this day and in this daypart”. The SIM will search its inventory and do the best it can to honor the request while taking into account station rules such as maximum number of spots assigned to a single campaign, no back-to-back spots assigned to a single campaign, and so forth. The SIM manages stitching issues by coalescing adjacent shorter spots when possible and by preferentially fulfilling requests with stitched spots. For example, if a SIM has a 60-second spot available, it may assign half of it to a 30-second campaign and then assign the second half to the very next 30-second campaign.
- The following sequence of events takes place in response to requests:
- On reserve:
- matching spots are removed from inventory
- the reservation is timed so that spots can be restored after the timeout
- On book (only reserved spots can be booked):
- the spots are allocated to the booking campaign
- On release (either explicit or via timeout):
- if the spot is currently booked: the spot is marked as available
- if the spot is currently reserved: the spot is returned to its pre-reservation state
- The Campaign Manager manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play.
- When a campaign is booked, a Campaign Manager is created for that campaign which then attempts to reserve (and subsequently book) the inventory that will fill the campaign goals. It queries the
Metrics Manager 1308 to learn of radio stations, AQH, CPM, etc., and determine which stations it should attempt to buy from. There will be anInventory Snapshot 1318 available to the Campaign Manager that holds a slightly stale view of inventory. This snapshot can be used to refine the initial inventory request. For example, a campaign may wish to spread its purchases equally across markets and may need to know its chances of getting inventory in specific markets before finalizing the purchases. If any of its purchases are unsuccessful, the Campaign Manager will attempt to buy alternate spots until its goals are met. - As inventory changes due to higher priority campaigns taking inventory or because of play failures, the Campaign Manager will learn of these changes. When inventory is lost the Campaign Manager must attempt to “make good” by buying alternate spots. The Campaign Manager will attempt to buy a spot that is roughly equivalent to the spot that was lost. No other considerations will be taken when buying a “make-good” spot.
- The Campaign Manager does not know the precise state of the inventory when it determines what buys to attempt. It should request N spots from the radio stations in its market within the days and dayparts that meet its criteria, while in one embodiment making a small number of large requests rather than a large number of small requests. Some of those requests will succeed and others will fail or will be only partially fulfilled. Once the Campaign Manager knows the status of all its requests, it will determine if additional buy attempts are needed to meet its goals. It may be possible that, to meet proper market or daypart distribution, a Campaign Manager will want to return spots to inventory. This is allowed if the spots have been reserved but not yet booked, and the returned spots will revert to their prior status. However, this mechanism is expected to be a small fraction of total buys.
- A campaign can be paused, in which case no spots for that campaign will be actually played (unless they have already been queued to the station). The spots will not be returned to inventory unless the campaign is cancelled. If spots from a paused campaign need to be filled, they will be auctioned off by the Auctioneer. When a campaign is resumed it should not lose any of its inventory, except what was auctioned off because its play time has passed. The primary purpose for pausing a campaign would be to temporarily block a campaign because the account holder has not paid its bills. If the account is cancelled, all campaigns for that account should be cancelled; if the account is reactivated, all paused campaigns should be resumed.
- If a campaign is cancelled, the Campaign Manager should release its entire inventory. The SIM provides functionality for releasing all inventory belonging to a specific campaign over a range of dates.
- As described below in connection with
FIGS. 15B and 16B ,campaign manager 1313 can bid in accordance with a criterion, including an external criterion. - In the above-described embodiment, campaign pricing is currently determined on a campaign-by-campaign basis through negotiation with the advertiser booking the campaign. This is especially true of nationwide campaigns that buy guaranteed spots. In other embodiments, however, pricing is more dynamic and able to be set online or automatically while booking the campaign. In the embodiment of
FIG. 12 , theCampaign Manager 1313 uses a Pricing Engine to determine the price of spots it buys. The price from the Pricing Engine is passed to the SIM, which uses it to determine which campaigns to prefer when allocating inventory. - In one embodiment, the Pricing Engine associates each spot with a price at which a Campaign Manager can reserve it as part of a guaranteed campaign. In one implementation, the pricing set by the engine may vary based on buy type, buyer, and/or other factors.
- In one embodiment, the Pricing Engine is part of the Campaign Manager. In other embodiments, the Pricing Engine is a component separate from the
CM 1313. - The Metrics Manager has the job of maintaining and providing station metrics for all stations supported by
IMS 1300. The Campaign Manager can learn all relevant information about potential inventory from the Metrics Manager. In some embodiments,IMS 1300 also contains a business layer that determines, for example, which stations are online, what is a station's format, and what is a station's market. In other embodiments, these functions are also performed by the Metrics Manager. Metrics Manager also tells the Campaign Manager what demographics a station caters to, and what their listener numbers are. TheCampaign Manager 1313 accesses theMetrics Manager 1308 andbusiness layer 1309 to receive information. For example, the Campaign Manager can request the average listeners as reported by Arbitron for certain dayparts on certain stations. Alternatively, data from other survey or research companies can be used. The Campaign Manager can further request from theMetrics Manager 1308 data corresponding only to a specific demographic at which the campaign is targeted. - In one embodiment, the
Metrics Manager 1308 holds all its data in a database. In one implementation, the Metrics Manager supports various metrics for calculating the value of spots for particular campaigns on alternate research besides Arbitron data. The Campaign Manager can indicate which research or metric type to use, and the Metrics Manager finds and normalizes the data before returning the values. - The Forecaster's primary responsibility is to predict and adjust inventory for a station. For efficiency purposes, the Forecaster may run in the same process as the
SIM 1314. - At the end of each day or other period, as the station's schedule is confirmed and the schedule performance for the prior day or period becomes known, the Forecaster should recalculate both known and expected inventory for the coming days or periods. This forecast will add new spots to inventory, remove existing spots from inventory, or adjust the play time of existing spots. If inventory is lost, the owning campaign is notified so that it can buy additional, “make-good” inventory. Note that in one embodiment, when determining which spot to eliminate, the spot within the daypart with the lowest priority should be removed.
- Inventory for the immediate future should be known precisely, while inventory further in the future is being predicted. The accuracy of the prediction should be marked in the inventory and adjusted as the data becomes more precise. For example, spots for “tomorrow” might be accurate to the minute, while spots for “next month” might be accurate only to a daypart. In addition to accuracy, the forecaster also predicts the reliability of the inventory, based on an analysis of prior station performance and the accuracy of the forecast. If a station frequently schedules inventory but then fails to play it, this will be reflected in the reliability. Spot reliability may be used by the campaign buyer to evaluate the quality of the campaign.
- When inventory is moved to more accurate times, it may be possible that the spots within a daypart can no longer be correctly allocated to all the campaigns that have booked spots within that daypart. For example, it may become impossible to place two spots from the same campaign because they would play too close to each other. If this should happen, the Forecaster will need to take inventory from a campaign and deallocate it. Campaign Managers are notified of any spots they lose.
- In one embodiment,
forecaster 1316 uses a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method, which takes into account both trends and seasonality. The architecture supports applying different forecasting models on a station by station basis. - While the actual computation of the forecast is very fast, especially with exponential smoothing methods which can complete their computation with the addition of just a single new number, updating the inventory can be computationally expensive. The reason for this is that the Forecaster must update existing inventory by adding new spots, removing lost spots, or adjusting the play time of existing spots. Therefore, in one embodiment, the Forecaster either maintains its own copy of all existing inventory, or it queries the SIM to learn its inventory. It then calculates deltas from existing inventory to new inventory and applies the changes. For these reasons it is expected that the Forecaster will best be implemented in the same process as the SIM so that expensive, large-payload process-to-process communication is avoided.
- Since the inventory update process only adds, removes, or adjusts the play time of inventory, it should be able to execute while the SIM is processing requests from the Campaign Managers. One time this would be an issue is if an update of an existing spot changes its daypart after a campaign has bought the spot but before the response has been sent, since the Campaign Manager would thus receive stale data which might alter its goal calculations. To avoid this, changes to a spot's play time (which occurs infrequently) should be synchronized with spot reservation.
- At the end of each day the
Play Verifier 1319 examines the play history for each station and determine if spots that were allocated failed to play. The owning Campaign Manager is notified for each failure. In one embodiment, Campaign Managers attempt to make good any play failures. - When the final play list needs to be generated for a station, the Creative Assigner will read the persistent allocations written by the SIM(s), assign creatives to specific spots (allocations), and make the play list available to the Audio Server. As described below in connection with
FIG. 16A ,creative assigner 1317 can perform copysplitting in accordance with a criterion, such as an external criterion or a criterion based on effectiveness of previous plays. - The Auctioneer performs an auction on a regular basis when there are spots to be sold to open campaigns that have not be sold to guaranteed campaigns. The number of campaigns competing for the spots can potentially be quite large.
- The method for performing the auction is as follows:
-
- The Auctioneer opens bidding for unsold spots.
- Open Campaign Managers that are interested in the station examine the Inventory Snapshot to determine what spots may potentially be bid upon.
- Each Open Campaign Manager sends its bids to the Auctioneer.
- The Auctioneer waits a reasonable amount of time for all bids to come in. This interval should be short enough to ensure timely completion of the auction but lengthy enough that normal latency is accounted for.
- The Auctioneer picks the winning bid and books the spot with the SIM.
- The Auctioneer notifies all winning Campaign Managers so that they can update their campaign status.
- In one embodiment, the auction is run on a scheduled basis. Bidding will remain open for a number of minutes determined via configuration, for example about 10 minutes. Open Campaign Managers must examine the schedule and place bids in a timely manner. However, not all campaigns bid at the same time. In one embodiment, Open Campaign Managers will randomize the times at which they will place bids, to reduce peak bandwidth requirements.
- Since the auction is only taking place for unallocated spots within, for example, one single day, the auction is expected to execute quickly.
- While the above architecture will handle campaigns of all types and requirements, the special requirements of Open Campaigns can cause a rather large flood of inventory grabs and subsequent losses as higher priority campaigns take those spots. Open Campaigns have market and demographics requirements, but they are designed to take only inventory not allocated to guaranteed campaigns.
- Following the above architecture, an Open Campaign would grab all available inventory in its desired markets, up to its price cap. This can be a large number of spots. Further, current business requirements demand that all Open Campaigns compete fairly for inventory, so as new Open Campaigns book inventory, they must, on a random basis, bump other Open Campaigns from their spots. Finally, Open Campaigns have the lowest priority of all campaigns, so as higher priority campaigns are booked, it is possible that the majority of spots they take will already be owned by an Open Campaign. Therefore, in these cases, a Campaign Manager should be notified.
- These characteristics of Open Campaigns suggest that, for efficiency purposes, they should be handled separately from other campaigns. That mechanism is described here.
- Rather than reserving inventory when an Open Campaign is booked, Open Campaigns will instead compete in an auction for unallocated spots just prior to the spots being published to the allocation list. It will typically cover all unsold inventory for one single day, but the timeframe can be more or less than one day.
- The auction to fill spots runs before the SIM publishes its allocations. After the auction has run, allocations may be published. The Creative Assigner then reads the published allocations, assigns creatives, and writes the final play list. Any spots still left unfilled are delivered to the Audio Server unallocated, which will typically result in, for example, a Public Service Announcement being played in that spot. In one embodiment,
system 1300 sends more than one ad in the stream to the target (such as a radio station or podcast target). Both ads are initially sent and at a later time, but before either of the ads is played, the system sends an indication of which ad should be played. In another embodiment, both ads are played, but thesystem 1300 sends an indication of their relative percentage of play time. - In one embodiment,

FIG. 14 shows tables used in an embodiment of the invention. These include a campaign table 1402; and a campaign events target table 1404. These events can be feedback based events as described herein.FIG. 14 further shows a campaign event target details table 1406 (one for each criterion); a campaign audio targeting table 1408, an audio targeting timeblocks table 1410; a campaign event type table 1412; an audio targeting formats table 1414; an arb_formats table 1416; an audio targeting markets table 1418; a timeblocks table 1420; and an arb_markets table 1422. - The tables supporting use of feedback include the campaign event target details table 1406, which can occur for each criterion set by the advertiser. These criteria can relate to creative placement (i.e., copysplitting), in which case the system references the campaign audio targeting table 1408. These criteria can also relate to the campaign and where and when it places ads, in which case, the system references the campaigns table 1402.
- All campaign events have a campaign
event type ID 1412, which includes a name, description, threshold description, and an upper and lower limit, which are preferably used for error checking. Assume, for example, the advertiser specifies “if the pollen count is above W use a CPM of X and above Y use a CPM of Z. In this example, there would be two instances of an event 1406: one for a pollen count of W and one for a pollen count of Z. Eachevent 1406 includes an event type ID 1454 (i.e, pollen count, temperature, sports scores, etc) as discussed above. It also contains a targetingID 1456 which specifies whether it is related to creatives or campaigns. It also contains athreshold type flag 1458, which specifies whether the criterion depends on a value being greater than, lesser than, equal to, or some other measurement, as discussed above. Here, the threshold type flags would be indicates “greater than.” It also contains athreshold value 1460. Here, the values for the first event would be W and for the second event would be Y. If the criterion relates to using a specific CPM if a criterion is met, the table 1406 contains aCPM value 1462. Here the first event would have a CPM of X and the second event would have a criterion of Z. If the events are campaign based (as in this example), they are used to help schedule campaigns as discussed further below. - If the event is creative based, it is not used for scheduling, but to decide which creative to play in a particular spot. Table 1408 contains a
campaign ID 1463, afile ID 1464, which identifies the specific creative that will play if the criterion is met (and the rule/event containing the criterion is not trumped by another rule), and aweight 1466. In this embodiment, the weight denotes a percentage of total time that the creative is to play in a particular spot. -
FIG. 15A is a flow chart showing 1560 a method used byCampaign Manager 1313. This flow chart shows actions performed byCM 1313 and other elements ofsystem 1300 to determine effective slots in which to place ads in accordance with an advertiser-entered criterion in a guaranteed campaign. Inelement 1563,CM 1313 receives from an advertiser at least one criterion for using different creatives. Inelement 1561,CM 1313 receives from an advertiser demographics for the campaign. For example, the advertiser may specify that the campaign is directed toward adults age 18-24. Inelement 1562,CM 1313 receives a station format from the advertiser (for example, light rock). Inelement 1567,CM 1313 receives a daypart from the advertiser (such as morning drive time). The order of at least elements 1563-1567 can change in other embodiments. Other embodiments can receive other information from advertisers that may affect play of advertising or other creatives. The front end communicates 1596 with a business layer to identify a list of stations that fit the user's specifications (which can include formats, etc.). This information is passed to the CM with other user inputs. Inelement 1566,CM 1313 knows what spots are available from the SIMs inventory.CM 1313 communicates with the Metrics Manager to find relevant demographic and other data for those slots. The CM requests price information for the slots from the SIMs. Inelement 1564,CM 1313 calculates CPM in accordance with a price and a number of listeners in slot. -
CPM=price for slot/#1000 listeners for slot - In
element 1565,CM 1313 uses the calculated CPM to determine the estimated efficacy of the slot based on the campaign criteria. Inelement 1568,CM 1313 requests or reserves from theSIM 1314 the most effective slots. Inelement 1569, Creative Assigner decides which creative to play in a requested slot. An example of this element is shown inFIG. 16A . -
FIG. 15B is aflow chart 1570 showing a method used byCampaign Manager 1313. This flow chart shows actions performed byCM 1313 to determine effective slots in which to place ads in accordance with an advertiser-entered criterion in an Open campaign. - In
element 1571,CM 1313 receives from an advertiser demographics for the campaign. For example, the advertiser may specify that the campaign is directed toward adults age 18-24. Inelement 1572,CM 1313 receives a station format from the advertiser (for example, light rock). Inelement 1577,CM 1313 receives a daypart from the advertiser (such as morning drive time). The order of at least elements 1571-1577 can change in other embodiments. Other embodiments can receive other information from advertisers that may affect placement of advertising or other creatives. Inelement 1573,CM 1313 receives a fixed CPM value from the advertiser. The advertiser may enter alternative CPMs and a criterion (such as a value for pollen count). Inelement 1576, theCM 1313 gets inventory list from the SIMs and a station list that matches (for example) the specified format(s) from the front-end. Inelement 1574, theCM 1313 communicates with SIMs to find available spots and their price and communicates withMetrics Manager 1308 to find a number of listeners in the target demographic and possibly other data for those slots. Inelement 1580,CM 1313 checks information relevant to the criterion to determine which CPM to use (i.e., it checks the received information against the criterion). Inelement 1575,CM 1313 calculates a maximum price that it would bid in accordance with a price and a number of listeners in slot. -
Max price for slot=#1000 listeners for slot×CPM - In
element 1578,CM 1313 uses the calculated max price to communicate withSIM 1314 to bid on spots. Inelement 1579, Creative Assigner decides which creative to play in a slot resulting from the auction. An example of this element is shown inFIG. 16A . -
FIG. 16A is aflow chart 1600 showing a copysplitting method used byCampaign Manager 1313 that depends on a criterion. In the described embodiment, this method is performed byCreative Assigner 1317. In other embodiments, the method could be performed by other appropriate portions of the system or apportioned between more than one part of the system - Note that, in one embodiment, the method of
FIG. 16A is performed both for open campaigns and for guaranteedcampaigns 1601. If a criterion is met 1604 (for example if the pollen count is a specified value), then a first creative is scheduled in such a way that it plays for a first percentage of time, while a second creative is scheduled so that it plays for a second percentage of time. This is known as copy-splitting, although here, the percentage of the copy-splitting is dependent on the evaluated criterion. - The criterion can be an external criterion, as discussed above, such as pollen count, weather, and so on. In some embodiments, multiple criteria can be specified. In these cases, the advertiser can set the order of priority for overlapping or conflicting rules.
-
FIG. 16B is aflowchart 1650 showing a method of a bidding rule used by thecampaign manager 1313 in accordance with a criterion, such as an external criterion. Note that, in one embodiment, the method ofFIG. 16B is performed foropen campaigns 1651. It will be understood that this bidding rule is only one of a plurality of rules used to schedule creatives. The plurality of rules can be overlapping. In one embodiment, an advertiser can rank the rules to indicate which is followed if there is conflict. In the described embodiment, this method is performed byCampaign Manager 1313. In other embodiments, the method could be performed by other appropriate portions of the system or apportioned between more than one part of the system. - If a criterion is met 1654, then the
CM 1313 uses a first CPM to calculate a first max bid price. Otherwise 1658, it uses a second CPM to calculate a second max bid amount. Some embodiments employ multiple conditional bids that may conflict and overlap. The user can specify the priority of those conditional rules. Some embodiments allow multiple criteria in a single rule (i.e., both criteria must be met for the rule to be satisfied). -
FIG. 17A shows an example 1700 of using feedback from previous plays of an ad spot. In this example, the advertiser is paying based on CPI (cost per inquiry) and using an open (auction) method. The system receives 1704 a CPI that the advertiser is willing to pay and a maximum budget for the campaign, along with other campaign goals. Budgets may be by day, week, month, or other specified time periods. If the campaign is a hybrid campaign, then the advertiser also specifies a minimum CPM value (input B of element 1704). The system determines initial slots for the campaign. This may be accomplished by simply allocating a percentage of open slots to first-time campaigns with no bidding needed, or by human beings or the system estimating a starting CPM based on historical knowledge about the advertiser or on knowledge of the field. Then, the system waits for a period of time (such as an hour, a day, a week or some other time period) while the spot initially plays in advertiser-selectedmarkets 1706. While the spot is having initial play, a third party system and/or a portion of system 1300 (not shown) collects data about the effectiveness of the spot in various times and markets. - For example, the spot may have played in Houston and San Antonio at roughly the same days, time, and number of plays. The system generates 1712 an effective CPM using, for example, one of formulas A or B, for each station and daypart. Effective CPM could also be determined for other attributes such as each creative, each format, each audience demographic, and so on. If the collected feedback data indicates that the Houston spot generated 4 inquiries and the San Antonio spot generated 2 inquiries for a particular daypart, the cost per inquiry that the advertiser has agreed to pay is $10, and the two stations have roughly the same number of listeners (e.g., one thousand) then the CPMs for that daypart are (using calculation A in element 1712):
-
Houston effective CPM=40×$10/#1000 listeners in daypart=4×10/1=$40 -
San Antonio effective CPM=20×$10/#1000 listeners in daypart=2×10/1=$20 - In a hybrid system using a min CPM of $30, the cost would be:
-
Houston effective CPM=greater of (30, (4×$10/1)=$40 -
San Antonio effective CPM=greater of (30, (2×$10/1)=$30 - The system will bid the effective CPM in each relevant station and
daypart auction 1718. This method is repeated periodically 1720 to fine-tune the advertiser's bidding. -
FIG. 17B shows another example 1750 of using feedback from previous plays of an ad spot. In this example, the advertiser is paying based on CPM (cost per thousand listeners). The system receives 1754 a CPM that the advertiser is willing to pay and a maximum budget for the campaign, along with other campaign goals. Budgets may be by day, week, month, or other specified time periods. Then, the system waits for a period of time (such as an hour, a day, a week or some other time period) while the spot initially plays in advertiser-selected markets. While the spot is having initial play, a third party system and/or a portion of system 1300 (not shown) collects data about the effectiveness of the spot in various times and markets. - For example, the spot may have played in Houston and San Antonio at roughly the same days, time, and number of plays. The system generates 1762 a cost per targeted response (“CTR”) cost per call for each creative, station and daypart. CTR could also be determined for other attributes such as each format, each audience demographic, and so on. If the collected feedback data indicates that the Houston spot generated 4 inquiries and the San Antonio spot generated 2 inquiries for a particular daypart, and the cost of the spots are each $100:
-
Houston CTR=$100/4=$25 -
San Antonio CTR=$100/2=$50 - The system will determine 1768 which station/daypart(s)/creative minimize cost per targeted response, taking campaign goals into account and without exceeding max dollars. The system (or the system with the advertiser's approval) will then change 1769 the percentage of the total budget (or total amount) spent on most effective station/dayparts(s). In some embodiments, instead of or in addition to changing the budget allocation, the system may change the percentage of play of creatives to play effective creatives more often. This method is repeated periodically to fine-tune the advertiser's spending (not shown).
