Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to machine learning. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating health diagnostic information from an audio recording or other audio data.
- many health disorders can manifest symptoms that are subtle or otherwise difficult for both lay persons as well as professional health care providers to detect or accurately quantify. For example, some health disorders may cause minor variations in the patient's speaking ability or style. Others can affect sonic characteristics of coughs and sneezes.
- EP 3 200 188 A1 discloses methods comprising: a) computing from audio data uttered by at least one first mathematical audio transformation function to obtain a first time series representation of said audio data; b) computing at least one second mathematical audio transformation function, equal or different to the first mathematical function, over said obtained first time series representation to obtain a second time series representation of the audio data; c) segmenting said first and second time series representations into one or more timestamps; d) computing one or more different measures by using the one or more timestamps and the first and second time series representations; and e) using the one or more different computed measures to train a machine learning algorithm which computes a score for assessing a disease.
- WO 2010/123483 A2 discloses speech data that includes a series of signal-on time periods separated by signal-free time periods, represented by separating the speech data into a series of utterances separated by pauses, wherein an utterance is defined to include at least a first signal-on time period and to have at least a duration of a minimum utterance duration, and a pause is defined to include at least a first signal-free time period.
- the presented speech data can be evaluated based on at least one of durations of pauses, durations of utterances, and frequency values within the utterances to, for example, gain information about the health state of subject having produced the speech data.
- One aspect of the present invention is directed to a computing system as defined in claim 1.
- Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a computer-implemented method as defined in claim 8.
- a further aspect of the invention is directed to a computer program as defined in claim 15.
- the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods that include or otherwise leverage use of a machine-learned health model to provide a diagnosis of a potential health disorder based on an audio recording or other audio data of a patient.
- the health model can receive a patient audio recording (e.g., of the patient speaking or making non-word sounds or utterances such as coughing, sneezing, etc.) and, in response, provide a diagnostic score that describes information associated with a potential health disorder.
- the patient audio recording can contain the patient speaking, and the diagnostic score can contain information about (e.g., identifying, predicting severity of) potential health disorders.
- systems and methods of the present disclosure can operate to generate or provide health information (e.g., a diagnosis of the existence and/or severity of a particular heath disorder) based on an audio recording of a patient and/or other patient information.
- the systems and methods of the present disclosure can include or be performed by one or more computing devices, including, as examples, a user computing device (e.g., a smartphone, laptop, computing device able to be worn, an embedded computing device, etc.), a diagnostic computing device (e.g., as operated by a health provider), as a service by a server computing device over a network, and/or other arrangements of computing devices.
- audio data collection can be performed across a constellation of devices that can interoperate, including mobile phones, kiosks/small monitors, desktops, and/or devices that are able to be worn such as headsets and on-attire devices.
- the patient/user can be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., audio recordings of the patient's speech).
- user information e.g., audio recordings of the patient's speech
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user.
- the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
- the systems and methods of the present disclosure can include or otherwise leverage use of a machine-learned health model to provide the diagnosis information.
- the health model can include a diagnostic model that is trained to receive the patient audio recording or information describing the patient audio recording (e.g., a spectrogram), and in response, output the diagnostic score.
- the health model can perform real-time analysis on audio data without storing the data.
- the term "recording" is used to refer to any audio data, whether stored or analyzed in real time.
- the health model can additionally include a sound model.
- the sound model can be trained to receive the patient audio recording and, in response to receipt of the patient audio recording, output sound description data that contains information about the patient audio recording.
- the diagnostic model can be trained to receive the sound description data, and in response to receipt of the sound description data, output the diagnostic score.
- each of the sound model and diagnostic model can be or include one or more machine-learned models such as, for example, an artificial neural network ("neural network”), such as, for example, a convolutional neural network.
- the diagnostic score can contain information diagnosing or identifying the health disorder.
- the diagnostic score can describe a predicted severity or likelihood (e.g., of the presence or absence) of a health disorder.
- the diagnostic score can describe a predicted severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- the diagnostic score can include a predicted functional rating scale (FRS) score, a metric used in the medical profession to quantify the progression of ALS in patients.
- the diagnostic score can describe the severity of a health condition or medical symptom, such as pain. The diagnostic score can describe whether the patient requires urgent medical care or can describe a predicted urgency associated with a need for medical attention.
- the diagnostic score can identify a specific health disorder from a set of potential health disorders.
- the diagnostic score can include a name or category of one or more health disorder(s) that has been identified based on information contained within the patient audio recording.
- the diagnostic score can include a list of two or more potential health disorders, and optionally, associated ranks, likelihoods, severities, etc. Examples of potential health disorders that the health model can be trained to diagnose include cranial nerve dysfunction, depression, autism (e.g., Asperger Syndrome), post-traumatic stress disorder, dementia, ALS, and Parkinson's disease.
- Additional applications can include identifying and alerting the user about the need for immediate or emergency medical treatment for the patient (e.g., in evaluation phone calls) and/or assessing a pain level experienced by the patient.
- the health model can find application in identifying or diagnosing any medical condition that manifests itself in the voice of the patient.
- the sound description data can contain a variety of information about the patient audio recording that can be useful for diagnosing potential health disorders. More particularly, in some implementations, the sound description data can describe sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) recognized in the patient audio recording.
- the sound description data can include a set of word sounds (e.g., words, syllables, phonemes, etc.) that have been recognized (e.g., by the sound model) in the patient audio recording.
- a set of word sounds is sometimes referred to as a "bag of words", “bag of syllables", “bag of phonemes”, etc.
- the sound description data can also include a set of confidence values respectively associated with the set of identified words sounds.
- the sound description data can describe a comparison between words recognized in the patient audio recording and a predetermined text string (e.g., a sentence or phrase).
- the patient audio recording can contain a recording of the patient reading or otherwise uttering the predetermined text string out loud.
- the sound model can be trained to recognize the words sounds in the patient audio and output sound description data that describes a comparison between the recognized word sounds and the predetermined text string.
- the comparison can indicate a number of words or sounds correctly spoken, a percentage of words or sounds correctly spoken, a number or percentage of words or sounds not correctly spoken, a matching score, and/or other forms of comparison.
- the resulting comparison can be indicative of the patient's ability to intelligibly enunciate specific syllables or phonemes contained in the words of the predetermined text string.
- the sound description data can describe a lack of expected sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds). This information can be indicative of the identity, severity, or likelihood of a potential health disorder.
- the sound model in response to receiving a patient audio recording that indicates difficulty enunciating, can output a transcript that contains information about such difficulties.
- some health disorders e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction
- the sound description data can describe additional information about speech in the patient audio recording.
- the sound description data can describe word rate, rhythm, tone, volume, hoarse voice, cadence, syllabic emphasis, pitch, timbre, etc.
- the sound description data can include a set of non-word sounds and a set of associated confidence values.
- the sound model can be trained to identify a wide variety of non-word sounds, such as coughing or sneezing.
- the sound model can be trained to recognize a wide variety of sounds including some that are generally not present in a recording of speech (e.g., musical instruments, doors closing, car engines etc.).
- the sound description data can sometimes contain confidence values associated with sounds that are not present in the patient audio recording. Nonetheless, this information can be predictive of health disorders, and thus be useful as an input into the machine-learned diagnostic model (e.g., as contained in the sound description data). This information could be referred to as a sonic "fingerprint" of the patient audio recording or as containing "biomarkers" that may be indicative of certain health states of the speaker.
- the sound description data includes an embedding provided by the sound model (e.g., by a final layer and/or a hidden layer of the sound model).
- the sound model includes a machine-learned audio classification model
- the sound description data includes an embedding provided by a hidden layer of the machine-learned audio classification model.
- the embedding can contain information that can be more descriptive of characteristics of the patient audio recording than a simple classification of sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) that are recognized in the patient audio recording. This can be particularly useful where, as indicated above, the sound model is trained to recognize sounds that may not be present in a recording of speech (e.g., musical instruments, doors closing, car engines etc.).
- the embedding can still contain useful information correlating features of such sounds with sounds in the patient audio recording. Although they may not be correctly identified by the sound model, the embedding can still provide information that is useful for diagnosing the health disorder.
- the patient audio recording can be divided into segments (e.g., by the sound model or according to a pre-processing scheme), and the segments can be used to generate the diagnostic score.
- the patient audio recording can be divided into segments of equal length in time (e.g., 1 second).
- the segments can be consecutive and non-overlapping.
- the segments can be overlapping.
- the sound description data can describe sounds that have been identified (e.g., by the sound model) within one or more of the segments.
- the sound description data can contain a set of identified sounds (e.g., words, non-words sounds) within the segments.
- the sound description data can also include a set of confidence values or weights associated with the identified sounds. Sound description data can be generated for each segment individually or can be respectively generated for various combinations of two or more segments (e.g., a combination of every consecutive pair of segments).
- a set of segment scores can be generated (e.g., based on the sound description data) that are respectively associated with the set of segments, and the diagnostic score can then be generated based on the set of segment scores.
- the diagnostic model can generate segment scores for some or all of the segments.
- the segment scores can be mathematically combined (e.g., averaged) to generate the diagnostic score.
- a set of confidence values can be generated (e.g., by the diagnostic model) that are associated with the segment scores. Calculating the diagnostic score can include calculating a weighted average of the segment scores that is weighted according to the set of confidences.
- Other techniques for combining segment scores can be used as well, including, for example, median techniques, outlier removal techniques, etc.
- the health model can include an attention model or an aggregation model that is trained to receive the segment scores, and in response to receiving the segment scores, generate the diagnostic score.
- the attention model or aggregation model can be or include a neural network, such a recurrent neural network.
- the attention or aggregation model can be trained on sequences of segment scores that have been labeled with a known diagnostic score. Thus, the attention or aggregation model can be trained to receive the sequence of segment scores and produce a diagnostic score based on such sequence.
- the patient audio recording can be pre-processed.
- Pre-processing of the patient audio recording can include removing at least one silent or quiet portion of the patient audio recording.
- quiet or silent portions can be defined as having sound levels below a predetermined threshold level.
- the health model or other system component can remove such quiet or silent portions before the patient audio recording is input into the sound model, which can improve the performance of the sound model.
- spectrograms can be generated that describe energy and/or frequency content of the patient audio recording.
- the spectrograms can characterize the energy distribution across time and frequency of the patient's speech patterns and/or non-speech vocal sounds (e.g. breathing, coughing, wheezing, etc.).
- the spectrograms can be input into the sound model and/or diagnostic model (e.g., in addition or alternatively to the raw audio data of the recording).
- a spectrogram that describes a set of frequencies and/or corresponding intensities e.g., sound levels
- the spectrogram can be generated using a variety of techniques, including, for example, Fourier transform (e.g., fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and/or the like).
- the spectrograms can be represented in color (e.g., in a color space such as RGB).
- the audio recording can include multiple channels (e.g., stereo) and can be collected from a plurality of sources (e.g., a microphone array).
- the spectrograms can describe spatial information associated with the audio recording.
- the spatial information can be used to identify sources of various sounds in the recording. This may be particularly useful for devices configured to be worn by the user as the spatial information can be used to distinguish between sounds produced by the user or by another nearby audio source.
- the spectrograms can be represented in grayscale.
- the sound model can be trained to identify sounds represented by the spectrogram.
- the spectral features can be augmented with target acoustic parameters characterizing, for example, pitch tracks, spectro-temporal modulation, syllable rate, etc.
- the health model can be trained to detect changes in diagnosis over time for a given patient. More specifically, in some implementations, the health model can be trained to detect changes in patient audio recordings received at different times for the same patient.

Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to machine learning. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating health diagnostic information from an audio recording or other audio data.
- Currently, medical evaluations or consultations with doctors, nurses, or other qualified medical personnel are generally required to receive diagnostic information about potential health issues. In person consultations, however, can be time consuming, expensive, or inconvenient. Recently, telemedicine (e.g., consultations through video conferencing) has become more prevalent. While this provides improved access to medical professionals, telemedicine still requires the time and attention of a qualified medical expert.
- Additionally, many health disorders can manifest symptoms that are subtle or otherwise difficult for both lay persons as well as professional health care providers to detect or accurately quantify. For example, some health disorders may cause minor variations in the patient's speaking ability or style. Others can affect sonic characteristics of coughs and sneezes.

- Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods that include or otherwise leverage use of a machine-learned health model to provide a diagnosis of a potential health disorder based on an audio recording or other audio data of a patient. In particular, the health model can receive a patient audio recording (e.g., of the patient speaking or making non-word sounds or utterances such as coughing, sneezing, etc.) and, in response, provide a diagnostic score that describes information associated with a potential health disorder. For example, the patient audio recording can contain the patient speaking, and the diagnostic score can contain information about (e.g., identifying, predicting severity of) potential health disorders.
- More particularly, systems and methods of the present disclosure can operate to generate or provide health information (e.g., a diagnosis of the existence and/or severity of a particular heath disorder) based on an audio recording of a patient and/or other patient information. The systems and methods of the present disclosure can include or be performed by one or more computing devices, including, as examples, a user computing device (e.g., a smartphone, laptop, computing device able to be worn, an embedded computing device, etc.), a diagnostic computing device (e.g., as operated by a health provider), as a service by a server computing device over a network, and/or other arrangements of computing devices.
- These example computing devices can obtain the audio recording of the patient in a number of different ways. As examples, in some implementations, audio data collection can be performed across a constellation of devices that can interoperate, including mobile phones, kiosks/small monitors, desktops, and/or devices that are able to be worn such as headsets and on-attire devices. Importantly, the patient/user can be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., audio recordings of the patient's speech). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
- According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can include or otherwise leverage use of a machine-learned health model to provide the diagnosis information. In particular, in some implementations, the health model can include a diagnostic model that is trained to receive the patient audio recording or information describing the patient audio recording (e.g., a spectrogram), and in response, output the diagnostic score. Although referred to as a "recording," it should be understood that in some implementations, the health model can perform real-time analysis on audio data without storing the data. Thus, the term "recording" is used to refer to any audio data, whether stored or analyzed in real time. In some implementations, the health model can additionally include a sound model. In some of such implementations, the sound model can be trained to receive the patient audio recording and, in response to receipt of the patient audio recording, output sound description data that contains information about the patient audio recording. The diagnostic model can be trained to receive the sound description data, and in response to receipt of the sound description data, output the diagnostic score. As an example, each of the sound model and diagnostic model can be or include one or more machine-learned models such as, for example, an artificial neural network ("neural network"), such as, for example, a convolutional neural network.
- The diagnostic score can contain information diagnosing or identifying the health disorder. In some implementations, the diagnostic score can describe a predicted severity or likelihood (e.g., of the presence or absence) of a health disorder. As an example, the diagnostic score can describe a predicted severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In such an example, the diagnostic score can include a predicted functional rating scale (FRS) score, a metric used in the medical profession to quantify the progression of ALS in patients. As another example, the diagnostic score can describe the severity of a health condition or medical symptom, such as pain. The diagnostic score can describe whether the patient requires urgent medical care or can describe a predicted urgency associated with a need for medical attention.
- In some implementations, the diagnostic score can identify a specific health disorder from a set of potential health disorders. As one example, the diagnostic score can include a name or category of one or more health disorder(s) that has been identified based on information contained within the patient audio recording. As another example, the diagnostic score can include a list of two or more potential health disorders, and optionally, associated ranks, likelihoods, severities, etc. Examples of potential health disorders that the health model can be trained to diagnose include cranial nerve dysfunction, depression, autism (e.g., Asperger Syndrome), post-traumatic stress disorder, dementia, ALS, and Parkinson's disease. Additional applications can include identifying and alerting the user about the need for immediate or emergency medical treatment for the patient (e.g., in evaluation phone calls) and/or assessing a pain level experienced by the patient. The health model can find application in identifying or diagnosing any medical condition that manifests itself in the voice of the patient.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the sound description data can contain a variety of information about the patient audio recording that can be useful for diagnosing potential health disorders. More particularly, in some implementations, the sound description data can describe sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) recognized in the patient audio recording. For example, the sound description data can include a set of word sounds (e.g., words, syllables, phonemes, etc.) that have been recognized (e.g., by the sound model) in the patient audio recording. Such a set of word sounds is sometimes referred to as a "bag of words", "bag of syllables", "bag of phonemes", etc. The sound description data can also include a set of confidence values respectively associated with the set of identified words sounds. As another example, the sound description data can describe a comparison between words recognized in the patient audio recording and a predetermined text string (e.g., a sentence or phrase). For instance, the patient audio recording can contain a recording of the patient reading or otherwise uttering the predetermined text string out loud. The sound model can be trained to recognize the words sounds in the patient audio and output sound description data that describes a comparison between the recognized word sounds and the predetermined text string. For example, the comparison can indicate a number of words or sounds correctly spoken, a percentage of words or sounds correctly spoken, a number or percentage of words or sounds not correctly spoken, a matching score, and/or other forms of comparison. The resulting comparison can be indicative of the patient's ability to intelligibly enunciate specific syllables or phonemes contained in the words of the predetermined text string. As another example, the sound description data can describe a lack of expected sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds). This information can be indicative of the identity, severity, or likelihood of a potential health disorder.
- More specifically, in some implementations, in response to receiving a patient audio recording that indicates difficulty enunciating, the sound model can output a transcript that contains information about such difficulties. As an example, some health disorders (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction) can impair a patient's ability to properly enunciate a specific set of syllables or to produce certain sequences of syllables or phonemes. This can cause stuttering, variations in vowel and/or consonant sounds, or unintentional pauses between words or syllables indicative of the health disorder. Additionally, in some implementations, the sound description data can describe additional information about speech in the patient audio recording. For example, the sound description data can describe word rate, rhythm, tone, volume, hoarse voice, cadence, syllabic emphasis, pitch, timbre, etc.
- In some implementations, the sound description data can include a set of non-word sounds and a set of associated confidence values. As an example, the sound model can be trained to identify a wide variety of non-word sounds, such as coughing or sneezing. As another example, the sound model can be trained to recognize a wide variety of sounds including some that are generally not present in a recording of speech (e.g., musical instruments, doors closing, car engines etc.). Thus, the sound description data can sometimes contain confidence values associated with sounds that are not present in the patient audio recording. Nonetheless, this information can be predictive of health disorders, and thus be useful as an input into the machine-learned diagnostic model (e.g., as contained in the sound description data). This information could be referred to as a sonic "fingerprint" of the patient audio recording or as containing "biomarkers" that may be indicative of certain health states of the speaker.
- In the implementation of the invention, the sound description data includes an embedding provided by the sound model (e.g., by a final layer and/or a hidden layer of the sound model). The sound model includes a machine-learned audio classification model, and the sound description data includes an embedding provided by a hidden layer of the machine-learned audio classification model. As such, the embedding can contain information that can be more descriptive of characteristics of the patient audio recording than a simple classification of sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) that are recognized in the patient audio recording. This can be particularly useful where, as indicated above, the sound model is trained to recognize sounds that may not be present in a recording of speech (e.g., musical instruments, doors closing, car engines etc.). In such an implementation, the embedding can still contain useful information correlating features of such sounds with sounds in the patient audio recording. Although they may not be correctly identified by the sound model, the embedding can still provide information that is useful for diagnosing the health disorder.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, the patient audio recording can be divided into segments (e.g., by the sound model or according to a pre-processing scheme), and the segments can be used to generate the diagnostic score. As an example, the patient audio recording can be divided into segments of equal length in time (e.g., 1 second). In some implementations, the segments can be consecutive and non-overlapping. Alternatively, the segments can be overlapping. The sound description data can describe sounds that have been identified (e.g., by the sound model) within one or more of the segments. For example, the sound description data can contain a set of identified sounds (e.g., words, non-words sounds) within the segments. The sound description data can also include a set of confidence values or weights associated with the identified sounds. Sound description data can be generated for each segment individually or can be respectively generated for various combinations of two or more segments (e.g., a combination of every consecutive pair of segments).
- A set of segment scores can be generated (e.g., based on the sound description data) that are respectively associated with the set of segments, and the diagnostic score can then be generated based on the set of segment scores. For example, the diagnostic model can generate segment scores for some or all of the segments. The segment scores can be mathematically combined (e.g., averaged) to generate the diagnostic score. As another example, a set of confidence values can be generated (e.g., by the diagnostic model) that are associated with the segment scores. Calculating the diagnostic score can include calculating a weighted average of the segment scores that is weighted according to the set of confidences. Other techniques for combining segment scores can be used as well, including, for example, median techniques, outlier removal techniques, etc.
- In some implementations, the health model can include an attention model or an aggregation model that is trained to receive the segment scores, and in response to receiving the segment scores, generate the diagnostic score. As an example, the attention model or aggregation model can be or include a neural network, such a recurrent neural network. In some implementations, the attention or aggregation model can be trained on sequences of segment scores that have been labeled with a known diagnostic score. Thus, the attention or aggregation model can be trained to receive the sequence of segment scores and produce a diagnostic score based on such sequence.
- In some implementations, the patient audio recording can be pre-processed. Pre-processing of the patient audio recording can include removing at least one silent or quiet portion of the patient audio recording. For example, quiet or silent portions can be defined as having sound levels below a predetermined threshold level. The health model or other system component can remove such quiet or silent portions before the patient audio recording is input into the sound model, which can improve the performance of the sound model.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, spectrograms can be generated that describe energy and/or frequency content of the patient audio recording. For example, the spectrograms can characterize the energy distribution across time and frequency of the patient's speech patterns and/or non-speech vocal sounds (e.g. breathing, coughing, wheezing, etc.).
- The spectrograms can be input into the sound model and/or diagnostic model (e.g., in addition or alternatively to the raw audio data of the recording). As an example, a spectrogram that describes a set of frequencies and/or corresponding intensities (e.g., sound levels) can be generated and input into the sound model. The spectrogram can be generated using a variety of techniques, including, for example, Fourier transform (e.g., fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and/or the like). In some implementations, the spectrograms can be represented in color (e.g., in a color space such as RGB). For example, in some implementations, the audio recording can include multiple channels (e.g., stereo) and can be collected from a plurality of sources (e.g., a microphone array). The spectrograms can describe spatial information associated with the audio recording. The spatial information can be used to identify sources of various sounds in the recording. This may be particularly useful for devices configured to be worn by the user as the spatial information can be used to distinguish between sounds produced by the user or by another nearby audio source. In other implementations, the spectrograms can be represented in grayscale. The sound model can be trained to identify sounds represented by the spectrogram. In some implementations, the spectral features can be augmented with target acoustic parameters characterizing, for example, pitch tracks, spectro-temporal modulation, syllable rate, etc.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the health model can be trained to detect changes in diagnosis over time for a given patient. More specifically, in some implementations, the health model can be trained to detect changes in patient audio recordings received at different times for the same patient. As an example, the diagnostic model can be trained to detect changes, such as trends, in the respective sound description data sets associated with the patient audio recordings. Such trends can be indicative of changes in the potential health disorder. As another example, the patient audio recording can be compared against one or more previous audio recordings (e.g., baseline audio recordings) that can represent sonic "fingerprints" or "signatures" of prior collected audio from the same patient. This comparison can be used to detect changes or trends with respect to the previous baseline audio recording(s). In some implementations, the diagnostic model can include a recurrent neural network (e.g., implementing long short term memory techniques). In other embodiments, the health model can include a trend model that is trained to receive diagnostic scores and/or sound description data (e.g., embeddings) from the sound model and/or diagnostic model. The trend model can be trained to output a diagnostic trend score or report containing information that describes changes or trends in the patient audio recordings. As another example, one or more distance metric learning loss functions can be implemented to estimate patient change over time in longitudinal analyses. As yet another example, one or more distributions can be generated that compare diagnostic scores or intermediary data (e.g., sound description data) to observed normal ranges for each particular patient.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the health model can be trained to identify a specific patient or speaker from the patient audio recording. More specifically, in some implementations, the health model can be trained to identify portions of the patient audio recording in which the patient seeking a diagnostic score is speaking. This capability can be particularly useful for detecting diagnostic trends, as discussed above.
- In some implementations, the health model can be trained using supervised training techniques. A training data set can include a set of training recordings and a set of training diagnoses associated with the training recordings. The set of training recordings can include recordings of patients speaking and/or making non-word sounds, and the set of training diagnosis can include information about health disorders (e.g., identity, severity, etc.) associated with the patients. The training data can be input into the health model, and diagnostic scores can be output by the health model in response. The training recordings can also include labeled non-patient audio recordings. For example, in some implementations, sets of publically available, labeled audio training data can be used to pre-train the sound model to recognize word sounds and/or non-word sounds.
- One or more objective functions (e.g., loss functions) can be calculated that describe a comparison between the output of the health model (e.g., diagnostic scores) and the labels / training data (e.g., training diagnoses). A training computing system can use the objective function(s) to train the sound model, diagnostic model, and/or attention or aggregation model by adjusting (e.g., iteratively) parameters of the health model such that evaluations of the objective function(s) move towards a target value (e.g., to minimize a loss function). As an example, loss function weighting can be implemented to correct / adjust for class imbalance in the training data that is often present in medical datasets.
- Additionally, in some implementations, the health model can be trained using unsupervised learning techniques. For example, the sound model can be pre-trained using unlabeled non-patient collections of sound recordings, such as speech recordings, non-speech sounds, publically available sound recordings from online video, etc. For instance, the sound model can start as a general purpose word and/or sound recognition model. Additionally, the diagnosis model can be pre-trained using sound description data generated from the sound model during pre-training. This pre-training using unlabeled non-patient collections of sound recordings may reduce the number of labelled patient sound recordings that are required in order to obtain a certain degree of accuracy/reliability from the health model.
- Providing diagnostic information about potential health disorders from a patient audio recording can have many uses. As an example, patients can record themselves using a personal computing device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, personal computer etc.) at their convenience, such as in their own home. The health model may be able to provide the patient with a fast and efficient initial indication of potential health disorders for further investigation. Indeed, the health model may enable determination of the presence of certain disorders in a manner that is non-invasive. In addition, use of the health model may allow disorders to be detected based on indications that are too subtle for conventional methods to detect. As such, the health model may enable disorders to be detected at an earlier stage. As another example, health professionals (e.g., nurses, doctors) can leverage use of the health model in a clinical setting, such as a doctor's office or hospital, to aid in identifying potential health disorders for further investigation.
- As one example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can be included or otherwise employed within the context of an application, a browser plug-in, or in other contexts. Thus, in some implementations, the models of the present disclosure can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by a user computing device such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. As yet another example, the models can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by a server computing device that communicates with the user computing device according to a client-server relationship. For example, the models can be implemented by the server computing device as a portion of a web service (e.g., a health assessment service).
- With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.

Thesystem 100 includes auser computing device 102, aserver computing system 130, and atraining computing system 150 that are communicatively coupled over anetwork 180. - The
user computing device 102 can be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., laptop or desktop), a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device. - The
user computing device 102 includes one ormore processors 112 and amemory 114. The one ormore processors 112 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 114 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof.

user computing device 102 can store or include one ormore health models 120. For example, thehealth models 120 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or other multi-layer non-linear models. Neural networks can include recurrent neural networks (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks), feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, or other forms of neural networks. Alternatively or additionally, the health model can include one or more other forms of machine-learned models such as, as examples, classifier models (e.g., linear classification models, quadratic classification models, binary classifiers, multi-class classifiers, multi-label classifiers, etc.); one or more regression models (e.g., simple linear regression models, multiple linear regression models, logistic regression models, stepwise regression models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, locally estimated scatterplot smoothing models, etc.); one or more decision tree-based models (e.g., classification and/or regression trees, iterative dichotomiser 3 decision trees, C4.5 decision trees, chi-squared automatic interaction detection decision trees, decision stumps, conditional decision trees, etc.); one or more kernel machines; one or more support vector machines; one or more nearest neighbor models (e.g., k-nearest neighbor classifications models, k-nearest neighbors regression models, etc.); one or more Bayesian (e.g., naive Bayes models, Gaussian naive Bayes models, multinomial naive Bayes models, averaged one-dependence estimators, Bayesian networks, Bayesian belief networks, hidden Markov models, etc.); and/or other forms of models.Example health models 120 are discussed with reference toFigures 2-6 . - In some implementations, the one or
more health models 120 can be received from theserver computing system 130 overnetwork 180, stored in the usercomputing device memory 114, and the used or otherwise implemented by the one ormore processors 112. In some implementations, theuser computing device 102 can implement multiple parallel instances of a single health model 120 (e.g., to perform parallel processing of audio and/or subsequent analysis across multiple instances of the health model). - More particularly, the
health model 120 can receive a patient audio recording (e.g., of the patient speaking or making non-word sounds such as coughing, sneezing, etc.) and, in response, provide a diagnostic score that describes information associated with a potential health disorder. For example, the patient audio recording can contain the patient speaking, and the diagnostic score can contain information about (e.g., identifying, predicting severity of) potential health disorders. - Additionally or alternatively, one or
more health models 140 can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by theserver computing system 130 that communicates with theuser computing device 102 according to a client-server relationship. For example, thehealth models 140 can be implemented by theserver computing system 140 as a portion of a web service (e.g., a health disorder diagnostic web service). Thus, one ormore models 120 can be stored and implemented at theuser computing device 102 and/or one ormore models 140 can be stored and implemented at theserver computing system 130. - The
user computing device 102 can also include one or moreuser input component 122 that receives user input. For example, theuser input component 122 can be a touch-sensitive component (e.g., a touch-sensitive display screen or a touch pad) that is sensitive to the touch of a user input object (e.g., a finger or a stylus). The touch-sensitive component can serve to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a traditional keyboard, or other means by which a user can enter a communication - The

server computing system 130 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. In instances in which theserver computing system 130 includes plural server computing devices, such server computing devices can operate according to sequential computing architectures, parallel computing architectures, or some combination thereof. - As described above, the
server computing system 130 can store or otherwise includes one or more machine-learnedhealth models 140. For example, themodels 140 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models such as neural networks (e.g., deep recurrent neural networks) or other multi-layer non-linear models or other forms of models as described with reference tomodels 120.Example models 140 are discussed with reference toFigures 2-6 . - The
server computing system 130 can train themodels 140 via interaction with thetraining computing system 150 that is communicatively coupled over thenetwork 180. Thetraining computing system 150 can be separate from theserver computing system 130 or can be a portion of theserver computing system 130. - The

The one ormore processors 152 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 154 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. Thememory 154 can storedata 156 andinstructions 158 which are executed by theprocessor 152 to cause thetraining computing system 150 to perform operations. In some implementations, thetraining computing system 150 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. - The
training computing system 150 can include amodel trainer 160 that trains the machine-learnedmodels 140 stored at theserver computing system 130 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. Themodel trainer 160 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained. - In particular, the
model trainer 160 can train ahealth model 140 based on a set of training data 142. The training data 142 can include, for example, a set of training recordings and a set of training diagnoses associated with the training recordings. The set of training recordings can include recordings of patients speaking and/or making non-word sounds (e.g., coughing, sneezing, sniffling, laughing, etc.) and the set of training diagnosis can include information about health disorders (e.g., identity, severity, etc.) associated with the patients. The training data can be input into the health model, and diagnostic scores can be output by the health model in response. The training recordings can also include labeled non-patient audio recordings. For example, sets of publically available, labeled audio training data can be used to pre-train the sound model to recognize word sounds and/or non-word sounds. - In some implementations, if the user has provided consent, the training examples can be provided by the user computing device 102 (e.g., based on communications previously provided by the user of the user computing device 102). Thus, in such implementations, the
model 120 provided to theuser computing device 102 can be trained by thetraining computing system 150 on user-specific communication data received from theuser computing device 102. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model. - The

Figure 1B , each application can communicate with a number of other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, each application can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a public API). In some implementations, the API used by each application is specific to that application. -
Figure 1C depicts a block diagram of anexample computing device 50 that performs according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thecomputing device 50 can be a user computing device or a server computing device. - The
computing device 50 includes a number of applications (e.g.,applications 1 through N). Each application is in communication with a central intelligence layer. Example applications include a text messaging application, an email application, a dictation application, a virtual keyboard application, a browser application, etc. In some implementations, each application can communicate with the central intelligence layer (and model(s) stored therein) using an API (e.g., a common API across all applications). - The central intelligence layer includes a number of machine-learned models. For example, as illustrated in
Figure 1C , a respective machine-learned model (e.g., a model) can be provided for each application and managed by the central intelligence layer. In other implementations, two or more applications can share a single machine-learned model. For example, in some implementations, the central intelligence layer can provide a single model (e.g., a single model) for all of the applications. In some implementations, the central intelligence layer is included within or otherwise implemented by an operating system of thecomputing device 50. - The central intelligence layer can communicate with a central device data layer. The central device data layer can be a centralized repository of data for the
computing device 50. As illustrated inFigure 1C , the central device data layer can communicate with a number of other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, the central device data layer can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a private API). -
Figure 2 depicts a block diagram of anexample health model 200 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some implementations, thehealth model 200 can include adiagnostic model 202 that is trained to receive a patient audio recording 204 (e.g., of the patient speaking or making non-word sounds such as coughing, sneezing, etc.) or data descriptive of the patient audio recording (e.g., one or more spectrogram 206) and, in response, provide adiagnostic score 208. Thediagnostic model 202 can be or otherwise include a neural network (e.g., a convolutional neural network). - The
diagnostic score 208 can contain information diagnosing or identifying the health disorder. For example, thediagnostic score 208 can describe a predicted severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). For instance, thediagnostic score 208 can include a predicted functional rating scale (FRS) score, a metric used in the medical profession to quantify the progression of ALS in patients. As another example, thediagnostic score 208 can describe the severity of a health condition or medical symptom, such as pain. The diagnostic score can describe whether the patient requires urgent medical care or can describe a predicted urgency associated with a need for medical attention. - In some implementations, the
diagnostic score 208 can identify a specific health disorder from a set of potential health disorders. As one example, thediagnostic score 208 can include a name or category of one or more health disorder(s) that has been identified based on information contained within the patient audio recording. As another example, thediagnostic score 208 can include a list of two or more potential health disorders, and optionally, associated ranks, likelihoods, severities, etc. Examples of potential health disorders that thehealth model 200 can be trained to diagnose include cranial nerve dysfunction, depression, autism (e.g., Asperger Syndrome), post-traumatic stress disorder, dementia, ALS, and Parkinson's disease. Additional applications can include the need for immediate or emergency medical treatment for the patient (e.g., in evaluation phone calls) and assessing a pain level experienced by the patient (e.g. using "gold standard" Revised Faces Scale or NRS numeric rating scale "zero to ten"). Thehealth model 200 can find application in identifying or diagnosing any medical condition that manifests itself in the voice of the patient, however. - The spectrogram(s) 206 can describe energy and/or frequency content of the
patient audio recording 204. For example, thespectrograms 206 can characterize the energy distribution across time and frequency of the patient's speech patterns and/or non-speech vocal sounds (e.g. breathing, coughing, wheezing, etc.). - The
spectrograms 206 can be input into the diagnostic model 202 (e.g., in addition or alternatively to the raw audio data of the patient audio recording 204). Thespectrogram 206 can be generated using a variety of techniques, including, for example, Fourier transform (e.g., fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and/or the like). In some implementations, thespectrograms 206 can be represented in color (e.g., in a color space such as RGB). In other implementations, thespectrograms 206 can be represented in grayscale. Thediagnostic model 202 can be trained to generate diagnostic information in thediagnostic score 208 based on the information contained in the spectrogram(s) 206. - In some implementations, the
patient audio recording 204 can be pre-processed. Pre-processing of thepatient audio recording 204 can include removing at least one silent or quiet portion of thepatient audio recording 204. For example, quiet or silent portions can be defined as having sound levels below a predetermined threshold level. Thehealth model 200 can remove such quiet or silent portions before the patient audio recording is input into thediagnostic model 202, which can improve the performance of thediagnostic model 202. -
Figure 3 depicts a block diagram of anexample health model 300 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thehealth model 300 is similar to thehealth model 200 ofFigure 2 except thathealth model 300 further includes asound model 302. Thesound model 302 can be or otherwise include a neural network (e.g., a convolutional neural network). Thesound model 302 can be trained to receive thepatient audio recording 306 and/or data descriptive thereof (e.g., spectrogram(s) 308) and, in response, outputsound description data 310 that contains information about thepatient audio recording 306. Thediagnostic model 304 can be trained to receive thesound description data 310, and in response to receipt of thesound description data 310, output thediagnostic score 312. - In some implementations, the spectrogram(s) 308 can be input into the
sound model 302. In other implementations, the spectrogram(s) 308 can be input into both thesound model 302 and thediagnostic model 304. As an example, aspectrogram 206 that describes a set of frequencies and/or corresponding intensities (e.g., sound levels) can be generated and input into thesound model 302. Thesound model 302 can be trained to identify sounds represented by thespectrogram 308. For example, thesound model 302 can be trained to outputsound description data 310 that describes features of thepatient audio recording 306. The spectral features of thepatient audio recording 306 can be augmented with target acoustic parameters characterizing, for example, pitch tracks, spectro-temporal modulation, syllable rate, etc. - Additional pre-processing can include removing quiet or silent portions of the
patient audio recording 306, for example as described above with reference toFigure 2 . Thehealth model 300 can remove such quiet or silent portions before the patient audio recording is input into thesound model 302, for example, which can improve the performance of thesound model 302. - In some implementations, the
sound description data 310 can contain a variety of information about thepatient audio recording 306 that can be useful for diagnosing potential health disorders. More particularly, in some implementations, thesound description data 310 can describe sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) recognized in thepatient audio recording 306. For example, thesound description data 310 can include a set of word sounds (e.g., words, syllables, phonemes, etc.) that have been recognized (e.g., by the sound model 302) in thepatient audio recording 306. Such a set of word sounds is sometimes referred to as a "bag of words", "bag of syllables", "bag of phonemes", etc. Thesound description data 310 can also include a set of confidence values associated with the set of identified words sounds. As another example, thesound description data 310 can describe a comparison between words recognized in thepatient audio recording 306 and a predetermined text string (e.g., a sentence or phrase). For instance, thepatient audio recording 306 can contain a recording of the patient uttering the predetermined text string out loud. Thesound model 302 can be trained to recognize the word sounds in thepatient audio recording 306 and outputsound description data 310 that describes a comparison between the recognized word sounds and the predetermined text string. The resulting comparison can be indicative of the patient's ability to intelligibly enunciate specific syllables or phonemes contained in the words of the predetermined text string. This information can be indicative of the identity, severity, or likelihood of a potential health disorder, for example. - More specifically, in response to receiving a
patient audio recording 306 that indicates difficulty enunciating, thesound model 302 can output sounddescription data 310 that contains information about such difficulties. As an example, some health disorders (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction) can impair a patient's ability to properly enunciate a specific set of syllables or to produce certain sequences of syllables or phonemes. This can cause stuttering, variations in vowel and/or consonant sounds, or unintentional pauses between words or syllables indicative of the health disorder. Additionally, in some implementations, thesound description data 310 can describe additional information about speech in thepatient audio recording 306. For example, thesound description data 310 can describe word rate, rhythm, tone, volume, hoarse voice etc. - In some implementations, the
sound description data 310 can include a set of non-word sounds and a set of associated confidence values. As an example, thesound model 302 can be trained to identify a wide variety of non-word sounds, such as coughing or sneezing. As another example, thesound model 302 can be trained to recognize a wide variety of sounds including some that are generally not present in a recording of speech. Examples of such sounds include musical instruments, doors closing, car engines. Thus, thesound description data 310 can sometimes contain confidence values associated with sounds that are not present in thepatient audio recording 306. Nonetheless, this information can be predicative of health disorders, and thus be useful as an input into the machine-learneddiagnostic model 304. This information could be referred to as a sonic "fingerprint" of the patient audio recording or as "biomarkers" that may be indicative of certain health states of the speaker. - In some implementations, the
sound description data 310 can include an embedding provided by a hidden layer of thesound model 302. As an example, thesound model 302 can include a machine-learned audio classification model, and thesound description data 302 can include an embedding by a hidden layer of the machine-learned audio classification model. As such, the embedding can contain information that can be more descriptive of characteristics of thepatient audio recording 306 than a simple classification of sounds (e.g., words, non-word sounds) that are recognized in thepatient audio recording 306. This can be particularly useful where, as indicated above, thesound model 302 is trained to recognize sounds that may not be present in a recording of speech (e.g., musical instruments, doors closing, car engines etc.). In such an implementation, the embedding can still contain useful information correlating features of such sounds with sounds in thepatient audio recording 306. Although these sounds may not be correctly identified by thesound model 302, the embedding can still provide information that is useful for diagnosing the health disorder. - According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, the
patient audio recording 306 can be divided into segments (e.g., by the sound model 302), and the segments can be used to generate thediagnostic score 312. As an example, thepatient audio recording 306 can be divided into segments of equal length in time (e.g., 1 second). In some implementations, the segments can be consecutive and non-overlapping. Alternatively, the segments can be overlapping. Thesound description data 310 can describe sounds that have been identified or correlated (e.g., by the sound model 302) within two or more of the segments. For example, thesound description data 310 can contain a set of identified sounds (e.g., words, non-words sounds) within the segments. Thesound description data 310 can also include a set of confidence values or weights associated with the identified sounds. Alternatively, a separate sounddescription data set 310 can be generated for each individual segment. - A set of segment scores can be generated that are respectively associated with the set of segments, and the diagnostic score can then be generated based on the set of segment scores. For example, the
diagnostic model 304 can generate segment scores for some or all of the segments represented in thesound description data 310. The segment scores can be mathematically combined (e.g., averaged) to generate thediagnostic score 312. As another example, a set of confidence values can be generated (e.g., by the diagnostic model 304) that are associated with the segment scores. Calculating thediagnostic score 312 can include calculating a weighted average of the segment scores that is weighted according to the set of confidences. Other techniques for combining segment scores can be used as well, including, for example, median techniques, outlier removal techniques, etc. -
Figure 4 depicts a block diagram of anexample health model 400 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thehealth model 400 is similar to thehealth model 200 ofFigure 2 except thathealth model 400 further includes atrend model 404. Thetrend model 404 can be or include a neural network, such a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks). Thetrend model 404 can be trained to receive two ordiagnostic scores 410 from the diagnostic model 403 and, in response to receiving thediagnostic scores 410 output a trenddiagnostic score 412 or report that contains information describing changes or trends in thediagnostic scores 410 output by thediagnostic model 402. For example, thetrend model 404 can be trained to recognize changes in thediagnostic scores 410 that are indicative of progression of a health disorder. Thehealth model 400 may be configured to alert the user of trenddiagnostic scores 412 that warrant further investigation. - According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the
health model 400 can be trained to identify a specific patient or speaker from thepatient audio recording 406. More specifically, in some implementations, thehealth model 400 can be trained to identify portions of thepatient audio recording 406 in which the particular patient that is seeking diagnostic information is speaking (e.g., the owner of the device collecting the audio recording). This capability can be particularly useful for detecting diagnostic trends, as discussed above. -
Figure 5 depicts a block diagram of anexample health model 500 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thehealth model 500 is similar to thehealth model 300 ofFigure 3 except thathealth model 500 further includes an attention oraggregation model 508. As an example, the attention model oraggregation model 508 can be or include a neural network, such a recurrent neural network. - In this implementation, the
patient audio recording 510 can be divided into segments (e.g., by the sound model 502), and the segments can be used to generate thediagnostic score 518. For example, thesound description data 514 can describe sounds that have been identified or correlated (e.g., by the sound model 502) within two or more of the segments, for example as explained above with reference toFigure 3 . Thediagnostic model 504 can be trained to receive thesound description data 514 and/or other data descriptive of the patient audio recording (e.g., spectrogram(s) 512), and in response, output segment scores 516 for some or all of the segments represented in thesound description data 514. The attention /aggregation model 508 can be trained to receive the segment scores 516 and/orsound description data 514 and in response, output thediagnostic score 518. For example, the attention /aggregation model 508 can be trained to "focus" on or weight the segments scores 516 and/or associatedsound description data 514 that are most indicative of potential health disorders. This implementation can provide a more predicative aggregation of the segment scores than simple averaging or weighted averaging described above with reference toFigure 3 . - Additionally, in some implementations, the
health model 500 can leverage the attention /aggregation model 508 to improve performance of thesound model 502 and/ordiagnostic model 504. For example, the attention /aggregation model 508 can generate an attention output that describes the relative importance of data segments. One or both of thesound model 502 ordiagnostic model 504 can be trained to receive the attention output and "focus" on the most relevant segments ofpatient audio recording 510 and/or associatedsound description data 514. For example, thesound model 502 and/ordiagnostic model 504 can allocate resources at least partially according to the attention output. As another example, thesound model 502 and/ordiagnostic model 504 can adjust weights associated with the various segments based on the attention output (e.g., increasing the weights for the most relevant segments). -
Figure 6 depicts a block diagram of anexample health model 600 configured to receive atraining data set 608 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The training data set can include a set oftraining recordings 610 and a set oftraining diagnoses 612 associated with thetraining recordings 610. The set oftraining recordings 610 can include recordings of patients speaking and/or making non-word sounds, and the set oftraining diagnosis 612 can include information about health disorders (e.g., identity, severity, etc.) associated with the patients. Thetraining data set 608 can be input into thehealth model 600, anddiagnostic scores 622 can be output by thehealth model 600 in response. Thetraining recordings 610 can also include labeled non-patient audio recordings. For example, sets of publically available, labeled audio training data can be used to pre-train the sound model to recognize word sounds and/or non-word sounds. - One or more objective functions 620 (e.g., loss functions) can be calculated that describe a comparison between the output of the health model (e.g., diagnostic scores 622) and the labels / training data (e.g., training diagnoses 612). The object function(s) 620 can be used to iteratively train the
sound model 602,diagnostic model 604, and/or attention / aggregation model 606 (and trend model if present) by seeking to adjust theobjective function 620 to a target value (e.g., to minimize a loss function). As an example, loss function weighting can be implemented to correct / adjust for class imbalance in thetraining data set 608 that is often present in medical datasets. - Additionally, in some implementations, the
health model 600 can be trained using unsupervised learning techniques. For example, thesound model 600 can be pre-trained using unlabeled non-patient collections of sound recordings, such as speech recordings, non-speech sounds, publically available sound recordings from online video, etc. For instance, thesound model 600 can start as a general purpose word and/or sound recognition model. Additionally, thediagnosis model 604 can be pre-trained usingsound description data 616 generated from the sound model during pre-training. Similarly, the attention /aggregation model 606 can be pre-trained using output 618 (e.g., segment scores) from thediagnostic model 604 during pre-training. -
Figure 7 depicts a flow chart diagram of an example method to perform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. AlthoughFigure 6 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particularly illustrated order or arrangement. - At 702, a computing system can input data descriptive of a patient audio recording into a sound model. The patient audio recording can first be obtained by one or more computing devices of the computing system. For example, audio data collection can be performed across an interconnected and/or interoperable array of devices (e.g., mobile phones, kiosks/small monitors, desktops, or wearable devices such as headsets and on-attire devices). Importantly, the patient/user can be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., audio recordings of the patient's speech). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- In response to recording or otherwise receiving the patient audio recording, the computing system can provide the input to the sound model. The patient audio recording can include word sounds or non-word sounds uttered or otherwise produced by the patient or user.
- At 704, the computing system can receive as an output of the sound model, sound description data. For example, the sound description data can describe correlations or similarities between features of the patient audio recording data and known sounds (e.g., as an embedding from a sound recognition model).
- At 706, the computing system can input the sound description data into a diagnostic model. At 708, the computing system can receive a diagnostic score as an output of the diagnostic model. For example, the diagnostic score can describe an identity of a specific health disorder from a potential set of health disorders, a likelihood of the patient having a specific health disorder, and/or a predicted severity of the specific health disorder.
- The health model may find particular application with health disorders that affect speaking abilities. For example, as discussed above, the health model can be trained to generate a diagnostic score that describes a predicted severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In such an example, the diagnostic score can include a predicted functional rating scale (FRS) score. FRS is a metric used in the medical profession to quantify the progression of ALS in patients and ranges from 0 to 4.
- The health model was used to generate predicted FRS scores from patient audio recordings of ALS patients. The predicted FRS scores were then compared with known FRS scores for each patient. The recordings were converted into spectrograms, which describe frequency and energy information associated with the patient audio recordings. The recordings were also divided into consecutive, non-overlapping, segments of equal length. In this example, the segments were one second long. The recordings and spectrograms were input into the health model, and segment scores were received as an output of the health model. The segment scores included a set of scores and confidence values respectively associated with each segment. The segment scores were combined according to their respective confidence values (e.g., using a weighted average) to produce the diagnostic scores. The diagnostic scores described FRS scores for each respective audio recording.
- In one set of analyses, the health model had an average prediction error of the known FRS score of 0.6. Ninety eight percent of the predicted FRS scores were within one unit of the known FRS scores. This corresponds to a class balanced accuracy of 64% in a dataset of 715 patients, an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.90, and a sensitivity index (d) of 1.8. These metrics, which are used in signal detection theory, indicate that the health model produced high quality FRS score predictions. Additionally, the health model was found to accurately predict the progression of disease within individual patients.
- The technology discussed herein makes reference to servers, databases, software applications, and other computer-based systems, as well as actions taken and information sent to and from such systems. The inherent flexibility of computer-based systems allows for a great variety of possible configurations, combinations, and divisions of tasks and functionality between and among components. For instance, processes discussed herein can be implemented using a single device or component or multiple devices or components working in combination. Databases and applications can be implemented on a single system or distributed across multiple systems. Distributed components can operate sequentially or in parallel.
