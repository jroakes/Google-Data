- wearable computing devices described herein such as wearable computing device 110 of FIG. 1 , wearable computing device 210 of FIG. 2 and/or wearable computing device 710 of FIG. 7 may, in some embodiments, be head-mounted eyeglasses devices, also referred to as wearable heads-up displays or head-mounted displays.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Microsoft Hololens® just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are bulky to enable adequate display performance and, as a result, appear very unnatural on a user's face compared to the sleeker and streamlined look of typical eyeglass and sunglass lenses.
- a traditional eyeglasses frame is problematic when correct alignment of optical components carried by the eyeglasses frame is a necessity for a high quality display. Because traditional eyeglasses have hinges where the arms meet the rest of the frame, any optical components carried on the arms may move relative to the rest of the frame or to the eye of the user while being worn, resulting in loss of or distortion of the display. There is a need in the art for means to successfully integrate electronic components into smaller frames in order to achieve the inconspicuous form factor and fashion appeal expected of the eyeglass frame industry while still maintaining a high display quality.
- the design form factor and location of an antenna within an electronic device is important because the location of the antenna relative to other components, both electronic and non-electronic, within the device impacts the functionality of the antenna. In some cases, interference from other components within the device significantly reduces the range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna, thus preventing the antenna from effectively connecting or communicating with other electronic devices. In many cases, a similar result occurs depending on the distance and orientation of the antenna relative to an external device with which the antenna is communicating.
- a wearable heads-up display may be provided in the form of eyeglasses frames and eyeglasses frames assemblies carrying an antenna for inter-device connectivity.
- Such glasses may include a minimal form factor that is aesthetically pleasing and an antenna design that enables superior range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna.

- the antenna 1401 can include different cross sections along its length along with one or more transitions, for example, the first portion 1403 of the antenna 1401 proximate the first distal end 1409 may have a square cross section, the second portion 1405 may have a triangular cross section, and the third portion 1407 may have a circular cross section.

- implementations described herein provide a compact, aesthetically pleasing glasses form factor that includes an antenna and a radio for enabling inter-device connectivity. Further, because a location, orientation and position of the antenna is adjustable relative to other electrical components, such as a power source and an electrically conductive path, interference between the antenna and other components within the eyeglass is minimized. As a result, implementations of the present disclosure allow for optimization of the connectivity, range, and signal strength of the antenna when transmitting or receiving signals from other electronic devices. In particular, implementations of the present disclosure enable optimal connectivity, range, and signal strength characteristics for the antenna and the radio regardless of the position of an external device within a given range.
