Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.

- sensors provide data that is processed by the computer in real-time, that is, the sensors may continuously update their output to reflect the environment being sensed at or over a range of time, and continuously or as-demanded provide that updated output to the computer so that the computer can determine whether the vehicle's then-current direction or speed should be modified in response to the sensed environment.
- data 134 may include detailed map information 136 , e.g., highly detailed maps identifying the shape and elevation of roadways, lane lines, intersections, crosswalks, speed limits, traffic signals, buildings, signs, real time traffic information, or other such objects and information.
- map information may include explicit speed limit information associated with various roadway segments.
- the speed limit data may be entered manually or scanned from previously taken images of a speed limit sign using, for example, optical-character recognition.
- the map information may include three-dimensional terrain maps incorporating one or more of objects listed above.
- the vehicle may determine that another car is expected to turn based on real-time data (e.g., using its sensors to determine the current GPS position of another car) and other data (e.g., comparing the GPS position with previously-stored lane-specific map data to determine whether the other car is within a turn lane).
- real-time data e.g., using its sensors to determine the current GPS position of another car
- other data e.g., comparing the GPS position with previously-stored lane-specific map data to determine whether the other car is within a turn lane.
- the map information is depicted herein as an image-based map, the map information need not be entirely image based (for example, raster).
- the map information may include one or more roadgraphs or graph networks of information such as roads, lanes, intersections, and the connections between these features.
- Each feature may be stored as graph data and may be associated with information such as a geographic location and whether or not it is linked to other related features, for example, a stop sign may be linked to a road and an intersection, etc.
- the associated data may include grid-based indices of a roadgraph to allow for efficient lookup of certain roadgraph features.
- An autonomous vehicle may transport itself, passengers, and/or cargo between two locations by following a route. For example, a driver may input a destination and activate an autonomous mode of the vehicle. In response, the vehicle's computer may calculate a route based on the roadgraph, its current location, and the destination. Based on the route (or as part of the route generation), the vehicle may determine a control strategy for controlling the vehicle along the route to the destination. For example, the control strategy may include where to turn, at what speeds to travel, where to look for traffic signals, where to stop for intersections or stop signs, etc.
- the vehicle may detect objects in its surroundings which are within the sensor fields.
- the computer may adjust the autonomous vehicle's speed or change direction.
- the sensor fields may be changed or become less reliable based on objects or other features in the vehicle's surroundings.
- An object may occupy a portion of the vehicle's sensor field.
- vehicle 301 may be driving along side of another large, moving object such as a tractor-trailer 610 .
- tractor-trailer 610 occupies an area 620 within vehicle 301 's sensor field.
- FIG. 7A vehicle 301 is driving alongside buildings 710 and approaching a bend in the road. These buildings occupy an area 720 within vehicle 301 's sensor field.
- the object's presence may change the perception of one or more sensors, for example by limiting the perception of other objects.
- the vehicle's computer may no longer be able to accurately detect other objects which are in the area behind the object or not within a sensor's line of detection.
- the sensors may be able to detect “though” some objects, but with much less accuracy than if the object was not present.
- the size and accuracy of the vehicle's sensor field may be diminished.
- the vehicle's computer may calculate the size and shape of the area of sensor diminution and a new or current sensor field based on this area of diminution.
- the computer may identify tractor-trailer 610 as an object and calculate the size and shape of area 620 , the size and shape of the sensor field within area 620 , and/or the size and shape of the sensor field which is not within area 620 .
- Any objects within area 620 are no longer detectable by vehicle 301 's sensors.
- This area represents an approximate area of “blindness.”
- the computer may be able to estimate the location of objects based on information from the roadgraph, or for example, if the computer is tracking an object which has recently entered the area. For example, sonar, laser or camera sensors would not be able to collect data which is within area 620 because the tractor-trailer is opaque. This prevents the sensors from collecting information “through” the truck.
- the vehicle's sensor field is affected by the buildings.
- the vehicle's computer may identify the buildings as objects and calculate the size and shape of area 720 , the size and shape of the sensor field within area 720 , and/or the size and shape of the sensor field which is not within area 720 .
- the vehicle is unable to detect truck 730 which is parked alongside of the buildings 710 , but within area 720 .
- the location of vehicle 730 is also shown within area 720 of FIG. 7B .
- sounds 890 of FIG. 8B are at or near the frequency or range of frequencies used by the cart's sonar devices.
- the sounds may be generated by other sonar devices or noises near the vehicle. These sounds may result in feedback which causes the sonar data to become less reliable for detecting objects.
- fields of view 750 - 755 of the sonar detection devices are no longer able to detect objects. Accordingly, these fields of view are shown in dashed line.
- the cart's computer may calculate a new sensor field, for example, based only on camera devices 560 and 580 or may simply determine that it the cart may rely only on it's sensor field from the cameras' fields of view.
- the vehicle's computer may change the control strategies of the vehicle. For example, rather than maintaining the vehicle's speed and direction, the vehicle's computer may have the vehicle slow down, maintain a lane, speed up (though with consideration of the speed limit), or take other responsive action. In another example, rather than slowing down to a first speed in order to take an action required for the route, such as a turn, the computer may slow the vehicle down to a second, much lower speed. In some examples, the vehicle may not need to take any specific action but may maintain its present speed and direction.
- vehicle 301 may be following a route which requires it to move one or more lanes to the left (towards tractor-trailer 610 ). Ordinarily, if the vehicle was traveling faster than the tractor-trailer, vehicle 301 may wait until it has passed tractor-trailer 610 to change lane. However, after the vehicle's computer has determined area of sensor diminution or the current sensor field, the computer may slow the vehicle down so that it falls behind the tractor-trailer in order to increase the sensor field so that vehicle 301 may detect objects to the left of tractor-trailer 610 .
- vehicle 301 may be following a route which requires it follow the road around the building.
- the computer may maintain the vehicle's speed.
- the computer may slow the vehicle down dramatically so that when the vehicle's sensor field is able to detect an object located near truck 730 , the vehicle may have sufficient time to take any necessary action to avoid the object.
- cart 501 may slow down dramatically such that if an object is detected within the approximately 3 meter range of the sonar field of view, cart 501 has sufficient time to stop or move around the object. If the cart's sensor field is limited to the camera fields of view, as shown in FIG. 8B , cart 501 may again slow down dramatically before taking a turn. In this example, if the cart would have maintained its speed before the sonar detection device's effectiveness had become diminished, cart 501 may continue to maintain its speed, slow down slightly, or even increase its speed.
- An autonomous vehicle's computer may continuously or periodically determine whether its sensor field has changed and take action, or change its control strategy, accordingly. For example, returning to FIG. 7A , if vehicle 301 has moved around the bend in the roadway and passed truck 710 , the vehicle's computer may return to the original control strategy and increase its speed again. Similarly, if cart 501 (of FIG. 8A ) moves into a shaded area where light 880 no longer has the same effect on the camera sensor, the cart's computer may again rely on the cameras to detect objects, return to the original control strategy, and increase its speed. This cycle of adjustments to speed and maneuvering and changing control strategies may occur continuously based on the area of diminution or the current sensor field of the vehicle.
- Flow diagraph 900 of FIG. 9 is another example of controlling an autonomous vehicle as described above.
- the vehicle's computer controls the autonomous vehicle based on a control strategy at block 910 .
- a sensor field is identified based on a field of view or views of one or more of the autonomous vehicle's sensors at block 920 .
- An object and its location in the sensor field are detected at block 930 .
- data from one or more sensor may be received and processed by the vehicle's computer in order to identify the object and its location.
- An area of diminished sensor perception is calculated based on the object's location relative to the sensor field at block 940 .
- a new control strategy is then identified based on the current sensor field at block 950 .
- the computer may then control the direction and speed of the vehicle based on the area of diminished sensor perception at block 960 .
- the computer determines whether or not the sensor field continues to be diminished at block 970 . If the sensor field continues to be diminished, the computer may maintain the new control strategy or adjust the control strategy as needed at block 980 and then returns to block 970 . Once the vehicle's sensor field is determined to no longer be diminished, the computer again controls the autonomous vehicle based on the original control strategy at block 990 and returns to block 930 when a new object is identified.
- Flow diagraph 1000 of FIG. 10 is yet another example of controlling an autonomous vehicle as described above.
- the vehicle's computer controls the autonomous vehicle based on a control strategy at block 1010 .
- a sensor field is identified based on a field of view or views of one or more of the autonomous vehicle's sensors at block 1020 .
- An object and its location in the sensor field are detected at block 1030 .
- data from one or more sensor may be received and processed by the vehicle's computer in order to identify the object and its location.
- a current sensor field is calculated based on the object's location relative to the sensor field at block 1040 .
- a new control strategy is then identified based on the current sensor field at block 1050 .
- the computer may then control the direction and speed of the vehicle based on the new control strategy at block 1060 .
- the computer determines whether or not the sensor field continues to be diminished at block 1070 . If the sensor field continues to be diminished, the computer may maintain the new control strategy or adjust the control strategy as needed at block 1080 and then returns to block 1070 . Once the vehicle's sensor field is determined to no longer be diminished, the computer again controls the autonomous vehicle based on the original control strategy at block 1090 and returns to block 1030 when a new object is identified.
- Flow diagraph 1100 of FIG. 11 is a further example of controlling an autonomous vehicle as described above.
- the vehicle's computer controls the autonomous vehicle based on a control strategy at block 1110 .
- a sensor field is identified based on a field of view or views of one or more of the autonomous vehicle's sensors at block 1120 .
- a change in the perception of one or more sensors is identified at block 1130 .
- data from one or more sensor may be received and processed by the vehicle's computer which indicates that the data from one or more of the sensors is unreliable.
- a new control strategy is then identified based on the change at block 1140 .
- the computer may then control the direction and speed of the vehicle based on the new control strategy at block 1150 .
- the computer determines whether or not the change is still in effect at block 1160 , for example, by receiving additional data from the sensors. If the change persists, the computer may maintain the new control strategy or adjust the control strategy as needed at block 1170 and then returns to block 1160 . Once the computer determines that there is no longer a change, the computer again controls the autonomous vehicle based on the original control strategy at block 1180 and returns to block 1130 when a new object is identified.
