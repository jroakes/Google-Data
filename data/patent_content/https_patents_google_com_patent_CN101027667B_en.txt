The exemplary service device
Fig. 3 is the exemplary functionality block diagram of basis according to part implementation, server 120 of the principle of the invention.According to an implementation, one or more functions as described below can be carried out by search engine 125.According to another implementation, in these functions one or more can by such as the computing machine that is associated with server 120 or one of server 130 and 140, carry out at the parts of server 120 outsides.
Fig. 4 is according to exemplary block diagram implementation, that can be stored in the inquiry log 400 in this storage vault according to the principle of the invention.Inquiry log 400 can comprise the clauses and subclauses that a plurality of and previous search of carrying out is associated.Clauses and subclauses in the inquiry log 400 can comprise inquiry field 410, choose entity identifier (ID) field 420, and may also comprise user behavior information field 430.Inquiry field 410 can be stored and is included in by the relevant information of project (one or more) in the search inquiry of user's input.Choose entity id field 420 can store information such as territory (perhaps host name or URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)), classification logotype symbol, product identifiers etc., that can identify special entity uniquely, this special entity is associated with the document of being selected from the result of the search using this search inquiry and carry out by the user.User behavior information field 430 can be stored the information about the visit of user's pair document that is associated with this entity, such as trending towards the information of explicit user to the interest of this entity.Because the user can select to surpass one the result who is associated with search inquiry, so (for example, inquiry 2) may appear in identical search inquiry in a plurality of clauses and subclauses in this inquiry log 400.
The example of the clauses and subclauses in the inquiry log 400 can comprise " barnesandnoble.com " that is used to inquire about " the harry potter barnes and noble " of field 410 and is used to choose entity id field 420.User behavior information field 430 can be stored the relevant information of the time quantum that spent with user capture barnesandnoble.com territory, conversion (conversion) whether occur (promptly, whether follow-up purchase on barnesandnoble.com has appearred), whether occurred partly transforming (that is, whether the user just is increased to article in the shopping cart) on the barnesandnoble.com territory and/or other can trend towards illustrating the information of user to the interest in barnesandnoble.com territory.
Return Fig. 3, entity identification unit 310 can generate the entity name list.Entity identification unit 310 can obtain the initial sets (for example, firm name in environment or the source of news title in the source of news environment) of the entity title of the entity in specific environment.There is a variety of entity identifications unit 310 can obtain the method for the initial sets of the entity title in the specific environment.For example, entity identification unit 310 can obtain the entity title by analytical documentation collected works etc. from line directory, tabulation, group issue.
For in these titles each, entity identification unit 310 can also identify be associated with this title, the entity identifier such as homepage domain name or classification logotype symbol.For example, if title is Barnes ﹠amp; Noble, the entity identifier that then is associated can be barnesandnoble.com.Entity identification unit 310 can identify the entity identifier that is associated according to for example to the analysis of the document information in the storage vault.
This entity title can be handled then to generate the list of variants of this title in entity identification unit 310.Several conversions can be used to this title and its entity identifier in entity identification unit 310, such as: in statu quo use the entity title; In statu quo use entity identifier; The qualifier of deletion such as " one ", " being somebody's turn to do ", " company ", " incorporated company " from the entity title; In the entity title, replace the space, perhaps replace hyphen or underscore with the space conversely with hyphen or underscore; Single quotation marks in the delete entity title; In entity title and/or entity identifier, exchange " and " and "; "; " and " in delete entity title and/or the entity identifier and “ ﹠amp; "; " .com " of " www. " of the beginning in the delete entity identifier and/or ending; And/or do not have the fullstop in space to be considered as the space both sides in the entity identifier or delete these fullstops.Can also use other or different conversions.
Return Fig. 3, this candidate character strings tabulation can be handled to generate two forms in entity handles unit 320: form 330 is rewritten in inquiry and form 340 is rewritten in the suggestion inquiry.As described in greater detail below, inquiry is rewritten form 330 and can be indicated whether automatically rewrite search inquiry, and suggestion inquiry rewriting form 340 can indicate whether advise to rewrite inquiry.
If the entity identifier of frequent click is the entity identifier that is considered to corresponding to this candidate character strings, then entity handles unit 320 can be determined to correct, the most whether the total number of clicks of the entity identifier of frequent click has surpassed a little threshold value (for example, 5).Use this threshold value to guarantee to use always to sufficing to show that it is right rewriting it with user's click unexpected different, this candidate character strings once.If total number of clicks is lower than this threshold value, then this candidate character strings can be ignored in entity handles unit 320, and selects next candidate character strings to assess.
If this is correct, the entity identifier of the most frequent click has the total number of clicks that is higher than this threshold value, then how many entity handles unit 320 can be analyzed and click the distribution situation that is associated with each entity identifier.If on statistical significance this distribution be enough " peak valueization (peaked) " (for example, it is the click that aligns certain body identifier that great majority are clicked, and considerably less click is the click to other entity identifier), then entity handles unit 320 can add this candidate character strings in the inquiry rewriting form 330.On the contrary, if this distribution is not a peak valueization, but under come to very slowly (for example, other entity identifier obtains many clicks about the same), then entity handles unit 320 can add this candidate character strings to the suggestion inquiry and rewrites in the form 340.
Can use many possible detections, comprising the information theory tolerance as (the being considered polynomial expression distributes) entropy that distributes to kurtosis (peakedness).For efficient and for simplicity, can use simple test, such as, if to correct, the click of the entity identifier of frequent click outnumbers inferior to N entity identifier of the most frequent click (for example, N=4) click number of combinations can think that then its enough peak valueization is to adding in the inquiry rewriting form 330.
Except total number of clicks, can also use other data in the inquiry log 400, the information in user behavior information field 430 to determine kurtosis.For example, the information that the time quantum that document spent that is associated with this entity with user capture is relevant, all or part of conversion whether to occur and/or can trend towards illustrating the user can be the factor of determining kurtosis to the out of Memory of the interest of this entity.Any data that trend towards the indicative of desired result can be associated with continuous weight.For example, can use a plurality of data in these data together, and to they assign weight (for example, transform and to transform with part that compare can be by weighting more, and part transform compare with click can be by weighting more).As selection, depend on time quantum that document spent that user capture and this entity are associated or some the relevant classification of the time quantum that document spent that is associated with this entity with user capture, these can be clicked with variable amount weighting.Then, kurtosis can be based on the tolerance of overall weighting.
The advantage of this technology is that it directly obtains the content that the user wants when the user provides search inquiry.For example, Amazon.com is the shop of using always, but it also is the river of South America.If they only mean the shop when most of users are included in it in the search inquiry, then it is added to inquiry and rewrite in the form 330.If significantly the user of a part means river or anything else, then they will click other result, and this distributions with not enough peak valueization inquire about in the rewriting form 330 to Amazon being added to.In this case, Amazon can be added to the suggestion inquiry rewrites in the form 340.
In an implementation, can generated query rewrite form 330 and suggestion inquiry rewrite form 340 back manual evaluation they.This can help new entity is put into correct form.In addition, can regular update form 330 and 340.Differently weighting user behavior (for example, clicking) may be desired when upgrading form 330 and 340, and this is because as described in detail later such, user's behavior may be subjected to the influence that inquiry is automatically rewritten.
Exemplary processes
Fig. 8 is according to the process flow diagram according to the exemplary processes implementation of the principle of the invention, that be used to generate form 330 and 340 (Fig. 3).Processing can be from the entity name list (action 810) that obtains to be used for specific environment.For each entity title, can also identify corresponding entity identifier (action 820).There are several technology that are used to this tabulation to identify entity title and/or entity identifier.For example, analytical documentation collected works etc. be can pass through, from line directory, tabulation, group issue, entity title and/or entity identifier identified.
Then, can generate candidate character strings tabulation (action 830) by conversion entity title and/or entity identifier.For example, the candidate character strings tabulation of the entity identifier that is used for the special entity title and is associated can comprise: entity title as it is, entity identifier as it is, there is not qualifier (for example, " one ", " being somebody's turn to do ", " incorporated company ", " company ") the entity title, with the entity title that hyphen or underscore replace the space and replace hyphen or underscore conversely with the space, there is not the entity title of single quotation marks, usefulness " and " replacement "; " and use “ ﹠amp conversely; " the entity title and/or the entity identifier of replacement " and ", there are not " and " and 66﹠amp; " entity title and/or entity identifier, the entity identifier of " .com " of " www. " of beginning and/or ending not, and replace the entity identifier that all do not have the fullstop in space on both sides or deleted this fullstop with the space.Can also use other or different conversions.
Can assess candidate character strings (that is, each version of entity title and/or entity identifier) then, and use it for to form to inquire about and rewrite form 330 and suggestion inquiry rewriting form 340 ( action 840 and 850).For example, can search query log 400, to identify all comprise the particular candidate character string in their inquiry field 410 clauses and subclauses.Then, can check the clauses and subclauses that identified, click which entity identifier (for example, territory, URL or classification logotype symbol) to be defined as corresponding search inquiry.Can analyze the distribution of this click, so that for example determine whether by the entity identifier of the most frequent click be the entity identifier that is considered to corresponding to this candidate character strings.If not, then can ignore this candidate character strings, and select next candidate character strings to be used for assessment.
If the entity identifier by the most frequent click is the entity identifier that is considered to corresponding to this candidate character strings, can determine then whether total number of clicks correct, the entity identifier of frequent click has been surpassed a little threshold value (for example, 5).If total number of clicks is lower than this threshold value, then can ignores this candidate character strings, and select next candidate character strings to assess.
If this is correct, the entity identifier of the most frequent click has the total number of clicks that is higher than this threshold value, what then can defines click the distribution situation that is associated with each entity identifier.If this distribution is enough " peak valueization " (for example, it is the click that aligns certain body identifier that great majority are clicked, and fewer click is the click to other entity identifier), then this candidate character strings can be added to inquiry and rewrite in the form 330.If this distribution is not a peak valueization, but under come to very slowly (for example, other entity identifier obtains many clicks about the same), then this candidate character strings can be added to the suggestion inquiry and rewrite in the form 340.Some that are used for determining kurtosis described above may be tested.
Fig. 9 is according to the process flow diagram according to the exemplary processes implementation of the principle of the invention, that be used for rewriting selectively search inquiry.Processing can be from receiving the search inquiry (action 910) from the user.This search inquiry can comprise one or more projects, and these projects can comprise or can not comprise the entity title.
Can use inquiry to rewrite form 330 and/or suggestion inquiry rewriting form 340 these search inquiries of assessment (action 920).For example, can search inquiry rewrite the clauses and subclauses in the form 330, be complementary with name character string in the character string field 610 (Fig. 6) to determine the project (the perhaps combination of project) in this search inquiry.If a project in the search inquiry (perhaps a plurality of project) is complementary with one of name character string, then can automatically rewrite this inquiry ( action 930 and 940).For example, if original inquiry comprises " harry potter barnes; Noble ", then this inquiry can be rewritten as " harry potter store:barnesandnoble ", want at Barnes﹠amp with the indication user; Search product or the information of relevant Harry Potter on the Noble website, rather than search comprises project " harry ", " potter ", " barnes ", “ ﹠amp simply; " and the document of " noble ".
Alternatively, can generated query link so that original inquiry to be provided to the user, be used to inquire whether the user wants to be different from the search inquiry (action 950) of the inquiry of automatic rewriting.In this case, this query link can provide original inquiry " harry potter barnes﹠amp to the user; Noble ".
If the name character string that does not have project and inquiry to rewrite in the form 330 in this search inquiry is complementary, then can search for suggestion inquiry and rewrite clauses and subclauses in the form 340, with determine in this inquiry project (the perhaps combination of project) whether with character string field 710 (Fig. 7) in the name character string be complementary.If a project in the search inquiry (perhaps a plurality of project) is complementary with one of name character string, then can generated query link ( action 960 and 970).This query link can provide inquiry to rewrite to the user, whether wants different search inquiries with the inquiry user.For example, if original inquiry comprises " purse coach ", then this query link can provide the inquiry " purse store:coach " (in environment) of rewriting, the product or the information of on the Coach website, searching relevant purse to indicate this user to want, rather than only search for the document that comprises project " purse " and " coach ".
Then,, then carry out search,, then carry out search, to identify and to rewrite/document that original inquiry is relevant based on original inquiry if perhaps can use original inquiry based on the inquiry of rewriting if can use the inquiry of rewriting.For example, can the searching documents storage vault to identify the document that comprises the one or more projects in this inquiry.The document that is obtained can form the Search Results (action 980) that can provide to the user.In an implementation, this Search Results can use the form of the link of document.
Automatically example-environment is rewritten in inquiry
Figure 10 and 11 is according to the diagram of rewriting example according to automatic inquiry implementation, in environment of principle of the present invention.As shown in figure 10, the user can be via the graphical user interface inputted search inquiry that is associated with search engine such as search engine 125 (Fig. 1).In this example, user's inputted search inquiry " harry potter amazon ".Suppose that project " amazon " has clearly identified shop Amazon.com, and therefore be included in the inquiry rewriting form 330 (Fig. 3) as the name character string.
