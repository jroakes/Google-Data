Definitions
- Digital video streams may represent video using a sequence of frames or still images.
- Digital video can be used for various applications including, for example, video conferencing, high definition video entertainment, video advertisements, or sharing of user-generated videos.
- a digital video stream can contain a large amount of data and consume a significant amount of computing or communication resources of a computing device for processing, transmission or storage of the video data.
- Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the amount of data in video streams, including compression and other encoding techniques.
- One technique for compression uses a reference frame to generate a prediction block corresponding to a current block to be encoded. Differences between the prediction block and the current block can be encoded, instead of the values of the current block themselves, to reduce the amount of data encoded.
- This disclosure relates generally to encoding and decoding video data and more particularly relates to interpolating a co-located reference frame for motion compensated prediction in video compression using optical flow estimation.
- a method includes determining a first frame to be predicted in a video sequence, determining a first reference frame from the video sequence for forward inter prediction of the first frame, determining a second reference frame from the video sequence for backward inter prediction of the first frame, generating an optical flow reference frame for inter prediction of the first frame by performing an optical flow estimation using the first reference frame and the second reference frame, and performing a prediction process for the first frame using the optical flow reference frame.
- An apparatus includes a non-transitory storage medium or memory and a processor.
- the medium includes instructions executable by the processor to carry out a method including determining a first frame to be predicted in a video sequence, and determining an availability of a first reference frame for forward inter prediction of the first frame and a second reference frame for backward inter prediction of the first frame.
- the method also includes, responsive to determining the availability of both the first reference frame and the second reference frame, generating a respective motion field for pixels of the first frame using the first reference frame and the second reference frame using optical flow estimation, warping the first reference frame to the first frame using the motion fields to form a first warped reference frame, warping the second reference frame to the first frame using the motion fields to form a second warped reference frame, and blending the first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame to form the optical flow reference frame for inter prediction of blocks of the first frame.
- Another apparatus also includes a non-transitory storage medium or memory and a processor.
- the medium includes instructions executable by the processor to carry out a method including generating an optical flow reference frame for inter prediction of a first frame of a video sequence using a first reference frame from the video sequence and a second reference frame of the video sequence by initializing motion fields for pixels of the first frame in a first processing level for an optical flow estimation, the first processing level representing downscaled motion within the first frame and comprising one level of multiple levels, and, for each level of the multiple levels warping the first reference frame to the first frame using the motion fields to form a first warped reference frame, warping the second reference frame to the first frame using the motion fields to form a second warped reference frame, estimating motion fields between the first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame using the optical flow estimation, and updating the motion fields for pixels of the first frame using the motion fields between the first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame.
- the method also includes, for a final level of the multiple levels, warping the first reference frame to the first frame using the updated motion fields to form a final first warped reference frame, warping the second reference frame to the first frame using the updated motion fields to form a final second warped reference frame, and blending the final first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame to form the optical flow reference frame.

- FIG. 13 is a diagram that illustrates object occlusion.
- a video stream can be compressed by a variety of techniques to reduce bandwidth required transmit or store the video stream.
- a video stream can be encoded into a bitstream, which involves compression, which is then transmitted to a decoder that can decode or decompress the video stream to prepare it for viewing or further processing. Compression of the video stream often exploits spatial and temporal correlation of video signals through spatial and/or motion compensated prediction.
- Inter-prediction uses one or more motion vectors to generate a block (also called a prediction block) that resembles a current block to be encoded using previously encoded and decoded pixels. By encoding the motion vector(s), and the difference between the two blocks, a decoder receiving the encoded signal can re-create the current block. Inter-prediction may also be referred to as motion compensated prediction.
- Each motion vector used to generate a prediction block in the inter-prediction process refers to a frame other than a current frame, i.e., a reference frame.
- Reference frames can be located before or after the current frame in the sequence of the video stream, and may be frames that are reconstructed before being used as a reference frame. In some cases, there may be three reference frames used to encode or decode blocks of the current frame of the video sequence. One is a frame that may be referred to as a golden frame. Another is a most recently encoded or decoded frame. The last is an alternative reference frame that is encoded or decoded before one or more frames in a sequence, but which is displayed after those frames in an output display order.
- the alternative reference frame is a reference frame usable for backwards prediction.
- One or more forward and/or backward reference frames can be used to encode or decode a bock.
- the efficacy of a reference frame when used to encode or decode a block within a current frame can be measured based on a resulting signal-to-noise ratio or other measures of rate-distortion.
- the pixels that form prediction blocks are obtained directly from one or more of the available reference frames.
- the reference pixel blocks or their linear combinations are used as prediction for the given coding block in the current frame.
- This direct, block-based prediction does not capture the true motion activity available from the reference frames. For this reason, motion compensated prediction accuracy can suffer.
- implementations of the teachings herein describe a reference frame collocated with the current coding frame that uses a per-pixel motion field calculated by optical flow to estimate the true motion activities in the video signal.
- a collocated frame is interpolated that allows tracking of complicated non-translational motion activity, which is beyond the capability of conventional block based motion compensated prediction directly from reference frames.
- Use of such a reference frame can improve prediction quality.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic of a video encoding and decoding system 100 .
- a transmitting station 102 can be, for example, a computer having an internal configuration of hardware such as that described in FIG. 2 .
- the processing of the transmitting station 102 can be distributed among multiple devices.
- a network 104 can connect the transmitting station 102 and a receiving station 106 for encoding and decoding of the video stream.
- the video stream can be encoded in the transmitting station 102 and the encoded video stream can be decoded in the receiving station 106 .
- the network 104 can be, for example, the Internet.
- the network 104 can also be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), cellular telephone network or any other means of transferring the video stream from the transmitting station 102 to, in this example, the receiving station 106 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- VPN virtual private network
- the receiving station 106 in one example, can be a computer having an internal configuration of hardware such as that described in FIG. 2 . However, other suitable implementations of the receiving station 106 are possible. For example, the processing of the receiving station 106 can be distributed among multiple devices.
- an implementation can omit the network 104 .
- a video stream can be encoded and then stored for transmission at a later time to the receiving station 106 or any other device having a non-transitory storage medium or memory.
- the receiving station 106 receives (e.g., via the network 104 , a computer bus, and/or some communication pathway) the encoded video stream and stores the video stream for later decoding.
- a real-time transport protocol is used for transmission of the encoded video over the network 104 .
- a transport protocol other than RTP may be used, e.g., a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based video streaming protocol.
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- the transmitting station 102 and/or the receiving station 106 may include the ability to both encode and decode a video stream as described below.
- the receiving station 106 could be a video conference participant who receives an encoded video bitstream from a video conference server (e.g., the transmitting station 102 ) to decode and view and further encodes and transmits its own video bitstream to the video conference server for decoding and viewing by other participants.

- the encoder 400 can also be implemented as specialized hardware included in, for example, the transmitting station 102 .
- the encoder 400 is a hardware encoder.
- the encoder 400 has the following stages to perform the various functions in a forward path (shown by the solid connection lines) to produce an encoded or compressed bitstream 420 using the video stream 300 as input: an intra/inter prediction stage 402 , a transform stage 404 , a quantization stage 406 , and an entropy encoding stage 408 .
- the encoder 400 may also include a reconstruction path (shown by the dotted connection lines) to reconstruct a frame for encoding of future blocks.
- the encoder 400 has the following stages to perform the various functions in the reconstruction path: a dequantization stage 410 , an inverse transform stage 412 , a reconstruction stage 414 , and a loop filtering stage 416 .

- the prediction block can be subtracted from the current block at the intra/inter prediction stage 402 to produce a residual block (also called a residual).
- the transform stage 404 transforms the residual into transform coefficients in, for example, the frequency domain using block-based transforms.
- the quantization stage 406 converts the transform coefficients into discrete quantum values, which are referred to as quantized transform coefficients, using a quantizer value or a quantization level. For example, the transform coefficients may be divided by the quantizer value and truncated.
- the quantized transform coefficients are then entropy encoded by the entropy encoding stage 408 .

- the computer software program can include machine instructions that, when executed by a processor such as the CPU 202 , cause the receiving station 106 to decode video data in the manner described in FIG. 5 .
- the decoder 500 can also be implemented in hardware included in, for example, the transmitting station 102 or the receiving station 106 .
- the decoder 500 similar to the reconstruction path of the encoder 400 discussed above, includes in one example the following stages to perform various functions to produce an output video stream 516 from the compressed bitstream 420 : an entropy decoding stage 502 , a dequantization stage 504 , an inverse transform stage 506 , an intra/inter prediction stage 508 , a reconstruction stage 510 , a loop filtering stage 512 and a deblocking filtering stage 514 .
- Other structural variations of the decoder 500 can be used to decode the compressed bitstream 420 .
- the data elements within the compressed bitstream 420 can be decoded by the entropy decoding stage 502 to produce a set of quantized transform coefficients.
- the dequantization stage 504 dequantizes the quantized transform coefficients (e.g., by multiplying the quantized transform coefficients by the quantizer value), and the inverse transform stage 506 inverse transforms the dequantized transform coefficients to produce a derivative residual that can be identical to that created by the inverse transform stage 412 in the encoder 400 .
- the decoder 500 can use the intra/inter prediction stage 508 to create the same prediction block as was created in the encoder 400 , e.g., at the intra/inter prediction stage 402 .
- the prediction block can be added to the derivative residual to create a reconstructed block.
- the loop filtering stage 512 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce blocking artifacts.

- the decoder 500 can produce the output video stream 516 without the deblocking filtering stage 514 .
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example of a reference frame buffer 600 .
- the reference frame buffer 600 stores reference frames used to encode or decode blocks of frames of a video sequence.
- the reference frame buffer 600 includes reference frames identified as a last frame LAST_FRAME 602 , a golden frame GOLDEN_FRAME 604 , and an alternative reference frame ALTREF_FRAME 606 .
- the frame header of a reference frame includes a virtual index 608 to a location within the reference frame buffer 600 at which the reference frame is stored.
- a reference frame mapping 612 maps the virtual index 608 of a reference frame to a physical index 614 of memory at which the reference frame is stored.
- One or more refresh flags 610 can be used to remove one or more of the stored reference frames from the reference frame buffer 600 , for example, to clear space in the reference frame buffer 600 for new reference frames, where there are no further blocks to encode or decode using the stored reference frames, or where a new frame is encoded or decoded and identified as a reference frame.
- the number of reference positions within the reference frame buffer 600 , the types, and the names used are examples only.
- the reference frames stored in the reference frame buffer 600 can be used to identify motion vectors for predicting blocks of frames to be encoded or decoded. Different reference frames may be used depending on the type of prediction used to predict a current block of a current frame. For example, in bi-prediction, blocks of the current frame can be forward predicted using either frames stored as the LAST_FRAME 602 or the GOLDEN_FRAME 604 , and backward predicted using a frame stored as the ALTREF_FRAME 606 .
- the reference frame buffer 600 can store up to eight reference frames, wherein each stored reference frame may be associated with a different virtual index 602 of the reference frame buffer. Although three of the eight spaces in the reference frame buffer 600 are used by frames designated as the LAST_FRAME 602 , the GOLDEN_FRAME 604 , and the ALTREF_FRAME 606 , five spaces remain available to store other reference frames. For example, one or more available spaces in the reference frame buffer 600 may be used to store further alternative reference frames, in particular the interpolated reference frame described herein.
- the alternative reference frame designated as the ALTREF_FRAME 606 may be a frame of a video sequence that is distant from a current frame in a display order, but is encoded or decoded earlier than it is displayed.
- the alternative reference frame may be ten, twelve, or more (or fewer) frames after the current frame in a display order.
- Further alternative reference frames can be frames located nearer to the current frame in the display order.
- An alternative reference frame may not correspond directly to a frame in the sequence. Instead, the alternative reference frame may be generated using one or more of the frames having filtering applied, being combined together, or being both combined together and filtered.
- An alternative reference frame may not be displayed. Instead, it can be a frame or portion of a frame generated and transmitted for use only for prediction (i.e., it is omitted when the decoded sequence is displayed).
- the reference frame buffer 600 is shown as being able to store up to eight reference frames, other implementations of the reference frame buffer 600 may be able to store additional or fewer reference frames.
- the available spaces in the reference frame buffer 600 may be used to store frames other than alternative reference frames.
- the available spaces may store a second last frame (i.e., the first frame before the last frame) and/or a third last frame (i.e., a frame two frames before the last frame) as additional forward prediction reference frames.
- a backward frame may be stored as an additional backward prediction reference frame.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram of a group of frames in a display order of the video sequence.
- the group of frames is preceded by a frame 700 , which can be referred to as a key frame or an overlay frame in some cases, and comprises eight frames 702 - 716 .
- No block within the frame 700 is inter predicted using reference frames of the group of frames.
- the frame 700 is a key (also referred to as intra-predicted frame) in this example, which refers to its status that predicted blocks within the frame are only predicted using intra prediction.
- the frame 700 can be an overlay frame, which is an inter-predicted frame that can be a reconstructed frame of a previous group of frames.
- an inter-predicted frame at least some of the predicted blocks are predicted using inter prediction.
- the number of frames forming each group of frames can vary according to the video spatial/temporal characteristics and other encoded configurations, such as the key frame interval selected for random access or error resilience, for example.
- the coding order for each group of frames can differ from the display order. This allows a frame located after a current frame in the video sequence to be used as a reference frame for encoding the current frame.
- a decoder such as the decoder 500
- the group coding structure assigns different roles that respective frames within the group may play in the reference buff (e.g., a last frame, an alternative reference frame, etc.) and defines or indicates the coding order for the frames within a group.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram of an example of a coding order for the group of frames of FIG. 7 .
- the coding order of FIG. 8 is associated with a first group coding structure whereby a single backward reference frame is available for each frame of the group. Because the encoding and decoding order is the same, the order shown in FIG. 8 is generally referred to herein as a coding order.
- the key or overlay frame 700 is designated the golden frame in a reference frame buffer, such as the GOLDEN_FRAME 604 in the reference frame buffer 600 .
- the frame 700 is intra-predicted in this example, so it does not require a reference frame, but an overlay frame as the frame 700 , being a reconstructed frame from a previous group, also does not use a reference frame of the current group of frames.
- the final frame 716 in the group is designated an alternative reference frame in a reference frame buffer, such as the ALTREF_FRAME 606 in the reference frame buffer 600 .
- the frame 716 is coded out of the display order after the frame 700 so as to provide a backward reference frame for each of the remaining frames 702 - 714 .
- the frame 700 serves as an available reference frame for blocks of the frame 716 .
- FIG. 8 is only one example of a coding order for a group of frames.
- Other group coding structures may designate one or more different or additional frames for forward and/or backward prediction.
- available reference frame may be a reference frame that is interpolated using optical flow estimation.
- the reference frame is referred to as a co-located reference frame herein because the dimensions are the same as the current frame.
- the co-located block i.e., the block having the same pixel dimensions and same address in the co-located reference frame
- a motion search may be performed to determine a prediction block for a current block.
- optical flow estimation can result in a reference frame that improves the precision of motion compensated prediction for a current frame, and hence improve video compression performance.
- This interpolated reference frame may also be referred to herein as an optical flow reference frame.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram used to explain the linear projection of a motion field according to the teachings herein.
- the optical flow (also called a motion field) of the current frame may be estimated using the nearest available reconstructed (e.g., reference) frames before and after the current frame.
- the reference frame 1 is a reference frame that may be used for forward prediction of the current frame 900
- the reference frame 2 is a reference frame that may be used for backward prediction of the current frame 900 .
- the immediately preceding, or last, frame 704 e.g., the reconstructed frame stored in the reference frame buffer 600 as the LAST_FRAME 602
- the frame 716 e.g., the reconstructed frame stored in the reference frame buffer 600 as the ALTREF_FRAME 606
- motion vectors may be projected between the pixels in the reference frames 1 and 2 to the pixels in the current frame 900 assuming that the motion field is linear in time.
- the index for the current frame 900 is 3
- the index for the reference frame 1 is 0,
- the index for the reference frame 2 is 716.
- a projected motion vector 904 for a pixel 902 of the current frame 900 is shown.
- the display indexes of the group of frames of FIG. 7 would show that the frame 704 is temporally closer to the frame 706 than the frame 716 . Accordingly, the single motion vector 904 shown in FIG.
- the projected motion field 906 is linear between the reference frame 1 , the current frame 900 , and the reference frame 2 .
- Selecting the nearest available reconstructed forward and backward reference frames and assuming a motion field for respective pixels of the current frame that is linear in time allows generation of the interpolated reference frame using optical flow estimation to be performed at both an encoder and a decoder (e.g., at the intra/inter prediction stage 402 and the intra/inter prediction stage 508 ) without transmitting extra information.
- a decoder e.g., at the intra/inter prediction stage 402 and the intra/inter prediction stage 508
- different frames may be used as designated a priori between the encoder and decoder.
- identification of the frames used for the optical flow estimation may be transmitted. Generation of the interpolated frame is discussed in more detail below.
- FIG. 10 is a flowchart diagram of a method or process 1000 for motion compensated prediction of a frame of a video sequence using an optical flow reference frame generated using optical flow estimation.
- the optical flow reference frame may also be referred to as a co-located reference frame herein.
- the process 1000 can be implemented, for example, as a software program that may be executed by computing devices such as transmitting station 102 or receiving station 106 .
- the software program can include machine-readable instructions that may be stored in a memory such as the memory 204 or the secondary storage 214 , and that, when executed by a processor, such as CPU 202 , may cause the computing device to perform the process 1000 .
- the process 1000 can be implemented using specialized hardware or firmware. Some computing devices may have multiple memories or processors, and the operations described in the process 1000 can be distributed using multiple processors, memories, or both.
- a current frame to be predicted is determined.
- Frames may be coded, and hence predicted, in any encoder order, such as in the coding order shown in FIG. 8 .
- the frames to be predicted may also be referred to as a first, second, third, etc. frame.
- the label of first, second, etc. does not indicate an order of the frames, instead the label is used to distinguish one current frame from another herein.
- the frame is processed in units of blocks in a block coding order, such as a raster scan order.
- the frame is also processed in units of blocks according to receipt of their encoded residuals within an encoded bitstream.
- forward and backward reference frames are determined.
- the forward and backward reference frames are the nearest reconstructed frames before and after (e.g., in display order) the current frame, such as the current frame 900 .
- the process 1000 ends. The current frame is then processed without considering an optical flow reference frame.
- an optical flow reference frame is generated using the reference frames at 1006 . Generating the optical flow reference frame is described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 11-13 .
- the optical flow reference frame may be stored at a defined position within the reference frame buffer 600 .
- a prediction process is performed for the current frame using the optical flow reference frame generated at 1006 .
- the prediction process can include generating a prediction block from the optical flow reference frame for predicting a current block of the frame. Generating the prediction block in either an encoder or a decoder can include selecting the co-located block in the optical flow reference frame as the prediction block.
- generating the prediction block can include performing a motion search within the optical flow reference frame to select the best matching prediction block for the current block.
- generating the prediction block can include using a motion vector decoded from the encoded bitstream to generate the prediction block using pixels of the optical flow reference frame.
- the prediction block is generated at the encoder, the resulting residual can be further processed, such as using the lossy encoding process described with regard to the encoder 400 of FIG. 4 .
- the prediction block is generated at the decoder, the decoded residual for the current block from the encoded bitstream can be combined with the prediction block to form a reconstructed block as described by example with regard to the decoder 500 of FIG. 5 .
- the process 1000 may form part of a rate distortion loop for the current block that uses various prediction modes, including one or more intra prediction modes and both single and compound inter prediction modes using the available prediction frames for the current frame.
- a single inter prediction mode uses only a single forward or backward reference frame for inter prediction.
- a compound inter prediction mode uses both a forward and a backward reference frame for inter prediction.
- the rate e.g., the number of bits
- the distortion may be calculated as the differences between pixel values of the block before encoding and after decoding. The differences can be a sum of absolute differences or some other measure that captures the accumulated error for blocks of the frames.
- the prediction process at 1008 may be repeated for all blocks of the current frame until the current frame is encoded or decoded.
- J data is the data penalty based on the brightness constancy assumption (i.e., the assumption that an intensity value of a small portion of an image remains unchanged over time despite a position change).
- J spatial is the spatial penalty based on the smoothness of the motion field (i.e., the characteristic that neighboring pixels likely belong to the same object item in an image, resulting in substantial the same image motion).
- the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ controls the importance of the smoothness of the motion field. A large value for the parameter ⁇ results in a smoother motion field and can better account for motion at a larger scale. In contrast, a smaller value for the parameter ⁇ may more effectively adapt to object edges and the movement of small objects.
- E x , E y , and E t are derivatives of pixel values of reference frames with respect to the horizontal axis x, the vertical axis y, and time t (e.g., as represented by frame indexes).
- the horizontal axis and the vertical axis are defined relative to the array of the pixels forming the current frame, such as the current frame 900 , and the reference frames, such as the reference frames 1 and 2 .
- E x (index r2 ⁇ index cur )/(index r2 ⁇ index r1 ) ⁇ E x (r1) +(index cur ⁇ index r1 )/(index r2 ⁇ index r1 ) ⁇ E x (r2)
- E y (index cur ⁇ index r1 )/(index r2 ⁇ index r1 ) ⁇ E y (r1) +(index cur ⁇ index r1 )/(index r2 ⁇ index r1 ) ⁇ E y (r2)
- E t E (r2) ⁇ E (r1) (5)
- variable E (r1) is a pixel value at a projected position in the reference frame 1 based on the motion field of the current pixel location in the frame being encoded.
- variable E (r2) is a pixel value at a projected position in the reference frame 2 based on the motion field of the current pixel location in the frame being encoded
- variable index r1 is the display index of the reference frame 1 , where the display index of a frame is its index in the display order of the video sequence.
- variable index r2 is the display index of the reference frame 2
- variable index cur is the display index of the current frame 900 .
- the variable E x (r1) is the horizontal derivative calculated at the reference frame 1 using a linear filter.
- the variable E x (r2) is the horizontal derivative calculated at the reference frame 2 using a linear filter.
- the variable E y (r1) is the vertical derivative calculated at the reference frame 1 using a linear filter.
- the variable E y (r2) is the vertical derivative calculated at the reference frame 2 using a linear filter.
- the linear filter used for calculating the horizontal derivative is a 7-tap filter with filter coefficients [ ⁇ 1/60, 9/60, ⁇ 45/60, 0, 45/60, ⁇ 9/60, 1/60].
- the filter can have a different frequency profile, a different number of taps, or both.
- the linear filter used for calculating the vertical derivatives may be the same as or different from the linear filter used for calculating the horizontal derivatives.
- ⁇ u is the Laplacian of the horizontal component u of the motion field

- FIG. 11 is a flowchart diagram of a method or process 1100 for generating an optical flow reference frame.
- the process 1100 can implement step 1006 of the process 1000 .
- the process 1400 can be implemented, for example, as a software program that may be executed by computing devices such as transmitting station 102 or receiving station 106 .
- the software program can include machine-readable instructions that may be stored in a memory such as the memory 204 or the secondary storage 214 , and that, when executed by a processor, such as CPU 202 , may cause the computing device to perform the process 1100 .
- the process 1300 can be implemented using specialized hardware or firmware. As described above, multiple processors, memories, or both, may be used.
- the estimated motion vectors from the current frame to the reference frames can be used to initialize the optical flow estimation for the current frame.
- all pixels within the current frame are assigned an initialized motion vector. They define initial motion fields that can be utilized to warp the reference frames to the current frame for a first processing level to shorten the motion lengths between reference frames.
- one or more spatial neighbors having an initialized motion vector may be used. For example, an average of the available neighboring initial motion vectors may be used.
- reference frame 2 may be used to predict a pixel of reference frame 1 , where reference frame 1 is the last frame before the current frame being coded. That motion vector, projected on to the current frame using linear projection in a similar manner as shown in FIG. 9 , results in a motion field mv cur at the intersecting pixel location, such as the motion field 906 at the pixel location of the pixel 902 .
- FIG. 11 refers to a first processing level because there are desirably multiple processing levels to the process 1100 .
- FIG. 12 is a diagram that illustrates the process 1100 of FIG. 11 .
- the following description uses the phrase motion field. This phrase is intended to collectively refer to the motion field for respective pixels unless otherwise clear from the context. Accordingly, the plural “motion fields” and “motion field” may be used interchangeably when referring to more than one motion field. Further, the phrase optical flow may be used interchangeably with the phrase motion field when referring to the movement of a single pixel.
- a pyramid, or multi-layered, structure may be used.
- the reference frames are scaled down to one or more different scales.
- the optical flow is first estimated to obtain a motion field at the highest level (the first processing level) of the pyramid, i.e., using the reference frames that are scaled the most.
- the motion field is upscaled and used to initialize the optical flow estimation at the next level. This process of upscaling the motion field, using it to initialize the optical flow estimation of the next level, and obtaining the motion field continues until the lowest level of the pyramid is reached (i.e., until the optical flow estimation is completed for the reference frames at full scale).
- the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ is set for solving the Lagrangian function (1).
- the process 1100 uses multiple values for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ .
- the first value at which the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ is set at 1104 may be a relatively large value, such as 100.
- the reference frames are warped to the current frame according to the motion field for the current processing level. Warping the reference frames to the current frame may be performed using subpixel location rounding. It is worth noting that the motion field mv cur that is used at the first processing level is downscaled from its full resolution value to the resolution of the level before performing the warping. Downscaling a motion field is discussed in more detail below.
- each pixel in a warped image E warped (r1) is calculated as the referenced pixel given by the motion vector mv r1 .
- Subpixel interpolation may be performed using a conventional subpixel interpolation filter.
- two warped reference frames exist.
- the two warped reference frames are used to estimate the motion field between them at 1108 .
- Estimating the motion field at 1108 can include multiple steps.
- the derivatives E x , E y , and E t are calculated using the functions (3), (4), and (5). Then, if there are multiple layers, the derivatives are downscaled to the current level. As shown in FIG. 12 , the reference frames are used to calculate the derivatives at the original scale to capture details.
- the downscaled derivatives at each level 1 may calculated by averaging within a 2 1 by 2 1 block. It is worth noting that, because calculating the derivatives as well as averaging them are both linear operations, the two operations may be combined in a single linear filter to calculate the derivatives at each level 1 . This can lower complexity of the calculations.
- 2D two-dimensional
- the motion field for the current frame is updated or refined using the estimated motion field between the warped reference frames.
- the current motion field may be updated by adding the estimated motion field on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
- a query is made at 1110 to determine whether there are additional values for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ available. Smaller values for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ can address smaller scales of motion. If there are additional values, the process 1100 can return to 1104 to set the next value for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ . For example, the process 1100 can repeat while reducing the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ by half in each iteration.
- the motion field estimated at 1108 is the current motion field for warping the reference frames at 1106 in this next iteration. Then, the motion field is again estimated at 1108 .
- the processing at 1104 , 1106 , and 1108 continues until all of the possible Lagrangian parameters at 1110 are processed. In an example, there are three levels to the pyramid as shown in FIG. 12 , so the smallest value for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ is 25. This repeating processing while modifying the Lagrangian parameter may be referred to as annealing the Lagrangian parameter.
- the process 1100 advances to 1112 to determine whether there are more processing levels to process at 1112 . If there are additional processing levels at 1112 , the process advances to 1114 , where the motion field is upscaled before processing the next layer using each of the available values for the Lagrangian parameter ⁇ starting at 1104 .
- the optical flow is first estimated to obtain a motion field at the highest level of the pyramid. Thereafter, the motion field is upscaled and used to initialize the optical flow estimation at the next level. This process of upscaling the motion field, using it to initialize the optical flow estimation of the next level, and obtaining the motion field continues until the lowest level of the pyramid is reached (i.e., until the optical flow estimation is completed for the derivatives calculated at full scale) at 1112 .
- the process advances to 1116 .
- the number of levels can be three, such as in the example of FIG. 12 .
- the warped reference frames are blended to form the optical flow reference frame E (cur) .
- the warped reference frames blended at 1116 may be the full-scale reference frames that are warped again according to the process described at 1106 using the motion field estimated at 1108 .
- the full-scale reference frames may be warped twice—once using the initial upscaled motion field from the previous layer of processing and again after the motion field is refined at the full-scale level.
- Optional occlusion detection may be performed as part of the blending. Occlusion of objects and background commonly occurs in a video sequence, where parts of the object appear in one reference frame but are hidden in the other. Generally, the optical flow estimation method described above cannot estimate the motion of the object in this situation because the brightness constancy assumption is violated. If the size of the occlusion is relatively small, the smoothness penalty function may estimate the motion quite accurately. That is, if the undefined motion field at the hidden part is smoothed by the neighboring motion vectors, the motion of the whole object can be accurate.
- FIG. 13 is a diagram that illustrates object occlusion.
- the occluded part of object A shows in reference frame 1 and is hidden by object B in reference frame 2 .
- the referenced pixel from reference frame 2 is from object B.
- using only the warped pixel from the reference frame 1 is desirable. Accordingly, using a technique that detects occlusions, instead of or in addition to the above blending, may provide a better blending result, and hence a better reference frame.
- the motion vector of the occluded part of object A points to object B in reference frame 2 .
- the first situation is that the warped pixel values E warped (r1) and E warped (r2) are very different because they are from two different objects.
- the second situation is that the pixels in object B are referenced by multiple motion vectors, which are for object B in the current frame and for the occluded part of object A in the current frame.
- N ref (r2) /N ref (r1) is greater than a threshold T ref .
- N ref (r2) is the total number of times that the referenced pixel in the reference frame 1 is referenced by any pixel in the current co-located frame. Given the existence of subpixel interpolation described above, N ref (r2) is counted when the reference subpixel location is within one pixel length of the interested pixel location. Moreover, if mv r2 points to a subpixel location, the weighted average of N ref (r2) of the four neighboring pixels as the total number of references for the current subpixel location. N ref (r1) is similarly defined.
- an occlusion can be detected in the first reference frame using the first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame. Then, the blending of the warped reference frames can include populating pixel positions of the optical flow reference frame corresponding to the occlusion with pixel values from the second warped reference frame. Similarly, an occlusion can be detected in the second reference frame using the first warped reference frame and the second warped reference frame. Then, the blending of the warped reference frames can include populating pixel positions of the optical flow reference frame corresponding to the occlusion with pixel values from the first warped reference frame
