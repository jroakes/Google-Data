Definitions
- the present invention is related to the following invention which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention:
- This invention relates in general to radio communication systems, and particularly, to reliable conversion of voice in a radio communication system.
- voice recognition systems are becoming popular with consumers of conventional computers due to the availability of continuous speech recognition systems. These applications are generally tailored for speaker-dependent voice recognition. That is, to provide a high degree of accuracy in the conversion of voice to a textual message, the continuous speech recognition system must be trained by a particular speaker's voice. This is generally performed by having the speaker read a canned message of several paragraphs, which is then recorded and analyzed by the speech recognition system to develop a set of statistical models of the speaker's voice. These models are later used by the continuous speech recognition system to convert the speaker's voice signals into a textual message.

- FIG. 1 is an electrical block diagram of a radio communication system comprising a fixed portion 102 and a portable portion 104.
- the fixed portion 102 includes a controller 112 for controlling operation of a plurality of base stations 116 by way of conventional communication links 114, such as microwave links.
- the portable portion 104 includes a plurality of SCR's (selective call radios) 122 for receiving messages from the base stations 116 under the control of the controller 112.
- SCR's selective call radios
- the radio communication system may be modified to support two-way communication between the SCR's 122 and the base stations 116. This modification may be achieved by the use of radio transceivers at both the SCR's 122 and the base stations 116.
- the controller 112 receives messages from callers utilizing a conventional telephone 124 for communicating with a conventional PSTN (public switch telephone network) 110.
- PSTN 110 then relays messages to the controller 112 through a conventional telephone line 101 coupled to the controller 112.
- the controller 112 processes the messages, and delivers them to the base stations 116 for transmission to designated SCR's 122.
- the telephone 124 may be directly coupled to the controller 112 by way of a conventional telephone line 103.
- FIGS. 2 and 3 are electrical block diagrams of the fixed and portable portions 102, 104 of the radio communication system according to the present invention.
- the electrical block diagram of the fixed portion 102 includes the elements of the controller 112 and the base stations 116.
- the controller 112 comprises a conventional processing system 210 for controlling operation of the base stations 116, a voice recognition system 218, and a transmitter interface 204 for communicating messages to the base stations 116.
- the voice recognition system 218 receives voice messages from the PSTN 110, and/or from a direct telephone connection 103, and converts the voice messages to equivalent text messages.
- the processing system 210 includes conventional hardware such as a computer system 212 (with built-in random access memory (RAM)--not shown in FIG. 2) and mass media 214 (e.g., a conventional hard disk) to perform the programmed operations of the controller 112.
- the base stations 116 comprise a conventional RF transmitter 202 coupled to an antenna 201 for transmitting the messages received from the controller 112.
- FIGS. 5-6 show flowcharts 400, 417 summarizing the operation of the radio communication system according to the present invention.
- the flowchart 400 depicts programmed instructions of the controller 112 which are initially stored in the mass media 214 and are then operated from the RAM included in the computer system 212.
- the flowchart 400 begins with step 401 where a caller initiates communication with the radio communication system intending to send a message to a selected SCR 122.
- this communication may originate from the PSTN 110 or a direct telephone connection 103 with the controller 112.
- the caller's voice signal is converted to a textual equivalent of speech.
- the text message is directly transmitted the selected SCR 122 in step 432. No further processing is required of the processing system 210.
- the processing system 210 proceeds to step 418 where the voice recognition system 218 generates a likelihood of success (e.g., between 0% and 100%) that the voice signal has been flawlessly converted to a text message.
- the processing system 210 compares the likelihood of success to a predetermined threshold.
- the predetermined threshold is, for example, selected by the service provider of the radio communication system based on a minimum acceptable level of accuracy desired (e.g., confidence level below 90% is unacceptable) from the conversion step 417.
- a minimum acceptable level of accuracy desired e.g., confidence level below 90% is unacceptable
- the processing system 210 proceeds to step 424; otherwise, the processing system 210 proceeds to step 432 where the text message is transmitted to the targeted SCR 122.
- the processing system 210 prompts a human operator of the radio communication system to listen to an audible representation of the voice signal generated by the caller in step 401, and to generate a corrected text message in step 426.
- Step 426 may be accomplished, for example, by having the human operator sit at a computer terminal (see FIG. 4) coupled to the radio communication system, listening to the audible representation of the voice signal and transcribing at the computer terminal the caller's voice message in total. Once this has been completed, the human operator presents the corrected text message to the radio communication by prompting the radio communication system to accept the corrected text message. Presentation of the corrected message may be accomplished by depressing one or more predetermined keys on the computer terminal (e.g., CTRL T representative of a command to transmit the text message to the SCR 122). It will be appreciated that alternative conventional methods may exist for delivering the corrected text message to the radio communication system, and that any of these methods would be considered by one of ordinary skill in the art to be within the scope of the present invention.
- CTRL T representative of a command to transmit the text message to the SCR 122
- the human operator may listen audibly to the caller's voice message, and view contemporaneously the text message generated by the voice recognition system 218 in step 417 on a monitor of the computer terminal which the human operator is operating from. In doing so, the human operator may find that the text message was converted flawlessly, and no correction is necessary. It is worth noting that a likelihood of success below the predetermined threshold (e.g., 90%) does not necessarily mean that the conversion of the caller's voice message was flawed. For this reason, the human operator may find that a correction is not necessary after listening to the audible representation of the voice signal. Similarly, the human operator may find that the text message generated by the voice recognition system 218 in step 417 only has a few errors. In that case, the human operator would correct these flaws rather than transcribe the entire message.
- the predetermined threshold e.g. 90%
- step 426 the above embodiments describing step 426 are modified such that the controller 112 places the caller on hold while still communicating through the PSTN 110 or the direct telephone line 103 with the radio communication system.
- the human operator finds that the audible representation of the voice signal is incomprehensible in step 426, the human operator proceeds to contact the caller in step 428 and requests a repetition of the voice message in step 430. The human operator then transcribes the repeated voice message into a corrected text message.
- the processing system 210 proceeds to step 432 whereby it causes a selected base station 116 to transmit the corrected text message to the SCR 122.
- a prominent feature of the present invention which substantially reduces the use of a human operator as depicted in steps 424-430 of FIG. 5 is included in the voice recognition system 218.
- the flowchart of FIG. 6 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the voice recognition system 218. This embodiment provides a high degree of first-time success in converting a caller's voice message to a textual message flawlessly, thereby limiting the frequency for which steps 424-430 are invoked.
- step 402 a voice signal originated by a caller in step 401 is sampled.
- An illustration of a voice signal is shown in FIG. 7.
- the processing system 210 is programmed to apply a Fourier transform to a plurality of frame intervals of the sampled voice signal (e.g., 10-25 ms) to generate spectral data having a spectral envelope for each of the plurality of frame intervals.
- the Fourier transform applied in this step is preferably a fast Fourier transform.
- the spectral signal over a frame interval is shown in FIG. 8. Assuming the input speech signal is represented by x n , the following equation describes the result of step 403: ##EQU1## where 0 ⁇ k ⁇ N-1.
- the spectral data is subdivided into a plurality of bands, each of the plurality of bands having a predetermined bandwidth (e.g., 400 Hz). It will be appreciated that, alternatively, each band may be of variable bandwidth.
- the processing system 210 determines an average magnitude of the spectral data for each of the plurality of bands. Then in step 407 a logarithmic function is applied to the average magnitude to generate a converted average magnitude. In step 408, the converted average magnitude is then decorrelated (preferably with a discrete cosine transform) to generate spectral envelope features.
- the controller 112 then proceeds to step 409 to filter out the spectral envelope from the spectral data of each of the plurality of frame intervals to generate filtered spectral data for each of the plurality of frame intervals.
- This step preferably comprises the steps of averaging the spectral data of each of the plurality of frame intervals to generate a spectral envelope estimate, and subtracting the spectral envelope estimate from the spectral data.
- These steps are substantially represented by the function, ##EQU2##
- the function ⁇ (i) is a 1-D Haar function well known in the art, and P k is the convolution of the Haar function with the original spectral data P k .
- the result of filtering the spectral data is shown in FIG. 9.
- step 410 a fast Fourier transform is applied to the filtered spectral data for each of the plurality of bands to generate an autocorrelation function for each of the plurality of bands. If there is a strong harmonic structure in the original spectral data, the autocorrelation function for each of the plurality of bands will have a high peak value around the value of its pitch period. For this reason, each autocorrelation function is preferably normalized by its corresponding spectral band energy.
- step 412 the controller 112 proceeds to measure a value of the magnitude of the autocorrelation function for each of the plurality of bands.
- the value of the magnitude of the autocorrelation function is defined as a measure of a degree of voiceness for each of the plurality of bands.
- the value of the magnitude of the autocorrelation function corresponds to a peak magnitude of the autocorrelation function.
- the value of the magnitude of the autocorrelation function for each of the plurality of bands is determined by: (1) summing the autocorrelation function of each of the plurality of bands to generate a composite autocorrelation function, (2) determining a peak magnitude of the composite autocorrelation function, (3) determining from the peak magnitude a corresponding frequency mark, and (4) utilizing the corresponding frequency mark to determine a corresponding magnitude value for each of the plurality of bands.
- Graphs (a)-(d) represent the autocorrelation function for each of bands 1-4.
- Graph (e) is the composite autocorrelation function as a result of summing the autocorrelation functions of bands 1-4. From the composite autocorrelation function a peak magnitude, and a corresponding frequency mark is determined. The corresponding frequency mark is then used to determine a corresponding magnitude value for each of the plurality of bands as shown in graphs (a)-(d).
- the value of the magnitude of the autocorrelation function is a measure of the degree of voiceness for each of the plurality of bands.
- the spectral envelope features determined in step 408 and the degree of voiceness just discussed is applied to a corresponding plurality of phoneme models.
- Phoneme models are known in the art as models of speech determined from statistical modeling of human speech. In the art, phoneme models are also commonly referred to as Hidden Markov Models. A phoneme represents the smallest quantum of sound used by a speaker for constructing a word.
- the word “is” may be decomposed into two phoneme sounds: "ih” and "z.” Since individuals of differing cultures may speak with differing dialects, the word “is” may have more than one set of phoneme models to represent mismatched populations. For example, there may be individuals who end the word “is” with a "s" sound, i.e., "ih” and "s.”
- the phoneme models are determined over a large population of samples of human speech, which accounts for varying pronunciations based on varying speech dialectics. Deriving phoneme models from a large population allows for the present invention to operate as a speaker-independent voice recognition system. That is, the phoneme models are not dependent on a particular speaker's voice. With speaker-independent descriptions built into a phoneme model library, the controller 112 of the radio communication system can convert the voice of any speaker nation-wide without prior training of the caller's voice to a textual message. It will be appreciated, however, that the present invention may be altered so that a phoneme library may be constructed from training provided by one or more specific speakers, thereby forming a speaker-dependent phoneme library. Notwithstanding this alternative embodiment, the ensuing discussions will focus on a speaker-independent phoneme library.
- the conversion of voice into a textual message is accomplished by comparing the spectral envelope features of the spectral data for each of the plurality of bands and the degree of voiceness for each of the plurality of bands with a library of speaker-independent phoneme models. From this comparison, a list of likely phonemes are identified, which are then compared to a dictionary of words (from, e.g., the English language) and their corresponding phonemes to derive a textual equivalent of speech from the processed voice signal of the caller.
- a dictionary of words from, e.g., the English language
- the following probability function is preferably used: ##EQU3## wherein M s is the number of mixture components in stream s.
- the variable S for the present invention is equal to 2, which represents the product of two probabilities. That is, one product represents the likelihood of a matched set of phoneme models based on the spectral envelope features of the spectral data per band, and another product represents the likelihood of a matched set of phoneme models based on the degree of voiceness per band.
- variable c jsm is weighting factor
- function N is a multivariate Gaussian function
- the variable o st is input data vectors representative of the spectral envelope features and degree of voiceness for each of the plurality of bands
- ⁇ jsm and ⁇ jsm are the mean and covariance vectors of each of the phoneme models in the phoneme library.
- the variable ⁇ is used for providing differing weights to the spectral envelope features probability result versus the degree of voiceness probability result.
- the spectral envelope features probability result may be given a weight of 1.00 while the degree of voiceness probability result may be given a weight of 1.20.
- more importance is given to the outcome derived from the use of degree of voiceness data rather than the spectral envelope features data. It will be appreciated that any weight may be given to either product depending on the application in which the present invention is utilized.
- Each of the probability results (b j ) is then compared over a stream of the plurality of frames to determine an equivalent textual version of the caller's voice message. In the event the comparison process leads to one or more possible textual streams, the textual stream with the greatest likelihood of success is chosen according to a composite probability result for each branch. Once the textual result with the greatest likelihood of success has been chosen, the controller 112 proceeds to steps 418-426 of FIG. 5 as discussed earlier.
- This article is useful for gaining further insight into the use of the foregoing equation (represented by b j ) to predict the likelihood of a stream of phonemes derived from a voice signal.
- the foregoing method and apparatus are substantially advantages over prior art systems.
- the present invention takes advantage of analyzing the texture of the speech spectrum (described above as the degree of voiceness) along with the spectral envelope features of the speech signal.
- the degree of voiceness the degree of voiceness
- the present invention provides a higher degree of accuracy for flawlessly converting speaker-dependent and speaker-independent voice signals to a text message.
- FIG. 3 shows an electrical block diagram of the SCR 122 according to the present invention.
- the SCR 122 receives textual messages (in the form of, e.g., alpha-numeric messages) generated by a caller after having been processed by the fixed portion 102 of the radio communication as described by the flowcharts of FIGS. 5-6.
- the SCR 122 comprises a receiver 304 coupled to an antenna 302, a power switch 306, a processor 308, an alerting device 316, a display 318, and user controls 314.
- the receiver 304 and antenna 302 are conventional RF elements for receiving messages transmitted by the base stations 116.
- the power switch 306 is a conventional switch, such as a MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) switch for controlling power to the receiver 304 under the direction of the processor 308, thereby providing a battery saving function.
- MOS metal oxide semiconductor
- the processor 308 is used for controlling operation of the SCR 122. Generally, its primary function is to decode and process demodulated messages provided by the receiver 304, storing them and alerting a user of the received message. To perform this function, the processor 308 comprises a conventional microprocessor 312 coupled to a conventional memory 310 including nonvolatile and volatile memory portions, such as a ROM (read-only memory) and RAM (random-access memory). One of the uses of the memory 310 is for storing messages received from the base stations 116. Another use is for storing one or more selective call addresses utilized in identifying incoming messages belonging to the SCR 122.
- ROM read-only memory
- RAM random-access memory
- the processor 308 activates the alerting device 316 which generates a tactile and/or audible alert signal to the user.
- the display 318 which is, for example, a conventional LCD (liquid crystal display) and conventional user controls 314, the user may process the received messages.
- the user controls 314 provide options such as reading, deleting, and locking of messages.
