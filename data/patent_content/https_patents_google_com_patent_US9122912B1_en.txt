Definitions
- Social network systems often enable users to share photos with each other. For example, users can share photos with friends and family, which provides enjoyable and bonding experiences among users of social network systems.
- a user can create a photo album that is associated with the user's profile. As owner of the photo album, the user can then allow other users to view the photo album when visiting the photos section of the user's profile.
- Implementations generally relate to sharing photos in a social network system.

- the group of photos is generated based on the significance of the people in the photos to the target user.
- a system obtains photos associated with a target user in a social network. The system detects the faces of people in the photos and then computes significance values for the faces, where each significance value indicates a degree of significance between the target user and each person represented by each face.
- the significance value for each face may be based on the frequency that each face appears in the photos. For example, if a given person appears in the photos with high frequency, that person would receive a higher significance value. A higher significance value may indicate a higher degree of significance (e.g., a family member, close friend, etc.) between the person in the photos and the target user.
- the system then generates a significance ranking of the significance values, and then determines a group of photos for the target user based on the significance ranking. For example, the system may include people with higher significance rankings (e.g., family members, close friends, etc.) in the group of photos.
- the system then transmits the group of photos to the target user.

- each significance value indicates a degree of significance between the target user and each person represented by each face.
- the significance value indicates how important a person in a photo is to a target user.
- the significance value for each face may be based on the frequency that each face appears in the photos.
- a particular face gets a significance value that is proportional to the frequency that the face appears in photos in the target user's photo albums. For example, if a given person appears in the photos with high frequency, system 102 may compute a higher significance value for that person.
- the higher significance value indicates a higher degree of significance between the person in the photos and the target user. The person may be captured in many photos because the person is a family member, or close friend, etc.
- a significance value may also be based on a type of social connection between that target user and each person associated with each face. Types of social connections that may warrant higher significance values may include family members and close friends.
- system 102 may compute the significance values for faces based on the frequency that each face appears in the photos, the type of social connection between that target user and each person associated with each face, or a combination thereof.
