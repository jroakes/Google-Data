Abstract
Disclosed are methods for codebook sub-sampling. In various implementations, a wireless terminal receives a reference signal, determines, based on the reference signal, a first precoding index i2 for a first subband and a second precoding index i'2 for a second subband. The wireless terminal transmits a representation of i2 and a representation of i'2 to a base station. In various implementations, i'2 belongs to the set Si2 which, in one implementation, equals {mod(i2 -K1+k,K), k=0,1,...,K2}, where K1>1, and where K2>1 and K>1 are integers. According to an implementation, the wireless terminal receives the reference signal from a first base station and transmits the representations of i2 and i'2 to a second base station.

It should be noted that, for the order-2W of scheme 2
2matrix comprises the set of the different structure for restrainting selection and common phase.On the other hand, for the order-2W of scheme 1
2matrix more regularly because only exist two common phase structures and 8 bundles right.Therefore, in certain embodiments, with scheme 2, order-2 is compared, and Two ranks (first based on bundle group, then based on common phase item) can be scheme 1 better, order-2 works.
Alternatively, two W are considered

To order 1, W
2comprise bundle and select Component Matrices Y, it can select any bundle for antenna port to (#15, #16) and (#17, #18), but has the light beam selection Component Matrices Y for the right phase deviation of co-polarization relative to another.To order 1 (if that is, the most newly reported RI is 1), bundle space matrix W
1n () can be compressed into 3 (such as, PUCCH1-1 subpattern 1 and subpattern 2), it has potential performance degradation.The above-mentioned form that suggested sub sampling is I
pMI=mod (i
1, 8), wherein, I
pMIrepresent sub-sub sampling PMI, and i
1∈ 0,1 ..., 15} is for W
