Definitions
- This specification relates to improving language-specific search results provided by a search engine.
- Search engines accept query parameters including search words or phrases and return information identifying one or more results.
- Each result is a content item (e.g., a word processing document, a web page, a text file, an image, a multimedia file, or the like) that matches the query parameters.
- the content items are generally identified by searching an index of available items for ones that match the query parameters. In the case of an Internet search engine, the index covers a large number of content items, many of which are hypertext documents on the world wide web (the “web”). Information about the content items is collected from servers that host the content items in numerous countries and have content in many different languages.
- a search engine can implement a number of strategies for ranking identified results. For example, a search engine user may specify a preferred language in which the user prefers identified results to be written. The user's preference can be specified explicitly, in a query parameter, for example, or in profile information provided by the user. Based on the preferred language, the ranking of identified results can be modified to return documents or other content items corresponding to the specified language.
- This specification describes technologies related to using language preference information in selecting or ranking search query results for presentation to a user of a search engine.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of storing language content correspondence data that represents correspondences between user language preferences and content item selections; generating language statistics for content items based on the stored language content correspondence data; receiving a search query from a user device; determining a query language preference for the search query; generating a ranking of results satisfying the query, the ranking based at least in part on the query language preference and the language statistics of the content items; and sending data identifying the ranked results to the user device in response to the search query.
- Other embodiments include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination.
- the content items are accessible over the Internet using uniform resource locators each specifying a domain; and the language statistics are aggregated based on the domains corresponding to the content items.
- the content items comprise web pages.
- a content item index is updated with the language statistics.
- the language content correspondence data comprises user language preference data linked to content item presentation records; and the language selection statistics are further generated from the content item presentation records.
- a content item presentation record includes a record of the display of a reference to a content item to a user having the opportunity to select the content item using the representation.
- Generating ranked results includes computing a language selection weight for each of a plurality of content items, and the rank of a given content item is based on a ranking score based at least in part on the language selection weight of the given content item.
- the language selection weight of a given content item is proportional to a percentage of total users selecting the content item having a language preference matching the query language preference.
- Computing the language selection weight of a given content item includes applying a factor based on a percentage of users having a language preference matching the query language preference who selected the content item upon being presented with an opportunity to do so by a search engine.
- the language selection weight is computed according to be bias1+(A ⁇ bias2)+(B ⁇ bias3), where A is a percentage of the total users that clicked on a content item that has a language preference matching the query language preference; B is a click through percentage of the content item for users having a language preference matching the query language preference; and bias1, bias2, and bias3 are bias values.
- Results provided to a search engine user can include results in the preferred language of the user as well additional results that are in a different language, where the results are likely to be of interest to the user.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart of an example method for providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example network environment of a search engine for providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example method for providing search results and using language selection statistics to adjust content item ranking scores.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a set of example records that can be used in providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example web page form for entering a search query.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example results web page including a preferred language results section and an other-language results section.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example results web page including intermingled results.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart of an example method 100 for providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- the method 100 is described with reference to an example search engine implementing the method.
- the search engine can be implemented on one or more computers operating in one or more locations.
- the search engine can interact with users over a network, e.g., the Internet. Users can interact with the search engine using a user interface provided by the search engine to a user device, e.g., user interface web pages provided to user computing devices, for example, personal computers, smart phones, or personal digital assistants.
- the search engine stores data identifying selections by users of particular content items from among search results with data identifying any indicated language preference of the users making the selections ( 102 ).
- the search engine can store records of selections made by many users of the search engine, e.g., records in a click log identifying content items selected by users from a list of search results.
- the search engine may provide users with an opportunity to opt in or opt out of features that may collect the personal information.
- the data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user and so that any identified user preferences or user interactions are generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user.
- Each recorded selection can include an indication of a language preference of the user that made the selection.
- a user language preference may have been indicated implicitly or explicitly.
- An implicit indication can be made, for example, by the use of a particular language in the submitted query preceding the recorded selection, or a pattern of using a particular language in submitted queries.
- An explicit indication can include, for example, a user selection of a check box or other user-generated input indicating a language preference that is submitted with a query, a language preference stored in a web browser cookie, or a language preference stored in association with a user's search engine account, e.g., in a profile maintained by the user.
- the user profile information may be anonymized, as described above.
- Other implicit and explicit indications can also be used.
- the language preference may be stored with a record of the selection (e.g., in a click log), or linked to such a record.
- the search engine generates user language statistics for content items selected by users ( 104 ). For example, the search engine can aggregate the language preference data from the selection records (e.g., click logs) to create language preference statistics for a given content item.
- the statistics can be maintained for individual content items, for groups of content items based on network addresses of the content items, or both. For example, selection statistics can be aggregated across an Internet domain for all content that is located in that domain.
- the search engine receives a search query request from a user and determines a query language preference ( 106 ).
- the query language preference can be received from the user with the query or it can be determined from information about the user maintained by the search engine, as described above.
- the query language preference can be specific to the query, or it can be a preference associated with the query because it is a language preference of the user issuing the query.
- the language preference can be indicated implicitly or explicitly, as described above.
- the search engine ranks a set of search results for the query based on the query language preference and the previously-stored content item language statistics ( 108 ).
- the content item language statistics can be used by the search engine to identify content items in another language that are likely to be of interest to users having a given language preference.
- Some content items will have an associated language.
- a web crawler application may be able to assign a language to an indexed web page based on the language used in the content of the web page.
- language statistics for such a web page will indicate that the user language preferences of users clicking on that web page overwhelmingly correspond to the language used in the page content.
- the language selection statistics for that web page can further indicate, however, that users having language preferences that are not the same as the language of the web page content often visit the web page. This can occur, for example, where users are multilingual and the content of the page appears in a language that is understood by the users, although it is not their indicated preferred language.
- users who speak Hindi may also be found, with some frequency, to speak English and to be interested in the content of a given page even though it is written in English.
- Interest in the content of the page by users having a Hindi language preference can be determined from aggregate statistics collected for the page from, for example, click logs, as described above.
- the content of the page can be valuable to users having a Hindi language preference despite the fact that it is written in a language other than the users' preferred language.
- a set of ranked results generated by the search engine will generally include content items that have language statistics indicating that users who have previously selected those content items have a language preference matching the query language preference. Where the statistics for a given content item show interest by users having a language preference matching the query language preference, that content item's ranking score, and therefore possibly the item's place in the ranking order of the search results, can be elevated.
- the search engine responds to the query with search results ( 110 ). For example, a list of ranked results (i.e., results in ranked order) or a user interface document (e.g., a web page) presenting the results in ranked order can be sent to the user device for display to a user.
- search results For example, a list of ranked results (i.e., results in ranked order) or a user interface document (e.g., a web page) presenting the results in ranked order can be sent to the user device for display to a user.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example network environment of a search engine 202 for providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- the search engine 202 and each of its components can be implemented as computer programs running on one or more computers operating in one or more locations.
- a user of the user device 206 e.g., a personal computer, smart phone, or personal digital assistant
- the user can direct web browser software running on the user device 206 to a network address of the search engine 202 , and the front end 208 can respond by transmitting one or more web-based user interface pages to the web browser for display to the user.
- the search engine 202 can accept queries from the user device 206 and respond with a web page that include search results.
- the search engine 202 indexes content available on the network 204 for later identification and retrieval of search results that satisfy user queries.
- the data identifying each search result for the user can include, for example, a title, a snippet of text extracted from the result, and a hypertext link to the result.
- the presentations of results may be grouped into a predetermined number of search results (e.g., ten) on each user interface page.
- a user can submit multiple search queries to the search engine 202 in one search session.
- a search session can be identified by the search engine 202 in one or more of a number of ways.
- a search session can be defined by a period of time between queries. For example, if a particular user device 206 submits a query, a current search session can be initiated. The current search session can be terminated when the search engine 202 has not received further queries from the user for a predetermined period of time (e.g., 5 or 10 minutes).
- a search session can also be defined by a user indicating a beginning and an end of a search session (e.g., by logging into the search engine and logging out of the search engine).
- a search session can also be identified when a relationship exists between a newly received search query and previously received search queries from the same user, so that the newly and previously received search queries are identified as belonging to the same session.
- the newly and previously received search queries may be limited to queries received in a time window of predetermined size, e.g., 10 or 30 minutes or one or two hours.
- the newly and previously received search queries may be limited to queries that are not separated by a query that does not share the relationship. Other ways of identifying and tracking a search session can also be used.
- Results matching the query can be identified by searching a content item index generated from content items collected by a network crawler 212 , e.g., a web crawler.
- a query processor 214 of the search engine 202 can receive the query from the front end 208 , identify and rank a set of content items using the content item index 210 and the ranking engine 216 , and send data identifying the results to the front end 208 for transmission to the user device 206 .
- the search engine 202 can use query and content information to generate a ranking score to rank the search results.
- the ranking score can be computed from information indicating how well each result satisfies or matches the query, from information indicating a level of query-independent quality of each result, or both.
- User selections of one or more content items from among the presented results can be recorded by the search engine 202 and stored in a selection data repository 218 .
- User selections can be recorded anonymously.
- the user language preference associated with a given user selection can be stored, for example, in a record in which a recorded user selection is recorded.
- data linking the language preference and the record of the user selection can be stored.
- a user selection of a given content item can be stored with a language preference of “French” based on an explicit or implicit language preference indicated by a user making the selection.
- the search engine 202 can collect selection data for many queries from many users. For example, user content item selections made by users upon being presented with query results can include an identifier, e.g., a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), of the content item selected and the corresponding language preference of those users can be recorded.
- the search engine can generate, from the collected data, language selection statistics for the content items represented in the content item index 210 .
- a language classifier 220 can aggregate the language preference statistics stored in the selection data repository 218 and use this aggregated data to update the content item index 210 .
- the ranking engine 216 can then use these statistics and a language preference of a query submitted by a user to rank content items satisfying the query. For example, in generating a ranking score for a given content item, a weight based on the language selection statistics for that content item and a language preference for the subject query can be included in the ranking score calculations to increase and/or decrease the ranking score of a content item.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example method 300 for providing search results and using language selection statistics to adjust content item ranking scores.
- a system implementing the method 300 receives a query and obtains a query language preference ( 302 ).
- the preference can be obtained from the query or from data maintained by the system.
- the system searches a content item index ( 304 ), and generates a list of highly ranked content items responsive to the query ( 306 ).
- the system can then adjust the ranking scores (i.e., adjust the scores that determine the relative positions) of the content items based on the query language preference and the language selection statistics of the content items ( 308 ). This can be done, for example, by generating a weight for each content item based on the language selection statistics for the respective content item and a language preference for the query. Each weight can, for example, multiply an initial ranking score to increase and/or decrease the score of a content item. For instance, if a language preference of a query is Hindi, content items, in English, for example, that have user selection statistics indicating strong interest by other Hindi users can have increased scores (and therefore possibly increased rank positions) relative to content items with selection statistics that do not show this interest by Hindi users.
- Data identifying the results and their ranked order according to the adjusted ranking scores, e.g., in a search results web page, is returned to the user device that sent the query ( 310 ).
- FIG. 4 illustrates a set of example records that can be used in providing search results based on language selection statistics.
- the first example record 402 illustrates a recording scheme where the language preference 404 is stored in a selection record with a content item identifier, such as the network location (in this case a URL) 406 .
- the next example record 408 illustrates aggregate language-specific selection statistics compiled from selection records for the web page content item located at the URL www.example.com/page1.html.
- the example statistics include selection counts that, for example, correspond to the number of times that users having the corresponding language preference selected the web page for viewing when presented with the opportunity to do so in a list of search results.
- the next example record 410 illustrates additional language-specific selection statistics compiled from selection records for the web page content item located at the URL www.example.com/page1.html.
- the example statistics include a count of content item presentations corresponding to the number of times that users having the corresponding language preference were presented with the opportunity to select the web page for viewing, e.g., in a list of query results.
- the selection data repository 218 includes a browsing history for users of the search engine, and browsing activity records can be used alone or in combination with selection records to generate language-specific statistics for a given content item. Users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in or opt out of the collection of browsing history or other features that may collect the personal information.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user and so that any identified user preferences or user interactions are generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user.
- the collected data may be deleted after a predetermined period of time.
- Language selection statistics can be used in ranking content item search results for search engine queries. For example, a language selection weight can be computed for content items and used as part of a ranking method for ranking content items to be returned as results to a search engine user. In some implementations, a language selection weight is computed for each content item in a collection of initially ranked results. The computed weight can then be multiplied by the initial ranking scores of corresponding content items to generate modified ranking scores.
- a in the formula is defined as:
- A Number ⁇ ⁇ Users ⁇ ⁇ with ⁇ ⁇ Language Preference ⁇ ⁇ X ⁇ ⁇ that ⁇ ⁇ Click ⁇ ⁇ on ⁇ ⁇ Content ⁇ ⁇ Item ⁇ ⁇ Y Total ⁇ ⁇ number ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ Users ⁇ ⁇ that ⁇ ⁇ Click ⁇ ⁇ on ⁇ ⁇ Content ⁇ ⁇ Item ⁇ ⁇ Y and B is defined as:
- a and B are calculated based on the language preference of the query. That is, “Language Preference X” is the query language preference, if there is one, or the language preference of the user to whom Content Item Y is presented. “Content Item Y” is the content item to which the language selection weight will be applied.
- A is a percentage of the total users clicking on the content item that have a language preference matching that of the querying user.
- B is a click through percentage of the content item for users that have the same language preference as that of the query.
- 0.05 is the value of bias1
- 5 is the value of bias2
- 2 is the value of bias3.
- Using language selection weights can provide a list of results whose ranking is based, at least in part, on the interest level of other users that have the same language preference as the query language preference.
- content items e.g., web pages
- that are categorized as using a language different from the user's preferred language may appear in a highly ranked position in search results depending on the selection statistics of other users having the same language preference.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example web page form 500 for entering a search query as displayed by a web browser running on a user device, e.g., a personal computer or Internet enabled mobile telephone.
- a personal greeting 504 indicates that user John Doe (having an example username johndoe123) logged into the search engine so that the search engine can use any previously saved preferences.
- the sign out link 506 By selecting the sign out link 506 , the user can log out of the search engine.
- the greeting 504 and other user interface elements are in German because, in this example, John Doe previously indicated a German language preference. Such a preference can be indicated, for example, by selecting the preferences link 508 and selecting a checkbox to indicate a language preference, or by selecting a German site of the search engine.
- the phrase “software downloads” (a phrase common in both German and English language documents) is shown in the search query field 502 as an example search term entered by the user John Doe.
- the browser sends the search query to the search engine.
- the search engine can respond by searching an index of content items to retrieve a list of content items based on the search term, the language preference of the query (in this case an explicitly-indicated user preference of German), and language-specific statistics for the content items indexed by the search engine.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example results web page 600 including a preferred language results section 602 and an other-language results section 604 .
- the example results shown correspond to a search for “software downloads” from a user indicating a German language preference.
- the results section 602 identifies a set of German language results, i.e., results identified as having German language content (identified as German, for example, by a crawling application that indexed the corresponding content). This is indicated in FIG. 6 by the language designations 606 , 608 .
- the language designations 606 , 608 would generally not appear on a results page, but are included here for purposes of explanation.
- the results in section 602 can, for example, be top ranked results from a search for results in the user's preferred language.
- the other-language results section 604 can be provided to present results in other languages.
- a portion of the results page is shown as being reserved for one or more results for which the language selection statistics show a high degree of interest by users with the same language preference as the querying user.
- the other-language results section 604 can exclude results categorized (by a crawler application, for example) as having the same language as the user's preferred language, and include one or more highest ranked results in another language based on ranking scores calculated using language selection statistics, e.g., as described above.
- a language selection weight can be used in ranking content item results not categorized as having the same language as the language preference of the query, and some highest ranked number of these content items can be presented to the user in the other-language results section 604 .
- results in the other-language results section 604 are categorized as English results (categorized as English, for example, by a crawling application that indexed the corresponding content), but could be categorized as any language as their inclusion or exclusion on the results page is not based on the content's language categorization, but rather on collected language selection statistics for the content item.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example results web page 700 including intermingled results 702 .
- the example results shown can correspond to a search for “nurburgring” (the Nürburgring is a race track in Germany) with a German language preference.
- the results section 702 includes four German language results and two English language results.
- the language designations 704 would generally not appear on a results page, but are included here for purposes of explanation.
- the results 702 can be, for example, top ranked results that include results from the user's preferred language and results in other languages and having, for example, a sufficiently large number or percentage of visitors that share the querying user's preferred language.
- a language selection weight can be used in ranking content items and some highest ranked number of these content items can be presented to the user.
- Interest in given content items by users having the same language preference as that of the query can, for example, cause content items not categorized as matching the language preference of the query to increase in rank.
- An increase in rank can be realized, for example, through calculation of language selection weights and their application to an initial ranking score of the content items.
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
