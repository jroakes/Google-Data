Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information aggregation systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for hosting customized news content aggregated by a news aggregation service.
- Existing news aggregation services search out, and aggregate, news content published on web pages throughout the Internet.
- the news aggregation service In response to a search query from a user, or when a user browses a newspaper section of the news aggregation service, the news aggregation service presents a list of stories, from the aggregated news content, relevant to the query or to the newspaper section requested, with each story involving a group of articles from different publications dealing with the same topic.
- users must manually access the news aggregation service, re-enter a search query and view relevant news stories.
- Systems and methods, consistent with the principles of the invention implement a news browsing service that may use search queries, received from a remote server that stores custom news documents, to automatically, and periodically, provide custom news content retrieved from a server that aggregates news content to the remote server.
- the custom news content may then be hosted at the remote server and accessed by various users.
- a customer associated with the remote server may customize the content and format of the custom news page.
- a method of retrieving news content from a news aggregation server includes hosting first news content at a first news server and receiving user input selecting news content of the first news content. The method further includes sending query data, associated with the selected news content, to the news aggregation server and receiving second news content from the news aggregation server resulting from a search performed at the news aggregation server using the query data. The method also includes hosting the second news content, in conjunction with the first news content, at the first news server.
- a method of creating custom news documents includes periodically producing one or more custom search queries related to news of interest and sending the one or more search queries at periodic intervals across a network to a news search server that aggregates news from multiple news sources.
- the method further includes receiving news content corresponding to the one or more search queries from the news search server and inserting the news content into the custom news documents.
- the method also includes permitting access to clients, from across the network, to the custom news documents.
- a method of providing news content to an external server that hosts customized news content includes fetching news content from multiple news source servers and aggregating the news content. The method further includes periodically receiving one or more search queries from the external server and searching the aggregated news content based on the one or more search queries. The method also includes periodically providing news content to the external server based, at least in part, on results of the searches.
- a method of retrieving news content from a news server includes permitting client access to first news content contained in one or more news documents stored at a custom document server and sending query data to the news server based, at least in part, on a portion of the first news content that is accessed by the client.
- the method further includes receiving second news content from the news server based, at least in part, on the query data and incorporating the second news content into the one or more news documents.
- the method also includes permitting client access to the second news content at the custom document server.

For example, as shown in FIG. 6 , a user may “click” on the “Custom News” button 605 of a news search page 600 of a news aggregation service associated with server 120 . If the user has selected the customer's news page, server 120 may then execute one or more queries associated with one or more news sections of the customer's custom news page (act 325 )( FIG. 3B ). Server 120 may execute the one or more search queries to search through news content previously aggregated in local memory.
- Server 120 may then provide a custom news page to the user (act 330 ) by sending one or more documents to the user containing the customer's custom news page.
- the one or more documents may additionally include content authored by an operator (e.g., a “blog”) of custom news server 140 and previously provided to news search server 120 .
- the customer's custom news page may be formatted similar to a human-compiled newspaper, with a title, short introduction, related story titles, data, photo, etc.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a personal news page 700 that includes two news sections 705 and 710 , “California News” and “World News,” respectively.
- the customer's custom news page may additionally be used to produce a similarly configured print newspaper in a viewable or hard copy format.
- a postscript or pdf file may be produced that is portable for viewing and ready to print for offline reading.
- the layout of the print newspaper may be separately specified from the custom news page hosted on server 120 .
- Server 120 may determine whether the customer desires to customize its custom news page (act 335 ). If not, processing may continue at act 345 . If the customer does desire to customize its custom news page, then server 120 may receive input from the customer to customize the customer's custom news page (act 345 )( FIG. 3C ). An interactive program (known as a Wizard) may execute at server 120 , or at customer news server 140 , to walk the customer through the process of adding news sections, placing them appropriately, and customizing their look and feel.
- a Wizard An interactive program (known as a Wizard) may execute at server 120 , or at customer news server 140 , to walk the customer through the process of adding news sections, placing them appropriately, and customizing their look and feel.
- the customer may decide how freshness of the news content should be valued, such as, for example, sorting news content by time, by importance, or by some combination, or by providing hints for ranking certain types of stories above other stories.
- the customer may indicate that a certain kind of news source (e.g., New York Times, sources in USA, etc.) may be preferred or not preferred.
- the customer may provide general keywords that are of interest to the user (e.g., San Francisco) and stories with these keywords should be boosted.
- the customer can list journalists they like or do not like or genres they like or do not like (e.g., opinion/commentary vs. breaking news vs. briefs vs. full coverage).
- Those skilled in the art can devise user interfaces that allow such preferences to be expressed either in the context of one particular news section, or all sections together.
- Server 120 may access external news content (e.g., from server 130 ), fetch updated news content and aggregate the updated news content in local memory (act 345 ).
- server 120 may use a news crawler (e.g., web robot) that may access updated news content documents hosted by news source server(s) 130 .
- the fetched updated news content may be indexed and grouped, using conventional indexing and grouping techniques (act 350 ).
- Server 120 may then, periodically, execute a query(ies) associated with one or more news sections of the customer's custom news page (act 355 ). Processing may then return to act 320 ( FIG. 3A ) to determine if a user has again selected the customer's custom news page to view updated, customized news content.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of exemplary processing for receiving customized news content from news search server 120 and hosting the news content at custom news server 140 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.

- the produced search queries may be related to news content that an operator of customer news server 140 desires to host on custom news server 140 .
- Custom news server 140 may then send the one or more queries to news search server 120 via, for example, network 150 (act 410 ).
- News search server 120 upon receipt of the one or more queries, may execute conventional search algorithms using the one or more queries to retrieve relevant news content from aggregated news content stored in local memory.
- News search server 120 may send the relevant news content to custom news server 140 via network 150 .
- Custom news server 140 may then receive relevant news content resulting from an executed search of the one or more queries performed at news search server 120 (act 415 ).
- Custom news server 140 may populate locally stored news sections with the news content received from news search server 120 (act 420 ).
- the customer associated with custom news server 140 may, thus, create its own “on-line” newspaper by combining external news which may come from a set of dynamic queries executed at news search server 120 with news content created locally at custom news server 140 .
- Such locally created news content may include, for example, an editorial section that may be maintained using “blogging” technology.
- the exemplary processing of FIG. 4 may be repeated periodically such that news content may be retrieved from news search server 120 using dynamic search queries to periodically update news content hosted on custom news server 140 .
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are flowcharts of exemplary processing for retrieving news, related to news content locally stored at the custom news server 140 , from news search server 120 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- a customer associated with custom news server 140 may link all or some of its locally created news content with related news stored at news search server 120 .

- custom news server 140 optionally embedding search queries in selected locations of news content documents stored at custom news server 140 (act 505 ). For example, HTML Iframes may be used at custom news server 140 to load one or more dynamic news queries.
- Custom news server 140 may then determine if a user, associated with a client 110 , has selected news content stored at custom news server 140 (act 510 ). If so, custom news server 140 may send query data to the client 110 associated with the user (act 515 ).
- the query data may include embedded search queries that may, in turn, be provided by client 110 to new search server 120 .
- the embedded search queries may be in the form of an “applet” or an “iframe.”
- News search server 120 may execute a conventional search technique using the search queries received from client 110 to retrieve relevant news content from aggregated news content stored in local memory. News search server 120 may then return the retrieved news content to client 110 .
- custom news server 140 may send query data to news search server 120 (act 520 ).
- the query data may include search queries that were embedded within the news content selected by the user.
- the query data may also include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or some of the text, of the news document hosted at custom news server 140 .
- news search server 120 may execute a conventional search technique using the query data to retrieve relevant news content from aggregated news content stored in local memory and return the retrieved news content to custom news server 140 .
- news search server 120 may fetch the news document corresponding to the URL hosted at custom news server 140 and an appropriate query, based on keywords of the news document, can be generated that can be executed by search engine 125 to find related news content.
- a suitable query can be devised, based on text given to news search server 120 , which can be executed by search engine 125 to retrieve related news content.
- search engine 125 can provide a ranked list of other news content accessed by users who accessed the URL sent from custom news server 140 .
- search engine 125 may locate a group of related news content to which the given URL belongs.
- news search engine 125 may already have created groups of related news content. Based on this previous grouping, search engine 125 may determine the group of related news content with which the given URL has been grouped. The remaining news content in this group may then be returned to custom news server 140 .
- Custom news server 140 may then receive relevant news content resulting from the executed search performed at news search server 120 using the query data (act 525 ). Custom news server 140 may populate news sections of locally stored news documents with relevant news content received from news search server 120 (act 530 )( FIG. 5B ).
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may use received customer search criteria to automatically, and periodically, provide custom news content to a remote custom news server.
- the custom news content may, at the custom news server, be integrated with local news content and provided to clients who desire to access the news content via the custom news server.
- FIGS. 3A , 3 B, 3 C, 4 , 5 A and 5 B can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 230 , ROM 240 or storage device 250 of server 120 or server 140 , as appropriate.
- the processing exemplified by FIGS. 3A , 3 B, 3 C, 4 , 5 A and 5 B can be implemented in hardwired circuitry, such as combinational logic, within server 120 or server 140 , as appropriate.
- aspects of the invention, as described above may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures.
