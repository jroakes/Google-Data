Definitions
- This relates generally to automated assistants, including but not limited to methods and systems for attending to speaking person(s) in a room with an automated assistant.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras are widely used to collect audio and visual data from users and implement voice-activated functions according to voice inputs.
- Devices are increasingly capable of accessing and presenting information to users.
- devices presenting visual information must be oriented toward a user in order for the user to view the presented information. This can be problematic for users who move between to different locations around the device.
- an electronic device that is integrated with microphones and cameras to locate and orient on speaking person(s) in a room.
- microphones and cameras it is also desirable that they attend to users who are addressing them.
- US 6,914,622 B relates to an apparatus for the projection of a remote conferee's presence into a group meeting environment by using a combination of videoconferencing/teleconferencing and robotics technology.
- the remote conferee's face is shown substantially life-size on a video monitor.
- the remote conferee's eyes appear to be looking directly at the viewer.
- the video monitor can turn left or right to point at the person speaking, automatically or by manual control, to give the impression that the remote conferee is turning his head to look at the person speaking.
- the video screen can be raised and lowered to give the impression that the remote conferee is standing up and sitting down.
- An attention-getting mechanism prompts the attention of the other conferees when the remote conferee wants to interrupt or enter a conversation.
- WO 2007/041295 relates to a mobile robot guest for interacting with a human resident that performs a room-traversing search procedure prior to interacting with the resident, and may verbally query whether the resident being sought is present.
- the mobile robot may facilitate a teleconferencing session with a remote third party, or interact with the resident in a number of ways.
- the robot may carry on a dialogue with the resident, reinforce compliance with medication or other schedules, etc.
- the robot incorporates safety features for preventing collisions with the resident; and the robot may audibly announce and/or visibly indicate its presence in order to avoid becoming a dangerous obstacle.
- the mobile robot behaves in accordance with an integral privacy policy, such that any sensor recording or transmission must be approved by the resident.
- EP 2,492,850 A relates to a social robot formed by an artificial vision system composed of webcam cameras, a voice recognition system formed by three microphones arranged in a triangular configuration, an expression system composed of an LED matrix, formed by a plurality of LEDs and a status LED, and eyelids formed by half-moons connected to gearwheels which engage with respective servomotors via transmission wheels, a speech synthesis system composed of loudspeakers, a system for detecting obstacles which is formed by ultrasound sensors, and a movement system formed by two driving wheels.
- a method according to claim 1, a computing system according to claim 12 and a computer-readable storage medium according to claim 13 are defined.
- an automated assistant device can be used to interact with user(s) via both audio and visual mediums.
- Such an assistant device can also use the audio and visual inputs to locate the users and attend to them (e.g., reorient itself to better receive information from the user and/or better present information to the user). This improves the user's experience as the user does not need to move to a particular location to view display data on the device, nor does the user need to reorient the device manually.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras are widely used to collect audio and visual inputs from users. By combining multiple sensing technologies, these electronic devices can find a user in a room with high accuracy and low latency.
- the described implementations have an advantage over user localization methods based purely on audio signals, which have issues associated with finding paths to the user which may be non-direct. For example, in the case of a hard wall or surface behind a device, the device may find the path to the user as the path reflecting off the back wall.
- An electronic device with multiple microphones and motor-mounted wide-lens camera is employed to locate user(s), e.g., to indicate that the device is listening to the user(s) or to obtain visualization of user(s) for video conferencing.
- the device After determining that the user is not in the field of view of the camera, the device reorients to look for the user.
- a user John addresses the device with a hotword ("OK assistant.")
- the device recognizes that the user is John by his voice, but does not see John in the camera's view.
- the device determines that hotword energy is mostly coming from a direction that is behind and above the device, and accordingly, rotates and tilts the camera in the direction of the hotword energy.
- the device finds John's face and centers the camera, assuring John that the device is attending to him.
- the device is able to find the user with high accuracy and low latency.
- the device's mannerisms when looking for the user also seem natural to the user, thus improving the user interactions with the device.
- devices, storage mediums, and computing systems are provided with methods for attending to speaking users in a room, thereby enhancing user interactions (e.g., improving accuracy and/or efficiency in the interactions) and user satisfaction with such systems.
- Such methods may complement or replace conventional methods for interacting with users.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras can be used to collect audio and visual inputs from users and implement voice-activated functions according to voice inputs.
- Some electronic devices include a voice assistant feature that is configured to use audio inputs to perform many tasks. The functionality of these devices can be further expanded to locate and attend to user(s).
- Jane moves about a room while issuing multiple requests to an automated assistant device.
- the assistant device receives the requests and presents responses, which include visual information for Jane to view.
- the assistant device uses audio and visual cues to continually reorient on Jane as she moves about the room. This enables Jane to view the visual information without interrupting her activity. It also assures her that the assistant device is active and paying attention to her. In some instances, reorienting the assistant device also improves the quality of Jane's voice received at the device as well as the quality of device audio heard by Jane.

Description
- This relates generally to automated assistants, including but not limited to methods and systems for attending to speaking person(s) in a room with an automated assistant.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras are widely used to collect audio and visual data from users and implement voice-activated functions according to voice inputs. Devices are increasingly capable of accessing and presenting information to users. However, devices presenting visual information must be oriented toward a user in order for the user to view the presented information. This can be problematic for users who move between to different locations around the device.
- Accordingly, it is desirable to employ an electronic device that is integrated with microphones and cameras to locate and orient on speaking person(s) in a room. For automated assistant devices, it is also desirable that they attend to users who are addressing them.

US 6,914,622 B relates to an apparatus for the projection of a remote conferee's presence into a group meeting environment by using a combination of videoconferencing/teleconferencing and robotics technology. The remote conferee's face is shown substantially life-size on a video monitor. The remote conferee's eyes appear to be looking directly at the viewer. The video monitor can turn left or right to point at the person speaking, automatically or by manual control, to give the impression that the remote conferee is turning his head to look at the person speaking. The video screen can be raised and lowered to give the impression that the remote conferee is standing up and sitting down. An attention-getting mechanism prompts the attention of the other conferees when the remote conferee wants to interrupt or enter a conversation. -
WO 2007/041295 relates to a mobile robot guest for interacting with a human resident that performs a room-traversing search procedure prior to interacting with the resident, and may verbally query whether the resident being sought is present. Upon finding the resident, the mobile robot may facilitate a teleconferencing session with a remote third party, or interact with the resident in a number of ways.

EP 2,492,850 A relates to a social robot formed by an artificial vision system composed of webcam cameras, a voice recognition system formed by three microphones arranged in a triangular configuration, an expression system composed of an LED matrix, formed by a plurality of LEDs and a status LED, and eyelids formed by half-moons connected to gearwheels which engage with respective servomotors via transmission wheels, a speech synthesis system composed of loudspeakers, a system for detecting obstacles which is formed by ultrasound sensors, and a movement system formed by two driving wheels. - A method according to claim 1, a computing system according to claim 12 and a computer-readable storage medium according to claim 13 are defined.
- There is a need for methods, devices, and systems to locate and attend to speaking persons in a room. Various implementations of systems, methods and devices within the scope of the appended claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the attributes described herein. Without limiting the scope of the appended claims, after considering this disclosure, and particularly after considering the section entitled "Detailed Description" one will understand how the aspects of various implementations are used to automatically (without user inputs) locate and attend to a speaking person. For example, there is a need for electronic devices that respond to both audio and visual user inputs. By locating user(s), indicating that they are listening to the user(s), and presenting visualizations to the user(s) in settings such as video conferences, these electronic devices create efficient and enhanced interactive experiences with users. Further, it is desirable for the electronic devices to show attention to a speaking person with mannerisms that will also seem natural to the user.
- For example, an automated assistant device can be used to interact with user(s) via both audio and visual mediums. Such an assistant device can also use the audio and visual inputs to locate the users and attend to them (e.g., reorient itself to better receive information from the user and/or better present information to the user). This improves the user's experience as the user does not need to move to a particular location to view display data on the device, nor does the user need to reorient the device manually.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras are widely used to collect audio and visual inputs from users. By combining multiple sensing technologies, these electronic devices can find a user in a room with high accuracy and low latency.
- The described implementations have an advantage over user localization methods based purely on audio signals, which have issues associated with finding paths to the user which may be non-direct. For example, in the case of a hard wall or surface behind a device, the device may find the path to the user as the path reflecting off the back wall.
- An electronic device with multiple microphones and motor-mounted wide-lens camera is employed to locate user(s), e.g., to indicate that the device is listening to the user(s) or to obtain visualization of user(s) for video conferencing.
- In some instances, however, the user who is speaking is not in the field of view of the camera. After determining that the user is not in the field of view of the camera, the device reorients to look for the user.
- For example, a user John addresses the device with a hotword ("OK assistant.") The device recognizes that the user is John by his voice, but does not see John in the camera's view. The device determines that hotword energy is mostly coming from a direction that is behind and above the device, and accordingly, rotates and tilts the camera in the direction of the hotword energy. The device finds John's face and centers the camera, assuring John that the device is attending to him.
- Accordingly, by combining multiple advanced audio and visual sensing technologies, the device is able to find the user with high accuracy and low latency. In some implementations, the device's mannerisms when looking for the user also seem natural to the user, thus improving the user interactions with the device.
- Thus, devices, storage mediums, and computing systems are provided with methods for attending to speaking users in a room, thereby enhancing user interactions (e.g., improving accuracy and/or efficiency in the interactions) and user satisfaction with such systems. Such methods may complement or replace conventional methods for interacting with users.

- Reference will now be made in detail to implementations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various described implementations. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various described implementations may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the implementations.
- Electronic devices integrated with microphones and cameras can be used to collect audio and visual inputs from users and implement voice-activated functions according to voice inputs. Some electronic devices include a voice assistant feature that is configured to use audio inputs to perform many tasks. The functionality of these devices can be further expanded to locate and attend to user(s).
- For example, Jane moves about a room while issuing multiple requests to an automated assistant device. The assistant device receives the requests and presents responses, which include visual information for Jane to view. In order to accommodate Jane's movement, the assistant device uses audio and visual cues to continually reorient on Jane as she moves about the room. This enables Jane to view the visual information without interrupting her activity. It also assures her that the assistant device is active and paying attention to her. In some instances, reorienting the assistant device also improves the quality of Jane's voice received at the device as well as the quality of device audio heard by Jane.

In some implementations, acontent host 230 is an information source from which thesmart assistant system 220 retrieves information in accordance with a user request. - In some implementations, the
electronic device 202 is a voice-activated device and the user request is a user voice request (e.g., a voice command). Theelectronic device 202 responds to voice commands by: generating and providing a spoken response to a voice command (e.g., speaking the current time in response to the question, "what time is it?"); streaming media content requested by a user (e.g., "play a Beach Boys song"); reading a news story or a daily news briefing prepared for the user; playing a media item stored on the personal assistant device or on the local network; changing a state or operating one or more other connected devices (not shown) within the operating environment 200 (e.g., turning lights, appliances or media devices on/off, locking/unlocking a lock, opening windows, etc.); or issuing a corresponding request to a server via thenetwork 210.

environment 200 includes multiple electronic devices 202 (e.g., devices 202-1 thru 202-N). In some implementations, thedevices 202 are located throughout the environment 200 (e.g., all within a room or space in a structure, spread throughout the structure, some within the structure and some without). When a user makes an audio request, each of thedevices 202 either receives the request or does not receive the input (e.g., if the device was too far away from the user). In some implementations, theelectronic devices 202 receive the request at varying degrees of quality. The quality of the sample of the voice input at adevice 202 is optionally based on multiple factors, including but not limited to distance of the user from the device and the noise around the device. In some implementations, themultiple devices 202 negotiate a leader amongst themselves to respond to and/or attend to the user, and to receive further voice input(s) from the user, based on the quality of the samples of the voice inputs received. -

As shown inFigure 5B theelectronic device 100 reorients so that theuser 520 is within the field of view of the device and responds by addressing theuser 520 by name ("Yes, Jane?"). In some implementations, in response to the detected hotword, theelectronic device 100 determines based on the obtained hotword signals that theperson 520 is speaking in a vicinity of the electronic device (e.g., by identifying of one or more hotword beam(s) and their corresponding determining signal-to-noise ratios using the audio localizer sub-module 3402).

In some implementations, theelectronic device 100 directs attention to the identified speaking user including acknowledging the speaking person by his/her name ("Yes Jane?") (e.g., using the attention control sub-module 3461). In some implementations, directing attention to the identified speaking user includes re-positioning one or more physical features on the electronic device 100 (e.g., re-positioning the array of illuminators 104). In some implementations, directing attention to the identified speaking user includes re-directing presentation of visual data (e.g., re-directing illumination from the array of illuminators 104). In some implementations, directing attention to the identified speaking user includes adjusting a directionality of a presentation of visual data toward the identified user (e.g., adjusting illumination from the array ofilluminators 104 to indicate a direction of the identified user). -

Figure 6B illustrates the response of theelectronic device 120 as a result of detecting the spoken hotword by theuser 620, in accordance with some implementations. As shown inFigure 6B theelectronic device 120 reorients so that theuser 620 is within the field of view of the device and responds by addressing theuser 620 by name ("Yes, John?"). In some implementations, in response to the detected hotword, theelectronic device 120 identifies one or more hotword beam(s) and determines the audio beam direction which has the highest-signal-to-noise ratio of the hotword power (e.g., using the audio localizer sub-module 3402). Theelectronic device 120 obtains identification of the speaking user by comparing the obtained audio signals with audio identification data (e.g., using the audio identification sub-module 3404). In some implementations, in response to the detected hotword, theelectronic device 120 determines that the speaking user is not in the field of view of the camera 108 (e.g., using the visual speech detection sub-module 3421 and/or the visual recognition sub-module 3422). - In some implementations, the
electronic device 120 reorients itself based on differences in the audio data received at the respective microphones 102. In some implementations, orienting theelectronic device 120 includes rotating the electronic device 100 (e.g., about theaxis 112 and/or the axis 114). In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 120 includes controlling the actuators 124 to change the position (e.g., increasing the height) of theelectronic device 120. In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 120 includes moving the electronic device to the proximity of the user (e.g., using the wheels 130 ofFigure 1B , not shown). - In some implementations, after reorienting itself, the
electronic device 120 obtains additional video data using thecamera 108, and determines that multiple users (e.g.,user 520 and user 620) are within the field of view of theelectronic device 120. In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that multiple users are in the field of view, theelectronic device 120 assigns a confidence score (e.g., using the confidence analysis module 344) to each of theusers electronic device 120 assigns a higher confidence score to theuser 620 based on a determination (e.g., using the speech detection submodule 3421) that the eyebrows of theuser 620 are raised and the mouth of theuser 520 is open. Accordingly, theelectronic device 120 determines identifies that theuser 620 is the speaking user. - In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the
user 620 is the speaking user, the electronic device attends to the speaking user by directing thedisplay 110 toward theuser 620, as illustrated by lines 612 which indicate the field of view of thedisplay 110.

Figures 7A-7B illustrate another representative operation of theelectronic device 202 ofFigure 3 , in accordance with some implementations. In this example, theelectronic device 202 is theelectronic device 120 as shown inFigure 1B .Figure 7A shows theroom 500 with theelectronic device 120 on the table 504. As shown inFigure 7A , thecamera 108 and thedisplay 110 of theelectronic device 120 are initially directed towards theright wall 508. The field of view of thecamera 108 is illustrated bylines 712. As shown inFigure 7A , thecountertop 502 includes a stack ofbooks 702, and theuser 520 is located behind thecountertop 502. Theuser 520 addresses theelectronic device 120 by speaking a hotword ("OK Assistant."). In some implementations, theelectronic device 120 is in a standby mode and the detection of the hotword (e.g., via the hotword detection sub-module 3401) awakens theelectronic device 120. -
Figure 7B illustrates the response of theelectronic device 120 as a result of detecting the spoken hotword by theuser 520, in accordance with some implementations. As shown inFigure 7B theelectronic device 120 reorients in an attempt to have theuser 520 within the field of view of the device, but its field of view is blocked by thebooks 702. Accordingly, theelectronic device 120 responds by notifying theuser 520 that the device is attending to theuser 520 even though thedevice 120 does not have line-of-sight with the user. In some implementations, theelectronic device 120 identifies one or more hotword beam(s) and determines the audio beam direction which has the highest-signal-to-noise ratio of the hotword power (e.g., using the audio localizer sub-module 3402). Theelectronic device 120 obtains identification of the speaking user by comparing the obtained audio signals with audio identification data (e.g., using the audio identification sub-module 3404). - In some implementations, in response to the detected hotword, the
electronic device 120 further determines that the speakinguser 520 is not in the field of view of the camera 108 (e.g., using the visual speech detection sub-module 3421 and/or the visual recognition sub-module 3422). In some implementations, theelectronic device 120 reorients itself based on differences in the audio data received at the respective microphones 102. In this example, theelectronic device 120 reorients by rotating itself (e.g., about theaxis 112 and/or the axis 114) and by changing its position using the actuators 124 (e.g., using the actuator control sub-module 3462). - In some implementations, after reorienting, the
electronic device 120 obtains additional video data from thecamera 108 and determines from the additional video data that the speaking person is not in the field of view. In this example, even though thecamera 108 and thedisplay 110 have been reoriented to face theuser 520, the stack ofbooks 702 obstructs theuser 520 from the field of view of thecamera 108. In some implementations, in accordance with a determination that the speaking user is not visible, theelectronic device 120 indicates via thedisplay 110 that the speaking user is not visible (e.g., using the attention control sub-module 3461). In some implementations, in accordance with a determination that the speakinguser 520 is not visible, theelectronic device 120 acknowledges the speakinguser 520 verbally and at the same time, presents a verbal indication (e.g., using the attention control sub-module 3461) that the speakinguser 520 is not visible to the electronic device 120 ("Hi Jane, I can't see you. What's your question?"). -
Figures 8A-8C are flowchart representations of amethod 800 for attending to a presenting user utilizing theelectronic device 202 ofFigure 3 , in accordance with some implementations. In some implementations, themethod 800 is performed by: (1) one or moreelectronic devices 202; (2) one or more server systems, such asserver system 206; or (3) a combination thereof. In some implementations, themethod 800 is governed by instructions that are stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and that are executed by one or more processors of a device/computing system, such as the one ormore processors 302 of theelectronic device 202 and/or the one ormore processors 402 of theserver system 206. For convenience, specific operations detailed below are described as being performed by theelectronic device 202. - The
electronic device 202 obtains (802) audio signals by concurrently receiving audio data at each microphone of a plurality of microphones (e.g., microphones 314). In some implementations, the received audio data includes hotwords. For example,Figure 5A shows theuser 520 addressing theelectronic device 100 by speaking a hotword. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 is in a standby mode and the hotword(s) for awaken the electronic device 202 (e.g., using the hotword detection sub-module 3401). In some implementations, the received audio data includes a user query and theelectronic device 202 gathers data from one or more remote sources (e.g., content host(s) 230) to answer the user query. - The
electronic device 202 determines (806) based on the obtained audio signals that a person is speaking in the vicinity of theelectronic device 202. For example, thedevice 202 identifies one or more words within the obtained audio signal. As another example, thedevice 202 determines that the audio includes a person speaking based on an analysis of the frequency, pitch, or cadence of the obtained audio. Theelectronic device 202 identifies (807) the speaking person based on the obtained audio signals. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 identifies the person by comparing the obtained audio signals with audio identification data (e.g., theaudio identification data 3501 in the persons database 350). - In some implementations, upon detecting an unknown voice, the
electronic device 202 queries the user for an identification and stores the identification and the voice in thepersons database 350. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 generates an audio query to the user. In some implementations, the electronic device generates an electronic notification (e.g., to be sent to the user's mobile device). - In some implementations, after determining that the person is speaking in the vicinity of the
electronic device 202, theelectronic device 202 indicates (808) via the display (e.g., the display 328) that a speaking person has been detected. In some implementations, indicating via the display that a speaking person has been detected includes turning on/off an illuminator (e.g., the LEDs 326), adjusting a color of a display (e.g., the display 328), or the like. In some implementations, after determining that the person is speaking, theelectronic device 202 further determines that the person has spoken a hotword (e.g., using the hotword detection sub-module 3401) and indicates via thedisplay 328 that the hotword has been detected. In some implementations, after theelectronic device 202 determines that the person is speaking, theelectronic device 202 determines that the person is speaking to theelectronic device 202, and indicates via the display that the electronic device is aware of the person speaking. In some implementations, after determining that the person is speaking, theelectronic device 202 further determines that the person has issued a query and the device indicates that the query has been received (e.g., via a visual and/or audio presentation). - The
electronic device 202 obtains (810) video data from one or more image sensor(s) (e.g., the camera(s) 319). In some implementations, video data is obtained on a continuous basis. In some implementations, video data is obtained continuously over a predetermined time period (e.g., 2 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.). In some implementations, video data is obtained intermittently over a predetermined time period (e.g., one frame every five seconds over a duration of ten minutes). - The
electronic device 202 determines (812) based on analysis of the video data that the person is not within the field of view of the image sensor. In some implementations, the determination is made using thevideo processing module 342, including the visual speech detection sub-module 3421 and/or the visual recognition sub-module 3422. In some implementations, the determination is made by comparing the video data withvisual identification data 3502 in thepersons database 350. - In some implementations, upon detecting an unknown person, the
electronic device 202 queries the user for an identification and stores the identification and feature data of the person in thepersons database 350. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 generates an audio query to the user. In some implementations, the electronic device generates an electronic notification (e.g., to be sent to the user's mobile device). In some implementations, the identification and feature data correspond to a particular voice and the feature data is associated with the voice. - In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the person is not within the field of view of the image sensor, the
electronic device 202 determines (814) a preferred direction for reorienting on the person. In some implementations, determining the preferred direction is based on the hotword and/or audio beam(s) of the obtained audio signals that are created by the electronic device 202 (e.g., using the audio localizer sub-module 3403). In some implementations, determining the preferred direction is based on one or more hotword and/or audio beam properties (e.g., directions, signal-to noise-ratios, etc.) of the obtained audio signals. - In some implementations, determining a preferred direction for reorienting on the person includes identifying (816) a position of a surface in the vicinity of the
electronic device 202, the surface having reflected at least a portion of the audio data received by a first microphone of the plurality ofmicrophones 314. In some implementations, the preferred direction for reorienting (817) on the person is based on the position of the surface. For example, thedevice 202 determines that a wall is directly behind the device and that part of the audio data received was a reflection of audio from the wall. In this example, thedevice 202 accounts for the audio reflection and determines that the preferred direction is not the direction of the wall. - In some implementations, the preferred direction for reorienting (818) on the person is based on a layout of the room in which the
electronic device 202 is located. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 stores a mapping of the room, dwelling, or structure. For example, as noted in the description ofFigure 3 , thememory 306 of theelectronic device 202 optionally stores a layout of the room in which theelectronic device 202 is located. To further illustrate, theelectronic device 202 determines based on the room layout and an analysis of the hotword beam(s) that it is situated next to a wall, and therefore receives audio beams that originate from both a user as well as from reflection off a vicinity wall. In this example, theelectronic device 202 determines the preferred direction for reorienting on the person to be the direction away from the wall. - In some implementations, the mapping of the room is obtained via radar, sonar, etc. (e.g., obtained via
sensor 360 of the electronic device 202). In some implementations, the layout of the room is obtained via an analysis of video data from the image sensor (e.g., the camera(s) 319). - The
electronic device 202 reorients (820) theelectronic device 202 based on differences in the audio data received at respective microphones in the plurality ofmicrophones 314. In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 202 includes rotating theelectronic device 202 about its axis (e.g., about theaxis 112 and/or theaxis 114 as shown inFigure 1A ). In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 202 includes translating, elevating, and/or rotating the electronic device (e.g., using the actuators 330). - In some implementations, reorienting the
electronic device 202 includes rotating (822) the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319) in the preferred orientation (as determined in 814). In some implementations, reorienting the electronic device includes rotating the display (e.g., the display 319) and the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319). In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 202 includes moving (824) the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319) along multiple axes. In some implementations, moving the image sensor along multiple axes includes, e.g., adjusting pitch and yaw; tilting the display up/down to align with a person's line of sight; moving toward the person; adjusting elevation; etc. In some implementations, reorienting theelectronic device 202 comprises moving the display and image sensor; or the entire device. - After reorienting, the
electronic device 202 obtains (826) second video data from the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319) and determines from the second video data that the person is within the field of view of the image sensor (e.g., using the video processing module 342). - The
electronic device 202 identifies (828) the person based on an analysis of the video data from the image sensor. In some implementations, theelectronic device 202 performs (830) facial recognition on the video data to identify the person based on the analysis of the video data (e.g., by comparing the obtained video data withvisual identification data 3502 in the persons database 350). In some implementations, identifying the person includes identifying the person based on the person's dimensions, respiratory patterns, and/or gait. In some implementations, performing facial recognition includes a determination of the distance between the image sensor and the person. - In some implementations, the
electronic device 202 identifies (832) the person based on an analysis of visual data from the image sensor. In some implementations, the identification of the person is based on visual speech detection technique (e.g., using the visual speech detection sub-module 3421). In some implementations, the visual speech detection technique includes determining that the person's mouth/face (e.g., eyebrow) is moving. In some implementations, the visual speech detection technique includes determining that the person's mouth movements correlate with the received audio signals. - In some implementations, after the
electronic device 202 reorients itself and obtains second video data from the image sensor, theelectronic device 202 determines (834) that a plurality of persons is within the field of view of the image sensor. For example,Figure 6B illustrates two users, namely theuser 520 and theuser 620, in the field of view of thecamera 108electronic device 202. In accordance with the determination that a plurality of persons is within the field of view of the image sensor, theelectronic device 202 assigns (836) a confidence score to each person of the plurality of persons (e.g., using the confidence analysis module 344). In some implementations, the confidence score is based on analyzing (838) the audio signals and/or video signals from the image sensor (e.g., using one or more of: theaudio localizer sub-module 3403, the audio identification sub-module 3404, the visual speech detection sub-module 3421, and the visual recognition sub-module 3422). In some implementations, different weights are assigned to the respective components of the audio signals and/or visual signals. In some implementations, determining that the person is within the field of view of the image sensor includes determining that the person is assigned (840) the highest confidence score. - The
electronic device 202 attends (842) to the person by directing the display (e.g., the display 328) to the person. In some implementations, the display includes a screen (e.g., a touch screen), one or more illuminators 104 (e.g., LEDs), and/or a user interface with one or more affordances. In some implementations, directing the display includes moving (e.g., translating and/or rotating) the display to the speaking user. For example,Figure 6B shows theelectronic device 120 moving from an initial position (shown inFigure 6A ) to an attentive position showing attention to the speakinguser 620, as illustrated by the lines 612. - In some implementations, the
electronic device 202 attends to the person by directing (844) the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319) toward the person. In some implementations, directing the image sensor toward the person includes centering (846) the person within the field of view of the image sensor. In some implementations, directing the image sensor toward the person includes focusing the image sensor on the person. In some implementations, directing the image sensor toward the person includes adjusting a brightness and/or contrast to highlight the person. In some implementations, additional to directing the image sensor toward the person, theelectronic device 202 also outputs a visual indication (e.g., a predefined pattern using the one or more illuminators 104 (e.g., LEDs) that it is listening to the person. - In some implementations, the
electronic device 202 obtains (848) second audio signals by concurrently receiving second audio data at each microphone of the plurality ofmicrophones 314. - In some implementations, in accordance with obtaining second audio signals, the
electronic device 202 determines (850) based on the second audio signals that a second person is speaking in a vicinity of theelectronic device 202. In some implementations, in accordance with the determination based on the second audio signals that a second person is speaking in a vicinity of theelectronic device 202, theelectronic device 202 determines (852) whether the second person is within the field of view of the image sensor. - In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the second person is within the field of view of the image sensor, the
electronic device 202 attends (854) to the second person by directing the image sensor (e.g., camera(s) 319) and thedisplay 328 toward the second person. - In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the second person is not within the field of view of the image sensor, the
electronic device 202 reorients (856) itself based on differences in the second audio data received at respective microphones of the plurality ofmicrophones 314. In some implementations, after theelectronic device 202 reorients itself based on differences in the second audio data, theelectronic device 202 determines (858) that the second person is not visible to theelectronic device 202. In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the second person is not visible, theelectronic device 202 indicates (860) via thedisplay 328 that the second person is not visible. In some implementations, in accordance with the determination that the second person is not visible, theelectronic device 202 outputs a response (e.g., an audio response) indicating to the person that the person is not visible. - For situations in which the systems discussed above collect information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or usage of a smart device). In addition, in some implementations, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the personally identifiable information cannot be determined for or associated with the user, and so that user preferences or user interactions are generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user.
