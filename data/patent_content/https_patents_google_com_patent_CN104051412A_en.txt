As shown in the chip apparatus of Fig. 1 D, memory chip 104(for example, wide I/O DRAM) can be arranged on logic chip 102.In addition, second memory chip 114(for example, wide I/O DRAM) for example can be stacked on memory chip 104(, wide I/O DRAM) on.Therefore, the handling process that can manufacture chip apparatus 105 at memory chip 104(for example for example can need in addition, wide I/O DRAM) top on for example pick up and place second memory chip 114(, wide I/O DRAM).In another example, reverse situation is set up, and, at second memory chip 114(for example for example may need wide I/O DRAM that is) top on for example pick up and place memory chip 104(, wide I/O DRAM).
In chip apparatus 100 and/or chip apparatus 105, in process flow steps (for example, single process flow steps) by a large amount of interconnection (for example in, may need, interconnection 106-x and/or interconnection 126-x and/or interconnection 136-x) (be for example connected to for example other interconnection, interconnection 106-x and/or interconnection 126-x and/or interconnection 136-x) and/or contact (for example, contact 102c-x and/or contact 104c-x).For example, according to the wide I/O interface standard of JEDEC, 1200 I/O can be connected to interconnection (for example, interconnection 106-x and/or interconnection 126-x and/or interconnection 136-x) and/or contact (for example, contact 102c-x and/or contact 104c-x).Can for example, by for example welding (, reflow soldering), connect.
From Figure 1A and Fig. 1 D, can find out, between logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114, form and (for example connect, for example, by welding, reflow soldering) the even height of may need to interconnect 106-x and/or interconnection 126-x and/or interconnection 136-x distributes.For example, interconnection (for example, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x) between non-homogeneous height can prevent or for example can substantially reduce, between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104 and/or forming the possibility of reliable coupling (, electric coupling) between memory chip 104 and second memory chip 114 and/or between logic chip 102 and second memory chip 114.
From Figure 1A and Fig. 1 D, can find out, between logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114, form and (for example connect, by welding, for example reflow soldering) (for example may need all interconnection, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x) availability, to form reliable interconnect between logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114.For example, for example, if one or more interconnection (, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x) lose, for example can hinder, between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104 and/or (forming reliable coupling between memory chip 104 and second memory chip 114 and/or between logic chip 102 and second memory chip 114, electric coupling), or its possibility reduced in fact.
From Figure 1A and Fig. 1 D, can find out, between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104 and/or between memory chip 104 and second memory chip 114, form and (be for example connected, by welding, for example reflow soldering) by interconnection (for example may require, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x) (be for example accurately placed on other interconnection, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x) and/or contact (for example, 102c-x and/or 104c-x) on.For example, for example, for example, if lose wettability (fusing (flux)) on contact (102c-x and/or 104c-x), can hinder and (for example between logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114, form reliable coupling, electric coupling), or its possibility reduce in fact.
From Figure 1A and Fig. 1 D, can find out, between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104 and/or between memory chip 104 and second memory chip 114, form and (be for example connected, for example, by welding, reflow soldering) may require the accurate aligning of logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114.For example, the misalignment meeting of logic chip 102 and/or memory chip 104 and/or second memory chip 114 hinders or reduces in fact between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104 and/or for example, in be reliably the coupled possibility of (, electric coupling) of formation between memory chip 104 and second memory chip 114 and/or between logic chip 102 and second memory chip 114.
As described with reference to figure 1A and Fig. 1 D above, the height H of interconnection (for example, 106-x and/or 126-x and/or 136-x, such as micro-protuberance) and/or width W can be the levels of tens of microns (for example, several microns).Therefore, an above-mentioned difficult problem relevant with chip apparatus 100 and/or chip apparatus 105 further aggravated, because the error margin under such size can be lower.
For example, possible situation is, even only single (for example the electrical connection between logic chip 102 and memory chip 104, in wide I/O stack in 1200 connections one) fault, for example, for example, due to one or more (, the non-homogeneous height of interconnection, loss interconnection, the inaccuracy placement of interconnection, coarse chip are aimed at) in above-mentioned error, whole chip apparatus 100/105 can correctly not move.Therefore, total output depends primarily on the generation of in chip-stacked technique defective electrical connection or interconnection.
For example, for the test result of wide I/O DRAM stack, show, the total output that the automatic stacking technique by routine obtains can be low to moderate 76%.In other words, due to the one or more generation in above-mentioned error in stacking technical process, have to abandon made wide I/O DRAM memory nearly 1/4th.
Further test shows, by the chip of aligned stack part manually, stacking process yields may for example increase to about 92%.Yet manual alignment can be process flow steps consuming time, this can greatly increase manufacturing cost.The another kind of method that improves output is in manufacture process, to use connector and/or the optical check of pinpoint accuracy.Yet this also can greatly increase manufacturing cost.
In view of above-mentioned consideration, can identify following demand:
The chip apparatus that high yield can be provided need to be provided.
Need to provide the chip apparatus of high yield can be provided with low manufacturing cost.
Need to improve the output of chip-stacked technique, logic-memory stacking technique for example, for example, wide I/O memory stacking technique.
Even if need to provide a kind of height change that is included in the interconnection in chip apparatus also can provide the chip apparatus of high yield.
Even if need to provide a kind of loses one or more interconnection and also can provide the chip apparatus of high yield in chip apparatus.
Even if need to provide a kind of is inaccurately placed on interconnection on other interconnection of comprising in chip apparatus and/or contact and also can provides the chip apparatus of high yield.
Even if need to provide the chip inaccuracy comprising in a kind of chip apparatus to aim at, also can provide the chip apparatus of high yield.
This chip apparatus can provide by example chip 20X as shown in Figure 2.
Fig. 2 shows plane Figure 200 of the chip 20X that can use in chip apparatus.
Chip 20X can for example be similar to the chip 10X shown in Figure 1B in some respects, but is different from chip 10X in other side.In Fig. 2 with Reference numeral identical in Figure 1B represent with Figure 1B in same or analogous element.Therefore, no longer those elements are elaborated herein; With reference to explanation above.Below the difference between Fig. 2 and Figure 1B is described.
Chip 20X can have the first side 20Xa.The first side 20Xa of chip 20X can for example be considered to be equal to the first side 10Xa of the chip 10X shown in Figure 1B.
Chip 20X can comprise at least one first contact 20Xc-1 to 20Xc-8, and it can for example be formed on the first 20Xa place, side (for example, be arranged in the first 20Xa place, side or on) of chip 20X.At least one first contact 20Xc-1 to 20Xc-8 of chip 20X can for example be considered to be equal to respectively at least one contact 10Xc-1 to 10Xc-8 of chip 10X.
Chip 20X can comprise at least one second contact 20Xd-1 to 20Xd-8, and it can for example be formed on the first 20Xa place, side (for example, be arranged in the first 20Xa place, side or on) of chip 20X.The second contact of at least one the second contact 20Xd-1 to 20Xd-8 can for example the first contact coupling (for example, electric coupling) with at least one the first contact 20Xc-1 to 20Xc-8 of chip 20X by heavy distribution structure 20XR-1 to 20XR-8.For example, corresponding the second contact can for example, by corresponding heavy distribution structure and corresponding the first contact coupling (, electric coupling).For example, as shown in Figure 2, the second contact 20Xd-1 can for example, by heavy distribution structure 20XR-1 and the first contact 20Xc-1 coupling (, electric coupling).
A plurality of interconnection can with corresponding the second contact coupling (for example, electric coupling) of at least one the second contact 20Xd-1 to 20Xd-8 of chip 20X.For example, as shown in Figure 2, more than first interconnection 20XIR-1 can with the one the second contact 20Xd-1 couplings (for example, electric coupling), more than second interconnection 20XIR-2 can with the two the second contact 20Xd-2 couplings (for example, electric coupling), more than the 3rd interconnection 20XIR-3 can with the three the second contact 20Xd-3 couplings (for example, electric coupling), etc.As example, (for example demonstrate three interconnection and corresponding the second contact 20Xd-x coupling, electric coupling), but for example, can be two with the quantity of the interconnection of corresponding the second contact 20Xd-x coupling (, electric coupling), or can be greater than three, can be for example four, five, six or more.
Compare with the chip 10X shown in Figure 1B, chip 20X shown in Fig. 2 can comprise heavy distribution structure 20XR-1 to 20XR-8, and it can for example re-route the electrical connection from corresponding the first contact 20Xc-1 to 20Xc-8 to corresponding the second contact 20Xd-1 to 20Xd-8.For example, as shown in Figure 2, heavy distribution structure 20XR-1 can re-route the electrical connection from the first contact 20Xc-1 to the second contact 20Xd-1.
Compare with the chip 10X shown in Figure 1B, the chip 20X shown in Fig. 2 can comprise for example, a plurality of interconnection 20XIR-1 to 20XIR-8 with corresponding the second contact 20Xd-1 to 20Xd-8 coupling (, electric coupling).For example, as shown in Figure 2, more than first interconnection 20XIR-1 can with the one the second contact 20Xd-1 couplings (for example, electric coupling).
Chip 20X shown in Fig. 2 can for example, by a plurality of interconnection 20XIR-1 to 20XIR-8 and another chip (not shown in Fig. 2, reference example is as Fig. 3) coupling (, electric coupling).
In the routine that comprises chip 10X shown in Figure 1B is arranged, only there is an interconnection 106-x in each chip contact 10Xc-x.Therefore, for a large amount of interconnection, at least due at least one in following reason, between chip 10X and another chip via at least one interconnection 106-x coupling (for example, electric coupling) possibility of fault is relatively high: the non-homogeneous height in a plurality of interconnection 106-x, at least one interconnection in a plurality of interconnection 106-x is lost, the wettability losing at least one contact 10Xc-x (for example, fusing (flux)), (for example pollute, due to be arranged in interconnection 106-x and/or at least one contact 10Xc-x place or on pollutant), and the misalignment of chip 10X and another chip.Therefore, output can be relatively low as mentioned above.
In comprising the chip apparatus of chip 20X, can be each chip contact, be also each first contact 20Xc-x of chip 20X, a plurality of interconnection (exemplarily comprising one or more standby interconnection) are provided.For example, the first contact 20Xc-1 is via heavy distribution structure 20XR-1 and the one the second contact 20Xd-1 coupling, and more than first interconnection 20XIR1-1(comprises three interconnection in this example) be set to the one the second contact 20Xd-1(and therefore the first contact 20Xc-1) with another chip coupling.Compare with the only situation of an interconnection as shown in Figure 1B, at least one interconnection more than first in interconnection 20Xd-1 is in fact by the one the second contact 20Xd-1(and therefore the first contact 20Xc-1) relatively high with the possibility of the corresponding counterpart contact coupling of another chip.Similarly consider other contact 20Xc-2, the 20Xc-3 applicable to chip 20X ..., 20Xc-8, it can also be provided with one or more standby interconnection, and (in Fig. 2, all contact 20Xc-x can be provided with three interconnection as shown in the figure; But can also be that only some contact 20Xc-x are provided with standby interconnection, or the quantity of standby interconnection be for each contact 20Xc-1,20Xc-2 ..., 20Xc-8 difference).Therefore, whole chip contacts of chip 20X (that is, in illustrated example, be contact 20Xc-1 ... 20Xc-8) by with another chip on the possibility of its corresponding mating section electric coupling can increase significantly, and therefore the output of chip-stacked technique can increase.
The effect providing by the chip 20X shown in Fig. 2 can be for example, to provide at least one standby electrical connection between the contact of chip 20X and the corresponding counterpart contact of another chip of can be coupled by for example a plurality of interconnection 20XIR-1 to 20XIR-8 and chip 20X (, electric coupling).Therefore, chip 20X and one or more electrical connections between another chip can exemplarily double or become three times or be multiplied by a certain other factor, thereby improve the possibility of correct electric coupling between chip.For example, for example, even if any in (or due to other reason) or combination in any by the corresponding counterpart contact coupling of the first contact 20Xc-1 of chip 20X and another chip (are failed an interconnection of more than first interconnection 20XIR-1 for above-mentioned reasons, electric coupling), in more than first interconnection 20XIR-1, there is at least one other interconnection that expection coupling (for example, electric coupling) can be provided.Similarly consider for other the first contact 20Xc-2 shown in Fig. 2 ..., 20Xc-8 also sets up.Exemplarily, signal on corresponding the first contact 20Xc-x of chip 20X can for example, exchange between chip 20X and another chip via plural signal path (, via by corresponding a plurality of interconnection 20XIR-x of corresponding the second contact 20Xd-1 and heavy distribution structure 20XR-x and corresponding the first contact 20Xc-x coupling).Therefore, this corresponding first contact 20Xc-x that can improve at chip 20X and chip 20X can with the corresponding counterpart contact of another chip of its coupling (for example, electric coupling) between there is the possibility that at least one connects (for example, being electrically connected to).
Therefore,, although chip 20X aims at inaccuracy with another chip, the effect being provided by chip 20X can be still high yield.
For the chip apparatus that comprises chip 20X, the effect being provided by chip 20X can be high yield.
For the chip apparatus that comprises chip 20X, the effect being provided by chip 20X can be high yield and low manufacturing cost.
Although comprise that the interconnect height of the chip apparatus of chip 20X changes, the effect being provided by chip 20X can be still high yield.
Although lost one or more interconnection in the chip apparatus that comprises chip 20X, the effect being provided by chip 20X can be still high yield.
Although interconnection is inaccurately placed in other interconnection and/or contact included in the chip apparatus that comprises chip 20X, and the effect being provided by chip 20X can be still high yield.

Fig. 4 shows the chip apparatus 400 that comprises the first chip 202 and the second chip 204, and wherein a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5 can be distributed between at least one the first contact 202c-1,202c-5 and at least one the second contact 202d-1,202d-5 of the first chip 202.
In Fig. 4, represent the same or analogous element with Fig. 3 with Reference numeral identical in Fig. 3.Therefore, no longer those elements are elaborated herein; With reference to explanation above.Each effect of above describing in conjunction with the chip apparatus 300 shown in Fig. 3 can be effective for the chip apparatus 400 shown in Fig. 4 similarly.Below the difference between Fig. 4 and Fig. 3 is described.
As shown in Figure 4, at least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place that at least one interconnection in a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5 can be formed on the first chip 202 are (for example, be arranged at least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place or on), and at least one other interconnection in a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5 can be formed at least one second contact 202d-1,202d-5 place (for example, be arranged at least one second contact 202d-1,202d-5 place or on) of the first chip 202.
In this example, at least one contact 204d-1,204d-5 of the second chip 204 (for example can have enough wide so that at least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place of being formed on the first chip 202, be arranged at least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place or on) at least one interconnection can (for example contact with at least one contact 204d-1,204d-5 of the second chip 204, physical contact, for example, lateral extent direct physical contact).Like this can be for example by least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place of being formed on the first chip 202 (for example, be arranged at least one first contact 202c-1,202c-5 place or on) at least one interconnection and the second chip 204 at least one contact 204d-1,204d-5 coupling (for example, or vice versa electric coupling).
As mentioned above, at least one through hole 222-1,222-5 can be arranged in and can be arranged in the centre of the first chip 202 or near region R central authorities.Therefore, and the interconnection of at least one the first contact 202c-1,202c-5 coupling can make the distance of the signal path between the first chip 202 and the second chip 204 minimize for set I/O.
In the larger example of the first side 202a of the first chip 202, for example on the first side 202a of the first chip 202, all signal paths can re-route (for example,, by for example at least one weighs distribution structure 202R-1,202R-5 from least one through hole 222-1,222-5).
At the first side 202a of the first chip 202 not enough greatly to adapt in the example of heavy-route of all signal paths, the extended layer that the first chip 202 and/or the second chip 204 can be laterally extended by the one or more sides from chip at least in part surrounds, for example, can be included in Embedded wafer scale ball grid array (eWLB) encapsulation, it can for example be provided for enough large real estates of the heavy-route of all signal paths.
In example, do not need for all signal path heavy-routes.For example, power supply signal (for example, ground, VDD, VSS etc.) is supplied to chip and can fetches realization by a plurality of being electrically connected, and therefore, does not need standby one or more such connection.For example, all provide for example, the path outside a plurality of paths of same power supplies electromotive force (, earth potential) may be without heavy-route and/or may be without being provided with backup path, for example, via a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5.For example, Fig. 9 shows to illustrate according to the I/O (I/O) at wide I/O logic-memory interface of JEDEC standard and connects.Can find out, each piece can have 300 I/O, and some of them I/O can be loaded with identical signal.For example, " VDD1 " can be provided by 6 I/O, and " VDD2 " can be provided by 20 I/O, and " VDDQ " can be provided by 16 I/O, etc.And some I/O may not used or be connected, (" NC ") as shown in Table.Therefore, one or more (being represented by circle in table) in those signals may be without heavy-route and/or may be without being provided with space signal path, for example, and via a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5.
Although for corresponding through hole 222-1,222-5 provide more than one signal path can increase the output of chip apparatus 300 and/or chip apparatus 400 when chip-stacked, if but at the first chip 202(for example, logic chip) with the second chip 204(for example, memory chip) between, realize a plurality of interconnection (each contact) simultaneously, can reduce the electrical property of chip apparatus (for example, stacking wide I/O DRAM).Therefore, (be for example desirably in the quantity of the stacking technique signal path that minimizing is worked again afterwards, each through hole 222-x is a signal path only), thus avoid between the first chip 202 and the second chip 204, exchanging a signal by thering are two above signal paths of unlike signal transmission characteristic.The minimizing of signal path can for example, realize by for example blowing the one or more fuses (, electronic fuse or laser blown device) that are arranged in signal path.In other words, can apply fusing be electrically connected to its standby electrical connection between select.
For example, signal can be between the first chip 202 and the second chip 204 at the signal path with length-specific (for example, signal path from through hole 222-1 via intercommunicated past second chip 204 a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1) exchange, and the signal being equal to can (for example, signal path via another intercommunicated past the second chip 204 a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1 from through hole 222-1) exchange in the space signal path between the first chip 202 and the second chip 204 with different length.In this example, can apply fusing to select between signal path and space signal path.
Although for corresponding through hole 222-1,222-5 provide more than one signal path can improve the output of chip apparatus 300 and/or chip apparatus 400, but the first chip 202 for example, is expected with disconnecting non-functional connection (, being electrically connected to) between the second chip 204.
Therefore, chip apparatus can comprise at least one fuse, it can for example be blown that the first chip 202 and at least one non-functional connection the (for example, being electrically connected to) between the second chip 204 are disconnected and/or selected between signal path and its space signal path.
Fusing can for example for example, be carried out in a plurality of interconnection 202IR-1,202IR-5 test (electrical testing) afterwards, and test can show that for example the first chip 202 is connected and non-functional connection (for example, being electrically connected to) or interconnection with the function between the second chip 204.Based on test, can for example judge optimal connection or interconnection in a plurality of connections or interconnection, then by fusing, eliminate not too applicable connection or interconnection in a plurality of connections or interconnection.
