Abstract
A method for authenticating a transaction between two entities includes receiving, by one or more processors, a request associated with the transaction between a first entity associated with a first computing device and a second entity, generating, by the one or more processors, transaction details information associated with completion of the transaction between the first entity and the second entity, encrypting, by the one or more processors, the transaction details information by digitally signing the transaction details information, and transmitting, by the one or more processors, the transaction details information encrypted by the one or more processors, to the first computing device.
Description
- This application is based on and claims priority to India Provisional Application No. 202221065324 having a filing date of Nov. 15, 2022, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.
- The disclosure relates generally to authenticating transactions. For example, the disclosure relates to computer implemented methods and computer systems for authenticating transactions using digitally signed transaction details information which may be embedded in a barcode.
- With the rise of online instant payments through mobile device applications, there is also a rise in fraud vectors that leverage this relatively new medium of paying, especially in less developed or secure markets. As an example, a customer obtains an item from a merchant and pretends to pay via a payment app. The customer then shows the merchant a fake display screen on their mobile device which appears to provide confirmation of payment, and the customer leaves with the supposedly purchased item. As a variation of the above example, the customer may also show the merchant a fake display screen on their mobile device which appears to provide confirmation of payment which “accidentally” exceeded the purchase price. The customer then requests and receives a refund for the supposed excess payment. The merchant believes they have received payment (or that a payment will arrive shortly after) but in fact they have not been, nor will they ever be, paid.
- Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or can be learned from the description, or can be learned through practice of the example embodiments.

Each example is provided by way of explanation of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
- Terms used herein are used to describe the example embodiments and are not intended to limit and/or restrict the disclosure. The singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. In this disclosure, terms such as “including”, “having”, “comprising”, and the like are used to specify features, numbers, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more of the features, elements, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof.
- It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc., may be used herein to describe various elements, the elements are not limited by these terms. Instead, these terms are used to distinguish one element from another element. For example, without departing from the scope of the disclosure, a first element may be termed as a second element, and a second element may be termed as a first element.
- The term “and/or” includes a combination of a plurality of related listed items or any item of the plurality of related listed items. For example, the scope of the expression or phrase “A and/or B” includes the item “A”, the item “B”, and the combination of items “A and B”.
- In addition, the scope of the expression or phrase “at least one of A or B” is intended to include all of the following: (1) at least one of A, (2) at least one of B, and (3) at least one of A and at least one of B. Likewise, the scope of the expression or phrase “at least one of A, B, or C” is intended to include all of the following: (1) at least one of A, (2) at least one of B, (3) at least one of C, (4) at least one of A and at least one of B, (5) at least one of A and at least one of C, (6) at least one of B and at least one of C, and (7) at least one of A, at least one of B, and at least one of C.
- Examples of the disclosure are directed to a computer-implemented transaction authentication method and transaction authentication system for authenticating transactions between a first entity (alternatively referred to as a consumer, buyer, or payor, herein) associated with a first computing device and a second entity (alternatively referred to as a merchant, seller, or payee, herein) associated with a second computing device. The transaction authentication method allows the second computing device to accurately verify various details of a transaction in an expedient manner, which may be conducted in an offline or online manner.
- In some circumstances a lag may exist between the time of payment completion by a consumer and the merchant obtaining confirmation or notification of the payment. For example, a stable internet connection may not be available and if the merchant is offline or is experiencing a poor internet connection, there may be no method for the merchant to proactively verify the transaction without receiving the confirmation or notification from the server computing system. As another example, the server computing system may also be experiencing service disruptions which can cause the confirmation or notification from the server computing system to not be sent to the merchant or to be delayed.
- Scammers take advantage of the lag in the time it takes for confirmation or notification of payment. For example, the merchant may rely on the word of the buyer or be fooled by a fake screenshot of a transaction because the merchant has no way of knowing a transaction is completed until the confirmation or notification of payment is actually received by the merchant. In some cases, the actual merchant registered and receiving payment confirmation or notification may not be available at the store and the staff has no option but to trust the screenshot of the transaction shown to them, which can accurately imitate genuine transaction details and be generated using applications available in the marketplace. Thus, merchants have a fundamental problem of not being able to quickly or accurately validate transaction screenshots presented to the merchant.
- According to example embodiments a transaction authentication system may include a transaction authentication application which provides a secure way for a merchant to verify (both in an offline and online manner) the authenticity of a transaction using digitally signed barcodes. Offline verification capabilities of the transaction authentication system remove the dependency for transaction authentication on the availability of the internet.
- In some implementations, the transaction authentication application may be configured to actively alert the merchant if the transaction is not valid (e.g., by displaying a warning message, sounding an alarm, etc.). In some implementations, the transaction authentication application may be configured to display a recency of the transaction (e.g., a time that the payment occurred) as part of a verification user interface screen to prevent or discourage scammers from reusing old transaction details pages. In some implementations, the transaction authentication application may be configured to keep track of the number of times a transaction has been authenticated as part of a verification user interface screen to prevent or discourage scammers from reusing old transaction details pages.
- According to example embodiments, when a buyer purchases a good or service from a merchant via a payment or transaction application, the payment or transaction application may include a transaction details page (i.e., the electronic receipt) which includes a barcode (e.g., a quick response (QR) code) that contains digitally signed transaction details information. The merchant may use a computing device to scan the barcode shown on the transaction details page (either in an offline or online manner) to validate the transaction. In some implementations the transaction details may include one or more of the merchant name, the buyer name, a time stamp, an amount, a transaction identifier, and a status. The transaction authentication system may be configured to embed the barcode when a transaction is successfully completed. For example, a server computing system may be configured to calculate a hash value based on the transaction details and sign the hash value with a private key to create the digital signature. The digital signature is encoded into the barcode and the barcode (e.g., QR code) is embedded into the transaction details page.
- According to example embodiments, the transaction authentication system may be configured to decrypt the digitally signed barcode either in an offline manner or an online manner.
- For example, in an online implementation, a uniform resource locator (URL) may be embedded in the barcode such that a server computing system can verify the barcode. For example, the merchant may use a computing device to scan the barcode as provided on a transaction details page which is displayed on a screen of the buyer's computing device (e.g., a mobile device). The merchant's computing device may be configured to, upon scanning the barcode, obtain the URL from the barcode and access a payment service provider at the server computing system so that the barcode can be authenticated by a server transaction authentication system of the payment service provider at the server computing system. For example, the server transaction authentication system may be configured to decrypt the digital signature with a public key stored at the server transaction authentication system to obtain a decrypted hash value. For example, if the decrypted hash value does not match a hash value calculated from the transaction details, then the server transaction authentication system may be configured to determine that the barcode displayed on the buyer's computing device is not authentic and provide an appropriate response to the merchant's computing device indicating the transaction is not authentic. The merchant's computing device can provide an output including displaying an error message to indicate the transaction is not authentic. For example, if the decrypted hash value does match the hash value calculated from the encoded transaction details, then the server transaction authentication system may be configured to determine that the barcode displayed on the buyer's computing device is authentic and provide an appropriate response to the merchant's computing device indicating the transaction is authentic. The merchant's computing device can provide an output including displaying a message indicating the transaction is authentic.
- In a variation of the above-described online implementation, the URL may be exposed (i.e., not embedded in the barcode) such that the URL is displayed in full on the transaction details page and the merchant can access a trusted web endpoint using the URL to perform authentication by the payment service provider as discussed above. Such an implementation can avoid a merchant being directed to possible fraudulent URLs that are embedded in a fake barcode.
- For example, in an offline implementation, the merchant may use a computing device to scan the barcode as provided on a transaction details page which is displayed on a screen of the buyer's computing device (e.g., a mobile device). The merchant's computing device may be configured to decode the barcode to obtain the information associated with the transaction details. For example, the merchant's computing device may be configured to decrypt the digital signature with a public key stored at the merchant computing device (e.g., with the payment application) to obtain a decrypted hash value. For example, if the decrypted hash value does not match a hash value calculated from the encoded transaction details, then the transaction authentication system may be configured to determine that the barcode displayed on the buyer's computing device is not authentic and provide an appropriate output (e.g., displaying an error message). For example, if the decrypted hash value does match the hash value calculated from the transaction details, then the transaction authentication system may be configured to determine that the barcode displayed on the buyer's computing device is authentic and provide an appropriate output (e.g., displaying a message indicating the transaction is authentic). In the offline implementation (i.e., without accessing the internet), verification can occur completely at the merchant's computing device using the payment application stored at the merchant's computing device which stores the certificate chain used for decrypting the barcode (e.g., storing the public key). In some instances, the merchant's computing device may need to access the internet to update expired certificates, however if the necessary certificate stored at the merchant's computing device is not expired, authentication of the transaction can be performed completely offline.
- In some implementations, when the barcode that is being scanned is a legitimate barcode but is not associated with either the buyer or the merchant, an error message may also be provided. For example, when the transaction details indicate the transaction is associated with Merchant A and Buyer B, and the user associated with the payment application being used to authenticate the transaction does not correspond to either Merchant A or Buyer B, such an error message may be output.
- According to the embodiments described herein, the merchant is able to confirm that the transaction is authentic based on the authentication of the barcode. In addition, the merchant can confirm transaction details regarding at least: (1) the transaction time (to ensure the barcode that has been authenticated is associated with a recent transaction); (2) the transaction participants (to ensure the barcode is associated with the merchant and the buyer); and (3) the transaction amount (to ensure the correct amount has been paid for the good or service).
- One or more technical benefits of the disclosure include preventing fraudulent transactions from being conducted by encrypting and embedding transaction details information in a barcode for completed transactions. Furthermore, one or more technical benefits of the disclosure include determining whether a transaction is authentic by decrypting a barcode which is provided for display on a display device of a user and determining whether the barcode is valid. One or more technical benefits of the disclosure include determining whether the transaction is authentic in an offline manner such that consumption of computing resources is reduced (e.g., reduced bandwidth usage, reduced network traffic, etc.) and such that authentication is capable of being performed quickly and accurately when a computing network is unavailable, disrupted, slow, etc. Thus, according to aspects of the disclosure, technical benefits including resource savings and transaction accuracy improvements may be achieved.
- Referring now to the drawings,
FIG. 1 is an example transaction environment according to one or more example embodiments of the disclosure.FIG. 1 illustrates an example of atransaction environment 1000 which includes afirst computing device 100 which is associated with afirst entity 1100 and asecond computing device 200 which is associated with asecond entity 1200. For example, thefirst entity 1100 may correspond to a customer or consumer who purchases goods or services from thesecond entity 1200 which may correspond to a merchant or seller who sells the goods or services to thefirst entity 1100. Thefirst entity 1100 andsecond entity 1200 may correspond to an individual or a legal entity including a corporation, company, organization, and the like. - According to example embodiments described herein, when the
first entity 1100 makes a purchase from thesecond entity 1200 via a transaction application 132 (seeFIG. 3 ), a transaction details page of a firstuser interface screen 162 may be displayed on a user interface screen of thefirst computing device 100. The transaction details page may include various information about the transaction including one or more of the merchant name, the buyer name, a time stamp, an amount, a transaction identifier, and a status, as well as a barcode 164 (e.g., a quick response code). In some instances, thefirst entity 1100 may need to confirm or prove payment for a purchase from the second entity 1200 (e.g., to obtain a refund for the purchase, to obtain a refund for an overpayment, etc.). As will be described more fully below, thesecond entity 1200 may authenticate the validity of the transaction and of the information about the transaction, by using thesecond computing device 200 to scan thebarcode 164 presented on the user interface screen of thefirst computing device 100. Thebarcode 164 includes encrypted information and includes digitally signed transaction details information regarding the transaction. - In some implementations, the
second computing device 200 may be configured to transmit the scanned image of thebarcode 164 to a server computing system 300 (seeFIG. 2 ) with a request to determine whether thebarcode 164 displayed on thefirst computing device 100 is associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200 and is authentic. Theserver computing system 300 may be configured to authenticate the transaction by decrypting the encrypted transaction details information. - In some implementations, the
second computing device 200 may be configured to determine itself whether the barcode displayed on thefirst computing device 100 is associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200 and is authentic. Thesecond computing device 200 may be configured to authenticate the transaction by decrypting the encrypted transaction details information. For example, thesecond computing device 200 may be configured to authenticate the transaction in an offline manner (without being connected to the internet). - For example, a result of the authentication process may be displayed on a
user interface screen 262 of adisplay device 260 of thesecond computing device 200 indicating whether the transaction is authentic or not authentic. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an example system according to one or more example embodiments of the disclosure is illustrated.FIG. 2 illustrates an example of asystem 2000 which includes thefirst computing device 100, thesecond computing device 200, aserver computing system 300, andexternal content 500, which may be in communication with one another over anetwork 400. For example, thefirst computing device 100 and thesecond computing device 200 can include any of a personal computer, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a global positioning service device, a smartwatch, and the like.

entity data store 370 is provided to illustrate potential data that could be analyzed, in some embodiments, by theserver computing system 300 to authenticate a transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. However, such data may not be collected, used, or analyzed unless thesecond entity 1200 has consented after being informed of what data is collected and how such data is used. Further, in some embodiments, thesecond entity 1200 can be provided with a tool (e.g., in atransaction application 232 or via a user account) to revoke or modify the scope of permissions. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed or stored in an encrypted fashion. Thus, particular user information stored in the secondentity data store 370 may or may not be accessible to theserver computing system 300 based on permissions given by the user, or such data may not be stored in the secondentity data store 370 at all. - In some example embodiments, the transaction details information data store 380 can represent a single database.

Theserver computing system 300 may configured to access data from the transaction details information data store 380 when generating an encoded or encrypted barcode image which is transmitted to thefirst computing device 100. - In some example embodiments, the certificate
information data store 390 can represent a single database. In some embodiments, the certificateinformation data store 390 represents a plurality of different databases accessible to theserver computing system 300. In some examples, the certificateinformation data store 390 can include information relating to the generation of a barcode (e.g., a QR code) which includes digitally signed transaction details information. For example, theserver computing system 300 may be configured to store secure service provider certificates (i.e., certificates issued by a certificate authority). For example, theserver computing system 300 may be configured to insert a digital signature which includes the transaction details information in the barcode using a private key stored at the certificateinformation data store 390. For example, the certificateinformation data store 390 may store the private key and a public key used to decrypt the digital signature. For example, the public key used to decrypt the digital signature may be obtained from the certificateinformation data store 390 and subsequently stored at the second computing device 200 (e.g., in certificate information data store 226). The certificateinformation data store 390 may store information about the certificate authority including identification information (e.g., a name of the organization issuing the certificate, address, etc.). -

FIG. 3 , example block diagrams of first and second computing devices and the server computing system, according to one or more example embodiments of the disclosure will now be described. - The
first computing device 100 may include one ormore processors 110, one ormore memory devices 120, atransaction authentication system 130, aposition determination device 140, aninput device 150, adisplay device 160, anoutput device 170, and ascanner 180. Thesecond computing device 200 may include one ormore processors 210, one ormore memory devices 220, atransaction authentication system 230, aposition determination device 240, aninput device 250, adisplay device 260, anoutput device 270, and ascanner 280. Theserver computing system 300 may include one ormore processors 310, one ormore memory devices 320, and atransaction authentication system 330. - For example, the one or
more processors first computing device 100,second computing device 200, orserver computing system 300. For example, the one ormore processors more processors - The one or
more memory devices more memory devices more memory devices - For example, one or
more memory devices 120 can storeinstructions 124, that when executed, cause the one ormore processors 110 to execute a computing application (e.g.,transaction application 132 and/or transaction verification application 134). For example, in response to thefirst entity 1100 purchasing a good or service via thetransaction application 132, theinstructions 124 may causetransaction verification application 134 to be executed and a request associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 associated with thefirst computing device 100 and thesecond entity 1200 may be transmitted to theserver computing system 300. For example, the request may be a request for theserver computing system 300 to generate a barcode which includes encrypted information including an embedded and digitally signed string (e.g., a base 64 QR string) that contains the transaction details information. Theinstructions 124 may further include instructions for receiving, from theserver computing system 300, the barcode including the encrypted transaction details information embedded in the barcode. For example, the transaction details information may be associated with the completion of the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. Theinstructions 124 may further include instructions for providing, for display by thedisplay device 160, the barcode and at least a portion of the transaction details information including one or more of a transaction time, first entity information, second entity information, a unique identifier associated with the second entity, status information, or an amount of the transaction, as described according to examples of the disclosure. - For example, one or
more memory devices 220 can store instructions 224, that when executed, cause the one ormore processors 210 to execute a computing application (e.g.,transaction application 232 and/or transaction verification application 234). For example, when thesecond entity 1200 wishes to authenticate or verify a transaction with thefirst entity 1100,transaction verification application 234 may be executed and the instructions 224 may include instructions associated with thetransaction verification application 234 that cause the one ormore cameras 282 of thescanner 280 to capture an image of a barcode provided on a display of thedisplay device 160 of thefirst computing device 100, wherein the barcode is potentially associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 associated with thefirst computing device 100 and thesecond entity 1200 associated with thesecond computing device 200. The instructions 224 may further include instructions for determining whether the barcode is authentic based on a decryption of encrypted transaction details information embedded in the barcode and a determination of whether a first hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is equal to a second hash value calculated based on a digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. The instructions 224 may further include providing, for display on thedisplay device 260, a first notification indicating the barcode is not authentic (e.g., when the first hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is not equal to the second hash value calculated based on the digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information) and providing, for display on thedisplay device 260, a second notification indicating the barcode is authentic when the first hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is equal to the second hash value calculated based on the digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. - For example, one or
more memory devices 320 can storeinstructions 324, that when executed, cause the one ormore processors 310 to execute a computing application (e.g.,transaction application 332 and/or transaction verification application 334). For example, when thefirst entity 1100 requests to receive an encrypted barcode from theserver computing system 300 and/or when thesecond entity 1200 wishes to authenticate or verify a transaction with thefirst entity 1100, thetransaction verification application 334 may be executed and theinstructions 324 may be executed. For example, theinstructions 324 may include instructions to receive a request associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200, to generate transaction details information associated with completion of the transaction via a first computing device associated with the first entity, to encrypt the transaction details information by digitally signing the transaction details information, and to transmit the encrypted transaction details information to the first computing device. For example, theinstructions 324 may include instructions to receive an image of a barcode potentially associated with the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. Theinstructions 324 may further include instructions for determining whether the barcode is authentic based on a decryption of encrypted transaction details information embedded in the barcode and for determining whether a first hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is equal to a second hash value calculated based on a digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. The instructions 224 may further include providing, to thesecond computing device 200, a first indication that the barcode is not authentic when theserver computing system 300 determines the first hash value is not equal to the second hash value and providing, to thesecond computing device 200, a second indication that the barcode is authentic when theserver computing system 300 determines the first hash value is equal to the second hash value. - One or
more memory devices 120 can also includedata 122 andinstructions 124 that can be retrieved, manipulated, created, or stored by the one ormore processors 110. In some example embodiments, such data can be accessed and used as input to execute the computing application (e.g., thetransaction application 132 and/or transaction verification application 134), as described according to examples of the disclosure. One ormore memory devices 220 can also includedata 222 and instructions 224 that can be retrieved, manipulated, created, or stored by the one ormore processors 210. In some example embodiments, such data can be accessed and used as input to execute the computing application (e.g., thetransaction application 232 and/or transaction verification application 234), as described according to examples of the disclosure. One ormore memory devices 320 can also includedata 322 andinstructions 324 that can be retrieved, manipulated, created, or stored by the one ormore processors 310. In some example embodiments, such data can be accessed and used to execute the computing application (e.g., thetransaction application 332 and/or transaction verification application 334), as described according to examples of the disclosure. - In some example embodiments, the
first computing device 100 includes thetransaction authentication system 130 which includes thetransaction application 132 andtransaction verification application 134. Thetransaction application 132 may be an application which can be used as a mobile payment system (e.g., a contactless payment method using near-field communication). However, the transaction application can be any application by which an entity (i.e., a user) can provide payment for goods or services using thefirst computing device 100. As described according to examples disclosed herein,transaction verification application 134 may be an application that can be used to prove or verify payment for the goods or services purchased, for example, using thetransaction application 132. - The
transaction authentication system 230 may includetransaction application 232 andtransaction verification application 234 and may correspond to thetransaction authentication system 130 including thetransaction application 132 andtransaction verification application 134. Therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted for the sake of brevity. In some examples, one or more aspects of thetransaction authentication system 130 may be implemented by thetransaction authentication system 330 of theserver computing system 300. For example, in some implementations thetransaction verification application 334 may perform authentication operations with respect to a scanned image of a barcode received from thesecond computing device 200. For example, in some implementations thetransaction verification application 334 may perform encryption operations with respect to a transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200, according to a request from thefirst computing device 100. - In some examples, the
transaction applications transaction verification applications transaction applications transaction verification applications network 400. - For example, the
position determination devices first computing device 100 andsecond computing device 200, respectively) and communicate such geographic location toserver computing system 300 overnetwork 400. Theposition determination devices position determination devices - For example,
input devices input devices input devices - The
display devices display devices display devices display devices transaction authentication systems first entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. For example, thedisplay device 160 can display a user interface screen which includes a barcode and transaction details information concerning a transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. For example, thedisplay device 260 can display user interface screens which confirm whether a barcode is authentic or not authentic. - For example,
output devices output device first entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. For example, if the transaction is determined to be not authentic bysecond computing device 200,output device 270 may be configured to output a sound which serves as a warning or alarm to alert a user of thesecond computing device 200. - For example,
scanners more cameras second computing device 200 may includescanner 280 which scans an image of a barcode presented on a display or user interface screen ofdisplay device 160, according to examples described herein. -
FIG. 4 andFIGS. 5A-5B are example user interface screens of computing devices which may be provided when authenticating a transaction between a first entity and a second entity, according to one or more examples of the disclosure. - Referring to
FIG. 4 , an example illustration of user interface screens associated with thefirst computing device 100 andsecond computing device 200 are shown, according to one or more examples of the disclosure. - As a non-limiting example,
FIG. 4 illustrates thefirst computing device 100 having a display which presents onuser interface screen 4100 various user interface elements that provide transaction details information regarding a completed transaction between thefirst entity 1100 andsecond entity 1200. For example, inFIG. 4 user interface screen 4100 includes a firstuser interface element 4110 indicating the identity of the second entity 1200 (“Bob”), a seconduser interface element 4120 which indicates an amount of the transaction (“R$123,99”), a thirduser interface element 4130 which indicates a status of the transaction and a date and time of the transaction (“Completed—Jan. 12, 2022 at 7:16 PM”), a fourthuser interface element 4140 which corresponds to a barcode (e.g., a QR code) that can be used to verify the transaction, and fifthuser interface element 4150 that indicates the form of payment (e.g., a particular credit card). Theuser interface screen 4100 can include additional or fewer user interface elements than those described in the example, however aspects of the disclosure utilize the barcode to verify the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200 as described herein. For example, inFIG. 4 user interface screen 4100 may include an exposed sixthuser interface element 4160 indicating a URL address which, when accessed by thesecond computing device 200, serves as a web endpoint for a payment service provider at theserver computing system 300 so that the barcode can be authenticated by thetransaction authentication system 330. In another implementation, the URL address may be embedded in the barcode. For example,second computing device 200 may be configured to, upon scanning the barcode, obtain the URL from the barcode and access a payment service provider at theserver computing system 300 so that the barcode can be authenticated by thetransaction authentication system 330. - As a non-limiting example,
FIG. 4 illustrates thesecond computing device 200 having a display which presents onuser interface screen 4200 various user interface elements that provide transaction details information regarding a completed transaction between thefirst entity 1100 andsecond entity 1200. For example, inFIG. 4 user interface screen 4100 may be provided after a successful authentication of the barcode presented on theuser interface screen 4100 of thefirst computing device 100 and which is scanned by thesecond computing device 200. For example, inFIG. 4 user interface screen 4100 includes a firstuser interface element 4210 indicating the identity of the first entity (“Alice”), a seconduser interface element 4220 which indicates an amount of the transaction (“R$123,99”), a thirduser interface element 4230 which indicates an identity of the second entity (“Bob”), a fourthuser interface element 4240 which indicates a unique second entity identifier (e.g., a tax identification number associated with the second entity, a user identifier associated with the second entity, or any identifier which may be unique or is specific to thesecond entity 1200 and known to the second entity 1200), a fifthuser interface element 4250 which indicates whether authentication of the transaction is successful (e.g., when the authentication is successful a checkmark, a celebratory symbol, etc. may be presented), a sixthuser interface element 4260 which indicates a status of the transaction and a date and time of the transaction (“Completed—Jan. 12, 2022 at 7:16 PM”), a seventhuser interface element 4270 which indicates a transaction identifier of thetransaction application 232 associated with the transaction. Theuser interface screen 4200 can include additional or fewer user interface elements than those described in the example, however aspects of the disclosure including providing some kind of indication or notification to thesecond entity 1200 via thesecond computing device 200 when authenticating the barcode that is presented on the display of thefirst computing device 100 to verify the transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200 as described herein. - As illustrated in
FIG. 4 , after a successful authentication of the barcode (either by theserver computing system 300 or the second computing device 200), at least some of the information presented on theuser interface screen 4200 is extracted from the barcode and presented on the display of thefirst computing device 100. For example, after successfully decrypting the information included in the barcode (either by theserver computing system 300 or the second computing device 200), transaction details information can be extracted from the barcode and be provided for presentation on the display of thesecond computing device 200. For example, the transaction details information which is obtained from the barcode and presented on the display of thesecond computing device 200 may include one or more of the identity of the first entity (first user interface element 4210), an amount of the transaction (second user interface element 4220), the identity of the second entity (third user interface element 4230), the unique second entity identifier (fourth user interface element 4240), the status of the transaction and the date and time of the transaction (sixth user interface element 4260), and the transaction identifier of the transaction application 232 (seventh user interface element 4270). - For example, either the
server computing system 300 or thesecond computing device 200 can determine whether the barcode is authentic based on a decryption of encrypted transaction details information embedded in the barcode and by determining whether a first hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is equal to a second hash value calculated based on a digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. When the first hash value is not equal to the second hash value (as determined by either theserver computing system 300 or the second computing device 200), thesecond computing device 200 may be configured to provide an output indicating the authenticity of the barcode could not be verified (see, e.g.,FIG. 5A which illustratesuser interface screen 5200 displaying a message that an error has occurred when authenticating the QR code presented on the first computing device 100). In some instances, the barcode which is scanned may be an authentic barcode associated with a valid transaction, however the transaction may be associated with an entity other than thefirst entity 1100 or thesecond entity 1200. For example, where the barcode displayed on the display of thefirst computing device 100 pertains to a transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and a third entity, the second entity 1200 (which is associated with the second computing device 200) may not be authorized to view the transaction details information associated with that transaction. For example,FIG. 5B illustratesuser interface screen 5200′ displaying a message that an error has occurred because the user associated with the second computing device 200 (or associated with thetransaction authentication system 230 includingtransaction application 232 and transaction verification application 234) is not authorized to view the details of the transaction. For example,transaction verification applications FIG. 5B . -
FIGS. 6A-6C are example processes for verifying or authenticating a transaction between a first entity and a second entity, according to one or more examples of the disclosure.FIGS. 7A-7B are examples of programming syntax for defining messages regarding generating strings for transaction details information and for a digital signature, according to one or more examples of the disclosure. - For example,
FIG. 6A illustrates aprocess 6000 by which theserver computing system 300 generates a digital signature and calculates a hash value with respect to the transaction details information associated with a transaction between thefirst entity 1100 and thesecond entity 1200. For example, when a transaction is completed between thefirst computing device 100 and thesecond computing device 200, thefirst computing device 100 may be configured to transmit a request to theserver computing system 300. The request may be a request for theserver computing system 300 to generate a barcode which includes encrypted information, for example, an embedded and digitally signed string (e.g., a base 64 QR string) that contains transaction details information associated with the transaction. The request may further include the transaction details information or an identifier or link that corresponds to the transaction details information which theserver computing system 300 can utilize to obtain the transaction details information (e.g., from the transaction details information data store 380). In some implementations, theserver computing system 300 may be configured to automatically generate the barcode and transmit the barcode to thefirst computing device 100 in response to receiving an indication from thetransaction application 332 that a transaction has been conducted or completed which involvesfirst computing device 100. Atoperation 6010, the server computing system can obtain or receive the transaction details information from thefirst computing device 100 or from transaction details information data store 380. For example, the transaction details information can include time information concerning the transaction so that thesecond entity 1200 can verify a time or freshness of the transaction when the transaction details information is provided to thesecond computing device 200. For example, the transaction details information can identify the participants of the transaction including thefirst entity 1100 andsecond entity 1200 so that thesecond entity 1200 can verify that thefirst entity 1100 andsecond entity 1200 conducted a transaction, when the transaction details information is provided to thesecond computing device 200. For example, the transaction details information can identify the amount of the transaction so that thesecond entity 1200 can verify the correct amount of the transaction, when the transaction details information is provided to thesecond computing device 200. Other information may also be included as part of the transaction details information, for example, a unique identifier associated with the second entity, a reference identifier associated with the transaction and the entity which is associated with the transaction application that provides transaction related services, etc. - At
operation 6020 the server computing system 300 (e.g., transaction verification application 334) can calculate a hash value associated with the transaction details information. For example, a SHA-256 hash may be used to calculate the hash value. Atoperation 6030 the server computing system 300 (e.g., transaction verification application 334) can encrypt the transaction details information (e.g., using a private key). Atoperation 6040 the server computing system 300 (e.g., transaction verification application 334) generates a digital signature associated with the transaction details information. - For example,
FIG. 6B illustrates aprocess 6100 by which theserver computing system 300 transmits a barcode including encoded and encrypted information to thefirst computing device 100 where the barcode, for example, includes an embedded digital signature and encrypted transaction details information. In some implementations, the barcode may include an embedded URL that, when scanned by thesecond computing device 200, causes thesecond computing device 200 to access a web endpoint of theserver computing system 300 for the purpose of verifying the transaction via thetransaction verification application 334. - For example, at
operation 6110 the server computing system 300 (e.g., transaction verification application 334) obtains the transaction details information and the digital signature. Atoperation 6120 the server computing system 300 (e.g., transaction verification application 334) generates the barcode (e.g., the QR code) by encoding and embedding the transaction details information and the digital signature into the barcode. Referring toFIG. 7A ,section 710 includes example transaction details information regarding a transaction which can include various strings containing entity information (e.g., regarding a payor and payee), time information, entity identifier information (e.g., of the payee, for example a tax identification number), and a reference identifier concerning the transaction. Referring toFIG. 7B , information which is to be encoded and embedded in the barcode is included in two strings as indicated bysection 720. For example, the first string includes the transaction details information and the second string includes the digital signature. For example,server computing system 300 may be configured to convert the first and second strings into a barcode image (e.g., a QR code image). - At
operation 6130 theserver computing system 300 transmits the generated barcode image to the first computing device 100 (client-side). Atoperation 6140 thefirst computing device 100 is configured to embed the barcode in a user interface screen, for example as shown inFIG. 4 with respect to fourthuser interface element 4140. For example, theuser interface screen 4100 of thefirst computing device 100 may be referred to as a transaction details page that may be presented based on a user input with respect to thetransaction application 132 and/ortransaction verification application 134. - For example,
FIG. 6C illustrates aprocess 6200 by which either theserver computing system 300 or thesecond computing device 200 may be configured to decode and verify the barcode. Therefore, operations described with respect toFIG. 6C are applicable to either theserver computing system 300 or thesecond computing device 200 which may be executed by eithertransaction verification application 234 ortransaction verification application 334, for example. For example, atoperation 6210 an image of the barcode is received, for example via a scanning operation performed byscanner 280 which scans an image of a barcode presented on the display offirst computing device 100. In some implementations, the image of the barcode may be received by theserver computing system 300 in response to the scanning operation performed byscanner 280. For example, atoperation 6220 the barcode may be decoded by separating the content of the barcode back into the transaction detailsinformation 6230 and the appendeddigital signature 6240. -
FIGS. 8A-8B are example processes for verifying or authenticating a transaction between a first entity and a second entity, according to one or more examples of the disclosure. - For example,
FIGS. 8A-8B illustrate aprocess 8100 and aprocess 8100′, respectively, by which either theserver computing system 300 or thesecond computing device 200 may be configured to decode and verify the barcode. Therefore, operations described with respect toFIGS. 8A-8B are applicable to either theserver computing system 300 or thesecond computing device 200 which may be executed by eithertransaction verification application 234 ortransaction verification application 334, for example. For example, atoperation 8110 content of the barcode has been separated back into the transaction details information and the appended digital signature. Atoperation 8120 the hash value of the transaction details information is calculated to obtain a calculated hash value (e.g., using the same method implemented by the server computing system, for example, SHA-256). Atoperation 8130 the digital signature may be decrypted using a corresponding public key to obtain an expected hash value. For example, the public key may be stored at the server computing system (e.g., in certificate information data store 390) or may be stored locally at thesecond computing device 200. -
Operation 8140 illustrates an example where the expected hash value is equal to the calculated hash value, and the barcode is an authentic barcode. In an implementation by which the second computing device 200 (transaction verification application 234) requests theserver computing system 300 to authenticate the barcode in an online authentication mode (first mode), the server computing system 300 (transaction verification application 334) is configured to provide a notification to thesecond computing device 200 indicating the barcode is authentic when the hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is equal to the expected hash value calculated based on the digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. In an implementation by which thesecond computing device 200 itself authenticates the barcode (second mode), for example in an offline authentication mode, the second computing device 200 (transaction verification application 234) is configured to provide, for display on thedisplay device 260, a notification indicating the barcode is authentic when determining the barcode is authentic. -
Operation 8140′ illustrates an example where the expected hash value is not equal to the calculated hash value, and the barcode is not an authentic barcode. In an implementation by which the second computing device 200 (transaction verification application 234) requests theserver computing system 300 to authenticate the barcode in an online authentication mode (first mode), the server computing system 300 (transaction verification application 334) is configured to provide another notification to thesecond computing device 200 indicating the barcode is not authentic when the hash value calculated based on the transaction details information is not equal to the expected hash value calculated based on the digital signature used to digitally sign the transaction details information. In an implementation by which thesecond computing device 200 itself authenticates the barcode (second mode), for example in an offline authentication mode, the second computing device 200 (transaction verification application 234) is configured to provide, for display on thedisplay device 260, a notification indicating the barcode is not authentic when determining the barcode is not authentic. - To the extent terms “module”, and “unit,” and the like are used herein, such terms may refer to, but are not limited to, a software or hardware component or device, for example a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), which performs certain tasks.
