Definitions
- This specification generally describes techniques for analyzing web content, including user-generated web content.
- a web site or electronic community can host one or more types of electronic content that is created and/or uploaded by the users of the web site.
- discussion forums, electronic photo albums, and video sharing web sites provide users with the ability to post or upload user-generated content to share with other users.
- Some host web sites require each user to log in using identification information before contributing content. In this manner, the content may be positively associated with a registered user.
- users can interact with each other.
- a discussion forum for example, a first user can post a question or comment and other users can respond to the posting made by the first user.
- This specification describes techniques for weighting interactions between users in an electronic community and generating user credential scores based on interactions between users.
- user-generated content items e.g., comments to a blog or answers posted on a question answering web site
- the user-generated content items can additionally be analyzed to assess quality of input and identify individual interactions between users (e.g., one or more users uploading responses to a question posed by a first user).
- the interactions can be represented in a social, or user activity, graph having weightings assigned to directed links between pairs of users based on the assigned quality factors. These weightings and the corresponding interactions can be used to produce user credential scores.
- a search query is received, and a processor is used to identify user-generated content entries or items responsive to the search query and to rank the identified user-generated content items based, at least in part, on the user credential scores associated with the items.
- the identification of user-generated content items responsive to the search query can involve assigning a measure of content relevance for each item, and the ranking of the user-generated content items based on the user credential scores can involve combining the user credential scores associated with the items with the measures of content relevance for the items.
- the user credential scores and the measures of content relevance can be normalized, and the combination of the user credential scores associated with the items with the measures of content relevance for the items can involve combining the normalized user credential scores with the normalized measures of content relevance.
- a processor can be used to generate a user activity graph identifying links between users based on the interactions between users, to determine an authority score for each user, and to determine a
- the authority score for a particular user can be based on contributiveness scores of users with whom the particular user is linked in the user activity graph, and the contributiveness score can be based on authority scores of users with whom the particular user is linked in the user activity graph.
- the authority scores and the contributiveness scores are generated using an iterative updating process until the iterative updating process reaches a
- the user interactions can correspond to user-generated content on at least one of a question answering web site, a bulletin board web site, a blog, or a social networking web site.
- the weighting factor can include a combination of multiple quality factors, and quality factors can include a relevance of a content item by one user to an associated prior content item by another user, an originality of a content item relative to other content items, a coverage of a content item corresponding to a measure of uncommon terms in the content item, a richness of the content item, or a timeliness of a content item. Users can be rewarded based on the user credential scores.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving and publishing user-generated content for access across a network, storing user- generated content, and identifying interactions between pairs of users relating to the stored user-generated content.
- a weighting factor is generated for each interaction based on an objective measure of quality of the interaction
- a user credential score is generated for each user based on the identified interactions and the weighting factors for the interactions, and users or user-generated content based on the user credential scores.
- One or more servers can be used to receive and publish the user-generated content
- user-generated content can be stored in one or more storage devices
- one or more processors can be used to identify the interactions, generate weighting factors, generate user credential scores, and rank users or user-generated content.
- a user credential score for each user is generated by iteratively updating an authority score and a related contributiveness score based on the identified interactions and the weighting factors.
- a search query can be received, and multiple user-generated content items are identified in response to the search query.
- the identified user-generated content items are ranked based, at least in part, on the user credential score for a user associated with each user- generated content item, and a set of search results is generated based on the ranking of content items.
- the identified user-generated content items can be ranked based on a weighted combination of a measure of relevance associated with each user-generated content item and the user credential score for a user associated with each user-generated content item.
- the objective measure of quality of the interaction is derived from a combination of factors representing a relevance of a content item by one user to an associated prior content item by another user, an originality of a content item relative to other content items, and a coverage of uncommon terms in the content item.
- a particular one of the interactions can include an electronic response by a first user to electronic information posted by a second user, and the weighting factor for the particular interaction can relate to a relevance of the electronic response by the first user to the electronic information posted by the second user, a coverage of relatively uncommon information in the electronic response, or a relative originality of the electronic response.
- Quality of postings or other user-generated content can be assessed and used for purposes of generating search results, rewarding users for high quality input, or restricting access based on low quality contributions.
- Interactions or relationships between users can be evaluated to identify relatively authoritative or reliable contributors.
- Search engines can use user credential scores to generate search results.
- Search results can be personalized by, for instance, using a relationship strength between users A and B, along with the scores of user B, to adjust the relative position in which content created by, or related to (e.g., commented on by, replied to by, etc.), user B appears in the results of searches performed by A. Using such a personalization capability, the adjustment may be different for some different user C as a function of the relationship strength between users B and C.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system for ranking search results in searches of user-generated content.
- FIG. 2 is an example screenshot of a web page for a question answering electronic discussion board.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B are diagrams of an example user activity graph.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for generating user credential scores.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of another process for generating user credential scores.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of generating a ranking of search results using user credential scores.
- media content or simply “content” may refer to a single electronic document, a collection of related electronic documents which can include audio, visual, and/or textual components, or a portion of an electronic document.
- text, photos, or videos may be added to a hosting web site by a registered user to share with other (registered or non-registered) users.
- the quality and subject matter relevance of the media content supplied by users can vary.
- sites which host user-generated content provide a framework for users to interact with each other regarding user-generated content to produce additional user-generated content.
- a first user may post a question to a discussion forum and a second user may post a response to the question.
- This exchange of information between two users may be described as an interaction.
- Other exemplary user activities which may contribute to one or more interactions include submitting a question or answer on a question and answer (Q&A) website, posting a topic or discussion on a blog or online bulletin board, submitting a rating for content available on a website, or viewing new content provided by a first user operating a first user device (e.g., by a second user viewing the new content on a second computing device).
- Q&A question and answer
- a system and method for ranking user-generated content can provide a quality weighting of interactions between users in an
- Each user and each user-generated content item may be
- authority scores can be assigned to users based on an analysis of quality of responses to user-generated content and contributiveness scores of users who posted the content
- contributiveness scores can be assigned to users based on an analysis of quality of posted or uploaded user- generated content and authority scores of users who responded to the content.
- user interactions may be viewed as a vote of confidence, such that numerous interactions, particularly interactions involving particularly authoritative and/or contributive users, tend to increase the user credential score(s).
- the interactions can be represented in a social, or user activity, graph having weightings assigned to directed links between pairs of users (e.g., a link between the user who posted a question and the user who answered the question). These weightings and the corresponding interactions can be used to produce user credential scores.
- the described techniques can provide for one or more benefits, e.g., ranking user credibility to improve upon the overall community within the electronic environment. For example, a user who is abusing the privileges of the electronic environment (e.g., spamming or making harassing comments towards others) may be automatically discovered, while a user who frequently contributes to high quality interactions may be promoted or rewarded.
- the techniques may also be used to improve the ranking of search results that include user-generated content by providing a measurement of quality (e.g., topic relevance, contributiveness, descriptiveness, or reputation of the source of the content) associated with the user- generated content.
- Preexisting user relationships can also be used to personalize search results for the particular user who conducts a search, e.g., by increasing the relevance score of search results associated with users with whom the particular user has previously interacted (e.g., based on a combination of the user credential scores of the other users and the relationship strength between the searching user and the other users).
- the user credential scores (and any rankings based on the scores) can be different for different categories or labels associated with the user- generated content.
- user credential scores can be separately calculated for user-generated content relating to gardening versus user-generated content relating to dining.
- a particular user who participates in forums relating to gardening and dining can have different user credential scores associated with each category.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 100 for ranking search results in searches of user-generated content.
- one or more users operating user devices 104, can connect to a web server 106 and a search server 108 through a network 102 to search for, upload, and retrieve electronic content.
- the web server 106 and the search server 108 are each connected to an interaction processing server 1 10, directly or through network 102.
- the interaction processing server 1 10 can cooperate with the web server 106 to analyze user-generated electronic content and to derive quality measurements associated with the user- generated electronic content.
- the search server 108 can additionally collaborate with the interaction processing server 1 10 to augment search result ranking of user- generated content based upon the derived quality measurements.
- the computer network 102 e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the web server 106, the search server 108, and user devices 104a, 104b, and 104c.
- Example user devices 104 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, smart phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and television set-top boxes.
- search server 108 and one web server 106 are shown, the system 100 may include any number of web servers, search servers, and user devices.
- the web server 106 can be a general content server that receives requests for content and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the web server 106 may be related to a news content provider, a retailer, an independent blog, a social networking site, or any other entity that provides and/or receives content over the network 102.
- the web server 106 includes a user-generated content repository 1 12 and a user data repository 126 (e.g., each repository includes one or more electronic storage devices included within or coupled to the web server 106).
- the user-generated content can include the content items themselves (e.g., one or more files uploaded by a particular user) as well as metadata associated with individual user- generated content (e.g., a user identification, a reference to associated user- generated content, a category of the user-generated content, a date the user- generated content was uploaded to the web server, a tally representing the number of times the user content item has been requested/viewed, and the like).
- content items themselves (e.g., one or more files uploaded by a particular user) as well as metadata associated with individual user- generated content (e.g., a user identification, a reference to associated user- generated content, a category of the user-generated content, a date the user- generated content was uploaded to the web server, a tally representing the number of times the user content item has been requested/viewed, and the like).
- a user identifier can be created or a user may register with the web server 106 using a user ID and password.
- Each user may provide additional profile information (e.g., sex, age, location, email address, etc.).
- Data associated with each user can be stored within the user data repository 126.
- each user record can include references to user content items uploaded by the user to the web server 106 and stored within the user-generated content repository 112.
- the user- generated content stored within the user-generated content repository 1 12 may be provided by the web server 106 in response to requests from the user devices 104 through the network 102.
- the content available from the web server 106 can be searched using the search server 108.
- the search server 108 includes a search engine 1 14 and a search index repository 116.
- the search engine 1 14 can generated or access an index of the content provided by publishers such as the web server 106 (e.g., an index of web pages) for later search and identification of content items that are responsive to the queries.
- a user operating a user device e.g., user device 104a, can submit a search query to the search server 108.
- the search engine 1 14 can search for web content responsive to the search query within the search index repository 1 16.
- the search server 108 can then return search results to the user in response to the search query.
- the search results can include web content references (e.g., lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, or hypertext links to those web pages) that link to web pages available via the web server 106.
- Search results may be presented to users grouped in predetermined numbers (e.g., ten) of search results.
- the search results are ranked by a results ranking module 1 18 based in part on scores related to the content items identified by the search results, e.g., information retrieval ("IR") scores and optionally a separate ranking of each document based upon document relevance scores provided by a relevance scoring module 120.
- IR information retrieval
- the search server 108 can communicate with the interaction processing server 1 10 to obtain data applicable to the relevance scoring of user- generated content items.
- the interaction processing server 1 10 includes a content analysis module 122.
- the content analyzer 122 can analyze the content and interactions represented within user-generated content (e.g., the user-generated content stored within the user-generated content repository 1 12) and generate scores related to the relevance and quality of individual content items (interaction data) and the authority or contributiveness of each user providing user-generated content (user data).
- the interaction processing server 1 10 can store data
- each user e.g., within a credential data repository 138
- data associated with the content and interactions represented by the user-generated content e.g., within an interaction data repository 124.
- the interaction processing server 1 10 retrieves user- generated content collected by the web server 106.
- the web server 106 is shown as having a connection to the interaction processing server 1 10, in some implementations the interaction processing server 1 10 may have direct access to the user-generated content repository 112. In other implementations, the interaction processing server 1 10 stores the user-generated content in a temporary storage location or in the interaction data repository 124.
- the interaction processing server 110 additionally receives or has access to a portion of the user data records (e.g., user identifications and related uploaded content) which can be included within the credential data repository 138.
- a post analyzer 128 can analyze each user-generated content item, or post, to produce a quality value.
- a question is analyzed to determine its relevance to the forum topic, appropriateness of language (e.g., lack of profanity), and/or originality in relation to previously-posted questions.
- the post analyzer 128 can assign a quality score to each content item.
- a social graphing module 132 within the content analyzer generates a social, or user activity, graph representing the interactions between different users based upon an association between two users regarding a user-generated content item, e.g., a comment posted by one user to a blog posting by another user.
- the user activity graph can be constructed of nodes, representing individual users, and directed and/or undirected links, representing an interaction between the two users. For example, a first user may upload a question regarding the best pizza available in Atlanta Georgia, and then a second user may upload a response regarding a pizza restaurant in Atlanta.
- Each user would be represented by a node in the user activity graph, and the interaction would be represented by a directed link between these two nodes representing the second user's posting of a response to the first user's question.
- the user activity graph also identifies
- relationships between users that are based on other types of connections between users.
- user A may be a friend of user B, or user C may be interested in any content posted by user D.
- These types of relationships can be either explicit (user A declared that user B is his/her friend) or implicit (based on a history of many earlier interactions, content analysis, or the like, it is possible to infer that user A is a friend of user B).
- Interactions reflected in social or user activity graphs may also be based on such relationships.
- a quality weighting module 130 can assign weights to each link within the user activity graph generated by the social graphing module 132.
- the weights may represent the quality of one or both of the user-content items involved within the interaction (e.g., the quality of the question in relation to the forum or the quality of the answer in relation to the question).
- a credential scoring module 134 can analyze the user activity graph produced by the social graphing module 132 to assign credential scores to the users associated with the user-generated content items.
- the user credential scores can be used to represent the reputation or credibility of a particular user.
- the user credential scores can be based, in part, on the quality of the content item(s) provided by the user (e.g., as determined by the post analyzer 128) as well as the quality of the interactions that the user has become involved in. For example, when a user responds to a high quality question with a high quality answer, the interaction may positively impact the user's credential score. Alternatively, if a user responds to a question with a low quality answer, the interaction may negatively impact the user's credential score.
- the interaction may generate a more positive impact to the user's credential score than if the user responds to a question posted by a user with a low credential score.
- the interaction may generate a positive impact to the credential score of the user who posted the question.
- the user credential scores are calculated in part by using a Hypertext Induced Top Selection (HITS) algorithm that accounts for the weighted links.
- HITS Hypertext Induced Top Selection
- a user ranking module 136 can rank the users who have contributed user-generated content to the web server 106.
- the user rankings can be used to promote or reward users for contributing a large number of high quality content items. For example, the highest-ranking user(s) may be rewarded with gift certificates, prizes, or other incentive items.
- the top one or more users can be reported to the web server 106 where an indication of user status (e.g., "top 10", “top 100", “star contributor”, etc.) can be embedded within web pages which include user-generated content created by those users.
- the user rankings can be used to help in identifying poor quality users.
- the lowest ranking user(s) may be further evaluated as potential spammers.
- the user-generated content can be provided to the interaction processing server 1 10 where the content can be analyzed and scored based upon the quality of the contributions by the post analyzer 128.
- the user credential scores can be continually or periodically updated by the credential scoring module 124 based upon the addition of interactions to the user activity graph generated by the social graphing module 132 and the associated interaction weights calculated by the quality weighting module 130.
- the interaction data generated by the post analyzer 128, the quality weighting module 130, and the social graphing module 132 can be stored within the interaction data repository 124.
- the user credential scores generated by the credential scoring module 124 can be stored within the credential data repository 138.
- the results ranking module 1 18 can provide the interaction processing server 110 with the identification of each user-generated content item included within the query result list.
- the interaction processing server 110 can retrieve user credential scores associated with the identified user-generated content and provide the user credential scores to the search server 108.
- the results ranking module 118 can normalize the user credential scores and optionally normalize the relevance scores calculated by the relevance scoring module 120.
- the results ranking module 1 18 can then combine the user credential scores and the relevance scores to generate a ranked search results list.
- the information retrieval (IR) scores can be computed from dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a content item, and the ranking of the search results can be based on relevance scores that are a combination of the IR scores and the user credential scores.
- the search server 108 can then respond to the user who initiated the query with the ranked search results list. The user can select a result from within the result list to retrieve the user-generated content or other content from the web server 106.
- the web server 106, the interaction processing server 1 10, and the search server 108 are each represented as individual machines, in some implementations, one or more of the servers 106, 108, or 1 10 are combined within a single server.
- the user data repository 126 and the credential data repository 138 are combined within the same records which may reside within the same storage device(s).
- the functionalities of the post analyzer 128, the quality weighting module 130, the social graphing module 132, the credential scoring module 134, or the user ranking module 136 are combined in some implementations.
- FIG. 2 is an example screenshot of a web page 200 for a question answering electronic discussion board related to scuba travel.
- a user may access or register with the electronic discussion board to post a question related to scuba travel or to respond to a question posted by another user.
- the web page 200 includes a series of questions 202, each attributed to a particular user identifier 204.
- a last posted column 206 lists which user 204 most recently responded to the associated question 202.
- a total view column 208 lists the number of users who have viewed the Q&A exchange associated with each question 202.
- a total responses column 210 lists the number of responses provided to each question 202.
- a time column 212 provides the timestamp of the most recent response to each question 202.
- a search box 214 offers a user interacting with the web page 200 the opportunity to search the electronic discussion board.
- the web page 200 depicts a particular forum of a larger electronic community.
- the electronic discussion site may pertain to many scuba topics (e.g., underwater photography, gear recommendations, safety tips, etc.) with a separate forum devoted to each topic.
- a user may be presented with another web page including the full text of the question (if it was truncated within the web page 200 due to length) along with a series of answers related to that question.
- a user may also, in some implementations, select a user identifier (e.g., the user identifier techdiver 204a) to receive additional information regarding that user.
- selection of the user identifier techdiver 204a may launch an additional web page displaying profile information regarding the user techdiver 204a (e.g., location, sex, age, scuba interests, date registered with the electronic discussion board, timestamp of most recent visit to the electronic discussion board, credential scoring/ranking of the user, etc.) and/or a listing of each post (questions and answers) contributed by the user techdiver 204a.
- viewing of information by one user 204 about another user 204 can constitute an interaction that influences user credential scores.
- Each question and answer pair can be termed an interaction between the users who authored the user-generated content.
- the question 202b contributed by userheaded4mex 204b has been viewed 46 times, according to the total view column 208, with a total of eleven responses, according to the total responses column 210.
- Each of the eleven responses creates an interaction between the author of the response and the user headed4mex 204b.
- Users may be involved in more than one interaction.
- the user maddog 204e submitted the fifth question 202e as well as the eighth question 202h.
- the user cheapdives 204c in another example, contributed both the third question 204c and contributed the most recent response to the tenth question 202j.
- FIGs. 3A and 3B are diagrams of an example user activity graph 300 depicting exemplary interactions involving the users 204 registered to the electronic discussion board as described in relation to FIG. 2.
- the user activity graph 300 can be generated by the social graphing module 132 as described in reference to FIG. 1.
- a user activity graph (also referred to as a social graph) represents entities and interactions (connections) between entities.
- users are represented as nodes in the graph and interactions are represented as lines connecting the nodes.
- Each of the nodes and connections can be stored as objects or otherwise defined in a data structure stored on a computer-readable storage device.
- Interactions can involve communications between two individual users, e.g., a response by the user lobstahdive 204n to a question posed by the user yellowbcd 204m.
- a pair of users may become involved in multiple interactions.
- the users 204 are connected by lines
- the edge 302 within the user activity graph 300 represents this interaction.
- the user lobstahdive 204n and the user yellowbcd 204m are connected by three edges 304 representing three individual interactions (e.g., a question by the user lobstahdive 204n responded to by the user yellowbcd 204m or vice versa).
- the edges are directed.
- the edge 302 can be directed towards the user techdiver 204a from the user dive4fun 204j, the interaction being related to the response which was directed towards the question 202a.
- the users beachdweller 204g, underh2o 204p, headed4mex 204b and diverdan 204k are separated from the rest of the group of users 204. Any number of interactions can be represented between users within a user activity graph.
- the edges within a user activity graph can be weighted.
- a quality score can be associated with each interaction between a pair of users 204.
- the quality weighting module 130 as described in relation to FIG. 1 can apply weights (e.g., .3 or .5) to the edges of the user activity graph 300 based, in part, on quality scores associated with the user-generated content contributed by one or both of the users involved within the interaction.
- a default user forum_travel 352 is introduced to create an interaction between the user posting the new question and the discussion forum.
- forum_travel 352 and the user beachdweller 204g can be based in part upon the relevance of the question posed by the user beachdweller 204g in relation to the topic of the electronic discussion board (e.g., scuba travel). For example, a question posted by the user beachdweller 204g regarding inexpensive mail order prescription medicine may be awarded a low quality rating, while a question posted by the user headed4mex regarding diving the cenotes near Playa del Carmen may be awarded a high quality rating.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process 400 for generating user credential scores based, in part, upon interactions involving each user.
- the process 400 in some implementations, is executed by the content analyzer 122 as described in FIG. 1.
- Quality measurements associated with the content of user interactions are calculated at 402.
- the user interactions includes the upload of new user-generated content through the submission of a question or answer on a question and answer (Q&A) website or the posting of a topic or discussion on a blog or online bulletin board.
- Q&A question and answer
- Each user-generated content item can be evaluated to determine a quality score.
- the quality score may be based upon a number of factors, e.g., the relevance of the content item, the originality of the content item, or the level of focus of the content item.
- the quality score of a user-generated content item includes a collection of individual factor scores.
- the quality of a user-generated content item can be evaluated based, in part, upon the context in which the content item was introduced.
- a relevance factor is used to evaluate the relevance of a user-generated content item with relation to the topic of the website, bulletin board, or topic forum, or to the question to which the content item responds.
- a relevance factor is calculated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Another exemplary evaluation factor is coverage, referring to the generality or specificity of a posted content item in terms of the vocabulary employed within the content item. Coverage can be used as an indication of the level of focus of the user contribution.
- the coverage factor in some implementations, is measured using the inverse document frequency (IDF) of words within the user- generated content item.
- IDF inverse document frequency
- a user content item can additionally be evaluated based upon its originality. For example, a question posted to a Q&A website may be compared to other questions posted to the website or an answer posted to a Q&A website may be compared to other answers to the same or a similar question. In some
- the originality of a content item can be based, in part, on a comparison with other content items contributed by the same user. For example, a user posting a same message (e.g., spam) across multiple topics of a Q&A website may be discovered by examining the originality across all of the content provided by that user.
- the originality score in some implementations, is measured through, e.g., the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scoring method.
- the post analyzer 128 as described in FIG. 1 applies quality scores to user-generated content items.
- Links are identified between users based on the interactions between the users at 404. Interactions between two users such as a "replied-to" activity can be used to establish links between the individual users.
- a common type of interaction may involve a first user uploading new user-generated content and a second user responding to that user-generated content in some manner (e.g., viewing, ranking, rating, or uploading a new user-generated content response).
- the interaction is considered to be between the user and the website or bulletin board.
- links connect two users based upon an answer posted by a second user in response to a question posted by a first user, a rating posted by a second user in reference to content provided by a first user, or a comment posted by a second user in response to a blog entry posted by a first user.
- a virtual user e.g., node
- the bulletin board may be represented by a virtual user.
- the process 400 has a method for applying a quality score to the user-generated content and adjusting the credential score(s) of the user accordingly.
- a weighting factor representing the quality of the interaction is assigned to the interaction at 406.
- Quality scores related to the aforementioned factors of relevance, coverage, and originality, and/or other factors can be individually weighted and combined to generate a single overall quality score for the content item.
- the quality score in some examples, is a numeric rating (e.g., a value between 1 and 10 or 1 and 100, etc.) or a category rating (e.g., positive, neutral, or negative).
- the quality scores related to the individual quality factors can be weighted based upon learned coefficients and combined to produce a quality weighting.
- learned coefficients can be generated and applied to the individual quality factors based upon the relative importance of each quality factor in relation to the electronic community.
- the coefficients may differ depending upon the type of electronic community. For example, in some implementations the timeliness of a response to a user post is of greater importance than the coverage of a user post.
- the quality weighting module 130 calculates the weighting factors associated with the interaction links.
- User credential scores are calculated at 408.
- the user credential scores make an effort to quantify the value of contributions made by a particular user to an electronic community.
- a user may either contribute new content or provide feedback regarding content contributed by another user.
- Each role taken by a user can be considered separately when generating credential scores for the user.
- a contributiveness score can be assigned to a user based upon the quality of contributions the user has made to the electronic community (e.g., website, discussion board, forum, etc.).
- the contributiveness score represents a measurement of how many questions a particular user has asked and how much interest the questions generated among other authoritative users within the electronic community.
- an authority score can be assigned to a user based upon the quality of responses or ratings the user has made to user-generated content contributed by other users to the electronic community.
- the authority score may represent a
- the scores can be calculated in accordance with a time decay, such that older interactions have less of an impact on the weightings and/or the scores than more recent interactions.
- a modified version (as described in connection with FIG. 5 below) of the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm is employed to generate the contributiveness and authority scores of each user.
- the contributiveness score for a particular user may be generated by scaling and weighting (e.g., by the quality score(s) of the user- generated content item(s) involved in the interaction) the authority scores of the other users involved in interactions with that user.
- the authority score for a particular user may be generated by scaling and weighting (e.g., by the quality score(s) of the user-generated content item(s) involved in the interaction) the contributiveness scores of the other users involved in interactions with that user.
- a positive (high quality) response posted by an authoritative second user to a content item generated by a first user may increase the contributiveness score of the first user.
- a negative (low quality) response posted by a distrusted (spammer) second user may be discounted when calculating the contributiveness score of the first user.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process 500 for generating user credential scores (e.g., contributiveness and authority scores).
- the process 500 for example, is executed using a modified version of the HITS link-based ranking algorithm where the authority score for the user is used in place of the conventional HITS estimate of the value of the content as an authoritative source and the user contributiveness score is used in place of the conventional HITS hub score which estimates the value of the user as an authoritative reference.
- the modified HITS algorithm can also use the weighted links in generating the user credential scores.
- the content analyzer 122 (as described in relation to FIG. 1) can execute the process 500.
- a weighted user activity graph is constructed at 502. Based upon the interaction links derived within the process 400 (as described in relation to FIG. 4), with each directed link between two users being weighted by a quality factor associated with the user-generated content item(s) involved in the interaction, an affinity matrix can be constructed defining the weighted interactions between users. For example, the matrix element A(u h uj) can be populated with a combination (e.g., sum, weighted sum, etc.) of the interaction quality weighting factors between the first user u, and the second user u,.
- the user activity graph is generated by the social graphing module 132 (as shown in FIG. 1).
- Contributiveness and authority scores associated with each user are initialized at 504.
- a base value for contributiveness and authority scores initializes the system such that relative contributiveness and authority scores may be obtained based upon the neutral starting point.
- a random initial value can be assigned.
- the contributiveness score and the authority score are each represented by a vector equation.
- the contributiveness score for example, may be considered a representation of the user activity graph with the links directed in a first orientation (e.g., from the responder to the questioner) while the authority score may be considered a representation of the user activity graph with the links directed in the reverse orientation (e.g., from the questioner to the responder).
- the random initial values for example, can be obtained through a random sampling of content item quality scores.
- the initial values equal, approximate, or otherwise are based on values generated in a prior execution of the HITS-based algorithm (e.g., to update the user credential values after additional interactions occur).
- a convergence threshold is defined at 506. The convergence threshold can be used to define a stopping point at which the authority scores and contributiveness scores of each user have been calculated.
- the contributiveness and authority scores are updated based on the weighted user activity graph at 508.
- the vector scores can be calculated, for example, using an algorithm involving normalizing first each row of the user activity graph matrix and then each column of the user activity graph matrix.
- the algorithm is repeated. At the conclusion of each iteration, the change in scores between the previously calculated values and the currently calculated values is compared to the convergence threshold.
- the initialization and calculation of the user scores are performed by the credential scoring module 134.
- the user credential scores are iteratively calculated across multiple computer processors in parallel.
- the user credential scores are assigned at 512.
- the contributiveness score and the authority score associated with each user can be stored within the credential data repository 138 (as shown in FIG. 1 ) in association with the corresponding user identifier.
- the contributiveness score and the authority score can optionally be combined to generate an overall user reputation score.
- the users can optionally be ranked (e.g., by the user ranking module 136 of FIG. 1).
- the process 500 may be repeated as often as desired to update user credential scores based upon new user-generated content items added to the electronic community. For example, the process 500 may be repeated daily or weekly to generate updated user credential scores and, optionally, to update the ranking of individual users within the electronic community. In some
- the process 500 can be performed incrementally, e.g., by incrementally adjusting user credential scores after each new interaction.
- the quality of a new interaction can be used to adjust user credential scores (authoritativeness and contributiveness) for users in the vicinity of the interaction in the user activity graph.
- a propagation distance parameter can be defined to limit the propagation of score adjustments in the overall user activity graph. For example, a propagation distance parameter value of two can limit the incremental recalculation of user credential scores to nodes that are within two links of the link that corresponds to the new interaction.
- nodes representing users will not be impacted if those users have no interaction history with the users involved in the new interaction or with users within two links of the users involved in the new interaction.
- the social activity graph can be updated with the new link and the user credential scores for users within the propagation distance on the social activity graph can also be updated.
- the number of impacted nodes can be limited.
- nodes to be updated can be selected according to nearness to the new link and number of interactions that directly or indirectly link the node to nodes connected by the new link.
- the incremental calculation of user credential scores can be used to provide substantially real time user rankings or access to user credential scores. Even with incremental score updating, calculation of scores for the overall user activity graph can be periodically calculated for all nodes using the iterative approach described above to ensure that the incremental updates do not cause divergence from the globally accurate scores.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a process 600 for generating a ranking of search results using user credential scores.
- the process 600 may combine the activities of the search server 108 (as shown in FIG. 1) with the activities of the interaction processing server 1 10 to augment traditional search results ranking with user-generated content quality measurements.
- Quality measurements associated with the user-generated content items involved in interactions are calculated at 602. These quality measurements, in some examples, are based upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, relevance, coverage, originality, timeliness of contribution (e.g., with a quick response valued more highly than a slow response or vice versa), multimedia content, or rich media content.
- Links are identified between users based on the interactions between the users at 604.
- the directed links can correspond to the reaction of one user (e.g., posted response, ranking, viewing, etc.) to a user-generated content item (e.g., question, blog, multimedia content item, etc.) provided by another user.
- the interactions occur, in some implementations, within an electronic community e.g., a Q&A website, discussion forum, or online bulletin board.
- User credential scores are calculated at 606.
- User credential scores may include more than one individual score, e.g., a contributiveness score and an authority score.
- User credential scores may include a composite score such as a reputation score.
- the user credential scores may be calculated, for example, using the process 500 as described in connection with FIG. 5.
- the user credential scores are calculated by the credential scoring module 134 as shown in FIG. 1.
- the user credential scores are normalized at 608. In order to base search results ranking in part upon the credential score of the user supplying the content item, the user credential scores are first normalized to provide a comparison base between search result scoring and user credential scoring. In some
- the user credential scores can be transformed to a standard Gaussian distribution.
- the user credential scores are normalized by the results ranking module 118 as shown in FIG. 1.
- a search query is received at 612.
- the search query may be responsive to one or more user-generated content items.
- the search query in some examples, are submitted to the electronic community which contains the user-generated content items or to a general search engine. In some implementations, the search query is received by the search engine 1 14 as shown in FIG. 1.
- User-generated content entries responsive to the query are identified at 614. The responsive content entries, for example, may be located based upon keyword matching between the search query and the text of the content items.
- Relevance scores are optionally applied to the identified content entries based upon a first ranking method at 616.
- the search engine 1 14, for example, can apply information retrieval (IR) scores to the user-generated content entries to determine a first ranking of the items responsive to the search query.
- IR information retrieval
- the Okapi BM25 ranking function in one example, can be used to determine a relevance score of each user-generated content item in relation to the search query.
- the relevance scores are normalized at 618.
- the normalization technique for example, can be selected so that the normalized user credential scores from step 608 may be combined with the normalized relevance scores.
- the relevance scores can be transformed to a standard Gaussian distribution.
- the user credential scores are normalized by the results ranking module 1 18 as shown in FIG. 1.
- the identified content entries are ranked based on user credential scores associated with the entries plus the optional normalized relevance scores at 610.
- the type of user credential score employed is based upon the type of user-generated content item referenced by the query search result. For example, if the content item is a response to a question, the user authority score can be normalized and combined with the relevance score for ranking. On the other hand, if the content item is a question, the user contributiveness score can be normalized and combined with the relevance score for ranking. When combining the normalized user credential score with the normalized relevance score, a weighting to one of the scores can be applied.
- a weighting factor between zero and one can be applied to the normalized user credential score to represent the relative importance of the user reputation in ranking the user-generated content item within the query search results.
- the query search results may now be sorted by rank and returned to the requestor.
- the following exemplary equations may be applied to generate a single quality indicator.
- This quality indicator may be used as a weighting within a user activity graph illustrating the interactions between users.
