- personal scores of the music items stored in the data storage unit 130 are calculated. (Step 310 ).
- the personal score for a music item is determined based on the combination of user-specific (personal) music item characteristics and their corresponding weight factors.
- a music item characteristic refers to user-specific data associated with the particular music item.
- User-specific data, or personal item characteristics can include, for example, the user's 105 play count of the music item, the user's 105 last play date of the music item, the bitrate of the music item as selected by the user 105 during download/creation, the date the music item was added to (or removed from) a collection and/or playlist resident in the data storage unit 130 and managed by the user 105 , information on how frequently and with whom the user 105 has shared the particular music item, and the user's 105 rating of the music item.
- each music item included in the data storage unit 130 will have a plurality of different user-specific, or personal, music item characteristics.
- each music item included in the data storage unit 130 have at least one similar item characteristic.
- each music item included in the data storage unit 130 have different item characteristics.
- a weight factor is applied to each of the user-specific item characteristics for a particular music item.
- the weight factors applied to similar item characteristics are the same for each of the music items stored in the data storage unit 130 .
- the weight factors applied to the “play count” characteristic of each of the music items in the storage unit 130 is the same, qualitatively and/or quantitatively.
- the weight factors applied to similar item characteristics vary between music items.
- the weight factor applied to the “play count” characteristic may vary between music items, album, playlists, genres, etc.
- historical user data is used to determine a weight factor for each user-specific item characteristic associated with a music item.
- the weighting for a user's item characteristics may begin as the same weighting factor for each item characteristic.
- the weighting factors can be modified based on historical user data. For example, if a user has a greater tendency to select music items that were recently added, the weighting factor associated with the date a music item was added to the user's personal collection can be assigned a greater weight.
- an aggregate of all the weighted item characteristics for a music item is computed to determine the user-specific score for the music item.
- user-specific scores for every music item in the storage unit 130 are calculated.
- a public score for the music item is determined based on the combination of a public (universal) music item characteristic and a corresponding weight factor.
- the user device 110 can be used to determine both the personal and public score for the music item.
- the server 115 is used to determine both the personal and public score for the music item.
- the user device 110 is used to determine the personal score and the public score is calculated by the other user devices 120 and/or the server 115 and provided to the user device 110 .
- the public music item characteristic refers to public data associated with the music item.
- Public data referred to as public/universal item characteristics, is data representative of non-user/universal data associated with the music item.
- a public music item characteristic includes a universal play count of the music item.
- the universal play count can include the number of times the music item has been accessed at the universal music item collection on the storage unit 145 and played in whole or in part.
- the universal play count can also include the number of times an album associated with the music item has been accessed at the universal music item collection on the storage unit 145 and played.
- the public item characteristic can include a universal purchase count of the music item representative of the number of times the music item has been purchased by different users from the server 115 or directly from other users at the other user devices 120 .
- the public item characteristic can also include a universal collection count representative how many users include that same music item in their personal music library.
- the public item characteristic can also include a universal search count representative of the number of times users have searched for the music item or for data ancillary to the music item (album, artist information, etc.). It is contemplated that the universal search count can include the number of times the music item as been searched on the internet or on various media sharing websites (e.g., YOUTUBE®).
- the public item characteristic can also include a count of any mention or tagging of the music item on a social media site.
- a social media count public item characteristic can include the number of times the music item has been tagged, shared, or liked on a social medial site.
- each music item included in the data storage unit 145 has a plurality of different public music item characteristics. In an example embodiment, each music item included in the data storage unit 145 can have at least one similar public item characteristic. In an alternate embodiment, each music item included in the data storage unit 145 has different public item characteristics.
- a public weight factor is applied to each of the public item characteristics for a particular music item. For example, as an initial default, public weight factors applied to the public item characteristics can be equal so that no public item characteristic has a greater influence than other public item characteristics in determining a public score for a music item.
- a user can begin with public weight factors that are calculated based on the average public weight factors applied for other users. In such an example, if users tended to select music items with more recent release dates as compared to music items with older release dates, the public item characteristic associate with a recent release date can be more heavily weighted.
- public weight factors also can be modified over time to reflect a user's preferences.
- historical, non-user-specific, data can be used to determine an initial weight factor for each item characteristic associated with a music item. For instance, if a user demonstrates a preference for music items that are not in the user's personal collection, such as those stored in data storage unit 145 and not stored in data storage unit 130 , the public item characteristics can be more heavily weighted than the personal item characteristics.
- the initial weight factors applied to similar item characteristics are the same.
- the initial weight factors applied to the “social media count” characteristic of each of the music items in the storage unit 145 is the same, qualitatively and/or quantitatively.
- the initial weight factors applied to similar item characteristics can vary for each music item based on the genre of the music item or another item characteristic. For example, the weight factor applied to the “universal search count” characteristic may vary between classical music items and jazz music items.
- an aggregate of all the public item characteristics for a particular music item is computed to determine the public score for the music item.
- public scores for each music item in the universal music item collection stored at storage unit 145 are calculated.
- public scores may only be calculated for each music item stored in the personal music item collection stored at storage unit 130 .
- the personal scores and the public scores are combined to determine the rank of the corresponding music item. (Step 330 ). Using the combined personal score and public score, each music item is compared/ranked against the next and ordered from highest score to lowest. In an alternate embodiment, one of the personal score or the public score may not be calculated and the music item is ranked only based on the calculated score. For example, the network 135 may not be available to the user 105 and thereby preventing the user device 110 from receiving the public score for particular music items from the server 115 . In a further example, the music item may not be available on the user device and or the server 115 , preventing the personal score or the public score to be calculated for that item.
- the resulting ranking will be based only on the personal score. Similarly, if the music ranking application 125 does not have access to the personal score, the resulting ranking will be based only on the public score.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart depicting a method of ranking music items in response to a user request and user response data in accordance with certain example embodiments. Similar to method 300 , it is contemplated that any one of the music ranking applications 125 , 140 , and/or 155 can perform the described method of ranking music items, however, example music ranking application 125 will be used in describing method 400 .
- the method may be initiated based on a user 105 search request of the user's music database stored on the data storage unit 130 or a music database stored on the data storage unit 145 of the server.
- the user 105 search may be for a particular music item, an album, artist, song title, genre of music, or any other relevant music-related search request by a user 105 .
- method 400 may be used to rank the results based on the search query and provide the ranked results, from most responsive to least, to the user 105 .
- the music ranking application 125 uses historical data stored in the data storage unit 130 and/or the data storage unit 145 , determines the personal score for a music item. (Step 405 ).
- the personal score is based on the weighted aggregate of each of the user-specific (personal) music item characteristics associated with the music item.
- the personal score is calculated using initial weight factors determined based on historical user 105 data.
- the public score for the music item is then determined by the music ranking application 125 (or the music ranking application 140 ). (Step 410 ). Similar to the personal score, the public score is calculated using the public item characteristics and the initial weight factors determined based on historical public data regarding each music item. Using the combined personal score and public score, the music item is initially ranked. (Step 415 ). In alternate embodiments, only one of the personal score and the public score may be calculated and only one of the personal score and the public score may be used to determine a rank of the music item.
- the music ranking application 125 can receive a user's 105 search request for a music item. (Step 420 ).
- the user's 105 search query can be entered to search either the user's 105 music library resident on the data storage unit 130 , a public music library resident on the data storage unit 145 , and/or other user's music libraries resident on the other user devices 120 .
- the initially ranked search results are provided to the user 105 .
- the relevant music library stored on one of data storage units 130 or 145 or on the other user devices 120 are searched for the requested music item.
- a search results list of music items is returned which lists music items according to their initial ranking The higher ranking music items appearing higher on search results list.
- the user 105 may provide a response/feedback to the music ranking application 125 .
- the user's 105 response can include the selection of a particular music for purchase, download, or play, a user's 105 rating of a particular item's relevance in the search result listing, indication that the user scrolled through the search results, the user's selection and playing all of the selected music item, the user playing only a portion of the selected music item, or any other interaction with the results listing that would indicate a user's 105 preference, or lack of preference, for a particular music item.
- the weights assigned to each of the music item characteristics used in calculating both the personal and public score are adjusted. (Step 435 ). As described previously, the weights assigned to the personal and public item characteristics can be adjusted based on a variety of criteria including the user's preferences and historical data regarding the user.
- the personal score and public score are recalculated. (Step 440 ).
- the recalculated personal score and public score are then used to adjust the ranking of each of the music items.
- the adjusted ranking of the search results are then provided to the user. (Step 450 ).
- the adjusted ranking is provided to the user 105 during their initial search query.

Abstract
A system, method and computer-readable medium for ranking music items (songs, artists, albums, etc.) listed in a search result. The system may include a user database storing user-managed music items and a public database storing a universe of music items. A music ranking application configured to receive a search query, identify music items in response to the query, and provide a ranked result list to the user. Different characteristics of the music items are weighted to provide a score for the music item, the score indicating the relevance of the music item when compared to user data and universal data associated with the item. The weighted scores are used to determine the ranking of the music item and can be adjusted based on user feedback, resulting in an adjusted ranking of the music items listed in the search result.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to systems, methods, and computer programs for ranking music search results based on both user data and public data associated with a music item.
- Individuals typically maintain a personal music library on their home computer, mobile device, and/or remote storage location. Similarly, the Internet and various music distributors maintain vast music libraries. Searching for a particular music item (track, album, artist, playlist, etc.) is typically completed using a query entered by the user. Because a user's music library and a distributor library can contain a huge number of music items, locating a desired track, album, artist, etc. can be challenging.
- Typical search tools attempt to return search results based on search terms entered by the user, the goal of which is to provide relevant results based on the query. In general, the search tools accomplish this by matching the terms in the user query to a corpus of pre-stored data about the music item. Music items that contain the user's search terms are identified and are returned to the user.
- In an attempt to increase the relevancy and quality of the music results returned to the user, a search tool may attempt to sort the list of hits so that the most relevant and/or highest quality music items are at the top of the list returned to the user. Conventional methods of determining relevance are based on the contents of the music item or data associated with the music item. For example, the contents and associated data are compared to the terms of the user's query and the music items with the highest correlation are returned to the user.
- One goal is to return the most desirable set of music items in response to a search query. Thus, it is desirable to improve the ranking algorithm used by search tools and to therefore provide users with better search results.
- One aspect provides a computer-implemented method for ranking music items listed in a search result. The method may include identifying a personal item characteristic associated with a music item. The method may further include determining a personal weight factor for the personal item characteristic and a personal score of the music item based on the personal item characteristic and the personal weight factor. The method may further include ranking the music item based on the personal item score, receiving a user request for the music item, and providing search results containing the music item to the user sorted according to the ranking of the music item.
- Another aspect provides a system for ranking of music items, the system comprising: a user database adapted to store a plurality of music items and associated user item characteristics; a public database adapted to store the plurality of music items and associated public item characteristics; and a processor. The processor may be configured to identify a plurality of user item characteristics associated with a music item and a plurality of public item characteristics associated with the music item. The processor may be further configured to calculate a personal score based on a weighted aggregate of the user item characteristics; calculate a public score based on a weighted aggregate of the public item characteristics; rank the music item based the personal score and the public score; receive a query for the music item; and provide the music item in a search result listing sorted according to the music item rank.
- Another aspect provides a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions may include instructions for identifying a personal item characteristic associated with a music item, determining a personal weight factor for the personal item characteristic, determining a personal score of the music item based on the personal item characteristic and the personal weight factor, and ranking the music item based on the personal item score.

FIG. 5 is an example embodiment of a functional block diagram of a computing device. - The present disclosure relates generally to systems, methods, and computer programs for ranking music search results based on both user data and public data associated with a music item. While the examples provided herein refer to music items, alternate embodiments may involve other types of content such as books or videos. Ranking of search results may take into account information about the user, information about the music item, and universal/public data associated with the music item. The overall system providing ranked search results is described.
- In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive music items or other content from a server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a server.
- As used throughout the specification, music item is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable electronic media, work product, instruction, video content, document, computer-implemented instructions, etc. An example music item may include, for example, electronic media such as audio files, video files, image files, web casts, podcasts, etc., or any other form of information that can exist in a computer-based environment. For example, a music item can include an audio file including a song, an album, or any portion of a song or an album. The music item can include various types of data used to identify the music item itself. For example, the music item can also include information identifying the particular song, album, and artist associated with the music item. Example data can include a song title, an album title, artist information, song lyrics, album cover art, release date, a website associated with the artist/album/song, etc. The music item can also include supplemental and/or ancillary information associated with the song, artist, or album. For example, the music item can include a web site, a calendar or calendar entry, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a blog post, advertisement, or any of the aforementioned information.

The drives and their associated computer-readable media can provide non-transitory, non-volatile storage of computer-executable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for theserver 115. A number of modules can be stored on the ROM, RAM, hard disk drive, magnetic disk, or optical disk, including operating instructions for the servermusic ranking application 140. - As illustrated in
FIG. 2 , anexample operating environment 100 can include acloud computing environment 150. In certain example embodiments, multiplecloud computing environments 150 may be employed. Thecloud computing environment 150 may include one or more similar system components as theuser device 110. For example, thecloud computing environment 150 may include amusic ranking application 155 and adata storage unit 160, each performing the same or similar function as the corresponding components of theuser device 110. For example, the examplemusic ranking application 155 may facilitate access to music items and data stored in thedata storage unit 160. Similarly, themusic ranking application 155 may be used to sort and rank the music items stored in thedata storage unit 160. Likewise, the examplemusic ranking application 155 may be used to sort and rank music items listed in a search result of a search performed of thedata storage unit 160, theother user devices 120, and/or theserver 115. In such an embodiment, theuser 105 can access themusic ranking application 155 and the music data stored at thedata storage unit 160 using another device, such as a desktop computer or mobile computing device (not shown) connected to thenetwork 135. - The
example operating environment 100 includes anetwork 135 providing a wired or wireless communication system or device by which network devices (including devices includinguser device 110,server 115,user devices 120, and cloud computing environment 150) can exchange data. For example, via thenetwork 135 and using themusic ranking application 125/155, theuser 105 can complete a search for music items stored on theuser device 110,cloud computing environment 150,server 115, and/or theother user devices 120. In a further example, theuser 105 can preview, listen to, view, download, upload, or otherwise access music items via the distributednetwork 135. In an example embodiment, thenetwork 135 can include a telecommunications network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, an Internet, or any combination thereof. It will be appreciated that the network connections disclosed are example and other means of establishing a communications link between theuser device 110,server 115,user devices 120, andcloud computing environment 150 can be used. - The network devices (
user device 110, server 114,other user devices 130, and cloud computing environment 150) are configured to operate in a wired and/or wireless communication environment includingcommunication network 135. Anexample user device 110 and/orcloud computing environment 150 can communicate with theserver 115 and theother user devices 120 using various forms of wireless technology.

FIG. 3 is a flow chart depicting amethod 300 for ranking music items in accordance with certain example embodiments. It is contemplated that any one of themusic ranking application music ranking application 125 will be used in describingmethod 300. - In an example embodiment, personal scores of the music items stored in the
data storage unit 130 are calculated. (Step 310). The personal score for a music item is determined based on the combination of user-specific (personal) music item characteristics and their corresponding weight factors. - In an example embodiment, a music item characteristic refers to user-specific data associated with the particular music item. User-specific data, or personal item characteristics, can include, for example, the user's 105 play count of the music item, the user's 105 last play date of the music item, the bitrate of the music item as selected by the
user 105 during download/creation, the date the music item was added to (or removed from) a collection and/or playlist resident in thedata storage unit 130 and managed by theuser 105, information on how frequently and with whom theuser 105 has shared the particular music item, and the user's 105 rating of the music item. In an exemplarily embodiment, each music item included in thedata storage unit 130 will have a plurality of different user-specific, or personal, music item characteristics. In an example embodiment, each music item included in thedata storage unit 130 have at least one similar item characteristic. In an alternate embodiment, each music item included in thedata storage unit 130 have different item characteristics. - When determining the personal score for a music item, a weight factor is applied to each of the user-specific item characteristics for a particular music item. In an example embodiment, the weight factors applied to similar item characteristics are the same for each of the music items stored in the
data storage unit 130. For example, the weight factors applied to the “play count” characteristic of each of the music items in thestorage unit 130 is the same, qualitatively and/or quantitatively. In an alternate embodiment, the weight factors applied to similar item characteristics vary between music items. For example, the weight factor applied to the “play count” characteristic may vary between music items, album, playlists, genres, etc. - In another example embodiment, historical user data is used to determine a weight factor for each user-specific item characteristic associated with a music item. For example, the weighting for a user's item characteristics may begin as the same weighting factor for each item characteristic. However, periodically, the weighting factors can be modified based on historical user data. For example, if a user has a greater tendency to select music items that were recently added, the weighting factor associated with the date a music item was added to the user's personal collection can be assigned a greater weight.
- Once the weight factors have been applied to each of the music item characteristics, an aggregate of all the weighted item characteristics for a music item is computed to determine the user-specific score for the music item. In an example embodiment, user-specific scores for every music item in the
storage unit 130 are calculated. - Once the personal scores for the music items have been determined, public scores for the music items are calculated. (Step 320). A public score for the music item is determined based on the combination of a public (universal) music item characteristic and a corresponding weight factor. The
user device 110 can be used to determine both the personal and public score for the music item. In another embodiment, theserver 115 is used to determine both the personal and public score for the music item. In another example embodiment, theuser device 110 is used to determine the personal score and the public score is calculated by theother user devices 120 and/or theserver 115 and provided to theuser device 110. - In an example embodiment, the public music item characteristic refers to public data associated with the music item. Public data, referred to as public/universal item characteristics, is data representative of non-user/universal data associated with the music item. For example, a public music item characteristic includes a universal play count of the music item. The universal play count can include the number of times the music item has been accessed at the universal music item collection on the
storage unit 145 and played in whole or in part. The universal play count can also include the number of times an album associated with the music item has been accessed at the universal music item collection on thestorage unit 145 and played. The public item characteristic can include a universal purchase count of the music item representative of the number of times the music item has been purchased by different users from theserver 115 or directly from other users at theother user devices 120. The public item characteristic can also include a universal collection count representative how many users include that same music item in their personal music library. The public item characteristic can also include a universal search count representative of the number of times users have searched for the music item or for data ancillary to the music item (album, artist information, etc.). It is contemplated that the universal search count can include the number of times the music item as been searched on the internet or on various media sharing websites (e.g., YOUTUBE®). In an example embodiment, the public item characteristic can also include a count of any mention or tagging of the music item on a social media site. For example, an example “social media count” public item characteristic can include the number of times the music item has been tagged, shared, or liked on a social medial site. - In an example embodiment, each music item included in the
data storage unit 145 has a plurality of different public music item characteristics. In an example embodiment, each music item included in thedata storage unit 145 can have at least one similar public item characteristic. In an alternate embodiment, each music item included in thedata storage unit 145 has different public item characteristics. - When determining the public score for the music item, a public weight factor is applied to each of the public item characteristics for a particular music item. For example, as an initial default, public weight factors applied to the public item characteristics can be equal so that no public item characteristic has a greater influence than other public item characteristics in determining a public score for a music item. As an alternate example, a user can begin with public weight factors that are calculated based on the average public weight factors applied for other users. In such an example, if users tended to select music items with more recent release dates as compared to music items with older release dates, the public item characteristic associate with a recent release date can be more heavily weighted.
- These public weight factors also can be modified over time to reflect a user's preferences. In another embodiment, historical, non-user-specific, data can be used to determine an initial weight factor for each item characteristic associated with a music item. For instance, if a user demonstrates a preference for music items that are not in the user's personal collection, such as those stored in
data storage unit 145 and not stored indata storage unit 130, the public item characteristics can be more heavily weighted than the personal item characteristics. In yet another example embodiment, the initial weight factors applied to similar item characteristics are the same. For example, the initial weight factors applied to the “social media count” characteristic of each of the music items in thestorage unit 145 is the same, qualitatively and/or quantitatively. In an alternate embodiment, the initial weight factors applied to similar item characteristics can vary for each music item based on the genre of the music item or another item characteristic. For example, the weight factor applied to the “universal search count” characteristic may vary between classical music items and jazz music items. - Once the weight factors have been applied to each of the public music item characteristics, an aggregate of all the public item characteristics for a particular music item is computed to determine the public score for the music item. In an example embodiment, public scores for each music item in the universal music item collection stored at
storage unit 145 are calculated. Alternatively, public scores may only be calculated for each music item stored in the personal music item collection stored atstorage unit 130. - The personal scores and the public scores are combined to determine the rank of the corresponding music item. (Step 330). Using the combined personal score and public score, each music item is compared/ranked against the next and ordered from highest score to lowest. In an alternate embodiment, one of the personal score or the public score may not be calculated and the music item is ranked only based on the calculated score. For example, the
network 135 may not be available to theuser 105 and thereby preventing theuser device 110 from receiving the public score for particular music items from theserver 115. In a further example, the music item may not be available on the user device and or theserver 115, preventing the personal score or the public score to be calculated for that item. If themusic ranking application 125 does not have the data necessary to calculate or be provided the public score, the resulting ranking will be based only on the personal score. Similarly, if themusic ranking application 125 does not have access to the personal score, the resulting ranking will be based only on the public score. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart depicting a method of ranking music items in response to a user request and user response data in accordance with certain example embodiments. Similar tomethod 300, it is contemplated that any one of themusic ranking applications music ranking application 125 will be used in describingmethod 400. The method may be initiated based on auser 105 search request of the user's music database stored on thedata storage unit 130 or a music database stored on thedata storage unit 145 of the server. Theuser 105 search may be for a particular music item, an album, artist, song title, genre of music, or any other relevant music-related search request by auser 105. Based onhistorical user 105 data and historical public data, the music items in thedata storage unit 130 and/or thedata storage unit 145 will have a preliminary rank. Having received the search request,method 400 may be used to rank the results based on the search query and provide the ranked results, from most responsive to least, to theuser 105. - In an example embodiment, the
music ranking application 125, using historical data stored in thedata storage unit 130 and/or thedata storage unit 145, determines the personal score for a music item. (Step 405). The personal score is based on the weighted aggregate of each of the user-specific (personal) music item characteristics associated with the music item. The personal score is calculated using initial weight factors determined based onhistorical user 105 data. - The public score for the music item is then determined by the music ranking application 125 (or the music ranking application 140). (Step 410). Similar to the personal score, the public score is calculated using the public item characteristics and the initial weight factors determined based on historical public data regarding each music item. Using the combined personal score and public score, the music item is initially ranked. (Step 415). In alternate embodiments, only one of the personal score and the public score may be calculated and only one of the personal score and the public score may be used to determine a rank of the music item.
- The
music ranking application 125 can receive a user's 105 search request for a music item. (Step 420). The user's 105 search query can be entered to search either the user's 105 music library resident on thedata storage unit 130, a public music library resident on thedata storage unit 145, and/or other user's music libraries resident on theother user devices 120. - Based on the search request, the initially ranked search results are provided to the
user 105. (Step 425). In an example embodiment, the relevant music library stored on one ofdata storage units other user devices 120 are searched for the requested music item. Using the search query, a search results list of music items is returned which lists music items according to their initial ranking The higher ranking music items appearing higher on search results list. - Having received the initial ranked search results, the
user 105 may provide a response/feedback to themusic ranking application 125. (Step 430). In an example embodiment, the user's 105 response can include the selection of a particular music for purchase, download, or play, a user's 105 rating of a particular item's relevance in the search result listing, indication that the user scrolled through the search results, the user's selection and playing all of the selected music item, the user playing only a portion of the selected music item, or any other interaction with the results listing that would indicate a user's 105 preference, or lack of preference, for a particular music item. - Based on the feedback received from the
user 105, the weights assigned to each of the music item characteristics used in calculating both the personal and public score are adjusted. (Step 435). As described previously, the weights assigned to the personal and public item characteristics can be adjusted based on a variety of criteria including the user's preferences and historical data regarding the user. - Using the adjusted weights, the personal score and public score are recalculated. (Step 440). The recalculated personal score and public score are then used to adjust the ranking of each of the music items. (Step 445). The adjusted ranking of the search results are then provided to the user. (Step 450). In an example embodiment, the adjusted ranking is provided to the
user 105 during their initial search query. For example, the search results can adjust dynamically in response touser 105 feedback without requiring theuser 105 to enter a new search request. In an alternate embodiment, the adjusted ranking is provided to theuser 105 after another search request is entered by the user. For example, the adjusted ranking may be stored and used as a replacement for the initial ranking by themusic ranking application 125. - In an example embodiment, the initial and adjusted ranking of the music items can be used to target content to the
user 105. In an example embodiment, products or services relevant to music items listed at the top of the ranking may be identified as relevant or of interested to theuser 105. For example, based on the ranking, other music items may be suggested to theuser 105 including concert/event tickets, merchandise associated with the music item, and related and/or similar music items. In an example embodiment, advertisements for products or services may be targeted to the user based on the ranking - The example embodiments described herein can be used with computer hardware and software that perform the methods and processing functions described previously.
