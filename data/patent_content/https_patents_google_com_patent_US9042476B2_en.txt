- eNB evolved Node B
- CSI Channel State Information
- Option 1-1 The eNB configures two CSI processes.
- the first process has a codebook subset restriction that restricts the User Equipment (“UE”) to feed back the best rank 1 Precoding Matrix Indicator (“PMI”) and Channel Quality Indicator (“CQI”).
- the second CSI process has a codebook subset restriction that restricts the UE to feedback the best rank 2 PMI and CQI.
- Option 1-2 The eNB targets the first CSI process towards Single-User MU-MIMO (no codebook subset restriction).
- the eNB targets the second CSI process towards MU-MIMO (rank 1 codebook subset restriction).
- Option 2 The UE selects the best desired PMI and the best companion PMI corresponding to a co-scheduled user.
- Option 2-1 The UE selects the desired PMI and the co-scheduled user PMI jointly such that the desired Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (“SINR”) or sum-rate is maximized.
- SINR Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
- Option 2-2 The UE adopts a suboptimal approach in which it selects the best desired PMI and then selects a companion PMI that leads to the smallest co-scheduled user interference. This option has a lower implementation complexity.
- MU-CQI Multi-User Channel Quality Indicator
- the UE must evaluate a MU-CQI corresponding to each of the multiple companion PMI hypotheses.
- the UE draws the companion PMI hypotheses from a codebook subset that is either signaled or specified, so that the elements of the subset have a column space that is (quasi-) orthogonal to the column space of the desired precoder.

- FIG. 2 is a generalized schematic of a representative network entity or UE.
- FIG. 3 , FIG. 4 , and FIG. 5 are flowcharts showing procedures carried out according to embodiments of the disclosure.
- the 3GPP adopts a method for enhancing MU-MIMO scheduling efficiency that increases the number of bits required for CSI feedback, then it should endeavor to make the best possible use of those extra bits.
- This disclosure sets forth a device and methods for enhancing PMI and MU-CQI feedback that uses the additional feedback bits in an efficient manner.
- the UE computes the projection of the error vectors along the best direction e k,1 H v k,1 , e k,2 H v k,1 with respect to the chosen Single-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (“SU-MIMO”) PMI v k,1 and sends information regarding this projection to the eNB.

- the representative wireless communication network 100 is configured to use one or more radio access technologies, examples of which include an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (“E-UTRA”), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) 802.11, and IEEE 802.16.
- the network 100 includes a first cell 101 k , a second cell 101 j , and a third cell 101 c .
- First cell 101 k is managed by a first Network Entity (“NE”) NEk
- second cell 101 j is managed by NEj
- third cell 101 c is managed by NEc.
- Possible implementations of cells 101 k , 101 j , and 101 c include a macrocell, a femtocell, a picocell, and a wireless access point.

- Possible implementations of a UE include a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop, and a machine-to-machine device.
- Communication between a network entity and a UE typically occurs when the UE is located within the network entity's cell.
- each of NEk, NEj, and NEc can transmit signals to and receive signals from UE 1 .
- NEj would typically communicate with UE 2 and UE 3 .
- cell refers either to the geographical area covered by a network entity or to the network entity itself.
- the context in which the term is used indicates its meaning. For example, when a UE is said to be transmitting to a cell, it means that the UE is transmitting to the network entity that controls the cell.
- the term “cell” refers to the geographical area. In the geographical sense, a sector is a type of cell.
- a “virtual cell” is a cell that is created as a result of multiple network entities cooperating.
- a UE generally does not perceive any distinction between a virtual cell and a non-virtual cell.
- network entity refers to hardware and software that operates as part of the infrastructure of a network. Examples include an E-UTRA base station, an eNB, a transmission point, a remote radio head, a home eNB, a relay node, an IEEE 802.11 access point, and an IEEE 802.16 base station.
- a network entity can be made of multiple network entities. For example, two base stations can operate in conjunction with one another to operate as a single network entity.

- multiple network entities coordinate with one another, e.g., when using Carrier Aggregation or coordinated multipoint communication.
- the cells, network entities, and UEs of FIG. 1 are only representative and are intended to facilitate description.
- the network 100 likely has many cells and network entities and is in communication with many UEs.
- the network 100 is an LTE network, it includes many eNBs that control many macrocells. Many users move within and between those macrocells, and the mobile devices of the users frequently connect to one or more of the macrocells.
- the network 100 also includes a backhaul network 107 .
- the backhaul network 107 includes wired and wireless infrastructure elements that carry signals around various parts of the network 100 and among the cells. Examples of infrastructure elements include fiber optic lines and wireless microwave links.
- the network 100 also includes a core network 108 that controls the operation of the network 100 using various resources, including billing systems, home location registers, and Internet gateways. In an LTE implementation, resources of the core network 108 communicate with network entities over an E-UTRA network. The core network resources also communicate with other networks.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a configuration of a network entity or a UE (from FIG. 1 ) in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- the network entity or UE (“the device 200 ”) includes a user interface 208 , a controller 210 , a memory 220 (which can be implemented as volatile memory or non-volatile memory), one or more transceivers 240 , an input/output (“I/O”) interface 250 , a network interface 260 , and one more antennas 221 .
- Each of these elements is communicatively linked to one another via one or more data pathways 270 .
- Possible implementations of the data pathways 270 include wires, conductive pathways on a microchip, and wireless connections. Possible implementations of the controller 210 include a microprocessor and a computer. Possible implementations of the network interface 260 include a modem, a network interface card, and a wireless local area network chipset.
- each transceiver 240 receives data from the controller 210 and transmits Radio Frequency (“RF”) signals representing the data via an antenna 221 connected to it. Similarly, each transceiver 240 receives RF signals via the antenna 221 , converts the signals into the appropriately formatted data, and provides the data to the controller 210 .
- RF Radio Frequency
- the controller 210 retrieves instructions and data from the memory 220 and, using the instructions and data, provides outgoing data to, or receives incoming data from, the transceivers 240 .
- the controller 210 also receives data from, and sends data to, external devices via the I/O interface 250 .
- the network interface 260 is coupled to a backhaul interface. In such a case, the controller 210 transmits data to other network entities of the network 100 ( FIG. 1 ) via the network interface 260 .
- the antennas 221 belong to a set 223 of geographically collocated or proximal physical antenna elements. Each of the antenna elements has one or more transmitters and one or more receivers.
- the device 200 supports MIMO communication.
- the eNB performs MU-MIMO scheduling based on SU-MIMO feedback.
- the UE picks a wideband PMI that corresponds to the best rank (under the configured codebook subset restriction that is applicable to the CSI process)+CQI and reports it to the eNB.
- Release 12 with the introduction of Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (“PUSCH”) 3-2 mode, the UE sends both wideband and subband PMI back to the eNB using either the Release 8 (“Rel-8”)/Release 10 (“Rel-10”) codebook or the Rel-12 codebook. Additionally, the UE reports the associated CQI.
- the PMI chosen by the UE corresponds to either rank 1 or rank 2 if there is no codebook subset restriction.
- the PUSCH 3-2 feedback mode may be augmented by a MU-CQI (e.g., Option 2 or Option 3 above) if such feedback is adopted by the Radio Access Network Working Group 1.
- the MU-MIMO scheduler can pick up to four users for co-scheduling over a Physical Resource Block (“PRB”) group such that the scheduler maximizes the multi-user sum rate.
- PRB Physical Resource Block
- the scheduler is a hybrid SU/MU-MIMO scheduler, which co-schedules UEs only if doing so achieves a sum rate that is better relative to SU-MIMO.
- the eNB schedules only one layer per co-scheduled UE. This assumption is based on the practical limits of an LTE Rel-11 system. Thus, if a UE reports PMI/CQI under rank 2, the eNB performs a rank override (i.e., transmits signals at a lower rank than what is reported by the UE) and attempts to signal in a direction and with a rate related to the SU-MIMO PMI/CQI feedback.
- a rank override i.e., transmits signals at a lower rank than what is reported by the UE
- v k and v m are the optimal rank 1 signaling directions for the two users based on the SU-MIMO PMI/CQI feedback (possibly with rank override). Also suppose that the effective channels for the two users post-receive filtering can be written as:
- H eff [ g k H ⁇ H k g l H ⁇ H l ]
- g l H and g l H are the receive filters determined at the UE based on Maximal Ratio Combining (“MRC”), ZF, or Minimum Mean Squared Error (“MMSE”) criterion
- H k and H l are the N R ⁇ N T channel matrices.
- 2 are each a user Signal-to-Noise Ratio (“SNR”) derived from the SU-MIMO CQI report.
- SNR Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- the eNB applies a ZF precoder W based on the estimated effective channel ⁇ eff such that tr(WW H ) ⁇ 1 so as to reduce the Multiple Access Interference (“MAI”) as seen from each UE's receiver.
- the ZF precoding matrix can be written as:
- the UE feeds back SU-MIMO CQI under the assumption that the eNB signals on the chosen best direction.
- ZF leads to signaling for each user along a direction related to, but not the same as, the chosen best direction. Therefore, the eNB must take the SNR degradation due to forced ZF into account while allocating rate for each co-scheduled user.
- 2 and ⁇ l 0.5(1 ⁇
- the eNB can still attempt to estimate the post-receive processing SINR under different receiver assumptions (MRC, ZF, MMSE, etc.) and allocate rate based on that.
- MRC MRC, ZF, MMSE, etc.
- ZF precoder is designed based on quantized PMI:
- the signal received at user k can therefore be written as:
- [ s k s l ] is the signal vector that corresponds to the Multi-Level Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“M-QAM”) modulated symbols meant for the two users.
- M-QAM Multi-Level Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
- the post-receive processing SNR for user k that employs MMSE receiver can be estimated by the eNB as:
- ⁇ k ( MMSE ) 1 [ ⁇ d k ⁇ 2 ⁇ Q k H ⁇ ⁇ k 2 ⁇ ⁇ Q k + I N R ] ( 1 , 1 ) - 1 - 1 , which is clearly a function of a, b, c, and d.
- the total transmit power is normalized to unity (i.e., E[Tr(H k WW H H k H )] ⁇ 1 and the reported CQI corresponds to a SNR equal to
- the eNB does not know all of the terms needed for computing the a-d parameters, it is possible to bound them based on the SU-MIMO feedback and the codebook distance properties. Additionally, the UEs can provide information that can help in computing these parameters to the eNB.
- the a-d parameter can be written as:
- a 1 2 ⁇ ( 1 - ⁇ ⁇ _ ⁇ 2 ) ⁇ ( 1 - ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 2 + e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ k , 1 - ⁇ _ * ⁇ e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 )
- b 1 2 ⁇ ( 1 - ⁇ ⁇ _ ⁇ 2 ) ⁇ ( e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 - ⁇ _ ⁇ e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ k , 1 )
- c 1 2 ⁇ ( 1 - ⁇ ⁇ _ ⁇ 2 ) ⁇ ( e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ k , 1 - ⁇ _ * ⁇ v _ k , 2 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 - ⁇ _ * ⁇ e k , 2 H ⁇ v
- [ a b c d ] A ⁇ [ e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ k , 1 e k , 2 H ⁇ v _ k , 1 ] ⁇ x 1 + B ⁇ [ e k , 1 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 v _ k , 2 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 e k , 2 H ⁇ v _ l , 1 ] ⁇ x 2 , where A and B are two suitable coefficient matrices.
- Multi-Resolution Desired PMI Multi-Resolution Desianion PMI
- the UE computes the projection of the error vectors along the best direction e k,1 H v k,1 , e k,2 H v k,1 with respect to the chosen SU-MIMO PMI v k,1 and sends information regarding this projection to the eNB.
- the UE sends information pertaining to the projections e k,1 H v l,1 and e k,2 H v l,1 for a one or more hypotheses on v l,1 , back to the eNB.
- the UE sends explicit information pertaining to the projection v k,2 H v l,1 for different hypotheses on v l,1 back to the eNB.
- Another implementation avoids such explicit feedback by restricting the UE to reporting rank 2 PMI.
- the UE must report v k,2 (i.e., the second quantized direction orthogonal to v k,1 ) to the eNB so that the eNB can compute v k,2 H v l,1 for different hypotheses on v l,1 .
- the UE reports only the first quantized direction v k,1 (i.e., rank 1 PMI)
- the UE will need to report v k,2 H v l,1 for different hypotheses on v l,1 .
- the projection operations of the previous subsection can be decomposed into norm and direction feedback as follows.
- the UE can break down the processing into the following steps:
- Step 1 Compute best desired direction v k,1 .
- R-CQI Residual Channel Quality Indicator
- the table can comprise a set of squared norm values on the dB scale, i.e., 10 log 10 r k,1 2 such as ⁇ 0, ⁇ 1, ⁇ 2, . . . , ⁇ 8, ⁇ Inf ⁇ dB, where each value in the table can be represented as a 3-bit field, and where ⁇ Inf is the encoding used for squared norm that is below ⁇ 8 dB.
- Step 4 Compute the best direction for the residue by the maximization
- CB(1) is the rank 1 codebook.
- CB(1) can be a subset of the rank 1 codebook such that the codewords are (quasi-)orthogonal to the chosen v k,1 .
- the UE can obtain these codewords by referencing a pre-determined look up table.
- the eNB can send a look-up table to the UE through Radio Resource Control (“RRC”) signaling at the beginning of the data session, and the UE can make use of this look up table for CB(1).
- RRC Radio Resource Control
- UE feeds back the Residue direction Precoding Matrix Indicator (“R-PMI”).
- R-PMI Residue direction Precoding Matrix Indicator
- the UE can select the R-PMI to represent the direction vector that satisfies
- the UE can select the residue direction vector as
- the UE can perform the following additional processing.
- Multi-Resolution Desired PMI or Multi-Resolution Companion PMI can be applied to one CSI process or to multiple CSI processes. Furthermore, they can be used with rank 1 or rank 2 codebook subset restrictions.
- the eNB has configured two CSI processes. The first CSI process has no codebook subset restriction, and the UE reported feedback can be used for SU-MIMO scheduling.
- the second CSI process has a rank 1 codebook subset restriction and additionally, the eNB signals a field to indicate that the UE must report rank 1 PMI plus the error vector norm and direction for the principal signaling direction (Solution 1).
- Such signaling can be part of the CSI process configuration signaling or embedded within dedicated configuration signaling (e.g., RRC).
- the eNB can achieve improved ZF based on multi-resolution PMI. To do so, the eNB first improves the estimate of the effective channel as:
- the eNB can then compute the a, b, c, d parameters based on the improved ZF precoder and with Multi-Resolution Desired PMI or Multi-Resolution Companion PMI.
- both the ZF precoding and rate allocation can be made more accurate.
- Multi-Resolution Desired PMI improves rate allocation by the scheduler.
- Multi-Resolution Companion PMI improves rate allocation by the scheduler.
- Multi-Resolution Desired PMI is sufficient for improved ZF precoder construction.
- Multi-Resolution Companion PMI can additionally help improve rate allocation.
- a UE To provide error vector encoding according to one embodiment, a UE:
- u ⁇ arg ⁇ min u ⁇ C ⁇ ⁇ e - L z ⁇ u ⁇ 2 ;
- MMSE-IRC Minimum Mean Squared Error Interference Rejection Combining
- the eNB configures the UE within a single Channel State Information Reference Signal (“CSI-RS”) process to provide feedback of either SU-MIMO CSI (PMI, CQI, or Rank Indication (“RI”)).
- CSI-RS Channel State Information Reference Signal
- the UE sends a quantized version of the dominant eigenvector of the channel transmit covariance matrix, where the combined set of vectors from rank 1 and rank 2 codebooks are used for feedback.
- the UE selects the best rank 2 (or rank 4) precoder matrix. It then selects the best column within that precoder matrix—one that is relevant for rank 1 transmission. The UE then feeds the matrix and the column back to (identifies them for) the eNB.
- MMSE-IRC receiver can be viewed as a composition of three steps:
- maximizing the mutual information under a MMSE-IRC receiver is equivalent to minimizing the product MSE k,(1,1) . . . MSE k,(v,v) where v is the transmission rank.
- MU-CSI Multi-User Channel State Information
- a more appropriate criterion would be to select p k that maximizes trace (p k H H k H R z k ⁇ 1 H k p k ) or trace(p k H E[H k H R z k ⁇ 1 H k ]p k ).
- the UE receiver of user k applies a linear ZF that projects the received signal into the nullspace of the co-channel interference subspace (the interference subspace is estimated through neighbor channel estimation and through the knowledge of the neighbor cell precoder covariance matrix).
- a linear ZF that projects the received signal into the nullspace of the co-channel interference subspace (the interference subspace is estimated through neighbor channel estimation and through the knowledge of the neighbor cell precoder covariance matrix).
- an MMSE spatial filter can be used. If ZF is used, the user k applies the transformation u ⁇ k H y k where u ⁇ k H is chosen to be in the left nullspace of G ⁇ k P.
- the UE receiver feeds back the effective channel u ⁇ k H H ⁇ k P to the serving base station.
- this method provides gains only when the dominant cell interference (arising from cell ⁇ ) is much stronger than the residual co-channel interference.
- the ZF method leads to a loss as it does not provide beamforming gain. Therefore, in an MMSE version of the above procedure, the UE and base station iterate feedback and precoding operations respectively.
- each UE restricts the co-channel+Multi-User (“MU”) interference to a (M ⁇ 1)-dimensional subspace.
- Step 2 above can be accomplished with finite-bit UE feedback by using a codebook (such as Rel-8 4Tx codebook or Rel-10 8 Tx codebook).
- the receive filter is suboptimal to choose the receive filter.
- the feedback direction i.e., PMI feedback, is based only on the signal space.
- Rel-11 requirements mandate the use of a blind interference covariance estimator (e.g., based on first computing the residual signal based on DM-RS resource elements and then computing the sample covariance matrix in the subband of interest) while in the receiver of steps 1 through 3 the interference covariance is estimated parametrically by estimating the interference channel matrix and then making some assumptions on the statistical properties of the neighbor cell precoding matrix.
- a blind interference covariance estimator e.g., based on first computing the residual signal based on DM-RS resource elements and then computing the sample covariance matrix in the subband of interest
- PMI selection criteria can be adapted to take into account MMSE-IRC receiver for Rel-11 or DIA. Some examples are:
- P k arg ⁇ max P ⁇ CB ⁇ ⁇ min ⁇ ( R z k - 1 / 2 ⁇ H k ⁇ P ) .
- P k arg ⁇ min P ⁇ CB ⁇ 1 2 ⁇ ⁇ H k H ⁇ R z k - 1 ⁇ H k - PP H ⁇ 2 .
- P k arg ⁇ min P ⁇ CB ⁇ arccos ⁇ ⁇ U k H ⁇ P ⁇ .
- rank 1-2 or rank 1-4 precoders are pooled together as rank 1 vectors, and the vector from this pooled rank 1 codebook that has the smallest Euclidean distance (or equivalently, the largest inner product) with respect to the principal eigenvector of H k H H k is selected for feedback.
- rank 1-2 codebooks there are potentially 32 rank 1 vectors with Rel-8 4Tx codebooks.
- rank 4 codebook there are potentially 64 rank 1 vectors if Rel-8 4Tx codebook is used. This approach results in better spatial resolution relative to, say, just using the rank 1 codebook, which has only 16 vectors.
- This method can be easily adapted to finding the precoding vector that has the smallest Euclidean distance relative to the dominant eigenvector of H k H R z k ⁇ 1 H k .
- the network or UE can implement the following steps:
- the eNB RRC configures the UE within a CSI process to feed back either SU-MIMO PMI/CQI/RI or rank 1 PMI using rank 2/3/4 codebook columns as its search space.
- the direction quantization can use vectors from the rank 1 codebook that are (quasi-)orthogonal to the chosen ⁇ circumflex over (p) ⁇ k .
- chordal distance does not change under a semi-unitary transformation that maps a vector into a higher dimensional space.
- codebooks designed for maximizing SU-MIMO link throughput do not have this directional property, one can start with a codebook that is optimal in the sense of possessing pair-wise maximal chordal distance in a (M ⁇ 1)-dimensional space and use a distance-preserving transformation based on Z for obtaining a codebook in the M-dimensional space with the same distance spectrum.
- ⁇ u 1 ,u 2 , . . . ,u 2 B , ⁇ is a B-bit codebook in the (M ⁇ 1)-dimensional space with maximal pair-wise chordal distance.
- Forming a new codebook ⁇ L z u 1 ,L z u 2 , . . . ,L z u 2 B , ⁇ in the M-dimensional space maintains the optimal distance property and simultaneously yields a codebook in the space orthogonal to p. Therefore, once a UE chooses a dominant signal direction vector (rank 1 vector or the column of the rank 2 precoder that corresponds to the larger of the two CQIs), it generates a complementary codebook in the space orthogonal to the dominant signal direction.
- the complementary codebook is based on a codebook that has optimal distance properties in a lower dimensional space. The UE uses the transformed codebook for error vector feedback.
- the present disclosure shows two example codebook constructions in the (M ⁇ 1)-dimensional space.
- a 2 [ 1 / 3 j / 3 - 1 ⁇ 3 - j / 3 1 / 3 - 1 ⁇ 3 1 / 3 - 1 ⁇ 3 1 / 3 - j / 3 - 1 ⁇ 3 j / 3 ]
- a 3 [ 1 / 2 1 / 2 0 e j2 ⁇ / 3 / 2 e j2 ⁇ / 3 / 2 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 0 1 / 2 0 1 / 2 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 0 0 e j2 ⁇ / 3 / 2 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 0 1 / 2 1 / 2 0 0 e j2 ⁇ / 3 / 2 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 0 1 / 2 1 / 2 0 e j4 ⁇ / 3 / 2 0 e j4 ⁇
- a unitary transformation of the codebook leads to another codebook with the same distance spectrum.
- M and B For other values of M and B, one can use similar numerical searches to determining good line packings.
- the UE carries out the following steps:
- u ⁇ arg ⁇ min u ⁇ C ⁇ ⁇ e - L z ⁇ u ⁇ 2 .
- the UE carries out the following steps.
- the UE receives a pilot signal from a transmission point.
- the UE determines, based on the pilot transmission, a first channel direction vector.
- the UE selects, from a first codebook, a first precoding vector.
- the UE determines, based on the first channel direction vector and the first precoding vector, a representation of the normalized error vector.
- the UE sends a report to a serving cell based at least in part on the first channel direction vector and at least in part on the normalized error vector representation.
- the UE carries out the following steps in order to provide feedback in another embodiment.
- the UE receives a pilot signal from a transmission point.
- the UE estimates a first channel direction vector from the pilot signal.
- the UE obtains a first precoding vector from a first codebook.
- the UE determines, based on the first precoding vector, a first derived direction vector.
- the UE determines first residue vector based on the difference between the first channel direction vector and the first derived direction vector.
- the UE determines a first projection between the first residue vector and a second precoding vector from a second codebook.
- the UE sends a report to a serve cell based at least in part on the first projection.
- the UE carries out the following steps: At step 502 , the UE receives a pilot signal from a transmission point. At step 504 , the UE estimates the channel matrix based on the pilot transmission.

At step 508 , the UE determines a first vector from a first codebook that satisfies a set of criteria. At step 510 , the UE sends a report to a serving cell based at least in part on the first vector.

where |dk|2 and |dl|2 are each a user Signal-to-Noise Ratio (“SNR”) derived from the SU-MIMO CQI report.
W=C(C H C)−1,
which results in perfect diagonalization or zero MAI if the PMI feedback is perfect. However, the PMI feedback is quantized (often to four bits/wideband and an additional four bits/subband under PUSCH 3-2 mode), resulting in imperfect ZF that leads to non-zero MAI.

In matrix form, this dependence can be expressed as:
where A and B are two suitable coefficient matrices.
where CB(1) is the rank 1 codebook. Alternatively, CB(1) can be a subset of the rank 1 codebook such that the codewords are (quasi-)orthogonal to the chosen
where CB(1) is a subset of the rank 1 codebook as before. In one embodiment, the UE can select the residue direction vector as
The improved ZF precoder then becomes

This is similarly the case for {tilde over (v)}l and where {tilde over (α)}={tilde over (v)}k H{tilde over (v)}l.
