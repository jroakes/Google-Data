- the social network application 122 may regulate access to the content shared in association with the event.
- the social network application 122 may reference the event definition to determine access parameters and provide access based thereon. For instance, if the event definition restricts access to the shared content to particular users, (e.g., invitees to the event (explicit invitees, friends of invitees, users who heard about or walked upon the event, etc., invitees that actually attended the event and/or met an exemption requirement, etc.) the social network application 122 may limit sharing of the shared content accordingly.
- the social network application 122 may share event-associated content with an event invitee and permit the event invitee to share his/her event-associated content with other event invitees based on one or more parameters of the event definition, as discussed further elsewhere herein, such as the invitee's location inferred from the location of the invitee's client device.
- the social network application may determine if an event invitee is within the geofence associated with a given event by receiving geofencing data indicating such from the geofencing engine 124 and/or the data store 210 . In some embodiments, even if an invitee is not within the geofence or approaching the geofence, the social network application may provide access to the invitee to share and receive shared content if the invitee meets an exemption requirement (e.g., defined by the event definition). As an example, the social network application 122 may share event-associated content with a user as the user approaches or is within the geofence and stop sharing once the user leaves the geofence.
- an exemption requirement e.g., defined by the event definition
- an attendee who is driving to the event may be exempted to share content while en route with the other attendees or a group of the attendees (e.g., attendees belonging to a particular social networking group as reflected in the social graph 220 ).
- the social network application 122 may share the content in a variety of ways, such as but not limited to, by injecting the event-related content into each applicable user's content stream, by offering a content stream dedicated to the event that can be accessed the users and may include all content shared by the applicable event invitees, by messaging the event-related content using a messaging service (e.g., instant message, SMS, email, etc.).
- a messaging service e.g., instant message, SMS, email, etc.
- the social network application 122 may send the event-related shared content to the various instances of the location-aware client application 108 (or another application) operable on the client devices 106 of the invitees for presentation thereby to the invitees.
- the shared content may be included in a web page and/or or provided as a data object (e.g. XML, JSON, etc.) for processing and rendering by the location-aware client application 108 , although numerous other variations are also possible.
- the social network application 122 may include data APIs configured to provide social-network related content (e.g., social graph data, user data, content data, etc.) to other entities of the system 100 , provided the applicable users' have authorized such data access.
- the social network application 122 can adapt the sharing of the content between the invitees associated with the event based on dynamic changes made to the event, such as the duration of the event, the location of the event (e.g., changes to the scope and character of the geofence associated with the event based on the movement patterns of the attendees of the event). For instance, as sub-geofence(s) are derived off of the originating geofence, as reflected in the geofencing data stored in the data store 210 and maintained and updated by the geofencing engine, the social network application 122 can regulate the sharing of content between the users associated with the differing geofences (originating geofence, sub-geofence(s)).
- each sub-geofence may have its own access control list that provides users associated with that geofence to share content associated with the event privately between themselves or promote content to the originating geofence and/or other sub-geofence(s) derived from the originating/main geofence. For instance users of one sub-geofence can share content with another sub-geofence without sharing the content with a larger audience associated with the main geofence.
- the access control lists for the geofences may be managed dynamically by the geofencing engine 124 as it manages the geofences and sub-geofences.
- the access control lists may be stored and retrieved from storage (e.g., the memory 204 , the data store 210 ) by the social network application 122 and/or the geofencing engine 124
- the geofencing engine 124 includes software and/or hardware for creating, managing, and dissolving geofences.
- the geofencing engine 124 may use data provided by the social network application 122 , location engine 126 , and/or events planning engine 128 to create, manage, and dissolve the geofences.
- the geofencing engine 124 may receive the data provided by these entities directly or from data storage (e.g., the data store 210 ).
- the geofencing engine 124 may be electronically communicatively coupled to these and other entities to send and receive data.
- the geofencing engine 124 may schedule geofences for events planned using the events planning engine 128 .
- the events planning engine 128 may signal the geofencing engine 124 to schedule a geofence for an upcoming or impromptu event.
- the geofencing engine 124 may define a geofence for an event based on the parameters included in the event definition generated by the events planning engine 128 .
- the geofencing engine 124 may define the area of the geofence associated with the event using one or more locations provided in the event definition.
- the geofencing engine 124 may define the duration of the geofence based on the duration defined in the event definition.
- the duration may be fixed, dynamic, open-ended, reoccurring, etc.
- the geofencing engine 124 may access the event definition from data storage (e.g., the data store 210 ) or may receive a signal from the events planning engine 128 indicating such.
- the geofencing engine 124 may generate (e.g. create, initialize) a geofence for an event at a time corresponding with the start time of the event, as determined by the event definition.
- the start time of the geofence and be the same as the start time of the event, or maybe earlier or later depending on the preferences of the event stakeholder (e.g., the event planner or delegate thereof).
- event stakeholder may prefer to have the geofence active before the event begins so participants can begin communicating about the event beforehand, and may specify (in the event definition) a start time for the geofence independent of the start time of the event geofence or at certain time prior to the start time of the event. This is helpful as it can generate a buzz about the event beforehand and increase the probability of some invitees may be considering not coming to the event actually attend, thereby increasing the overall attendance and success of the event.
- the geofencing engine 124 supervises which users are within the geofence, and whether and/or when they enter and exit the geofence.
- the geofencing engine 124 may generate geofencing data describing which individual users are within the geofence and whether and when they enter and exit geofence to the social network application 122 so that the social network application 122 can share content based on whether event invitees are within the geofence, as discussed elsewhere herein.
- the geofencing engine 124 may store the geofencing data in the data store 210 as geofencing data 218 , for access and/or retrieval by it or other components of the social platform 120 , such as the social network application 122 .
- the geofencing engine 124 may access location data indicating the location history of the invitees including the invitees' current locations, which may be received, stored, and/or provided by the location engine 126 , as discussed elsewhere herein.
- the invitees' current locations may be inferred from location data captured by the invitees' client devices 106 and processed as discussed elsewhere herein, for instance, with reference to the location engine 126 .
- the geofencing engine 124 can divide a geofence into multiple associated geofences (e.g., two or more sub-geofences, a main geofence and sub-geofence, etc.). The geofencing engine 124 may also merge associated geofences (e.g., a main geofence and sub-geofence, two or more sub-geofences, etc.). In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may derive one or more sub-geofences from an initial geofence to accommodate movement patterns of the attendees of the event during the event, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.
- a user may create a sub-geofence (e.g., for a concurrent party or after-party) and the geofencing engine may splinter off a group from the originating geofence into the sub-geofence.
- a sub-geofence e.g., for a concurrent party or after-party
- the geofencing engine 124 in cooperation with the events planning engine 128 , may allow users to convert the sub-geofence into a separate event that is unassociated with an originating event and geofence and sub-geofences (if applicable).
- the event attendees associated with the sub-geofence may provide input instructions instructing the events planning application 128 , the social network application 122 , or another component to convert the sub-geofence into a new event that includes the event attendees that are within the sub-geofence.
- the events planning application 128 in cooperation with the other components of the social platform 120 , may generate a separate event and geofence for these users using the data (e.g., location data, geofencing data, etc.) associated with the sub-geofence and/or provided by the users for the new event.

- Example state changes include, but are not limited to, the start time, duration, and/or end time of the geofence, the users associated with the geofence (e.g., invitees that entered, exited, are/were within the geofence), the amount of time users were within the geofence, the area of the geofence, access control, etc.
- the geofencing engine 124 may maintain access control lists for all geofence types in a given geofence environment (e.g., originating geofence, sub-geofences derived therefrom, etc.). In some embodiments, these access control lists allow the geofence and sub-geofence(s) to have their own access control levels, which in-turn provides users customized control in sharing content. For instance, users may elect to share content locally within their own sub-geofence, across specific sub-geofences, across the entire geofence environment, etc. As a further example, users can restrict sharing content to users within the sub-geofence, allow the shared content to be included in the originating geofence, allow for an unrestricted/unregulated sharing across geofences, etc.
- these access control lists allow the geofence and sub-geofence(s) to have their own access control levels, which in-turn provides users customized control in sharing content. For instance, users may elect to share content locally within their own sub-geofence, across specific sub-ge
- a user can elect to remove themselves from a current sub-geofence and join another sub-geofence, the originating geofence, a different geofence, etc.
- the geofencing engine 124 may store and manipulate the access control lists in data storage (e.g., data store 210 ) with the geofencing data 218 .

For instance, for a family party, the event planner may select a social network group that includes that user's family members instead of having to select each individual separately.
- the events planning application 128 may use the social graph data to notify the invitees of the event.
- the social graph data may include the invitees' electronic contact information (e.g., SMS phone number, email address, social network address, etc.) and the events planning application 128 may use this information to notify the invitees about the event and request confirmation to the event.

- the user may use the location-aware client application 108 , or another application operable by the client device 106 , to input the event definition.
- the client device 106 may transmit data describing the event definition to the events planning application 128 , which may process and store the event definition in association with the user in the data store 210 as event data 212 , and/or provide the event definition to one or more other components, such as the social network application 122 , the geofencing engine 124 , and/or the location engine 126 , as described elsewhere herein.
- the events planning application 128 may process and store the event definition in association with the user in the data store 210 as event data 212 , and/or provide the event definition to one or more other components, such as the social network application 122 , the geofencing engine 124 , and/or the location engine 126 , as described elsewhere herein.
- the method 400 generates an event geofence associated with the location of the event described by the event definition.
- the event geofence may be generated by the geofencing engine 124 to persist for a duration that corresponds to the duration of the event.
- the event geofence may persist for the same duration as the event, may be defined to begin and end at a certain time prior to or after the start and end time of the event, may have a dynamic duration that adapts to the evolution of the event (e.g., start as a critical mass of attendees arrive at the site of the event and/or end as the critical mass leaves the event), etc.
- an event may originally be defined to end at a certain time but because there are attendees who are still at the event, the geofencing engine 124 may extend the event to allow those users to continue to share content.
- the events planning application 128 or other component of the social platform 120 may notify an event organizer and/or a delegate thereof that the event is due to end and ask whether the event should be extended.
- the event organizer and/or the delegate may extend the event by providing a corresponding input into an associated user interface, which the geofencing engine 124 may receive and thereby use to extend the persistence of the geofence and the social network application 122 may allow the users associated with the event to continue sharing content privately with one another.
- the geofencing engine 124 may provide location data to or may store location data in the data store 210 for retrieval by the social network application 122 that indicates to the social network application 122 which geofence a particular user is associated with.
- the method 400 may privately share content between attendees of the event that are located within the event geofence or within a certain proximity to the geofence.
- the geofencing engine 124 or another component of the system 100 such as the location-aware client application 108 or the social network application 122 , may determine which invitees have entered the geofence based on a user's location data based on location data associated with that user or an exemption requirement. If so, those invitees are considered event attendees and the social network application 122 may share content between them.
- attendees must be within a geographic area/perimeter of the geofence. For example, if the location of the event is a particular restaurant, the geofence covers the area of the restaurant (e.g., the parking lot, the building, etc.) and the attendees must be within that area to receive content shared by other attendees. In some embodiments, the geofence may cover multiple locations.
- an event defined by a user may include more than one location (e.g., at various locations within a particular city or state, a locations in different states or countries (e.g., New York and Los Angeles)) and the geofence area may cover those locations to allow users in attendance of the event to automatically share content even though they are attending in multiple locations.
- a location e.g., at various locations within a particular city or state, a locations in different states or countries (e.g., New York and Los Angeles)
- the geofence area may cover those locations to allow users in attendance of the event to automatically share content even though they are attending in multiple locations.
- an attendee that is not specifically within the geofence area may still receive and or share content with the other attendees that are within the geofence area if that attendee meets one or more exemption requirements.
- the exemption requirements may include, but are not limited to, that the attendee confirmed that he/she is attending the event, the attendee is en route to the event, that the attendee opted to attend the event virtually, etc.
- the scope of the sharing may be limited to just those users currently in attendance of the event and when a given attendee who is within the geofence leaves the geofence, the social network application 122 may cut that user off from receiving further content from other attendees. In some cases, the user may no longer be able to access any content that was shared until the user re-enters the geofence.
- an event definition may specify which users have access to the content being shared by the invitees and for what duration access to the content is granted.
- the sharing may be constrained by certain event parameters, and only allow certain people (e.g., confirmed attendees, specific confirmed attendees specified by a user, etc.) within the geofence to share content for the duration of the event, although numerous other variations are also possible.
- users can configure the social network application 122 to automatically start sharing a user's photos associated with the event once the user has entered the geofence and automatically stop sharing the photos once the user has exited the geofence.
- any type of digital content may additionally or alternatively be shared, such but not limited to as status updates, location, social network posts, videos, news articles, links to web-based content, files, etc.
- an invitee may initially receive content shared in associated with the event (e.g., for a certain period of time) but may eventually be cut off if he/she doesn't eventually enter the geofence area (e.g., within a certain timeframe).
- an invitee may be incapable of physically attending one of the event locations (e.g., may be deployed in a remote region) and the event definition may allow that user to indicate that he/she will be attending the event virtually. This allows that user to participate in/virtually attend the event even though he/she is unable to physically be at the event.
- location data may be captured by the user's client device 106 and then compared by the geofencing engine 124 or another component, such as the location-aware client application 108 , to the geofence area and/or exemption requirements to determine whether the user is allowed to share content with other attendees of the event.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example method 500 for creating an event and scheduling an associated geofence.
- the method 500 receives an event definition and in block 504 determines one or more event parameters describing one or more locations, an event duration, and/or or more invitees from the event definition.
- the method 500 notifies the invitees about the event.
- the events planning application 128 receives and processes the event definition and invites the invitees to the event. For example, the events planning application 128 notifies each of the invitees defined in the event definition about the event and asks the invitees to RSVP for the event (e.g., by providing input indicating that the invitee will be attending, is tentatively planning to attend, or is not planning to attend).
- the events planning application 128 notifies an invitee by injecting a notification into that invitee's social network content stream hosted by the social network application 122 , sending the invitees notification via a messaging system provided by the social network application 122 , sending the invitee a notification via an electronic message, such as a message sent through a messaging system provided by the social network application 122 , an electronic message (e.g., e-mail, SMS, instant message, microblog, another social network, voice message, etc.) sent by another messaging system, such as one provided by the social platform 120 or a third-party application 136 executable by a third-party server 134 .

- the confirmation may be provided in response to selecting a corresponding user interface element indicating that the invitee will be attending.
- the invitee may select a “yes” button provided in association with the notification that was injected into the invitee's social network content stream or presented in association therewith.
- the confirmation may be received in an electronic message (e.g., e-mail, SMS, instant message, microblog, another social network, voice message, etc.) sent in response to the invitation.
- the invitation may include an electronic link (e.g., a hyperlink), and the user may select the electronic link and then fill out and submit a form provided responsive to the link selection. Numerous other variations are also possible.
- event planning application 128 may store the confirmations in the data store 210 as event data 212 .
- the events planning application 128 may store the confirmations in association with an electronic record that reflects the event definition including the parameters of the event.
- the method 500 may schedule a geofencing for the event based on one or more of the event parameters.
- the geofencing engine 124 may schedule the geofencing to persist for a duration to corresponds to the duration of the event and to have a perimeter to corresponds to the one or more locations included in the event.
- the geofence may be stored as geofence data 218 in the data store 210 , cached, client-side to the client devices 106 of the invitees, for reference once the geofence is scheduled to become active, and the event to begin.
- the events planning application 128 , the geofencing engine 124 , or another may associate the geofence with the invitees of the event so that when the invitees enter or exit the geofence, their presence or absence may be identified.
- an invitee is associated with the geofence once the invitee has confirmed attendance.
- all invitees may be associated with the geofence so that any invitees that did not confirm attendance but ended up showing up may still participate in the event and share content. Additional variations are also possible and contemplated.
- the event stakeholder may instruct the events planning application 128 to notify the invitees of the event (e.g., by selecting an invite button on a user interface that includes form fields for specifying the event parameters).
- the events planning application 128 may notify the invitees of the event by sending them an invitation to the event using any available electronic notification mechanism, such as posting an electronic invitation including the event details or a link thereto to the users' social network content stream, sending the users an electronic invitation or a link thereto (e.g., email, SMS, instant message, proprietary messaging mechanism, etc.), placing an automated call and/or leaving an automated voice message, etc.
- an invitee may confirm attendance by selecting an appropriate option in an associated user interface. As users confirm attendance, the event creator, coordinator, etc., may be notified via electronic message and/or may monitor such by viewing event-related information in an associated user interface.

- the social network application 122 may permit qualifying users associated with the event, such as those within the geofence area and meeting one or more exemption requirements, to share content with one another.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an example method 700 for managing content sharing based on user location.
- the method 700 receives a request from a client device 106 of an event invitee to receive or share content privately with other invitees to the event.
- the social network application 122 may receive the content request.
- the method 700 determines location of the client device 106 associated with the requesting invitee and then, in block 706 , whether the client device 106 of the invitee is within the area of the event geofence, e.g., by comparing the client device 106 location to the area. By doing so, the method 700 can reliably verify whether the invitee is in attendance of the event.
- the geofencing engine 124 and/or the location-aware client application 108 may provide geofencing data to the social network application 122 indicating whether the user is located within the geofence, and the social network application 122 may use the geofencing data to determine whether to provide access to the invitee to receive or share content in association with the event, as discussed further below.
- the method 700 provides access in block 710 to the invitee to receive or share content with the other invitees within the geofence (also in attendance). If the invitee is not determined to be within the geofence area, the method 700 may determine in block 708 , based on the location data of the client device 106 of the invitee, whether the client device 106 of the invitee is approaching the geofence area. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 receive location data from the location engine 126 and/or the data store 210 and determine whether the invitee is approaching the geofence area based thereon.

- the geofencing engine 124 and/or the location-aware client application 108 may determine that invitee is approaching geofence by receiving location data from the client device 106 overtime showing the progression (e.g., movement of the client device 106 ) toward the geofence.
- the location engine 126 may receive location data from the client device 106 and store the location data in the data store 210 for retrieval by the geofencing engine 124 and/or may provide the location directly to the geofencing engine 124 .
- the method 700 determines that the client device 106 of the invitee is not approaching geofence area, the method 700 proceeds to block 712 where it determines whether the client device 106 of the invitee is associated with (e.g., within) a sub-geofence derived from the main event geofence (or another sub-geofence also derived from the main event geofence), as discussed elsewhere herein. If so, the method 700 determines an access level for the share request received from the invitee in block 716 and then provides access to the invitee to receive or share content in association with a sub-geofence and/or the main event geofence commensurate with the access level in block 718 .
- the access level may be defined by the requester and/or one or more other users also associated with a sub-geofence (e.g., located within the sub-geofence as indicated by the location data determined by their client devices 106 ). In some embodiments, the access level may be automatically determined based on whether the user's client device 106 is located within the sub-geofence. Further variations are also possible and contemplated.
- Allowing users to attend the event and share content via a sub-geofence is advantageous because it, for example, allows users who are within a certain proximity of one another to only share content with each other if desired. In further examples, it also allows users of the sub-geofence to push some relevant content up to the other attendees within the main-geofence while preserving other relevant content for just those users who are within the sub-geofence.
- the method 700 determines that the client device 106 of the invitee is not associated with a sub-geofence, the method 700 in block 714 denies the content request received from the invitee.

- a small group of friends that are attending a party at a nightclub left to go to a pub down the street to get drinks and some food.
- the geofencing engine 124 may determine that this group of friends left the main group of party attendees at the nightclub and went to the pub based on the movement data of this group of friends.

- the method 800 is advantageous because, for instance, it allows users who are attending an event flexibility to continue sharing content as the event evolves. For example, attendees of the event may continue sharing content as they migrate from the original location of the event to other locations.

Abstract
Various embodiments for event-based information sharing are disclosed. In one example embodiment, an event definition describing an event is determined. An event geofence associated with a location of the event is generated and content is shared between invitees attending the event and located within an area of the event geofence.
Description
The present disclosure relates to electronic communication. In particular, the present disclosure relates to event-based content sharing using geofencing.
Using some current solutions, it can be challenging to share content (e.g., location, photos, text, etc.) securely between private groups of people at an event who have a shared investment in accessing that content. This problem is particularly prominent when the people are on the go and are taking part of a shared event. For instance, an event may take place at a specific location and at a specific time, such as a party in downtown San Francisco. Using these solutions, there is no integrated way to determine the location of those who have confirmed that they will be attending. This can cause a problem for those who are running late or are lost because they might not be able to locate where the group is, especially if the event is a roaming event. Or conversely, it can be difficult for the event coordinator to gauge how far a specific person is from the event location without having to call that person.
According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system includes one or more processors and one or more memories storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to perform operations including determining an event definition describing an event; generating an event geofence associated with a location of the event; and sharing content between invitees attending the event and located within an area of the event geofence.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that determining, using one or more computing devices, an event definition describing an event; generating an event geofence, using the one or more computing devices, associated with a location of the event; and sharing, using the one or more computing devices, content between invitees attending the event and located within an area of the event geofence.
Other embodiments of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features, such as that determining the event definition includes receiving the event definition from a client device of an event stakeholder, the event definition including the location for the event, a duration for the event, and the invitees; that generating the event geofence includes initializing the event geofence to persist for a duration corresponding to the duration of the event; that sharing content between the invitees attending the event includes verifying that the invitees are within the area of the geofence; receiving, using the one or more computing devices, a request from an invitee included in the event definition that has not yet arrived to the event; determining, using the one or more computing devices, that a client device of the invitee is approaching the area of the geofence; providing, using the one or more computing devices, access to the invitee to share content with other invitees attending the event and located within the area of the geofence responsive to determining that the client device of the invitee is approaching the area of the geofence; creating, using the one or more computing devices, a sub-geofence from the geofence for a sub-group of the invitees in attendance of the event that have moved to a location distinct from a location of the event covered by the area of the geofence; receiving, using the or more computing devices, a content share request from an invitee; determining, using the one or more computing devices, that a client device of the invitee is within an area of the sub-geofence created from the event geofence; determining, using the one or more computing devices, an access level for the content share request; providing, using the one or more computing devices, access to the invitee to share content with other invitees associated with the sub-geofence or the event geofence based on the access level; determining, using the one or more computing devices, the invitees associated with the geofence are migrating to a new location different from the location defined in the event; and dynamically updating, using the one or more computing devices, the area of the geofence to include the new location.
It should be understood, however, that this list of features is provided by way of example and is not all-inclusive, as many additional features fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the present disclosure has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein.
The disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.
The technology described herein enables an event attendee within a geofence to automatically share content with other event attendees within the geofence. An event is generally associated with a physical gathering of some sort, often for a particular purpose, and a user can plan the event using an event planning application included in the technology, for example, by inputting an event definition into a corresponding application interface. In some embodiments, the event may persist for a specific duration and the technology may enable and disable sharing based upon entry into and exit from a geofence associated with the event, although other variations are contemplated where the duration of an event may be open-ended or dynamic, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.
A geofence may cover one or more geographic locations associated with the event. In some embodiments, the geofence area may be defined by a set of geographic coordinates that establish a perimeter. The perimeter may include a single or multiple continuous and/or discontinuous geographic locations. In some embodiments, the geofence can be fixed to one or more specific locations or may be dynamic/mobile and move with a group of users associated with the event (e.g., inferred by the location data received from the participant-users' mobile devices).
The geofence may be used by a social network application to share content. The scope of the sharing by the social network application may be limited to the users associated with the event, such as the event invitees, those attending the event, those meeting an exemption requirement, etc. In some embodiments, the social network application can privately share content associated with the event based on whether or not the attendees are located within the geofence and/or meet an exemption requirement.
An event definition defining an event includes parameters that set forth the details for the event. In some embodiments, the event parameters include one or more of the event invitees, the start time and/or duration of the event, the event location(s), an event description, an event title, keywords and/or tags characterizing the event, an event theme, content sharing, etc. The event invitees parameter may specify a list of specific users, may allow invitees to invite friends, may be open to any users or users that meet certain criteria (e.g., work at a particular company, attended a particular school, etc.), etc. The content sharing parameter(s) may determine if, when, how, and what type of content may be shared. For example, the content sharing parameter(s) may specify the type of content that can be shared, specify the scope of the sharing, specify the duration of the sharing, specify which of the attendees can access the shared content, specify whether post-event sharing and/or viewing is allowed, etc.
The network 102 may include one or more wired or wireless networks having any number of network configurations.

The communication unit 208 may provide connections to the network 102 and to other entities of the system 100 using standard communication protocols including, for example, those discussed with reference to the network 102. The communication unit 208 may link the processor 202 to the network 102, which may in turn be coupled to other processing systems. Depending on the embodiment, the communication unit 208 may be coupled to the network 102 via signal line 118 or 112 for communication and interaction with the other entities of the system 100.
The social network application 122, the geofencing engine 124, the location engine 126, and the events planning application 128. In some embodiments, one or more of the components 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 include sets of instructions executable by the processor 202. In some embodiments, one or more of the components 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 are stored in the memory 204 and are accessible and executable by the processor 202. In any of the foregoing embodiments, these components 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 202 and other components of the system 100.
The social network application 122 is software including routines for providing a virtual social network via which users may share content and communicate. The social network is a social structure that connects users by one or more common features. The common features can include any attribute, interest, preference, relation, or interaction attributable to the users. For example, the common features include relationships/connections, e.g., professional and academic attributes and interests, friendships, familial ties, etc. The common features can also include explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users and entities. The common features can be provided by one or more social networking systems, including, for example, the social network application 122. These common features, which may be stored as profile information for the users, can be mapped by the social network application 122 to connect the users.
A user's social graph may include social graph connection information describing connections between that user and the other users of the social network; what common features (e.g., attributes, interests, social network activity, relationships, etc.) connect that user to other users; any groups/sets formed by that user and/or the social network application 122 to categorize or group his or her connections on the social network; the strength of the connections (e.g., affinity) between the user and other users, which can be calculated based on, for example, the degree or degrees (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.) of separation between the user and other users, who, if any, the connecting/interstitial users are; the amount or type of interactions between the users, etc.; etc. For instance, the social network application 122 and/or a user (e.g., via an associated user interface), may define groups for users who are work friends, school friends, networking contacts, clients, etc., and social graphs may include data reflecting what groups these users belong to. Together, the social graphs of the users form a collective social graph 220 that reflects a mapping of all of the users of the social network and how they are related.
In some embodiments, the information stored by the social graph 220 may be stored in the memory 204 or a data store of the application server 118, or may be included in a memory, computing device and/or storage system distinct from but accessible by the application server 118. In various embodiments, the social graph 220 stores records, files, objects, data, etc., in cooperation with a file system executable by the processor 202. The social graph 220 may additionally or alternatively include a database management system (DBMS) executable by the processor 202 to manage a collection of records, files, objects, etc. For example, the database could be a structured query language (SQL), NoSQL DBMS, etc., storing data that can be manipulated using programmatic operations (e.g., queries and statements) by the social network application 122, the geofencing engine 123, the location engine 126, the events planning application 128, and the other entities of the system 100.
Users may use the social network to receive and share content with other users. In a simple example, a user may input content (e.g., a status, photos, videos, a URL, a location check-in, other content) into a form presented by the client application 108 or another application and submit it to the social network application 122. The social network application may receive the user's submission and inject it into the content streams of that user's connections on the social network.
The social network application 122 may notify invitees of events planned using the events planning application 128 (e.g., via a notification tool provided by the social network application 122, via a post injected into the user's content stream, etc.). In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may collaborate with the events planning application 128 to provide users with a socially-enabled events planning experience. For example, the social network application 122 may provide data, such as social graph data and content data, to or store data for retrieval by, the events planning application 128.
The social network application 122 may receive content shared by users and associate that content with an event planned using the events planning application 128. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may associate the content with the event in the data store 210. For instance, the social network data may store the content as shared content data 214 in the data store and relate (e.g., link) that content with the event, which is stored as event data 212.
The social network application 122 may receive, in some cases, event-related content that was captured during the event or is otherwise somehow associated with the event after the event has ended, and may add the content to the event (e.g., by associating it with the event in the data store 210) to provide a more complete picture of the event and allow attendees and/or invitees to reminisce and/or catch up on the various proceedings at the event. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may automatically add content to an event or may request authorization from a stakeholder of the event (e.g., the event planner or a delegate thereof).
The social network application 122 may interact with the geofencing engine 124 and the location engine 122 to receive location-related data, which it can use to associate shared content with the appropriate event, as discussed further elsewhere herein. The social network application 122 may be coupled to the geofencing engine 124, the location engine 126, and/or the events planning engine 128 to send and receive data, and may be coupled to the data store 210 and/or the social graph 220 to store and manipulate (e.g., retrieve, update, delete, etc.) data stored therein.
The social network application 122 may regulate access to the content shared in association with the event. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may reference the event definition to determine access parameters and provide access based thereon. For instance, if the event definition restricts access to the shared content to particular users, (e.g., invitees to the event (explicit invitees, friends of invitees, users who heard about or stumbled upon the event, etc., invitees that actually attended the event and/or met an exemption requirement, etc.) the social network application 122 may limit sharing of the shared content accordingly.
The social network application 122 may share event-associated content with an event invitee and permit the event invitee to share his/her event-associated content with other event invitees based on one or more parameters of the event definition, as discussed further elsewhere herein, such as the invitee's location inferred from the location of the invitee's client device.
The social network application may determine if an event invitee is within the geofence associated with a given event by receiving geofencing data indicating such from the geofencing engine 124 and/or the data store 210. In some embodiments, even if an invitee is not within the geofence or approaching the geofence, the social network application may provide access to the invitee to share and receive shared content if the invitee meets an exemption requirement (e.g., defined by the event definition). As an example, the social network application 122 may share event-associated content with a user as the user approaches or is within the geofence and stop sharing once the user leaves the geofence. As a further example, an attendee who is driving to the event may be exempted to share content while en route with the other attendees or a group of the attendees (e.g., attendees belonging to a particular social networking group as reflected in the social graph 220).
The social network application 122 may share the content in a variety of ways, such as but not limited to, by injecting the event-related content into each applicable user's content stream, by offering a content stream dedicated to the event that can be accessed the users and may include all content shared by the applicable event invitees, by messaging the event-related content using a messaging service (e.g., instant message, SMS, email, etc.).
The social network application 122 may send the event-related shared content to the various instances of the location-aware client application 108 (or another application) operable on the client devices 106 of the invitees for presentation thereby to the invitees. In some embodiments, the shared content may be included in a web page and/or or provided as a data object (e.g. XML, JSON, etc.) for processing and rendering by the location-aware client application 108, although numerous other variations are also possible. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may include data APIs configured to provide social-network related content (e.g., social graph data, user data, content data, etc.) to other entities of the system 100, provided the applicable users' have authorized such data access.
The social network application 122 can adapt the sharing of the content between the invitees associated with the event based on dynamic changes made to the event, such as the duration of the event, the location of the event (e.g., changes to the scope and character of the geofence associated with the event based on the movement patterns of the attendees of the event). For instance, as sub-geofence(s) are derived off of the originating geofence, as reflected in the geofencing data stored in the data store 210 and maintained and updated by the geofencing engine, the social network application 122 can regulate the sharing of content between the users associated with the differing geofences (originating geofence, sub-geofence(s)).
In some embodiments, each sub-geofence may have its own access control list that provides users associated with that geofence to share content associated with the event privately between themselves or promote content to the originating geofence and/or other sub-geofence(s) derived from the originating/main geofence. For instance users of one sub-geofence can share content with another sub-geofence without sharing the content with a larger audience associated with the main geofence. The access control lists for the geofences may be managed dynamically by the geofencing engine 124 as it manages the geofences and sub-geofences. The access control lists may be stored and retrieved from storage (e.g., the memory 204, the data store 210) by the social network application 122 and/or the geofencing engine 124
The geofencing engine 124 includes software and/or hardware for creating, managing, and dissolving geofences. The geofencing engine 124 may use data provided by the social network application 122, location engine 126, and/or events planning engine 128 to create, manage, and dissolve the geofences. The geofencing engine 124 may receive the data provided by these entities directly or from data storage (e.g., the data store 210). The geofencing engine 124 may be electronically communicatively coupled to these and other entities to send and receive data.
The geofencing engine 124 may schedule geofences for events planned using the events planning engine 128. In some embodiments, the events planning engine 128 may signal the geofencing engine 124 to schedule a geofence for an upcoming or impromptu event. The geofencing engine 124 may define a geofence for an event based on the parameters included in the event definition generated by the events planning engine 128. For example, the geofencing engine 124 may define the area of the geofence associated with the event using one or more locations provided in the event definition. The geofencing engine 124 may define the duration of the geofence based on the duration defined in the event definition. As discussed elsewhere herein, the duration may be fixed, dynamic, open-ended, reoccurring, etc. The geofencing engine 124 may access the event definition from data storage (e.g., the data store 210) or may receive a signal from the events planning engine 128 indicating such.
The geofencing engine 124 may generate (e.g. create, initialize) a geofence for an event at a time corresponding with the start time of the event, as determined by the event definition. In some embodiments, the start time of the geofence and be the same as the start time of the event, or maybe earlier or later depending on the preferences of the event stakeholder (e.g., the event planner or delegate thereof). For example, in some embodiments, event stakeholder may prefer to have the geofence active before the event begins so participants can begin communicating about the event beforehand, and may specify (in the event definition) a start time for the geofence independent of the start time of the event geofence or at certain time prior to the start time of the event. This is helpful as it can generate a buzz about the event beforehand and increase the probability of some invitees may be considering not coming to the event actually attend, thereby increasing the overall attendance and success of the event.
The geofencing engine 124 supervises which users are within the geofence, and whether and/or when they enter and exit the geofence. The geofencing engine 124 may generate geofencing data describing which individual users are within the geofence and whether and when they enter and exit geofence to the social network application 122 so that the social network application 122 can share content based on whether event invitees are within the geofence, as discussed elsewhere herein. The geofencing engine 124 may store the geofencing data in the data store 210 as geofencing data 218, for access and/or retrieval by it or other components of the social platform 120, such as the social network application 122.
To determine whether a particular event invitee is within the geofence, approaching the geofence, split off from the geofence, or unassociated with the geofence, etc., the geofencing engine 124 may access location data indicating the location history of the invitees including the invitees' current locations, which may be received, stored, and/or provided by the location engine 126, as discussed elsewhere herein. The invitees' current locations may be inferred from location data captured by the invitees' client devices 106 and processed as discussed elsewhere herein, for instance, with reference to the location engine 126.
The geofencing engine 124 can divide a geofence into multiple associated geofences (e.g., two or more sub-geofences, a main geofence and sub-geofence, etc.). The geofencing engine 124 may also merge associated geofences (e.g., a main geofence and sub-geofence, two or more sub-geofences, etc.). In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may derive one or more sub-geofences from an initial geofence to accommodate movement patterns of the attendees of the event during the event, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein. For instance, for a larger event, such as a conference with thousands of people in attendance, a user may create a sub-geofence (e.g., for a concurrent party or after-party) and the geofencing engine may splinter off a group from the originating geofence into the sub-geofence.
In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124, in cooperation with the events planning engine 128, may allow users to convert the sub-geofence into a separate event that is unassociated with an originating event and geofence and sub-geofences (if applicable). For example, the event attendees associated with the sub-geofence may provide input instructions instructing the events planning application 128, the social network application 122, or another component to convert the sub-geofence into a new event that includes the event attendees that are within the sub-geofence. In response, the events planning application 128, in cooperation with the other components of the social platform 120, may generate a separate event and geofence for these users using the data (e.g., location data, geofencing data, etc.) associated with the sub-geofence and/or provided by the users for the new event.
The geofencing engine 124 stores data describing the geofences in the data store 210 as geofencing data 218. The geofencing engine 124 may update the geofencing data 218 to reflect changes to the state of the geofences. Example state changes include, but are not limited to, the start time, duration, and/or end time of the geofence, the users associated with the geofence (e.g., invitees that entered, exited, are/were within the geofence), the amount of time users were within the geofence, the area of the geofence, access control, etc.
The geofencing engine 124 may maintain access control lists for all geofence types in a given geofence environment (e.g., originating geofence, sub-geofences derived therefrom, etc.). In some embodiments, these access control lists allow the geofence and sub-geofence(s) to have their own access control levels, which in-turn provides users customized control in sharing content. For instance, users may elect to share content locally within their own sub-geofence, across specific sub-geofences, across the entire geofence environment, etc. As a further example, users can restrict sharing content to users within the sub-geofence, allow the shared content to be included in the originating geofence, allow for an unrestricted/unregulated sharing across geofences, etc. In these embodiments, a user can elect to remove themselves from a current sub-geofence and join another sub-geofence, the originating geofence, a different geofence, etc. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may store and manipulate the access control lists in data storage (e.g., data store 210) with the geofencing data 218.
The location engine 126 includes software and/or hardware for receiving, processing, storing, and/or providing location data. With user consent, the location engine 126 may receive location data from users of the social platform 120. The location data may be provided by instances of the location-aware client application 108 operating on the client devices, or another application operating thereon. Location data provided by these applications may include any geolocation data specifying the geographic location of the users 114, such as GPS coordinates, an IP address, mobile carrier data, an explicit check-in, etc.
The location engine 126 may process and store the location data in the data store 210 for access and/or retrieval by it and/or other components of the social platform and/or provide it to other components of the social platform 120. The location data may include a location history including a current location if available for each of the users of the social platform 120 that are providing such data.
The location engine 126 may be coupled to the social network application 122, the geofencing engine 124, the events planning engine 128, the instances of the location-aware client application 108, etc., to send and receive data, and may be coupled to the data store 210 to store and manipulate (e.g., retrieve, update, delete, etc.) data stored therein.
The events planning application 128 includes software and/or hardware for planning and managing events. Users may use the events planning application 128 to plan events, revise events, delete events, access content shared in association with the events, view event activity and analytics, share the events (e.g., upcoming, ongoing, transpired, etc.) with other users, etc. A user may input parameters defining event into a corresponding user interface presented by an application operating on his/her client device 106, such as the location-aware client application 108, and submit the event definition to the events planning application 128.
The events planning application 128 may receive and process the event definition to create a corresponding event record, initiate creation of a corresponding geofence, invite attendees and receive confirmations therefrom, etc., as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the events planning application 128 may query the social graph 220 of the social network and provide the social graph data for presentation to the event planner to facilitate the creation of the event. For example, the events planning application 128 may query the event planner's social graph, which is stored in/managed by the social graph 214, to access a list of that user 114's social network contacts, including social groups, which the event planner can use to easily identify which users to invite to the event. For instance, for a family party, the event planner may select a social network group that includes that user's family members instead of having to select each individual separately.
The events planning application 128 may use the social graph data to notify the invitees of the event. For instance, the social graph data may include the invitees' electronic contact information (e.g., SMS phone number, email address, social network address, etc.) and the events planning application 128 may use this information to notify the invitees about the event and request confirmation to the event. In some embodiments, the contact information of the invitees may be explicitly included in the event definition by the event stakeholder.
After creating the event, an authorized user may revise or delete the event by requesting the event definition and providing corresponding input to revise it, and then submitting those changes. The events planning application 128 may receive the revised event definition and process and/or store it accordingly.
In some embodiments, an event may be a recurring event. For example, the event may be a routine event that is held every month, and an event stakeholder, such as the event planner or a delegate thereof, may define the parameters for the recurring event in the event definition. As a result, the geofencing engine 124 may generate geofences for the event at routine intervals to facilitate the sharing of content between the attendees of the different occurrences of the event. The social network application 122 may be configured to share content across all occurrences of the event or may segment content sharing between specific occurrences. This advantageously allows content to either be shared with all attendees of the event regardless of which occurrence of the event they attended, or with the attendees of specific occurrences of the event.
In some embodiments, the events planning application 128 and/or the social network application 128 may generate data for presenting user interfaces that allow users to view the current location of other invitees to the event, being shared by those invitees, view areas associated with the event geofence(s) including (e.g., any sub-geofences that have been generated during the event and the users associated therewith), which users have attended, are approaching, have left, etc., the event, etc. It should be understood, that this data for presenting user interfaces may be generated by other components, such as the location-aware client application 108.
The events planning application 128 may be coupled to the social network application 122, the geofencing engine 124, the location engine 126, and/or the location-aware client application 108 to send and receive data, and may be coupled to the data store 210 and/or the social graph 220 to store and manipulate (e.g., retrieve, update, delete, etc.) data stored therein.
The social network application 122, the geofencing engine 124, the location engine 126, the events planning engine 128, and/or the location-aware client application 108 may require users 114 to be registered to use various acts and/or functionality provided by them.
The data store 210 is an information source capable of storing and providing access to data to the various entities coupled to the network 102. In some embodiments, the data store 210 could include a file system, a database management system (DBMS), etc. The DMBS could include a structured query language (SQL), a NoSQL DBMS, other types of DMBSs that store data that can be manipulated using programmatic operations (e.g., queries and statements to store, query, update, and/or delete data) by other components of the social platform 120 and/or the system 100. In some embodiments, the data store 210 stores information including but not limited to events data 212, shared content data 214, location data 216, and geofencing data 218, as discussed in further elsewhere herein.

While not depicted, the memory 204 may include a camera engine (e.g., a driver), which includes software storable in the memory 204 and operable by the processor 202 to control/operate the capture device 314. The camera engine may be communicatively coupled to the capture device 314 and the other components of the client device 106 via the bus 206, and these components may interface with the camera engine via the bus 206 to capture still and/or motion images (e.g., photos and videos) using the capture device 314.
The location sensor 316 includes hardware and/or software for determining a position of the client device 106. The location sensor 316 may include a receiver configured to receive positional data from a positioning system coupled to the network. In some embodiments, the positional data my include GPS or similar signals and the location 316 may determine the location of the client device 106 based thereon. In further embodiments, the client device 106's location may be determined based on network and/or cellular signals communicated by the communication unit 208.
The location-aware client application 108 or another application may retrieve the current location of the client device 106 from the location sensor 316 and/or the communication unit 208 (e.g., via a device driver) and utilize it to share and/or receive content, and/or provide location data including the location to the social platform 106 for use thereby to provide event-based sharing of content using geofences, as discussed in further detail herein.
In some embodiments, the positioning system (not shown) coupled to the network 102 could include a global positioning system (GPS), a differential global positioning system (DGPS), an assisted global positioning system (A-GPS), etc., a telecommunications system including a multilateration or triangulation engine, a geolocation system capable of determining an approximate geolocation of a client device 106 using an IP address of the client device 106 on the network 102 by cross-referencing the IP address with other information sources, such as internet server provider databases, internet registries, etc., or other location systems and/or mechanisms. It should be understood that in various embodiments any location-tracking system such as constellation systems like “hiball,” magnetic tracking systems, optical tracking system, inertial tracking systems, etc.
The location-aware client application 108 includes software, operable by the client device 106, for utilizing the social network provided by the social network application 122 and the events planning service provided by the events planning engine 128. In some embodiments, the social networking and event planning features may be integrated into a seamless user experience or may be provided using different user environments by the location-aware software application or different applications. In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may be software code operable in a web browser, may be software code operable by the client device 106 as a native application, a combination of the foregoing, etc.
The location-aware client application 108 may provide a user 116 interacting with the client device 106 mechanisms for sharing and/or receive shared content via the social network in association with an event, viewing the user's content stream, other users' content streams, a content stream associated with an event, etc. The location-aware client application 108 may display a variety of different user interfaces and options for utilizing the social network, planning and managing events, and/or configuring social network and event settings.
The location-aware client application 108 may communicate with the social platform 120 to send and receive related information, including location data, geofencing data, event-related data including event definitions, social network data including content being shared and/or received in association with the event and the geofence, etc. In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may, in some embodiments, initiate a share request for sharing content with other attendees of an event that are located within a geofence or sub-geofence, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein. The location-aware client application 108 may also receive and present event notifications, submit confirmations, authorize sharing requests, etc.
In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may supervise a user's location based on position data determined by location sensor 316 and/or the communication unit 208 to determine whether that user has entered and/or exited any geofences/sub-geofences applicable to the user and send geofencing data describing such for use by the geofencing engine 124 and/or the social network application 122. In some embodiments, social network application 122 and/or the geofencing engine 124 may determine such using location data describing the user's location provided by the location-aware client application 108.
In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 202. In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 is stored in the memory 204 of the client device 106 and is accessible and executable by the processor 202. In any of these embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 202 and other components of the client device 106. In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may be a stand-alone application or may be integrated into another application operable on the client device 106. In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may interact with and provide other software applications stored in the memory 204 and executable by the processor 202 of client device 106 with various information via an API.
Referring now to FIGS. 4-11 , various example methods are described. FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method 400 for event-based content sharing using geofencing.
In block 402, the method 400 determines event definition describing an event. In some embodiments, the event definition includes an event location, duration, and/or event invitees. The event definition may also include further information describing the event, such as a title, detailed description, content sharing parameters, etc., as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, a user may define event by inputting the event definition into an associated user interface presented by the user's client device 106. In some embodiments, the user may use the location-aware client application 108, or another application operable by the client device 106, to input the event definition. Once the event definition is input, the client device 106 may transmit data describing the event definition to the events planning application 128, which may process and store the event definition in association with the user in the data store 210 as event data 212, and/or provide the event definition to one or more other components, such as the social network application 122, the geofencing engine 124, and/or the location engine 126, as described elsewhere herein.
In block 404, the method 400 generates an event geofence associated with the location of the event described by the event definition. In some embodiments, the event geofence may be generated by the geofencing engine 124 to persist for a duration that corresponds to the duration of the event. For example, the event geofence may persist for the same duration as the event, may be defined to begin and end at a certain time prior to or after the start and end time of the event, may have a dynamic duration that adapts to the evolution of the event (e.g., start as a critical mass of attendees arrive at the site of the event and/or end as the critical mass leaves the event), etc. In a further example, an event may originally be defined to end at a certain time but because there are attendees who are still at the event, the geofencing engine 124 may extend the event to allow those users to continue to share content. In another example, the events planning application 128 or other component of the social platform 120 may notify an event organizer and/or a delegate thereof that the event is due to end and ask whether the event should be extended. In response, the event organizer and/or the delegate may extend the event by providing a corresponding input into an associated user interface, which the geofencing engine 124 may receive and thereby use to extend the persistence of the geofence and the social network application 122 may allow the users associated with the event to continue sharing content privately with one another. The geofencing engine 124 may provide location data to or may store location data in the data store 210 for retrieval by the social network application 122 that indicates to the social network application 122 which geofence a particular user is associated with.
In block 406, the method 400 may privately share content between attendees of the event that are located within the event geofence or within a certain proximity to the geofence. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 or another component of the system 100, such as the location-aware client application 108 or the social network application 122, may determine which invitees have entered the geofence based on a user's location data based on location data associated with that user or an exemption requirement. If so, those invitees are considered event attendees and the social network application 122 may share content between them.
In some embodiments, to receive content, attendees must be within a geographic area/perimeter of the geofence. For example, if the location of the event is a particular restaurant, the geofence covers the area of the restaurant (e.g., the parking lot, the building, etc.) and the attendees must be within that area to receive content shared by other attendees. In some embodiments, the geofence may cover multiple locations. For example, an event defined by a user (e.g., a birthday party, a reunion, a conference, etc.) may include more than one location (e.g., at various locations within a particular city or state, a locations in different states or countries (e.g., New York and Los Angeles)) and the geofence area may cover those locations to allow users in attendance of the event to automatically share content even though they are attending in multiple locations.
In some embodiments, an attendee that is not specifically within the geofence area may still receive and or share content with the other attendees that are within the geofence area if that attendee meets one or more exemption requirements. The exemption requirements may include, but are not limited to, that the attendee confirmed that he/she is attending the event, the attendee is en route to the event, that the attendee opted to attend the event virtually, etc.
In some embodiments, the scope of the sharing may be limited to just those users currently in attendance of the event and when a given attendee who is within the geofence leaves the geofence, the social network application 122 may cut that user off from receiving further content from other attendees. In some cases, the user may no longer be able to access any content that was shared until the user re-enters the geofence.
As another non-limiting example of the method 400, an event definition may specify which users have access to the content being shared by the invitees and for what duration access to the content is granted. For instance, the sharing may be constrained by certain event parameters, and only allow certain people (e.g., confirmed attendees, specific confirmed attendees specified by a user, etc.) within the geofence to share content for the duration of the event, although numerous other variations are also possible. In a further example related to photos, users can configure the social network application 122 to automatically start sharing a user's photos associated with the event once the user has entered the geofence and automatically stop sharing the photos once the user has exited the geofence. Also, it should be understood that any type of digital content may additionally or alternatively be shared, such but not limited to as status updates, location, social network posts, videos, news articles, links to web-based content, files, etc.
In some embodiments, if an invitee has confirmed that he/she will be attending the event, that user may initially receive content shared in associated with the event (e.g., for a certain period of time) but may eventually be cut off if he/she doesn't eventually enter the geofence area (e.g., within a certain timeframe).
In some embodiments, an invitee may be incapable of physically attending one of the event locations (e.g., may be deployed in a remote region) and the event definition may allow that user to indicate that he/she will be attending the event virtually. This allows that user to participate in/virtually attend the event even though he/she is unable to physically be at the event.
In some embodiments, location data may be captured by the user's client device 106 and then compared by the geofencing engine 124 or another component, such as the location-aware client application 108, to the geofence area and/or exemption requirements to determine whether the user is allowed to share content with other attendees of the event.
In block 502, the method 500 receives an event definition and in block 504 determines one or more event parameters describing one or more locations, an event duration, and/or or more invitees from the event definition. In block 506, the method 500 notifies the invitees about the event. In some embodiments, the events planning application 128 receives and processes the event definition and invites the invitees to the event. For example, the events planning application 128 notifies each of the invitees defined in the event definition about the event and asks the invitees to RSVP for the event (e.g., by providing input indicating that the invitee will be attending, is tentatively planning to attend, or is not planning to attend).
In some embodiments, the events planning application 128 notifies an invitee by injecting a notification into that invitee's social network content stream hosted by the social network application 122, sending the invitees notification via a messaging system provided by the social network application 122, sending the invitee a notification via an electronic message, such as a message sent through a messaging system provided by the social network application 122, an electronic message (e.g., e-mail, SMS, instant message, microblog, another social network, voice message, etc.) sent by another messaging system, such as one provided by the social platform 120 or a third-party application 136 executable by a third-party server 134.
In block 508, the method 500 receives confirmation of attendance from one or more of the invitees. For example, the events planning application 128 receives a confirmation from the invitee. The confirmation may be provided in response to selecting a corresponding user interface element indicating that the invitee will be attending. For instance, the invitee may select a “yes” button provided in association with the notification that was injected into the invitee's social network content stream or presented in association therewith. In further embodiments, the confirmation may be received in an electronic message (e.g., e-mail, SMS, instant message, microblog, another social network, voice message, etc.) sent in response to the invitation. In some embodiments, the invitation may include an electronic link (e.g., a hyperlink), and the user may select the electronic link and then fill out and submit a form provided responsive to the link selection. Numerous other variations are also possible.
Responsive to receiving the confirmations from the invitees, event planning application 128 may store the confirmations in the data store 210 as event data 212. For example, the events planning application 128 may store the confirmations in association with an electronic record that reflects the event definition including the parameters of the event.
In block 510, the method 500 may schedule a geofencing for the event based on one or more of the event parameters. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may schedule the geofencing to persist for a duration to corresponds to the duration of the event and to have a perimeter to corresponds to the one or more locations included in the event. In some embodiments, the geofence may be stored as geofence data 218 in the data store 210, cached, client-side to the client devices 106 of the invitees, for reference once the geofence is scheduled to become active, and the event to begin.
In some embodiments, the events planning application 128, the geofencing engine 124, or another may associate the geofence with the invitees of the event so that when the invitees enter or exit the geofence, their presence or absence may be identified. In some cases, an invitee is associated with the geofence once the invitee has confirmed attendance. In some cases, all invitees may be associated with the geofence so that any invitees that did not confirm attendance but ended up showing up may still participate in the event and share content. Additional variations are also possible and contemplated.
As a further non-limiting example associated with the method 500, once an event definition has been input, the event stakeholder (the event creator/planner or a delegate user thereof) may instruct the events planning application 128 to notify the invitees of the event (e.g., by selecting an invite button on a user interface that includes form fields for specifying the event parameters). In response, the events planning application 128 may notify the invitees of the event by sending them an invitation to the event using any available electronic notification mechanism, such as posting an electronic invitation including the event details or a link thereto to the users' social network content stream, sending the users an electronic invitation or a link thereto (e.g., email, SMS, instant message, proprietary messaging mechanism, etc.), placing an automated call and/or leaving an automated voice message, etc. In response to receiving an invitation, an invitee may confirm attendance by selecting an appropriate option in an associated user interface. As users confirm attendance, the event creator, coordinator, etc., may be notified via electronic message and/or may monitor such by viewing event-related information in an associated user interface.
In block 608, the method 600 authorizes users within the geofence area or meeting one or more exemption requirements to privately share content with other. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may permit qualifying users associated with the event, such as those within the geofence area and meeting one or more exemption requirements, to share content with one another.
In block 704, the method 700 determines location of the client device 106 associated with the requesting invitee and then, in block 706, whether the client device 106 of the invitee is within the area of the event geofence, e.g., by comparing the client device 106 location to the area. By doing so, the method 700 can reliably verify whether the invitee is in attendance of the event. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 and/or the location-aware client application 108 may provide geofencing data to the social network application 122 indicating whether the user is located within the geofence, and the social network application 122 may use the geofencing data to determine whether to provide access to the invitee to receive or share content in association with the event, as discussed further below.
If the invitee is determined in block 706 to be within the geofence area, the method 700 provides access in block 710 to the invitee to receive or share content with the other invitees within the geofence (also in attendance). If the invitee is not determined to be within the geofence area, the method 700 may determine in block 708, based on the location data of the client device 106 of the invitee, whether the client device 106 of the invitee is approaching the geofence area. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 receive location data from the location engine 126 and/or the data store 210 and determine whether the invitee is approaching the geofence area based thereon.
If in block 708, the method 700 determines that the client device 106 of the invitee is approaching the geofence area, the method 700 provides access in block 710 to the invitee to receive or share content with the other invitees that are within the geofence. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may receive data from the geofencing engine 124 and/or the location-aware client application 108 indicating that the invitee is approaching the geofence, based on the indication, the social network application 122 may permit the invitee to receive and/or share content with the other invitees in attendance of the event. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 and/or the location-aware client application 108 may determine that invitee is approaching geofence by receiving location data from the client device 106 overtime showing the progression (e.g., movement of the client device 106) toward the geofence. For example, the location engine 126 may receive location data from the client device 106 and store the location data in the data store 210 for retrieval by the geofencing engine 124 and/or may provide the location directly to the geofencing engine 124.
If in block 708, the method 700 determines that the client device 106 of the invitee is not approaching geofence area, the method 700 proceeds to block 712 where it determines whether the client device 106 of the invitee is associated with (e.g., within) a sub-geofence derived from the main event geofence (or another sub-geofence also derived from the main event geofence), as discussed elsewhere herein. If so, the method 700 determines an access level for the share request received from the invitee in block 716 and then provides access to the invitee to receive or share content in association with a sub-geofence and/or the main event geofence commensurate with the access level in block 718. In some embodiments, the access level may be defined by the requester and/or one or more other users also associated with a sub-geofence (e.g., located within the sub-geofence as indicated by the location data determined by their client devices 106). In some embodiments, the access level may be automatically determined based on whether the user's client device 106 is located within the sub-geofence. Further variations are also possible and contemplated.
Allowing users to attend the event and share content via a sub-geofence is advantageous because it, for example, allows users who are within a certain proximity of one another to only share content with each other if desired. In further examples, it also allows users of the sub-geofence to push some relevant content up to the other attendees within the main-geofence while preserving other relevant content for just those users who are within the sub-geofence.
If in block 712, the method 700 determines that the client device 106 of the invitee is not associated with a sub-geofence, the method 700 in block 714 denies the content request received from the invitee. In some embodiments, the invitee may be notified of the denied request via a notification or prompt presentation on his or her client device 106. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may trigger presentation of the notification or prompt sending a corresponding notification or prompt signal to the client device 106 and the location-aware client application 108 may receive and process the signal, and generate and present the corresponding connection or prompt to the invitee.
In block 804, the method 800 determines that a sub-group of invitees to the event moved to a location distinct from the main group of invitees based on the movement data. For example, the sub-group of invitees may have originally been with the main group of invitees within the geofence associated with the event and then migrated from that main group to another location. As further example, a small group of friends that are attending a party at a nightclub left to go to a pub down the street to get drinks and some food. The geofencing engine 124 may determine that this group of friends left the main group of party attendees at the nightclub and went to the pub based on the movement data of this group of friends.
In block 806, the method 800 may request confirmation from one or more of the invitees of the sub-group to form a sub-geofence. In some embodiments, upon determining that the sub-group has moved to a location distinct from the main group of invitees, the geofencing engine 124 may trigger the sending of notification requesting confirmation from one or more of the event invitees in that sub-group to form a sub-geofence. In block 808, the method 800 may receive confirmation from one or more invitees of the sub-group to form the sub-geofence. For instance, responsive to triggering the sending of notification requesting confirmation from one or more of the event invitees, the geofencing engine 124 may receive a corresponding response authorizing and/or rejecting the formation of the sub-geofence and the geofencing engine 124 may form or not form based on the responses.
In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may forgo requesting confirmation and may automatically form the sub-geofence to provide an option to the event attendees in the sub-group to share content privately with one another or promote the content to the event invitees associated with the originating geofence and/or other sub-geofences.
In block 810, the method 800 may create a sub-geofence from the main geofence. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may initialize the sub-geofence based on the confirmation responses or may autonomously initialize a sub-geofence.
In block 812, the method 800 may add the location associated with the sub-geofence to the event. In some embodiments, responsive to or in association with the creation of the sub-geofence, the geofencing engine 124 may update the event data 212 in the data store 210 describing the event to include the location of the sub-geofence.
In block 814, the method 800 facilitates sharing privately between the invitees associated with the sub-geofence and/or the main geofence. The social network application 122 is configured to compartmentalize and/or merge the sharing by the sub-groups and the main group based on which sub-geofence the content originates from and/or the access level associated with the content, as discussed elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the social network application 122 may receive signals from the geofencing engine 124 and/or may access location data stored in the data store 210 reflecting if content being shared is associated with the main-geofence or a sub-geofence. The social network application 122 may also retrieve access control data from the data store 210 describing the scope of the content being shared, e.g., whether the content should be shared with attendees associated with a particular sub-geofence, shared across the main-geofence and any other sub-geofences, etc. The social network application 122 may then share the content based on the location data and the access control data.
The method 800 is advantageous because, for instance, it allows users who are attending an event flexibility to continue sharing content as the event evolves. For example, attendees of the event may continue sharing content as they migrate from the original location of the event to other locations. These attendees may, in some cases, have reason to keep some of the content they are sharing amongst themselves, or may want to share that content with rest of the attendees of the event. It should be understood that multiple sub-groups and sub-geofences may be simultaneously maintained and associated with the main-geofence.
Regarding method 850, in block 852, the method 850 analyzes the location history of the invitees of the sub-group and in block 854 determines that the sub-group of invitees rejoined the main group of invitees associated with an originating or main geofence. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may determine that the sub-group rejoined the main-group based on the movement data associated with the users of the sub-group. Continuing a previous example, the small group of friends left the nightclub to go to a pub down the street to get drinks and some food may have returned to the main party at the nightclub, as determined by the geofencing engine 124 based on their movement data.
In block 856, the method 850 may request confirmation from one or more invitees of the sub-group to merge with the main-geofence and in block 858, the method 850 may receive a confirmation response from at least one of the one or invitees responsive to requesting confirmation. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may trigger the sending of a notification requesting confirmation from one or more of the invitees to rejoin the main-geofence. In some embodiments, notifications may be sent and confirmations received by the geofencing engine 124, the social network application 122, or the events planning application 128, although other variations are also contemplated. For instance, the location-aware client application 108 or another application, e.g., a messaging application, may present the notification to the corresponding invitee and receive and relay input provided by the user in response to the presentation of the notification to the geofencing engine 124, the social network application 122, or the events planning application 128, which may then process the confirmation responses accordingly.
In block 860, the method 850 may merge the sub-geofence with the man-geofence. In some embodiments, the geofencing engine 124 may dissolve the sub-geofence and associate the invitees from the sub-geofence with the main-geofence based on those invitees being located within the main-geofence as reflected by their location data. The method 850 is advantageous because, for example, it allows groups at an event that had splintered off the main group to conveniently and flexibly rejoin the main group and continue sharing content.
If the method 900 determines in block 904 that the invitees associated with the geofence are migrating, the method 900 may dynamically update the location of the event based on the location data of the invitees in block 906. In some embodiments, the location may be dynamically updated by the geofencing engine 124 or another component (e.g., the events planning application 128, the social network application 122) if a majority or other significant cluster of invitees who were in attendance are migrating together. In a further example, if the location data of the event planner or the person or persons that the events was planned for our migrating along with other attendees to another location, the location of the event may be dynamically updated even if they do not represent the majority of the invitees who were in attendance of the event, although numerous other variations are also possible and contemplated. As a location of the event is updated, the geofencing engine 124 may adapt the geofence to include the migratory path of the invitees, the eventual destination of the invitees, any points of interest along the way, etc., in the geofence. The social network application 122 may continue sharing content amongst the invitees determined to be in attendance of the event based on the dynamically updated geofence (and/or with those meeting any exemption requirements).
In block 908, the method 900 can notify the invitees who have not yet arrived at the location of the event of the location change. For example, responsive to the location change, event planning application 128 or the social network application 122 may send a notification to the invitees indicating the location change.
The method 900 is advantageous because, for example, it allows the invitees in attendance and/or exempted to continue sharing content as the event evolves, and can restrict further content sharing with users who actually leave the event.
In some embodiments, event invitees may access user interface that shows the event location real-time as well as any changes to that location, such as any sub-groups that may have splintered off of the main group, the users associated with each of the sub-groups, the users associated with the main group, the migratory paths of any of the sub-groups, the main group, etc. This is advantageous as invitees who have not yet arrived may be informed in advance of any location changes without having to personally contact the event planner or other attendees of the event, and allows those invitees to identify and arrive at the proper event location. In these embodiments, the social network application 122 (or another component of the social platform 120 or system 100) may generate data describing the location and migratory path of the event, including the geofence and the users associated with it, as well as any sub-geofences if applicable and the users associated with them, or provide this data to the client devices 106 of the invitees, including those not yet in attendance.
In some embodiments, the users within a sub-geofence that has splintered off of the main geofence, may elect to keep the sub-geofence private, and the sub-geofence may be hidden from view in the user interface. For example, some users may be planning surprise for the attendees in the main geofence and a splitter off into a sub-group to carry out the surprise. In this example, the users may provide input instructing the geofencing engine 124 that the sub-group should be kept private. The geofencing engine 124 may store data indicating such as the social network application 122 or other component may hide the sub-group from being discovered.
In block 1004, the method 1000 identifies relevant unshared photographs and videos. In some embodiments, the photographs and videos queried in block 1002 are compared with the content shared by the user via the social network application 122 with other invitees of the event in association with the event to determine which of the photographs and videos, if any, have not yet been shared. In some embodiments, metadata associated with the photographs and videos is used to determine whether or not the photographs and videos are related the event.
For example, metadata such as location data identifying where the photographs and videos were captured and timing data such as the date and time the photographs and videos were captured may be compared to corresponding parameters of the event definition, such as the location and duration (e.g., start time and end time) of the event to determine whether the photographs and videos are relevant to the event. In a further example, data, such as identity tags identifying the users depicted in the photographs and videos, may be compared to the invitees included in the event definition and/or confirmed as having attended the event (e.g., based on their location history, confirmation of attendance, etc.) to determine whether the photographs and videos are relevant to the event. Other variations are also possible and contemplated.
In some embodiments, the operations described in respect to blocks 1002 and 1004 may be performed by the location-aware client application 108 (or another application operable by the client device 106 of the user), a component of the social platform 120 (e.g., the social network application 122, event planning application 128, etc.), a combination of the foregoing, or another component of the system 100.
In block 1006, the method 1000 prompts the invitee to share relevant unshared photo(s) and/or video(s). In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 (or another application operable by the client device 106) prompts the invitee by displaying a notification requesting the invitee to share relevant unshared photo(s) and/or video(s). In some embodiments, the location-aware client application 108 may display notification responsive to identifying the photo(s) and/or video(s) in block 1004 or receiving corresponding signal from the social network application 122 or another component of the social platform 120.
In some embodiments, the method 1000 may be performed during the event to help promote content sharing between the invitees in attendance. For example, invitees that are identified by the geofencing engine 124 as being located within the geofence or sub geofence, may be prompted to share the photographs and/or videos that capture during the event. In some embodiments, the method 1000 may be performed after the conclusion of the event to provide a robust summary of the event from those who attended in some cases to those who were not able to attend the event. For example, after the event has concluded, the social network application 122 may provide access to the content shared by the invitees in attendance of the event and within the geofence and/or invitees meeting an exemption requirement, with the invitees that did not attend the event. The social network application 122 may determine whether a given invitee attended or is in attendance of the event based on signals from and/or location data stored by the geofencing engine 124, the invitee's location history, content shared by invitee during the time period of the event, attendance confirmation received from the invitee, or other data indicating the invitee was in attendance.
In block 1008, the method 1000 receives authorization from the invitee to share the photo(s) and/or video(s). In some embodiments, the social network application 122 (or another component of the social platform 120) receives the authorization responsive to the invitee being prompted to share the one or more photos in their videos.
In block 1010, the method 1000 shares the relevant unshared photo(s) and/or video(s) with the invitees within the geofence area and/or sub-geofence area(s), invitees who attended the event, etc., depending on the embodiment. For example, the social network application 122 may associate the previously unshared content with the event and shares it with the other invitees (within the geofence/sub-geofence areas, who were unable to attend, etc., depending on the embodiment).
In some embodiments, as with various other operations discussed herein, the operations of example method 1100 may be performed by the events planning application 128 in cooperation with the other components of the social platform 120, such as the geofencing engine 124 and the social network application 122, although other variations are possible where other components, such as the social network application 122, perform these operations independently or cooperation with other components.

16. A system comprising:
one or more processors;
one or more memories storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to perform operations including:
determining an event definition describing an event including a location of the event, a first duration of the event, a group of one or more user-specified exemption requirements specific to the event, and invitees to the event;
generating an event geofence associated with the location of the event, the event geofence persisting for a second duration corresponding to the first duration of the event;
determining whether a first invitee is within an area of the event geofence or meets an exemption requirement from the group of one or more user-specified exemption requirements specific to the event, wherein the first invitee is one of the invitees to the event included in the event definition; and
sharing content with the first invitee responsive to determining that the first invitee meets a first exemption requirement from the group of one or more user-specified exemption requirements specific to the event, wherein the first exemption requirement includes a client device associated with the first invitee being en route to the event or the first invitee opting to attend the event virtually.
17. The system of claim 16 , wherein determining the event definition includes receiving the event definition from a client device of an event stakeholder, and generating the event geofence includes initializing the event geofence to persist for the second duration corresponding to the first duration of the event.
18. The system of claim 16 , wherein the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the system to perform operations including:
receiving a request from the first invitee included in the event definition that has not yet arrived to the event;
determining that the client device associated with the first invitee is en route to the area of the event geofence, wherein the first exemption requirement includes the client device associated with the first invitee being en route to the event; and
terminating the sharing of the content with the first invitee responsive to the client device associated with the first invitee, having been determined to be en route to the event, failing to enter the area of the event geofence within a specified timeframe.
19. The system of claim 16 , wherein the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the system to perform operations including:
dynamically creating a sub-geofence distinct from the event geofence for a sub-group of the invitees in attendance of the event that have moved to a location outside the area of the event geofence.
20. The system of claim 19 , wherein the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the system to perform operations including:
receiving a content share request from an invitee included in the event definition;
determining that a client device of the requesting invitee is within an area of the sub-geofence created from the event geofence;
determining an access level for the content share request; and
providing access to the requesting invitee to share content with other invitees associated with the sub-geofence or the event geofence based on the access level.
21. The system of claim 16 , wherein the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the system to perform operations including:
determining a group of the invitees associated with the event geofence are migrating to a new location different from the location defined in the event; and
dynamically updating the area of the event geofence to include the new location.
