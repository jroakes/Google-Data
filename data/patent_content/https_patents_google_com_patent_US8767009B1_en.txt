- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an electronic device that comprises multiple-window display. Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown an electronic device 100 .
- the electronic device 100 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, and/or code that may be operable to handle and/or run various applications and/or programs. In this regard, executing applications and/or programs by the electronic device 100 may be based on user instructions and/or pre-configured instructions. In some instances, the electronic device 100 may be operable to communicate data via wired and/or wireless connections, in accordance with one or more supported wireless and/or wired interfaces, protocols or standards. Examples of electronic devices may comprise cellular phones, smartphones, tablets, laptop computers, desktop or personal computers, televisions, personal media players, and/or other similar devices which may process, generate and/or output data. The disclosure, and/or any implementation(s) in accordance therewith, however, are not limited to any particular type of electronic devices.
- the electronic device 100 may comprise a display 110 , which may be used in outputting video or graphical data.
- the display 110 may be utilized to display video content, which may comprise still and/or moving (stream of) images, and/or graphics (including, e.g., textual).
- the video content and/or graphics may comprise or correspond to input data read from storage device or received via broadcast or transmission to the electronic device; user interaction data, such as use menus or other graphic user interface (GUI) like functions; control related information, such as status or error related data; and/or data generated by and/or in conjunction with applications or programs run or executed by or on the electronic devices.
- GUI graphic user interface
- the display 110 may support multi-window display operations.
- multi-window display operations may comprise configuring multiple display regions (or windows), which may be used to concurrently display a plurality of video contents.
- the number and/or distribution of display regions may be configurable, such as based on user input and/or predetermine preferences, and/or may be dynamically adjusted during display operations.
- the display windows 120 1 and 120 2 may be configured in the display 110 , and may each be associated with one or more particular applications that may generate content and/or information that would be displayed only in the corresponding display window(s).
- commands issued by applications may comprise drawing commands, which may specify graphics, images, and/or video that may be displayed.
- drawing commands may specify a particular region in which the outputted data is to be display.
- a first command, command (1) may specify a particular region ( 130 1 )
- a second command, command (2) may specify a different region ( 130 2 ).
- the drawing commands may be associated with particular windows in the display 110 , such as display windows 120 1 and 120 2 .
- command (1) may be associated with display window 120 1 whereas command (2) may be associated with display window 120 2 .
- command (2) may be associated with display window 120 2 .
- a check may be performed to ensure that the regions specified by the commands coincide (intersect) with the associated display window(s).
- One way to perform that check is by use of clipping operation, which may be performed early when executing drawing commands.
- clipping operation the region specified by drawing command is compared with the allocated display window—if the boundaries of the region that needs to be drawn based on the command do not intersect with the current “clip region” (i.e., allocated display window) then the command is ignored.
- the “clip region” refers to a region of the screen defined by the system and/or the application as needing to be redrawn. Accordingly, use of clipping operation enables ignoring drawing command(s) that may not be related to particular changes, to the corresponding application, that may have occurred. Thus, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , because command (1) region 130 1 is within the corresponding display window 120 1 that command is handled; whereas because command (2) region 130 2 is outside the corresponding display window 120 2 that command is ignored.
- Performing clipping operations for individual command may not be too costly (e.g., in terms of resource use). However, in some instances, clipping operations may result in undesirable delays and/or unnecessary resource use.
- display lists may be utilized by applications running in the electronic device 100 .
- a display list may be used to record a series of drawing commands used by an application to display its video/graphical data via the display 110 .
- Display lists may sometimes be implemented in hierarchical manner—e.g., a display list may contain, or point to other display lists. When display lists are combined in such a way, they may generate series of useless or needlessly expensive operations, such as clipping operations.
- the same drawing command may be included in all of the display lists.
- the clipping operation e.g., determining that the command would be ignored
- handling of drawing commands may be optimized in such scenarios (e.g., multiple display lists), such as by incorporating one or more mechanisms to enable avoiding unnecessarily performing particular functions or operations, such as the clipping operations.
- particular handling information may be setup, during generation or recording of the display lists for example, specifying how to handle particular drawings commands whenever these commands are encountered.
- handling information may be incorporated into the commands themselves, for example, and/or may be associated with the command using separate/dedicated structures (e.g., lookup tables).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a series of display lists. Referring to FIG. 2 , there is shown a series ( 200 ) of display lists 210 1 - 210 M , with M being a non-zero natural number.
- the series 200 may be generated and/or configured by an application to display video data and/or graphics (e.g., user interface) associated therewith.
- Each of the display lists may comprise a plurality of commands—e.g., command (1) to command (N).
- the commands may comprise drawing commands, which may specify graphics, images, and/or video that may be displayed, and/or may further specify how the data is displayed—e.g., by specifying a particular screen region in which the outputted data is to be display.
- at least some of the commands may be repeated in each of the display lists 210 1 - 210 M . For example, the same drawing command may be used to refresh the command region after the same type of update.
- Handling the commands 1-N in each iteration of the display lists 210 1 - 201 M may require performing particular functions and/or operations, such as clipping operations, as described with respect to FIG. 1 . Because most commands may be repeated in each of the display list iterations 1-M, the same operation (e.g., clipping) may be repeated unnecessarily when handling the same command in iteration. Accordingly, in various implementations, handling of drawing commands in the multiple display lists 210 1 - 201 M may be optimized, such as by incorporating one or more measures to enable avoiding unnecessarily repeatedly performing particular functions or operations, such as the clipping operations.
- particular handling information may be setup, during generation or recording of the display lists 210 1 - 201 M , specifying, for example, how to handle particular commands whenever these commands are encountered during each iteration of the display lists 210 1 - 201 M .

Handling the commands issued by the applications may entail performing particular functions or operations. For example, in some instances, such commands may specify a particular region in which the outputted data is to be display. In situations where multi-windows environment is supported and/or utilized by the electronic device 300 , the drawing commands may be associated with particular windows in the display 320 .

- Such handling information may be incorporated into the commands themselves, for example. This is described in more details with respect to FIG. 4A .
- the preconfigured handling information may be associated with the command(s) using separate/dedicated structures (e.g., lookup tables). This is described in more detail with respect to FIG. 4B .
- FIG. 4A is a block diagram illustrating modified command structures for optimizing handling of drawing commands in series of display lists. Referring to FIG. 4A , there is shown command structures 410 , 420 , and 430 .
- Command structure 410 may represent original, unmodified commands as used without handling optimization.
- the command structure 410 may comprise a command operation code field 412 ; followed by window information field 414 , which may comprise information relating to the window associated with the command (e.g., location and/or size of the window); an image pointer 416 , which may point to the image or graphics that are to be displayed whenever the command is issued; and finally a drawing instructions field 418 , which may comprise information pertaining to any particular instructions (e.g., how to draw the image or graphics pointed to by the command) that are applicable whenever the command is executed.
- Command structure 420 may represent an implementation of modified commands that may be used for handling optimization.
- the command structure 420 may comprise a modified command operation code field 422 instead of the command operation code field 412 , with the other fields remaining unchanged.
- modified command operation code field 422 may be larger than the command operation code field 412 , to allow for encoding of handling flags.
- the command operation code field 412 may be 2-byte field
- the modified command operation code field 422 may be a 4-byte field, with the upper two bytes being allocated for setting handling flags, the lower two bytes being allocated to set the operation code.
- Use of the command structure 420 may require changes to the applications issuing the commands, to issue commands based on the modified structure.
- the handlings may be extracted first (e.g., by OR'ing the modified command operation code field 422 with 0xffff0000 to mask off the operation code sub-field while keeping the handling flags sub-fields).
- the handling flags may then be used to determine if any particular handling outcome exists without having to handle the command fully. For example, if the handling flags sub-field comprises a clipping flag, and the clipping flag is set (to indicate clipping region mismatch), the command may simply and promptly be ignored.
- Command structure 430 may represent another implementation of modified commands that may be used for handling optimization.
- the command structure 430 may comprise the same fields as the original command structure 410 (i.e., the command operation code field 412 , the window information field 414 , the image pointer 416 , and the drawing instructions field 418 ).
- the command structure 430 may additionally comprise a handling flags field 432 .
- the handling flags field 432 may be used for setting handling flags (e.g., the clipping flag).
- handling optimization may comprise adding (e.g., by the display list manager 330 ) the handling flags field 432 to issued commands (thus not requiring any changes to the applications issuing the commands).
- Extracting the handling information may simply entail processing the handling flags field 432 as any of the fields in the command structure 430 . Nonetheless, the handling flags field 432 may be processed first, to optimizing handling of the command—e.g., by allowing ignoring the command in instances of clipping mismatches without requiring processing the remaining fields before the mismatch is detected (e.g., by comparing the clip region with the associated screen region(s) or window(s).
- FIG. 4B is a block diagram illustrating lookup table structure for optimizing handling of drawing commands in series of display lists. Referring to FIG. 4B , there is shown a lookup table 450 .
- the lookup table 450 may comprise plurality of entries 460 1 - 460 N . Each entry 460 x may comprise an index field and a handling information field.
- the lookup table 450 may be utilized for enabling command handling optimization. However, instead of encoding the handling information in the commands themselves, use of the lookup table 450 may enable encoding the handling information in a separate data structure, thus leaving issuance and processing of the command unaltered. In this regard, an instance of the table 450 may be maintained by the display list manager 330 to setup preconfigured handling information for commands in the display lists, especially in repeated display lists scenarios.
- the preconfigured handling information may then be used to expedite handling of the commands by enabling determining when to skip the command based on predetermined outcome of particular operation (e.g., clipping operation).
- the command index field of a particular lookup table entry 460 x may be used to map the lookup table entry to particular command in a display list (e.g., based on the command order in the display list).
- index ( 3 ) in the lookup table 450 i.e., index field of lookup table entry 460 3
- the handling information field of the lookup table entry 460 x may then be used for setting handling information for the corresponding command.
- the command's index in the display list (e.g., order within the list) may be used as pointer into the corresponding the entry in the lookup table 450 , and the handling information field of mapped lookup table entry may then be extracted to determined how the command is handled (e.g., if it is skipped).
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart that illustrates handling of drawing commands in accordance with record-time clipping optimization. Referring to FIG. 5 , there is shown a flow chart 500 comprising a plurality of exemplary steps for optimizing clipping operations in an electronic device, such as device 300 .
- a check whether a presently handled command is a drawing command may be performed. In instances where it may be determined that the present command is a drawing command, the process may be proceed (to step 504 ); otherwise the process may terminate. In step 504 , a check whether preconfigured handling information is available may be performed. In instances where it may be determined that preconfigured handling information for the present command is available, the process may be proceed (to step 506 ); otherwise the process may terminate.
- the preconfigured handling information for the present command may be obtained. This may be done, for example, by extracting the preconfigured handling information from the present command itself in instances where that information is incorporated into the command (as shown in FIG. 4A ); or by obtaining the preconfigured handling information from a dedicated/external structure, such as the lookup table 450 of FIG. 4B , by using the present command index in the pertinent display list as index of the corresponding entry in the lookup table 450 .
- the present command may be handled based on obtained preconfigured handling information.
- the preconfigured handling information may specify outcome of clipping operation applicable to the present command (e.g., specifying that the command is ignored due to improper clip region).
- implementations may provide a non-transitory computer readable medium and/or storage medium, and/or a non-transitory machine readable medium and/or storage medium, having stored thereon, a machine code and/or a computer program having at least one code section executable by a machine and/or a computer, thereby causing the machine and/or computer to perform the steps as described herein for record-time clipping optimization in display list structures.
