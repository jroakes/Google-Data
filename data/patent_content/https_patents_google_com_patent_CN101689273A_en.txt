The eCPC parameter can be used to develop a model that could be used to charge advertisers on a CPA basis while crediting publishers on a CPC basis.
Description
Related application
It is the U.S. Provisional Application No.60/916 of " Metric Conversion ForOnline Advertising (being used for the conversion of measuring of online advertisement) " that the application requires in the title that on May 4th, 2007 submitted to, the rights and interests of the right of priority of 260 35 U.S.C. § 119, its full content is incorporated in this by reference.
Technical field
The application's theme relate generally to online advertisement.
Background technology
Mutual medium (for example, the Internet) have the great potential that improvement is directed to advertisement (" ad ") audient.For example, number of site provides the information search function based on the keyword of user's input of seeking information.This user inquiring can be the designator of user's interest information type.By comparing the lists of keywords of user inquiring and advertiser's appointment, can provide targeted ads to the user.
The another kind of form of online advertisement is advertisement polymerization (ad syndication), and it allows the advertiser by ad distribution is expanded their market scope to other partners.For example, the online publisher of third party can throw in advertiser's text or image ad on the web assets with expectation content, to impel the website of online client to this advertiser.
In some online advertising system, the advertiser pays based on the cost that whenever flashes (CPM) (for example, the cost that each flashes for thousand times), with the visibility of the advertisement that increases them and make up the brand awareness of their advertisement.The advertiser can be in each expense that payment is fixed when the consumer illustrates advertisement.Usually consult the CPM price at independently advertisement or advertising campaign are next with each publisher, for example, hold consultation by publisher's profitable or by the price of the product of advertising.
The advertiser who considers the conversion of the low number that generates from advertisement can come advertisement paying for them based on every click cost (CPC).In every click cost (CPC) system, the advertiser can pay fixing expense when each consumer clicks advertisement.The CPC system often is associated with auction market, and wherein, advertiser and other advertisers bid at the cost of clicking.Most of CPC advertising income of today is bidded from keyword, and wherein, the advertiser is for to bid from the click of the advertisement that is attached to particular keywords.
In other online advertising system, the advertiser can come the advertisement paying for them based on every action cost (CPA) model that usefulness drives, in this model, only to such as sell or the qualified action of registration is paid rather than with reach the market that this sale or registration be associated and become originally the advertiser to be chargeed.
From advertiser's viewpoint, because the CPA advertisement may have lower commercial risks and less invalid clicks, the CPA advertisement is more desirable than CPC advertisement sometimes.For example, CPA price structure is not come the book keeping operation of advertiser's debit at the click of the transaction that is not converted to particular types, and can be not easy to be subjected to concentrate on the influence of " click fraud " of CPC advertisement.Because often being difficult to exactly to CPM advertisement more fixes a price to reflect the true value of advertisement to the advertiser, so CPA price structure is also desirable than CPM price structure.The advertisement of CPM price also need be carried out persistent surveillance by the advertiser, so that determine the commercial effect (for example, by following the tracks of clicking rate, putting and click the number that is converted to purchase and/or action) of these advertisements.In the CPA advertisement, not too need such supervision.
Different with the advertiser, the publisher prefers being compensated based on CPC and/or CPM price structure, so that how the number of changing all generates income.Thereby the business motive that the publisher has seldom goes to participate in the CPA advertisement, has limited the publisher's of advertisement CPA advertisement number.
Summary of the invention
The advertiser specifies orientation bid (for example, the CPA orientation is bidded or other orientation) for the change event that is associated with advertisement.Come (for example, rule of thumb) to be identified for the conversion ratio or the value of the potential prediction of flashing of advertisement based on the translation data that is used for advertisement (for example, historical translation data) and a border data of flashing (for example, current a border data of flashing).The conversion ratio of prediction and directed bidding can be used to estimate based on bidding of clicking.The publisher can be based on being compensated based on bidding of clicking of estimation, and can use the orientation of original appointment to bid to advertiser's debit meter account.
In some embodiments, can come predictive conversion rate better by the calculation correction coefficient.The iterative process (for example, passing through learning model) of the deviation mistake of conversion ratio that for example, can the prediction of using compensation in the period of bidding is come the calculation correction coefficient.Iterative process can adopt historical usefulness data to obtain the bidding based on click of accurately estimation.Can automatically adjust correction coefficient in adaptive mode, with the variation or the fluctuation of the conversion ratio that alleviates prediction so that according to this orientation bid produce accurate estimation based on bidding of clicking.
In some embodiments, can in the single period of bidding, repeatedly upgrade correction coefficient, perhaps in a plurality of periods, upgrade correction coefficient.This feedback policy can be reduced in the conversion ratio of prediction and any deviation between the actual conversion ratio.
In some embodiments, a kind of method comprises: the input that obtains to specify first measurement value that is associated with advertisement; Be identified for the conversion ratio of the potential prediction of flashing of this advertisement; Conversion ratio based on this first measurement value and this prediction is estimated second measurement value; Compensate based on this second measurement value; And carry out debit meter account based on this first measurement value.This first measurement value can be based on the value of every action cost model, and this second measurement value can be based on the value of every click cost model.As an alternative, this first measurement value can be based on one value in every click cost model or the every action cost model, and this second measurement value can be based on the value of the cost model that whenever flashes.
In another embodiment, a kind of system comprises processor and computer-readable medium, and this computer-readable medium is couple to processor with being operated.Computer-readable medium comprises instruction, when this processor is carried out this instruction, makes this processor carry out following operation, comprising: the input that obtains to specify first measurement value that is associated with advertisement; Be identified for the conversion ratio of the potential prediction of flashing of this advertisement; Conversion ratio based on this first measurement value and this prediction is estimated second measurement value; Compensate based on this second measurement value; And carry out debit meter account based on this first measurement value.
Disclose other embodiment of measuring conversion that is used for online advertisement, comprised embodiment at system, method, device, computer-readable medium and user interface.

The position of the advertisement in the document of user 218 visit can also be at least in part based on the rank of advertisement.For example, the advertisement of higher ranked can be placed the advertisement of relatively low rank more outstanding or the discernible position of vision.No matter whether the user has selected this advertisement, presents to user's advertisement and the user is visited when presenting to the user with this advertisement document and can be forwarded to advertisement rank model to create empirical model, so that improve the advertisement rank.
Advertising campaign, advertisement time slot and advertisement putting are bidded
Return with reference to figure 1, each advertiser 102 can set up the advertisement program by Advertising Management System 104.The advertisement program can comprise, for example, and advertising campaign, intention, directed or the like.Advertiser 102 can define " advertising campaign ", and " advertising campaign " can comprise one or more advertisement groups, and each advertisement group comprises one or more advertisements.The advertisement group can define, for example, product type (for example, cap or pants), and intention can comprise the advertisement of text ground or figure ground definition product type.Each advertisement group or each advertisement can comprise Start Date, Close Date, budget information, geographical directed information and aggregation information.
Each advertisement or advertisement group can comprise independent pricing information (for example, cost, average unit cost or maximum cost (whenever flash, every selection, revolution change or the like)).For example, advertiser 102 can utilize Advertising Management System 104 specify about advertiser 102 be willing to mean that every user clicks, the flashing or change the maximum monetary value how much is paid of every advertisement or every advertisement group.Maximum monetary value can be based on the number (for example, CPC bids) of the number that flashes that generates in response to advertisement (for example, CPM bids), click advertisement or the number (for example, CPA bids) of conversion.For example, if advertiser 102 has selected the CPC Competitive Bidding Model, then advertiser 102 can import maximum CPC and bids, and its expression advertiser 102 when receiving click with advertisement group associated advertisement is ready the highest number paid.As another example, if advertiser 102 has selected the CPA Competitive Bidding Model, then advertiser 102 can import maximum CPA and bids, and its expression is ready the highest number paid when generating advertiser when changing with this advertisement group associated advertisement.Based on the Competitive Bidding Model of definition, can carry out the credit book keeping operation and can correspondingly carry out the debit book keeping operation for publisher 106 to advertiser 102.
When receiving ad-request, the corresponding advertisement of the ad-request of discerning and receiving.If discerned advertisement, then can auction with identification to distribute which advertisement more than one.During auctioning, can come rank is carried out in advertisement according to the advertising campaign parameter of one or more associations.One or more advertising campaign parameters can include but not limited to, bids by default (for example, CPC, CPA or CPM bid), by budget every day of advertiser 102 definition (for example, in the register advertisements activity) and can be by the correlativity of the definite advertisement of various methods, such as passing through to infer the high correlation of advertisement about for example specific keyword query.
The auction before or in the register advertisements activity, advertiser 102 can define the advertising campaign parameter or be used for advertisement is carried out the auction coefficient of rank.For example, the advertiser can import maximum CPM, the CPC or the CPA that are used for each advertisement group and bids.The combination that advertiser 102 can also use advertisement group interior maximum CPM, CPC and CPA to bid.For example, the advertiser can submit to the maximum CPC of the input that is used for the keyword orientation to bid and the maximum CPM that is used for the input of website orientation bids.
In some embodiments, advertising campaign parameter or the auction coefficient to definition carries out rank.For example, Advertising Management System 104 can be selected advertiser's bids by default from being up to lowland, and from being up to lowland advertiser's bids by default is carried out rank.As another example, can carry out rank to auction coefficient from being up to minimum ground such as click-through rate (CTR) and conversion ratio (CVR).
Click-through rate (CTR) is a kind of tolerance that is used for determining ad quality or advertising results.CTR represents that when presenting given advertising creative to the user given advertisement obtains the mark of the number of times of " click ".Point advances advertisement can mobilizing function, such as, browser is pointed to again the landing page or the webpage that provides by the advertiser.The CTR of advertisement can be confirmed as identification when this advertisement is presented, the frequency that this advertisement is accessed.Can advance number by the point relevant and calculate the CTR of advertisement divided by the number that flashes of the advertisement in the preset time section with this advertisement.
Think that " conversion " is to occur when finishing the transaction relevant with the advertisement of before having distributed as the user.The incident that constitutes conversion can be according to circumstances and different, and can determine with many modes.For example, can be following situation, before clicking advertisement, quote advertiser's webpage and leaving this webpage, the user finishes when buying changing.As an alternative, conversion can be defined as to the user advertisement being shown, and this user buys on (for example, seven days) inherent advertiser's the webpage at the fixed time.Many other definition that constitute the incident of conversion also are possible.For example, conversion can also comprise the member that is registered as the website, fills in online form, buy or the like when contacting with the advertiser via online intention.
In general, the number of the conversion of advertisement is considered to conversion ratio usually with the ratio of the number of the click of advertisement.In some embodiments, conversion ratio can be defined as:
Can also be weighted advertising campaign parameter or auction coefficient, to increase or to reduce of the influence of auction coefficient the advertisement rank.For example, even, having the advertisement of higher CTR more than or equal to bidding of giving tacit consent to, the advertisement with low CTR also may be had more than the advertisement of hanging down CTR by rank.
Be used for each advertisement is carried out the weighting score value of rank in generation, the weight between various auction coefficients can be adjusted on demand, and can comprise other coefficient.Based on the rank of determining during auctioning (and its any adjustment that causes owing to the score value of weighting), the advertisement that can select to discern presents.For example, if in the webpage of four advertisement positions, present the advertisement of this identification with advertisement of each demonstration, then can select four the advertisement of high rank present.And the rank of setting up during auctioning can be used for determining DISPLAY ORDER.For example, the advertisement that rank is the highest can be assigned to the most outstanding display position.
For instance, suppose three advertisers are arranged in the auction of the advertisement putting in the advertisement position is bidded, wherein, advertiser " A " has the maximum CPC Jing Jia $0.75 that is used for text advertisements, advertiser " B " has the maximum CPC Jing Jia $0.50 that is used for text advertisements, and advertiser " C " has the maximum CPC Jing Jia $1.00 that is used for text advertisements, so CPM (" the eCPM ") level that can be converted to estimation by maximum CPC is bidded and this result and CPM bidded compare to determine the winner of auction.Can multiply each other maximum CPC bidded by the click-through rate (pCTR) that CPC is bidded and multiply by 1000 prediction converts eCPM to, can be provided by [2] usually:
eCPM
CPC＝1000*pCTR*CPC
BID [2]
The result that CPC bids multiply by coefficient 1000, is each thousand cost value of flashing so that bid CPC extensive with the product of pCTR.In some embodiments, can use historical data (for example, advancing data) to derive pCTR by learning model 202.
Among the advertiser (advertiser " A ", advertiser " B " and advertiser " C ") any one defines that maximum CPM bids but not in the embodiment that maximum CPC bids therein, and then eCPM and CPM bid identically, can be provided by [3] usually:
eCPM
CPM＝CPM
BID [3]
The CPM that equation [3] provides the CPM of estimation to equal advertiser's appointment bids.For example, if the advertiser specifies the CPM Jing Jia $5 that flashes for per thousand times, also Shi $5 of eCPM so.
In some embodiments, Advertising Management System 104 can provide the CPA of recommendation to bid to advertiser 102.Each the directed CPA that advertiser 102 can use the CPA of this recommendation to bid as advertiser's advertisement group bids, rather than maximum CPC bids or maximum CPM bids.Usually, because the CPA pricing model is only for the point of conversion advances the book keeping operation of advertiser's debit, maximum CPC bids and maximum CPM bids so compare, and the advertiser prefers selecting directed CPA to bid.
To calculate eCPM in order bidding, to should be appreciated that and to bid and conversion ratio defines directed CPA and bids according to current C PC according to directed CPA.For instance, have maximum CPC Jing Jia $0.30 and put the conversion ratio 5% of advancing if the advertiser is current, then directed CPA bids Shi $6.00 ($6.00=$0.30/5%).In fact, advertiser's maximum CPC bids usually according to advertisement and according to the keyword of single advertisement and difference.Under these circumstances, can use following formula to calculate directed CPA bids:
Wherein the molecule of [4] be the advertiser receives during section correlation time (for example, the middle of the month in the past) whole points hit that " N " individual maximum CPC bids and, and the denominator of [4] is caused the total number of " M " individual conversion by these clicks.When other CPC that bids when top embodiment relates to maximum CPC, bids such as directed CPC bids, consider that also average CPC bids and minimum CPC.
In some embodiments, advertiser 214 can specify in the acquiescence that is used for each keyword or advertisement group in the advertising campaign based on bidding (for example, maximum CPC) of clicking and orientation bid (for example, directed CPA bids) the two.When translation data 208 is not useable for or is not enough to doing like this (for example, because new advertisement or advertisement group), give tacit consent to maximum CPC and bid and to be used to predict the conversion ratio of advertisement or advertisement group.For example, can bid to bid and estimate conversion ratio by giving tacit consent to maximum CPC divided by directed CPA.As an alternative, when not having enough information to do like this, give tacit consent to maximum CPC and bid and to be used as default value, and need not the predictive conversion rate.
In some embodiments, can the orientation of advertiser's 214 appointments be bidded by Advertisement Server 206 and offer learning model 204, wherein, orientation is bidded and can be made up with the conversion ratio of prediction, bids to produce maximum CPC new or that adjust.For example, learning model 202 can be used for calculating by the number that collection is used for interested each flash a click of border feature and conversion and is used for the pCVR that potential advertisement is flashed.As discussed above, the ratio of the number (for example, the number of the sale that generates by given advertisement) that conversion ratio has defined the conversion of advertisement and the number of clicking the advertisement number to advertiser's web asset access of advertisement (that is, from).Therefore, can come compute statistics based on these numbers that in the predictive conversion rate, use.In case determined pCVR, this parameter just can be with the orientation use (for example, multiply by orientation and bid) of bidding, with the acquiescence of automatically adjusting the advertiser based on bidding (for example, maximum CPC bids) of clicking or calculate new based on bidding of clicking.
In some embodiments, learning model 202 is to comprise being used for the rules learning system model of a border Feature Mapping to the conversion ratio prediction that flash.This rule can comprise, for example, is used for the probability multiplier of each border feature.For example, probability multiplier 0.85 can be assigned to user, and probability multiplier 1.1 can be assigned to the advertisement that occurs on specific news website from the U.S..For the predictive conversion rate, the probability multiplier of acquiescence conversion ratio and each correlated characteristic is multiplied each other.Use above example, on specific news website to from the advertisement shown in the user of the U.S. with acquiescence conversion ratio of 0.2%, the conversion ratio of the prediction of described advertisement can be 0.187% (0.2%*1.1*0.85).
In some embodiments, pCVR can be used to calculate or adjust advertiser's bid (for example, maximum CPC bids) based on click.For example, the conversion ratio of Shi $50 and prediction is 2% if the directed CPA of advertiser's appointment bids, and can use following formula with the maximum CPC Tiao Zhengwei $1 automatically that bids so:
Maximum CPC (adjustment)=CPA
BID* pCVR [5]
If there are not enough translation data to can be used for calculating pCVR, the maximum CPC of the acquiescence of advertiser's appointment bids to be used as and measures so, collected the enough translation data that are used for this advertisement up to, at this moment [5] can be used for automatically calculating or adjust maximum CPC and bid.In the process of advertising campaign, translation data 208 (and learning model 202) alternatively can little by little change along with accumulating more multidata, and a border of flashing simultaneously changes according to auction.These variations can cause the calculating of new pCVR.Then, new pCVR can be used for [5] " run mode (on-the-fly) ", makes the maximum CPC of acquiescence that can automatically and continuously calculate or adjust the advertiser during advertising campaign or auction bid.
Based on [5], can bid the CPM of calculation expectation according to the conversion ratio of the click-through rate (pCTR) of prediction, prediction and directed or maximum CPA.The CPM of this expectation can be used for using suitable measuring to determine to bid in the winning of ad auction of advertising results being carried out rank.For example, the usefulness of the advertisement estimation or the cost-effectively (eCPM) that can flash by each thousand times of advertisement measured.That is to say that the usefulness of advertisement can be measured by present the income number that advertisement generates for 1,000 times to the user.Can be by the item CPC in the replacement [2] of bidding with [5] middle CPC that defines
BIDCalculate eCPM to produce [6] next bidding according to directed CPA.
eCPM
CPA＝1000*pCTR*pCVR*CPA
BID [6]
Equation [6] has defined the CPA that can utilize advertiser's 214 appointments and has bidded at each conversion publisher's 216 credits to be kept accounts.Though equation [6] has reduced advertiser's risk by specifying the CPA pricing model, the publisher does not make full use of and supports this method.Particularly, if only when conversion takes place, just compensate the publisher, so with compensate the publisher based on the number of clicking or flash and compare the commercial risks that publisher's commitment is outer.Even the payment net amount to the publisher is identical (compensate or be compensated by the number of clicking by being converted to) in two kinds of models in total, because the low changeability that CPC or CPM pricing model relate to, the publisher prefers being compensated based on the number of clicking.Correspondingly, in some embodiments, can come the CPC that determines estimation bid (eCPC) that bids based on data predicted (for example, the conversion ratio of prediction) according to directed CPA.The eCPC parameter can be used to develop the model that can be used in coming based on CPC based on CPA the advertiser to be chargeed in for the book keeping operation of publisher's credit.
In order to calculate the eCPC that is used for the CPC advertisement, should be appreciated that eCPC indication CPC effective or estimation bids.In desirable market, effectively or the CPC of estimation to bid should be that the actual CPC of advertiser's appointment bids.Given should the relation, as in equation [2] the definition CPC bid the item can be taken as eCPC:
eCPM
CPC＝1000*pCTR*CPC
BID [7]
eCPM
CPC＝1000*pCTR*eCPC [8]
Based on equation [6], can followingly determine the eCPC of definition in equation [8]:
eCPC＝pCVR*CPA
BID [10]
Equation [10] allows publisher 216 to be compensated according to click, according to conversion advertiser's 214 debits is kept accounts simultaneously.In brief, can estimate the CPA advertisement in real time, to determine the CPC advertisement of equivalence when distributing the time.When the user clicks advertisement, the data that reception in real time and click (and translation data) are associated.No matter whether the user will change, and the publisher can be compensated by the number of clicking, and advertiser 214 can be chargeed by conversion.Because the publisher does not bear any extra risk or responsibility except needed in the CPC pricing model, so this method causes that effectively the publisher participates in the power of CPA advertisement, this will cause distributing extra CPA advertisement to user 218.Because only the CPA advertisement, so this method is also obviously favourable to the advertiser and prevents at not generating flashing or clicking the advertiser is chargeed of transaction just to the book keeping operation of advertiser's debit when generating conversion.
Under the situation of desirable pCVR, wish that the expense for the book keeping operation of publisher's credit should be identical with the expense that the advertiser is chargeed.Yet, in the embodiment of the reality that predicted conditions may change, can be always not accurate by the pCVR that learning model 202 calculates.Situation can comprise various factors, for example, and not enough or inconsistent translation data.In some cases, these factors may make pCVR cross prediction (over-predict) or owe prediction (under-predict) conversion ratio.Inaccurate can causing in income that the publisher generates (that is deviation between eCPC).For example, if pCVR is crossed prediction (for example, from 0.1% to 0.2%), may come at the advertisement of each demonstration so the publisher to be carried out the credit book keeping operation with every click cost higher than real cost.As another example,, then may use than specifying the lower number of number that receives under the pricing model to compensate the publisher if pCVR is owed prediction (for example, from 0.1% to 0.05%).
In order to compensate this pCVR deviation, in some embodiments, the correction coefficient γ that can calculate the deviation of the conversion ratio that is adapted to predict or fluctuation can and incorporate it into [10].ECPC with correction coefficient γ can be provided by [11] usually:
In some embodiments, can use iterative process (for example, feedback loop) (for example) to calculate the correction coefficient γ in [11], the pCVR deviation mistake of this iterative process compensation in the period of bidding by learning model 202.Iterative process can adopt historical usefulness data to obtain accurate eCPC.Can automatically adjust correction coefficient γ in adaptive mode,, draw the CPC of accurate estimation so that bid according to CPA with the variation or the fluctuation of the conversion ratio that alleviates prediction.
In some embodiments, iteration be can carry out, predetermined value, dynamic value or other optimal value of determining reached up to correction coefficient.In some embodiments, before carrying out iteration,, can (for example, by learning model 202) estimate correction coefficient such as before the iteration of carrying out threshold number.In other embodiments, if correction coefficient has changed amount less than threshold value after the specific iteration, so no longer carry out other iteration.
In some embodiments, can in the single period of bidding, repeatedly upgrade correction coefficient γ, perhaps in a plurality of periods, upgrade correction coefficient γ.This feedback policy can any pCVR deviation of balance.For example, predicted actual conversion ratio if determined that pCVR in the given period of bidding crosses, can in the period of bidding subsequently, adjust correction coefficient γ so to offset by crossing the mode (for example, by the CVR of increasing or decreasing correction coefficient γ) of predicting the difference that causes to equal to predict.Similarly, owed to predict actual conversion ratio if determined the pCVR in the given period of bidding, can in the period of bidding subsequently, adjust correction coefficient γ by the mode of owing to predict caused difference (for example, by the incremental change or the CVR of correction coefficient γ that successively decrease) so to equal to owe to predict to offset.
In some embodiments, correction coefficient γ can be defined as usually:
Wherein,
Based on CPC is the quantity of CPA advertisement to publisher's payment
And,
The quantity of collecting from the advertiser for the conversion in the CPA advertisement
Parameter alpha
(CPC, t)Defined the total total value of in bid the period " t ", the publisher being paid, and parameter beta
(CPA, t)Defined the total total value of in bid the period " t ", the advertiser being chargeed.Bid the period " t " can comprise data, such as the time of beginning and the end of the period of bidding, and can define according to flashing or clicking number.For example, bid the period " t " can have 10 conversions or click for 100 times) threshold value.As another example, the threshold value that bid the period " t " can have 50 conversions or click for 500 times.In some embodiments, the value of " t " of bidding the period can be adjusted to the permission parameter alpha
(CPC, t)And β
(CPA, t)Stability.
Parameter alpha
(CPC, t)And β
(CPA, t)Can be based on the clicks that in bid the period " t ", increases, number and cost flash.In some embodiments, these data can be stored in the translation data storage vault 208.In general, each bid the period " t " is corresponding with two time intervals of bidding between upgrading.Yet some can not comprise at interval, and for example, enough translation data are come calculation correction coefficient gamma reliably (for example, not reaching the predetermined threshold that flashes for 5000 times that click for per 500 times).Therefore, in some embodiments, a plurality of continuous periods can be added up to single bidding the period.In other embodiments, correction coefficient γ can be defaulted as 1, and in case reach data threshold, just can be adjusted or reappraise, notice that on average, correction coefficient γ can (for example increase along with advertiser and publisher's number, when this number near more than 1,000,000) and, this means that the paying to the publisher is identical with the expense of collecting from the advertiser near 1.In some embodiments, this expense can be that pre-income is divided into, and can follow any expense of deciding through consultation with Advertising Management System 104.
After initial pCVR was set, correction coefficient γ can be upgraded periodically, to compensate the accurate eCPC that potential pCVR deviation and acquisition are used for the next time period (for example, one hour, one day, a week or the like).The data that are used for the correction coefficient γ of definite scheduled time slot " t " can be from each provenance.For example, when definite parameter alpha
(CPC, t)And β
(CPA, t)The time, can income, the pricing model that the revolution of advertisement changes is provided and bid and click-through rate by the advertiser, and conversion ratio information can be followed the tracks of by Advertising Management System 104.
These parameters are measured therebetween bid the period " t " can rule of thumb come to determine, perhaps determines based on historical data.For instance, suppose in seven days receive and record (and study from learning model 202) translation data that is associated with conversion, the so experiential period of bidding can be set to allow with parameter alpha over seven days
(CPC, t)And β
(CPA, t)The reflection translation data.In some embodiments, can be frequently or adjust periodically and bid the period " t ", to guarantee to reduce parameter beta
(CPA, t)And α
(CPC, t)Between difference.In another embodiment, can select to bid the period " t " guarantee that the active data amount can be used for determining parameter alpha
(CPC, t)And β
(CPA, t)
Work as parameter beta
(CPA, t)And α
(CPC, t)When being (that is, indication also is based on the number of CPC to the expectation of publisher's payment based on the expense number that receives from the advertiser of CPA pricing model) that equates on mathematics, will to draw correction coefficient γ be 1 to equation [12] so.In this case, the CPA that the conversion ratio pCVR that eCPC may equal to predict multiply by advertiser's appointment bids, and has represented to the number of publisher's payment consistent with the number that the advertiser is chargeed.
Work as parameter alpha
(CPC, t)Greater than β
(CPA, t)The time, correction coefficient γ is greater than 1 so.In this case, pay publisher's expense number greater than the expense of collecting from the advertiser based on the CPA pricing model based on CPC.Thereby, in the period of bidding subsequently, can proofread and correct eCPC by item 1/ γ, make eCPC become less than the previous period of bidding with the excess charges of compensation to the publisher.
Work as parameter alpha
(CPC, t)Less than β
(CPA, t)The time, correction coefficient γ is less than 1 so.In this case, the expense of collecting from the advertiser based on the CPA pricing model is greater than the expense number of paying the publisher based on CPC, and the expense that the publisher is paid in its indication is less than the expense that may collect under traditional CPA model.Thereby in the period of bidding subsequently, eCPC can proofread and correct eCPC by item 1/ γ, makes eCPC become greater than previous bidding the period, with the not enough expense of compensation to the publisher.
Though top embodiment is described about the estimation CPC that bids according to directed CPA, other embodiment also is suitable for.For example, also consider to estimate the embodiment of CPM (for example, being the book keeping operation of publisher's credit) based on CPM about bid according to directed CPC (for example, the advertiser being chargeed) based on CPC.In these embodiments, can bid with directed CPC and replace the CPM that directed CPA bids and estimates to calculate.As another example, can come the advertiser is chargeed based on CPA or CPC, can come to be the book keeping operation of publisher's credit based on CPM simultaneously.In this example, the advertiser can utilize Advertising Management System to specify to be willing to mean about the advertiser that every user in response to advertisement or advertisement group clicks or revolution changes how much maximum monetary value of payment.Can come the CPM of calculation expectation according to this CPC or CPA value.The CPM of expectation can be used for being identified for compensating related publisher's corresponding credit volume.
In general, can guarantee in bid the period " t " that rule of thumb determine, pay publisher's number and the difference of the number that charges to the advertiser will be less than predetermined value as the converting system of measuring described here.System also guarantees in bid the period " t ", pays publisher's number and the number that charges to the advertiser will can be not depart from greater than predetermined value.
