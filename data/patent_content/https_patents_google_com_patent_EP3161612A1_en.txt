- computing devices and/or systems employing the techniques described herein may increase computational efficiency (by, e.g., avoiding redundant processing, avoiding parallel-processing hazards of operating on the same data, and/or improving device battery life).
- designating a single device to do so may ensure that a single device expends energy in the process, and that a single device performs actions responsive to the receipt of predetermined audio command.
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing environment 1 that includes a plurality of computing devices 2A-2C (collectively, "computing devices 2") configured to process audio input, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- computing devices 2 may include, but are not limited to, portable, mobile, or other devices, such as mobile phones (including smartphones), wearable computing devices (e.g., smartwatches, head-mounted devices, etc.), personal digital assistants (PDAs), in- vehicle devices (e.g., stereo systems, navigation systems, etc.), tablet computers, smart television platforms, laptop computers, desktop computers, server computers, mainframes, and the like.

- computing device 2A may be a smartphone
- computing device 2B may be an in- vehicle stereo/ navigation system
- computing device 2C may be a smartwatch.
- computing devices 2 may include additional computing devices, different computing devices, or fewer computing devices. That is, while described in the example of FIG. 1 with reference to three computing devices, computing devices 2 may include two computing devices, four computing devices, or more computing devices of various types.
- Computing devices 2 as shown in the example of FIG. 1, include respective communication units 4A-4C (collectively, "communication units 4").
- Each of communication units 4 may be operable to communicate with external devices via one or more wired and/or wireless networks by transmitting and/or receiving network signals on the one or more networks. Examples of
- communication units 4 include a network interface card (e.g. such as an Ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Additional examples of communication units 4 may include Near-Field Communications (NFC) units, Bluetooth radios, short wave radios, cellular data radios, wireless network (WiFi) radios, infrared communication ports, as well as universal serial bus (USB) controllers. In other words, each of communication units 4 may be means by which the respective one of computing devices 2 may communicate with any other device, such as with each other.
- NFC Near-Field Communications
- Bluetooth radios Bluetooth radios
- short wave radios cellular data radios
- WiFi wireless network
- USB universal serial bus
- each of communication units 4 may be means by which the respective one of computing devices 2 may communicate with any other device, such as with each other.
- computing devices 2 include respective audio input modules 6A-6C (collectively, "audio input modules 6").
- Each of audio input modules 4 may be operable to monitor the environment of the respective computing device for audio input and process the audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- the environment of a computing device may represent the real-world area immediately surrounding the computing device (e.g., within 1 meter of the computing device, within 5 meters of the computing device, within the same room as the computing device, or other designated area).
- a predetermined audio command generally, may be any audio input (e.g., a word, a phrase, etc.) that that is usable to initiate interaction with a computing device.
- predetermined audio commands may be specific audio input for which a computing device may monitor environmental audio and that a user may use without having to otherwise inform the computing device that he or she is about to provide audio input.
- One or more of audio input modules 6 may associate a predetermined audio command with an action to be performed by the respective computing device. For instance, one or more of audio input modules 6 may associate a word or phrase
- predetermined audio inputs and associated actions may include a word or phrase (e.g., "answer") that causes a computing device to answer a telephone call, a word or phrase (e.g., "answer") that causes a computing device to answer a telephone call, a word or phrase (e.g., "answer"
- predetermined audio commands may be user-configurable. That is, a user may create, modify, enable, disable, or discard various predetermined audio commands.
- which predetermined audio commands a computing device is configured to act on may be determined (e.g., by the computing device) based on a number of other criteria, such as the applications installed at the computing device, the applications executing at the computing device, the time of day, or other criteria.
- each of audio input modules 4 may require permission from a user of the respective one of computing devices 2. That is, each of audio input modules 4 may perform operations to obtain permission from a user prior to monitoring the environment around the respective computing device for audio input and/or processing the audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command. For instance, audio input module 4A may cause computing device 2A to output a prompt to the user, asking for permission to monitor audio from the environment of computing device 2A. Audio input module 4A may only monitor for audio input in response to receiving confirmation from the user. In some examples, permission to monitor
- environmental audio may be transient or situation specific.
- permission may be more persistent. That is, in various examples, a user may grant permission to monitor environmental audio for a short duration of time, for a long duration of time, only in specific situations, and/or until the user revokes permission.
- an audio input module may monitor for audio input by obtaining audio (e.g., via a microphone or other audio sensor) from the environment around the respective computing device and processing obtained audio input to determine whether a predetermined audio command is included in the audio input.
- audio input modules may be operable to utilize speech recognition techniques to determine text from obtained audio input, and compare the text to a set of predetermined audio commands (e.g., stored at the respective computing device or other location) to determine whether the obtained audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- computing devices 2 may all monitor environmental audio for audio input that includes a predetermined audio command. That is, in some examples, computing devices 2 may not be communicating with one another or otherwise associated with one another in any way and, consequently, each of audio input modules 4 may be monitoring the environment of the respective computing device for audio input that includes predetermined audio commands. If each of audio input modules 4 is monitoring a different environment, then audio input received by one of computing devices 2 may not be received by another of computing devices 2. For instance, a user may be wearing computing device 2C (the smartwatch) while in his or her kitchen.
- computing device 2C the smartwatch
- Computing device 2A (the smartphone) may be in the user's bedroom and computing device 2B (the in-vehicle stereo/navigation system) may be in the user's garage.
- computing device 2C may receive audio input that includes a predetermined audio command (e.g., "Hello device") while computing devices 2A and 2B each receive audio input that does not include a predetermined audio command. Consequently, only computing device 2C may perform a corresponding action (e.g., entering an audio input mode) because only computing device 2C was monitoring the environment in which the predetermined audio command was used (e.g., the kitchen).
- a predetermined audio command e.g., "Hello device”
- computing devices 2A and 2B each receive audio input that does not include a predetermined audio command. Consequently, only computing device 2C may perform a corresponding action (e.g., entering an audio input mode) because only computing device 2C was monitoring the environment in which the predetermined audio command was used (e.g., the kitchen).
- audio input received by one of computing devices 2 may be received by one or more others of computing devices 2.
- two or more of computing devices 2 may each process the audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- the two or more computing devices may each determine that the audio input includes a predetermined audio command and may each perform the corresponding action.
- Two or more computing devices monitoring the same environment for audio input that includes a predetermined audio command may waste processing power and/or battery life through duplicative monitoring of environmental audio as well as through duplicative processing of received audio input.
- two or more computing devices performing the same action may, in some examples, give rise to parallel-processing concerns. For instance, if two computing devices receive the predetermined audio command "Hello device,” both computing devices may, in some examples, enter an audio input mode.
- any audio command included in audio input may be received by both computing devices.
- both computing devices may attempt to access a "Song 1" audio file (e.g., located at a remote location) at nearly the same time.
- one computing device may begin playing "Song 1" while the other returns an error.
- both computing devices may begin playing "Song 1.”
- both computing devices may return an error.
- Other examples of parallel-processing concerns may include two or more computing devices attempting to place a phone call, two or more computing devices attempting to create or modify a calendar entry, or otherwise create, access, modify, or delete the same data. Monitoring an environment for audio input including predetermined audio commands by only a single computing device may reduce wasted energy, avoid parallel-processing problems, and overall improve the user experience.
- each of computing devices 2 may be associated with one another.
- computing devices 2 may be associated with one another based on the fact that each of computing devices 2 is associated with the same user.
- computing devices 2 may be associated with one another based on established communications links between computing devices 2 via one or more wireless or wired (e.g., physical) links.
- the connections may be established and/or maintained by communication units 4.
- computing devices 2 may be paired or grouped through short-range communication such as the Bluetooth protocol or the
- computing devices 2 may be paired, grouped, or otherwise communicatively connected to one another using another protocol.
- Other examples of wired or wireless connections linking two or more of computing devices 2 may include one or more connections formed via a packet-based network connection (e.g., TCP/IP, etc.) or any other means of communicating data.
- each connection may function independently.
- computing device 2A may communicate with computing device 2B via a first connection and communicate with computing device 2C via a second connection.
- all of computing devices 2 may communicate via one or more shared connections.
- computing devices 2 may each communicate with each other via a bus structure, a token ring structure, a star network structure, or any other structure for shared communication among two or more devices.
- computing devices 2 may determine whether or not they are in physical proximity of one another. That is, one or more of computing devices 2 may determine whether computing devices 2 are close to one another.
- computing devices 2 may determine physical proximity based on the signal strength of the short-range communications. In the example of FIG.
- computing device 2C the smartwatch
- computing device 2A the smartphone
- computing devices 2 may determine physical proximity based additionally or alternatively on physical location. That is, each of computing devices 2 may include a module to determine a physical location of the respective computing device (e.g., via GPS or other means) and computing devices 2 may determine that two devices are physically proximate when the two computing devices' physical locations are substantially the same (e.g., within 5 meters of one another, within 50 meters of one another, or within some other distance). In some examples, computing devices 2 may determine physical proximity by additionally or alternatively communicating via links 8. For instance, computing devices 2 may compare audio input received from the environment and, if the audio input is determined to be substantially the same, computing devices 2 may determine that they are physically proximate to one another.
- computing devices 2 may determine physical proximity based additionally or alternatively on other criteria, such as the existence or non-existence of one or more wireless networks, one or more inputs received from a user, or other criteria. In some examples, computing devices 2 may perform the techniques of the present disclosure without determining physical proximity.
- one or more computing devices from a plurality of computing devices may designate a particular computing device from among the plurality of computing devices to process audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- one or more of computing devices 2 e.g., computing device 2A, computing device 2A and computing device 2B, etc.
- the designation of computing device 2B may reflect the fact that, when travelling in a vehicle, an in- vehicle stereo/navigation system may provide better microphone placement and audio reception characteristics for voice recognition than a smartphone or a smartwatch. That is, while travelling in a vehicle, it may be likely that the user's wrist will be near the steering wheel and away from the user's mouth. Furthermore, while a user's smartphone may be sufficiently placed to receive environmental audio, it may be likely that the in-vehicle navigation system is better configured to monitor audio in the vehicle and process audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command, as the system may be designed to account for road noise, echo, and other
- designation of a particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input may be performed by a single computing device.
- computing device 2A the smartphone
- designation of a particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input may be jointly performed by two or more of computing devices 2.
- computing devices 2 may perform an arbitration process among themselves to determine which of computing devices 2 should be designated as the particular computing device.
- each of computing devices 2 may independently determine which of computing devices 2 should be designated as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate a particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input based on various criteria.
- designation of the particular computing device may be based on a configured hierarchy of device types (e.g., "smartphone,” “smartwatch,” “headset,” “tablet,” “laptop,” “desktop,” “in-vehicle system,” etc.).
- device types e.g., "smartphone,” “smartwatch,” “headset,” “tablet,” “laptop,” “desktop,” “in-vehicle system,” etc.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may be configured with a ranked list of device types that indicates respective priorities of various device types usable to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- Each of computing devices 2 may communicate (e.g., using communication units 4) an indication of its respective device type to others of computing devices 2.
- the one or more of computing devices 2 may designate, as the particular computing device, the computing device that is of a device type that ranks highest on the list. For instance, if each of computing devices 2 is configured with the ranked list, then each respective computing device may send a respective device type and receive device types of the other computing devices. Each respective computing device may determine whether or not the respective computing device is of the device type that ranks highest on the list. If the respective computing device is of the device type that ranks highest on the list, the respective computing device may designate itself to monitor for and/or process audio input. If the respective computing device is not of the device type that ranks highest, the respective computing device may not designate itself.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input based additionally or alternatively on a level of audio input quality associated with one or more of computing devices 2. For instance, one or more of computing devices 2 may obtain audio input from the environment (e.g., via respective ones of audio input modules 6) and communicate with others of computing devices 2 to compare the quality of the audio input and/or of speech included therein. Computing devices 2 may determine and/or compare audio input quality using various quantifiers, such as volume, signal-to-noise ratio, and/or or other parameters. The one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the computing device having the highest level of audio input quality as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- various quantifiers such as volume, signal-to-noise ratio, and/or or other parameters.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input based additionally or alternatively on the number of predetermined audio commands that each of computing devices 2 may be operable to act on. That is, in some examples, the one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the computing device configured with the largest number of predetermined audio commands as the particular computing device. This may reflect the fact that it may be more likely that the user will be causing the computing device configured with the largest number of predetermined audio commands to perform an action.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input based additionally or alternatively on a determined context of one or more of computing devices 2.
- the context of a computing device may be made up of any number of items of contextual information.
- Example items of contextual information may include collections of data (e.g., a text data structure, a numeric data structure, or other data structure) that represents a location of the computing device (e.g., a GPS location); information indicating a time as determined by the computing device; information indicating one or more applications installed at the computing device; information indicating one or more applications currently executing at the computing device; information indicating one or more networks (e.g., wireless networks) available to the computing device; data that represents one or more other computing devices in proximity to the computing device (e.g., within 10 feet, within 100 feet, or other distance); data that represents an operating mode (e.g., silent mode, airplane mode, driving mode, standby mode, low battery mode, or any other mode of operation) of the computing device, data obtained from one or more sensors of the computing device (e.g., temperature data, ambient noise level data, light level data, acceleration/movement data, image/video data, and other data), or any other data about the status or current state of the computing device.
- data
- an item of contextual information may additionally or alternatively be data representing information about a user of the computing device, such as a name of the user, a user identification (UID) of the user, information from one or more social media network service accounts associated with the user, information from one or more calendars or scheduling applications associated with the user, information indicating one or more social or professional relationships of the user (e.g., user contacts), or any other information about the user.
- a user identification UICC
- one of computing devices 2 may determine an item of contextual information indicating that computing device 2A is at a particular location and an item of contextual information indicating that the user's workplace corresponds to the particular location. Based at least in part on the determined context of computing device 2A, one or more of computing devices 2 may designate computing device 2C as the particular computing device to monitor for and process audio input. This may reflect the fact that, while a user is at work, he or she is unlikely to be near his or her vehicle. Furthermore, while at work, the user may want to speak softly and avoid holding his or her smartphone next to his or her face in order to avoid attracting attention.
- a smartwatch may be the device closest to the user's mouth when the user is providing audio input, and thus computing devices 2 may, based on the determined context of computing device 2A, designate computing device 2C as the particular computing device to monitor for and process audio input.
- the techniques of the present disclosure may include temporarily deactivating, for each respective computing device from the plurality of computing devices other than the particular computing device, the respective module included in the respective computing device.
- audio input modules 6A and 6C may be temporarily deactivated while audio input module 6B remains active. This is illustrated in the example of FIG. 1 by showing audio input modules 6A and 6C as shaded elements having dotted lines, while audio input module 6B remains solid and unshaded.
- the same computing device or devices that designate the particular computing device may temporarily deactivate the audio input modules that are included in computing devices other than the particular computing device.
- the designated particular computing device may output instructions to computing devices other than the particular computing device to cause the respective computing devices other than the particular computing device to temporarily deactivate respective audio input modules.
- each computing device other than the particular computing device may temporarily deactivate its own audio input module based on the designation.
- those of audio input modules 6 included in one of computing devices 2 other than the designated computing device (e.g., computing device 2B) may be temporarily deactivated by one or more of computing devices 2. That is, computing devices 2 may temporarily cease monitoring for and/or processing audio input.
- the deactivation may be temporary in that computing devices 2 may resume monitoring for and/or processing audio input at a later time (e.g., after a specified duration of time has passed, upon receiving an indication from another computing device, upon determining that none of the other of computing devices 2 are in proximity, or based on one or more other criteria).
- the techniques of the present disclosure may include receiving, by the particular computing device, audio input.
- audio input module 6B may continue to monitor the environment of computing device 2B for audio input.
- the user may speak a predetermined audio command (e.g., "Give me directions").
- Audio input module 6B may receive the audio input (e.g., from a microphone or other audio input device) that includes the
- Audio input modules 6A and 6B may remain deactivated and thus not receive the audio input that includes the predetermined audio command.
- the particular computing device may process the audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- audio input module 6B may process the received audio input and determine that the audio input includes the predetermined audio command, "Give me directions.”
- neither audio input module 6A nor audio input module 6C may waste processing power and/or battery power to monitor for audio input and/or process the audio input.
- the techniques of the present disclosure may enable a plurality of computing devices to more efficiently monitor for audio input and/or process received audio input to identify predetermined audio commands included in the audio input.
- the techniques described herein may reduce wasted energy (e.g., battery power) and avoid potential parallel-processing issues.
- the techniques of this disclosure may improve the user experience by improving speech recognition in various instances.

- Computing device 2 also includes one or more communication units 4 A, one or more sensors 26, and one or more storage devices 28.
- Storage devices 28 include user interface (UI) module 32, device context module 36, application modules 34A-34N (collectively, “application modules 34"), and audio input module 6A.
- Audio input module 6A in turn, includes monitoring and execution module 38 and negotiation module 40.
- Communication units 4 A may have the same or similar functionality as that previously described with respect to FIG. 1.
- Communication channels (COMM. CHANNELS) 30 may interconnect components 4A, 6A, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, and/or 40 for inter- component communications (physically, communicatively, and/or operatively).

- device context module 36 may obtain data indicating that application 34A (e.g., an audio player application) and application 34B (e.g., an email client application) are currently executing at computing device 2A, application 34B is currently in focus, and application 34A is currently playing an audio track while application 34B is providing an email- drafting user interface.

- device context module 36 may communicate with application modules 34 and/or communication units 6A to determine contextual information regarding the user of computing device 2A. For instance, device context module 36 may obtain information from an email application regarding social media network services that the user is a member of, email lists that the user subscribes to, or other information. Device context module 36 may also obtain information from a calendar application regarding appointments the user may have. Device context module 36 may communicate with communication units 6A to obtain information from one or more other computing devices or systems. For instance, if permission is received from the user, device context module 36 may cause communication units 6 A to obtain information from a social media network service account of the user, an email account of the user, or other sources of information.
- device context module 36 may determine a current context. As one example, device context module 36 may determine a current context by determining values for one or more contextual categories, as well as a respective weight for each category. That is, device context module 36 may determine values based on obtained information and weigh each category based on a predicted accuracy and/or a predicted importance of the associated value. For instance, contextual categories may indicate a type and/or a name of an application being executed at computing device
- a location of computing device 2A a location of computing device 2A, an indication of a computing device or computing devices that are proximate to computing device 2A, an activity or task in which computing device 2A is currently engaging or in which an application executing at computing device 2A is engaging, a time of day or current time, a user identification number for a user of computing device 2A, a predicted activity or task in which the user is engaging, a predicted mode of travel of the user, a predicted current availability of the user, or various other information.
- a weighting applied to a contextual category may indicate an importance of the value that was determined for the category.
- weightings may be defined on a scale (e.g., 0-10, 1-100, or other scale). If a value for a category is predicted to be an important part of the current context and/or determined as very likely to be true, then the category may receive a heavy weight, toward one end of the scale (e.g., 90 out of 100). If a value for a category is not predicted to be very important and/or is determined to include uncertainty, then the category may receive a lighter weight, at the other end of the scale (e.g., 10 out of 100). In this way, device context module 36 may prioritize some information over other information when determining the current context.
- device context module 36 may determine a value for a current-location category. For instance, based on information (e.g., obtained from a GPS location sensor included in sensors 26) indicating that computing device 2A is regularly located at a specified location during nighttime hours and that computing device 2A is currently located at the same specified location, as well as information (e.g., obtained from contact information for the user or from an email application of the user) indicating that the user's home address is
- device context module 36 may determine the value "Home" for the current-location category.
- Device context module 36 may determine a corresponding weight for the current-location category.
- device context module 36 may determine a relatively heavy weight, as the location information (e.g., based off of GPS data) is relatively accurate, and there are multiple pieces of information indicating the same result (e.g., that computing device 2A is at the home of the user).
- location information e.g., based off of GPS data
- the value for the current-location category may be weighted less heavily.
- Device context module 36 may, in the example of FIG. 2, also determine a value for a movement category that indicates whether or not computing device 2 A is moving.
- device context module 36 may determine the value for the movement category as "None.” That is, device context module 36 may determine that computing device 2A is not currently moving. Device context module 36 may assign a heavy weight to the movement category, as this information is unlikely to be incorrect (e.g., because the information is obtained directly from sensors 26 of computing device 2A).
- device context module 36 may determine values and weights for additional contextual categories or alternative contextual categories. In any case, after determining the current context, device context module 36 may provide at least an indication of the current context to audio input module 6A.

- Monitoring and execution module 38 may use the processed input to determine whether or not a predetermined audio command is included in at least a portion of the received audio input. For instance, monitoring and execution module 38 may compare the processed audio input to a set of indications (e.g., text, tonal characteristics, or other sonic identifiers) corresponding to predetermined audio commands. If monitoring and execution module 38 determines that the audio input includes a predetermined audio command, monitoring and execution module 38 may, in some examples, perform the associated action.

- negotiation module 40 may, based on the contexts, designate computing device 2B (the desktop computer) as the particular computing device. This may reflect the fact that the user is likely using computing device 2B (e.g., because the smartwatch is near the desktop computer) and computing device 2A is likely not near the user (e.g., because the smartwatch and desktop computer are not near the smartphone).
- the designation of computing device 2B to monitor for and/or process audio input may reflect the fact that computing device 2B is likely not a battery- powered device. That is, computing device 2B is less likely than computing devices 2A and 2C to have limited available power.
- negotiation module 40 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for audio input and/or process audio input based additionally or alternatively on an audio input quality associated with one or more of computing devices 2A, 2B, and 2C. For instance, negotiation module 40 may compare the audio input quality for each of computing devices 2A, 2B, and 2C, and designate the computing device associated with the best audio input quality as the particular computing device to monitor for and process audio input. In order to compare audio input qualities, negotiation module 40 may obtain audio input from one or more of sensors 26 and determine a level of audio input quality for the audio input.
- negotiation module 40 may determine the strength of the audio input (e.g., in decibels), a ratio between speech included in the audio input and other sound (e.g., background noise or static), or other measurements.

- negotiation module 40 may also receive indications of audio input quality determined by computing devices 2B and/or 2C.
- Negotiation module 40 may then compare the audio input quality of computing device 2A to that of computing devices 2B and 2C to determine which of the computing devices is associated with the best audio input quality.
- Negotiation module 40 may designate, as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input, the computing device that is associated with the best audio input quality (e.g., the highest audio strength, the best speech to noise ratio, etc.).
- negotiation module 40 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for audio input and/or process audio input based additionally or alternatively on a configured hierarchy of device types.
- the configured hierarchy may rank a desktop computer higher than a smartphone or a smartwatch and thus negotiation module 40 may designate computing device 2B as the particular computing device. That is, based on the hierarchy, negotiation module 40 may be more likely to designate a desktop computer as the particular computing device, if available, and less likely to designate a smartphone or smartwatch. This may reflect the fact that a desktop computer may have more resources (e.g., power, processing power, etc.) for monitoring for audio input and/or processing audio input.
- resources e.g., power, processing power, etc.

If the context of a desktop computer indicates that the desktop computer includes a microphone or other audio input device, the criteria may be satisfied, and negotiation module 40 may designate the desktop computer based on the first hierarchy.
- negotiation module 40 may designate the particular computing device based on a different configured hierarchy or in some other way.
- negotiation module 40 may send an indication of the designation (e.g., via communication units 4A) to the respective negotiation module of computing devices 2B and 2C. That is, a computing device that designates (or computing devices that designate) a particular computing device from a plurality of computing devices to monitor for and/or process audio input may, in some examples, send indications of the designation to others of the plurality of computing devices. In some examples, the computing device that is designated as the particular computing device may send indications of the designation.
- the particular computing device may send an at least an indication of the designation to each respective computing device from the plurality of computing devices other than the particular computing device. In this way, each of the plurality of computing devices may receive an indication of the designation.
- Negotiation module 40 in the example of FIG. 2, may also be operable by processors 20 to temporarily deactivate a module for monitoring and/or processing audio input. For instance, responsive to designating a computing device other than computing device 2A as the particular device to monitor for and process audio input, negotiation module 40 may temporarily deactivate monitoring and execution module 38. In a similar fashion, responsive to receiving an indication that one or more others of computing devices 2 have designated one of computing devices 2 other than computing device 2A as the particular computing device, negotiation module 40 may temporarily deactivate monitoring and execution module 38. For example, computing devices 2 may each compare a device identifier included in the indication to their own device identifiers.
- the respective computing devices may each determine that the designated computing device is a different computing device, and may deactivate a respective module for monitoring for and/or processing audio input (e.g., monitoring and execution module 38).

Monitoring and execution module 38 may process the audio input and compare the processed input to a set of indications corresponding to predetermined audio commands to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command. In some examples, the set of indications corresponding to predetermined audio commands may represent predetermined audio commands to which computing device 2A is configured to respond. In some such examples, if monitoring and execution module 38 determines that none of the represented predetermined audio commands is included in the audio input, monitoring and execution module 38 may cause audio input module 6A to send (e.g., via communications unit 4A), to others of computing devices 2, the processed input.

- the particular computing device may determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command to which any of the plurality of computing devices is configured to respond. For instance, computing device 2A may receive an indication of predetermined audio commands to which others of computing devices 2 are configured to respond. As another example, computing device 2A may receive an indication of a device type for others of computing devices 2 and computing device 2A may be configured with a list associating various predetermined audio commands with various device types.

- monitoring and execution module 38 may, in some examples, cause computing device 2A to perform the action or operation associated with the received predetermined audio command. For instance, if monitoring and execution module 38 determines that the audio input includes a predetermined audio command to which computing device 2A is configured to respond, monitoring and execution module 38 may cause computing device 2A to perform one or more actions that are associated with the received predetermined audio command. In some examples, if monitoring and execution module 38 determines that the audio input includes a predetermined audio command to which another of computing devices 2 is configured to respond, monitoring and execution module 38 may cause audio input module 6A to send, to the other computing device, an indication of the included predetermined audio command.
- monitoring and execution module 38 may receive an indication of audio input and process the audio input.

- GUI 50 may represent the list of ranked device types after device type entries 52A-52C and 52E-52G have been added (e.g., by the user of computing device 2A, prepopulated by a device manufacturer or retailer, or in some other way). That is, in some examples, a list or ranked device types on a computing device may initially only include a device type entry for the
- device type entries may be automatically added as the computing device communicates with new device types (e.g., when pairing via short range communication methods, when receiving an indication of a user's other devices, or in other ways).
- device type entries may additionally or alternatively be manually added. For instance, in the example of FIG. 3, a user of computing device 2 A may select graphical element 60 to cause computing device 2A to display a GUI that allows the user to add a new device type entry.

- a lower priority level may indicate that the respective device type entry indicates the type of devices that are more likely to be designated as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input in accordance with the techniques described herein.
- priority levels 54 may, in some examples, represent a ranked ordering of how different device types may be prioritized for designation as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input. In the example of FIG.
- audio input module 6A may designate a computing device having a "headset" device type, if included in the plurality of computing devices and/or detected by computing device 2 A, as the particular computing device. If no computing device having the "headset" device type is included in the plurality of computing devices, then audio input module 6A may designate an in- vehicle stereo/navigation system, if included in the plurality of computing devices and/or detected by computing device 2A, as the particular computing device, and so on. In this way, audio input module 6A may use priority levels 54 for device type entries 52 in designating the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process indications of audio input.
- the list of ranked device types may be user configurable.
- GUI 50 includes removal elements 56 and arrows 58. Removal elements 56 may be user-selectable to allow the user of computing device 2A to remove one or more of device type entries 52A-52C and/or 52E-52G from the list.
- device type entry 52D may not be removable, because computing device 2A corresponds to the
- a device type entry corresponding to the computing device at which a list of ranked device types is being modified may not be removable. In other examples, only certain device type entries may be removable, all device type entries may be removable, or no device type entries may be removable.
- Arrows 58 may, in the example of FIG. 3, be user-selectable elements that cause computing device 2A to modify one of priority levels 54 for a corresponding device type entry. For instance, selecting the up arrow (shown as un-filled in the example of FIG. 3) for device type entry 52D may cause computing device 2A to decrease the priority level of device type entry 52D from 4 to 3, and increase the priority level of device type entry 52C from 3 to 4. As a result, computing devices having a "smartphone" device type may be more likely to be designated as the particular computing device than computing devices having a "smartwatch" device type.
- the list of ranked device type entries shown in GUI 50 may be stored at computing device 2A. That is, when the list is modified, the changes may be saved at computing device 2A (e.g., at storage devices 28). In such instance, audio input module 6A of computing device 2A may designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- the list of ranked device type entries shown in GUI 50 may be stored at another of computing devices 2 (e.g., computing device 2B, computing device 2C), at an external computing device (e.g., a central server or cloud computing system) or at multiple computing devices.
- the changes may be sent (e.g., via communication units 4A) from computing device 2A to one or more other computing devices.
- the list of ranked device type entries 52 may be stored by computing device 2A and be sent by computing device 2A to each of computing devices 2B and 2C for storage.
- each of computing devices 2 A, 2B, and 2C may independently designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input. That is, because each of computing devices 2 includes the list of ranked device types, each of computing devices 2 may be operable to use the list in designating the particular computing device and thus each designate the correct computing device as the particular computing device.
- each of device type entries 52 may be associated with a corresponding priority level that is different from every other device type entry.
- priority levels 54 may be unique.
- two or more of device type entries 52 may be associated with corresponding priority levels that are the same.
- two computing devices that are associated with the same device type may be included in the plurality of computing devices.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input based on an arbitration process, based on a round-robin selection, based on random selection, based on the current context of each of the computing devices, or in other ways. For instance, if computing devices 2 includes two computing devices having the same priority level, the computing device that was most recently used by the user may be designated as the particular computing device. Thus, given the list of ranked device type entries shown in GUI 50, if the user has two computing devices having a "headset" device type, the headset that has more recently been used by the user may be designated as the particular computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- one or more computing devices may designate a particular computing device from a plurality of computing devices to monitor for and/or process audio input. Thereafter, each of the plurality of computing devices other than the particular computing device may temporarily cease monitoring for and/or processing indications of audio input.
- the designated computing device may receive audio input, and process the audio input to determine whether the audio input includes a predetermined audio command.
- the list of ranked device types described in the example of FIG. 3 represents only one example criterion on which designation of the particular computing device may be made. Various alternative or additional criteria may be used in various examples, as described herein.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of computing devices configured to monitor for and/or process audio input, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. For purposes of illustration only, the example operations of FIG. 4 are described below within the context of FIGS. 1 and 2.
- a plurality of computing devices e.g., computing devices 2
- Computing devices 2A-2C may be associated with one another.
- each of computing devices 2A-2C may be associated with the same user.
- each of computing devices 2A-2C may be in physical proximity to one another.
- each of computing devices 2A-2C may be communicatively connected to one another via one or more wired or wireless connections.
- one or more of computing devices 2 may designate one of computing devices 2 to monitor for audio input and/or process audio input (80).
- negotiation module 40 of computing device 2A may designate computing device 2B to monitor for and/or process audio input.
- the computing device to monitor for and/or process audio input may be designated based at least in part on a current context of one or more of computing devices 2, based at least in part on the device types associated with each of computing devices 2, and/or on various other criteria.
- Computing devices 2B and 2C may, in the example of FIG. 4, receive an indication of the designated particular computing device to monitor for audio input and/or process audio input (82A, 82B).
- computing devices 2B and 2C may receive the indication from computing device 2A, such as when computing devices 2 are communicatively connected via one or more communication links.
- computing devices 2B and 2C may receive the indication from another computing device, such as a remote device (e.g., a server system, "cloud computing" system, etc.) with which each of computing devices 2 is configured to communicate.
- a remote device e.g., a server system, "cloud computing" system, etc.
- computing devices 2A and 2C may each deactivate a respective module for monitoring for and/or processing audio input (84A, 84B). For example, computing devices 2A, 2B, and 2C may each compare a device identifier included in the indication to their own device identifiers. Responsive to determining that the device identifiers do not match (as in the case of computing devices 2A and 2C), the respective computing devices may each determine that the designated computing device is a different computing device, and can deactivate a respective module for monitoring for and/or processing audio input. In this way, the respective computing devices may temporarily cease processing of audio input.
- computing device 2B Responsive to determining that the device identifier included in the indication does match its device identifier (i.e., that computing device 2B is the computing device designated to monitor for and/or process audio input), computing device 2B will not deactivate its module for monitoring for and/or processing audio input, but rather will continue to monitor for audio input and/or process audio input. That is, computing devices from the plurality of computing devices other than the designated computing device may stop monitoring for predetermined audio commands while the designated computing device may continue to monitor for predetermined audio commands. For instance, computing device 2 A may deactivate monitoring and execution module 38, and computing device 2C may deactivate an analogous monitoring and execution module of computing device 2C.
- Computing device 2B may receive audio input (86). That is, because computing device 2B did not deactivate its respective module for monitoring for and/or processing audio input, the respective module of computing device 2B (e.g., a monitoring and execution module) may receive an indication of audio input. Computing device 2B may process the audio input and determine that the audio input includes a predetermined audio command (88). For instance, computing device 2B may determine that the audio input includes the predetermined audio command "make a call.”
- Computing device 2B may, in the example of FIG. 4, determine an action associated with the predetermined audio command that is included in the audio input (89). For instance, computing device 2B may determine an action based on the predetermined audio command itself and/or on subsequent audio input. As one example of an action determined based on the predetermined audio command itself, the predetermined audio command may be the phrase "go silent" and the action may be to enter a silent mode. That is, the action (e.g., enter silent mode) is based on the predetermined audio command (e.g., "go silent").
- the predetermined audio command may be the word "play" and the subsequent audio input may be the title of a song, TV show, or other media content item.
- the action e.g., play the specified media item
- the predetermined audio command may be the word "play" and the subsequent audio input.
- computing device 2B may determine an action to execute a telephone application, based on the predetermined audio command, "make a call.”
- computing device 2B may determine a computing device to perform the action corresponding to the predetermined audio command included in the audio input (90). That is, based at least in part on the
- computing device 2B may determine which of computing devices 2 should perform the action. In some examples, determining a computing device to perform an action associated with a predetermined audio command may be based on a current context of one or more of computing devices 2. For instance, computing device 2B may determine which of computing devices 2 is operable to perform the corresponding action, respective power sources of each of computing devices 2, or other contextual information. In some examples, determining the computing device to perform the action may be based on additional or alternative criteria. In the example of FIG. 4, computing device 2B may determine that computing device 2 A (e.g., the smartphone) will perform the action associated with the predetermined audio command (e.g., "make a call").
- computing device 2 A e.g., the smartphone
- Computing device 2B may, in the example of FIG. 4, send an indication of the action to be performed to computing device 2 A (92). That is, after determining which computing device will perform an action, the designated computing device may send an indication of the action to the determined computing device. The determined computing device may receive the indication of the action to be performed (94) and may perform the action (96). In this way, a computing device designated to monitor audio input and/or process indications of audio input does not have to be the computing device to perform actions associated with
- a computing device that monitors for predetermined audio commands may be operable in accordance with the techniques described herein to cause another computing device from the plurality of computing devices to perform actions corresponding to a received command.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of a computing device configured to monitor for and/or process audio input, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. For purposes of illustration only, the example operations of FIG. 5 are described below within the context of FIGS.1 and 2.

- two or more of computing devices 2 may independently perform the designation.
- computing device 2A may, in the example of FIG. 5, temporarily cease processing of audio input (104). That is, if computing device 2A determines that it was not designated as the particular computing device, computing device 2A may temporarily deactivate audio input module 6A. In other words, if the particular computing device is not computing device 2A, computing device 2A may cease processing of audio input. In some examples, computing device 2A may additionally send an instruction to each of computing devices 2 other than the particular computing device that causes the computing devices to temporarily cease processing of audio input
- computing device 2 A may receive first audio input (106). That is, computing device 2 A may determine that it is the designated particular computing device.
