Detailed Description
Discussed herein are techniques for providing contextually relevant navigation suggestions to a user to assist the user in completing a task. The techniques can be implemented in a variety of software applications, including a web browser, a mobile application running on a mobile device, or native operations executing on a desktop computer. For example, a user may use a web browser to perform a task (e.g., research a movie to decide whether to watch the movie in a movie theater) by searching the world wide web for content. For example, a user may start a web search to obtain search results for the movie, navigate to one or more reviews for the movie, navigate to a trailer for the movie, navigate to a web page that provides information about the actor lineups of the movie, and so on. During the process of displaying these different web pages to the user, existing web browsers may not understand the task the user is attempting to perform, which results in the loading and rendering of these particular pages.
In contrast, this disclosure describes techniques for using similarity analysis to capture those web pages that are relevant to a user's task and for automatically displaying navigation suggestions to the user to assist the user in performing the task. For example, in the movie example, after a user reads one or more reviews about the movie, views a trailer for the movie, and reads information about the actor lineup of the movie, the user may decide to watch the movie at a movie theater, but may want to persuade a friend to watch the movie with her. At this point, the user may want to find a web page with the movie trailer so that the user can send a link to the trailer to persuade friends to watch the movie. Further, at this point the user may have opened multiple browsing tabs, which may or may not include the web page with the movie trailer. Further, when using a web browser during the process of searching for a movie, the user may be performing a different task unrelated to the movie task. For example, the user may be viewing news or researching a dog breed, etc. Thus, a web browser may have many browser tabs open, where the history of the browser tabs may span multiple tasks (or histories). Typically, a user may simply open a new browser tab to search for a movie trailer, rather than switching to other browser tabs or viewing the browsing history of the web browser.
However, a web browser implementing the techniques discussed herein may use similarity analysis to determine which web pages are topic-related to a particular task (e.g., determine whether to watch a movie), and when the user's browser activity is related to the task, the web browser may automatically display pages related to the task (and/or other navigation suggestions, such as suggested pages or suggested actions that help the user perform the task). For example, in some implementations, the navigation suggestions include a list of previously rendered web pages that the user may return. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions include suggested web pages (e.g., web pages that the user has not visited yet). In some implementations, the navigation suggestions include a suggested course of action (e.g., a continuous display of navigation suggestions for completing a task).
The techniques discussed herein may reduce an amount of computing resources of a computing device executing a web browser by programmatically providing one or more navigation suggestions (e.g., a list of previously rendered web pages, suggested actions, etc.) to a user to carry out and/or complete a task associated with use of the web browser. For example, the number of browser tabs that would otherwise be launched to perform a task may be reduced and/or the execution time required to re-search or re-find the relevant web page to perform the task may be reduced, thus reducing the amount of computing resources consumed by the computing device (e.g., computing resources may be "freed") and increasing the efficiency of the web browser itself.
In the movie example, the navigation suggestions may include a list of previously rendered web pages that the user may return to in order to complete the task, the list including movie trailers. This list of web pages, which includes pages with movie trailers, may be presented as selectable User Interface (UI) elements, where selection of a UI element causes the web browser to display the corresponding web page in a browser tab. Thus, the user may not need to open a new browser tab to re-search for a movie trailer or to find out which browser tab has the content the user is looking for. Conversely, when it is determined that the user is currently performing a task, the web browser automatically provides navigation suggestions to the user to assist in performing the task.
In the movie example, since the content about the actor lineup of the movie is contextually relevant to the list (or group) of web pages relevant to the task of determining whether to watch the movie, a selection of a web page with a trailer for the movie may be automatically provided in a user interface of a web browser, and when the web page is selected, the web browser may display the web page with the trailer for the movie in a browser tab. In some implementations, the web browser can pre-fetch web content in some or all of the web pages of the group. For example, prior to the user selecting or navigating to one or more of the set of web pages (i.e., prior to the user selecting or navigating to one or more of the set of web pages), the web browser may obtain web content from websites corresponding to some or all of the set of web pages via the internet in a background operation of the web browser. This advantageously tends to allow faster rendering of the web content to the user. Furthermore, this advantageously tends to allow web content to be rendered offline to the user.
In addition, the user's reaction to the navigation advice can be monitored to create a feedback loop to improve further recommendations. For example, the user may decide to select a navigation suggestion provided by a web browser. Furthermore, the user may decide to select a particular navigation suggestion in preference to other navigation suggestions, or to not select any of the navigation suggestions but to navigate to a web page not suggested by the navigation suggestions. Future navigation suggestions may be refined based on the user's reaction to the navigation suggestions. Further, future navigation suggestions may be refined based on other users' reactions to the same or similar navigation suggestions. This advantageously tends to allow more accurate navigation suggestions over time. In some implementations, the user may be provided with controls that allow the user to make selections regarding whether and when the web browser and/or system may enable detection of the user's reaction to the navigation suggestions.
In some examples, the similarity analysis is performed by a web browser or other software application executing on a device that renders the content to the user. In some examples, the similarity analysis is performed on a server associated with a web browser or software application. For example, as a user navigates through various searches and/or websites using a web browser, the web browser may retrieve data about web pages rendered by the browser tab, and a server or web browser may determine a set of web pages previously rendered by the web browser that are thematically related to each other based on a similarity analysis of the data. The set of web pages may include two or more web pages determined to be topically related to each other, the set of web pages capable of indicating that a user is performing a task.
FIG. 1A illustrates a system 100 for providing one or more navigation suggestions 128 to assist a user in completing a task using a web browser 122 executing on a computing device 120. When a user navigates through content using web browser 122, web browser 122 can retrieve data 101 about web page 121 that web browser 122 accesses. In some implementations, web browser 122 can transmit at least a portion of data 101 to server 102 associated with web browser 122 over network 130.
Based on the data 101 received from the web browser 122 over the network 130, the server 102 may determine that the user is performing a task based on the data 101. A task may be a web search activity related to the same or similar subject matter. In some implementations, a task refers to a single topic or category of activity performed by navigating the web browser 122. Some non-limiting examples may include studying hiking in a region, studying dog breeds, studying a particular movie to watch in a movie theater, or purchasing a vacuum cleaner over the internet. In some implementations, the web browser 122 determines that the user is performing a task based on the data 101. Although the following description indicates that some of the operations are performed by the server 102, in some implementations, these operations may be performed by a web browser 122 executing on the computing device 120.
In some implementations, the server 102 determines that the user is performing a task by determining the first group 116 of web pages 121 from the web pages 121 previously rendered by the browser tabs 126 of the web browser 122. Web page 121 may be an instance of a web page that is being (or has been) loaded (or reloaded) in web browser 122. Different web pages 121 may be related to different web pages of the same internet site or web pages of different internet sites. The first group 116 of web pages 121 may include web pages that correspond to particular tasks that the user is performing using the web browser 122.
In some implementations, the data 101 can include information specifying actions performed by the user with any of the navigation tools, corresponding timestamps, and the like. Further, the data 101 may also include information specifying that the user interacted with any of the presented content (e.g., time spent viewing a web page, how many pages the user opened from a given page, audio playback, etc.). In some implementations, users associated with the same account can synchronize information across multiple computing devices where data 101 from a first web browser executing on a first computing device can be used along with data from a second web browser executing on a second computing device to determine a group.
In some examples, data 101 includes entered search terms, contextual information (e.g., navigation history, time spent, trends of the user or other users), user profile information, information from previous browser instances/sessions, and/or information from different browsers. In some examples, data 101 includes content and/or metadata of a web page. In some examples, a user may be provided with a query that allows the user to make information regarding whether and when web browser 122 and/or system 100 may enable the collection of data 101 and/or whether one or more types of data may be used in the similarity analysis to determine whether the user is performing a particular task.
Fig. 1B shows an example of the first group 116 and an example of the second group 118. As shown in fig. 1B, the first group 116 of web pages 121 includes web pages 121 that were previously rendered by the browser tabs 126 that are thematically related to one another. For example, the first group 116 may include a first web page 121-1, a second web page 121-2, and a third web page 121-3. Each web page 121 in the first set 116 is a different web page (e.g., an HTML file) of an internet site that is related in subject matter to the other web pages 121 in the first set 116. The web pages 121 in the first group 116 may represent a first task being performed by a user. For example, the web pages 121 in the first group 116 may be related to a first task topic.
In some implementations, the server 102 can determine the second group 118 of web pages 121 from the web pages 121 previously rendered by the browser tabs 126 of the web browser 122. As shown in FIG. 1B, the second group 118 of web pages 121 includes web pages 121 that were previously rendered by the browser tabs 126 that are related in subject matter to each other. For example, the second group 118 may include a fourth web page 121-4, a fifth web page 121-5, and a sixth web page 121-6. The web pages 121 in the second group 118 may be different in theme from the web pages 121 in the first group 116. Each web page 121 in the second set 118 is a web page (e.g., an HTML file) of a different internet site that is related in subject matter to other web pages 121 in the second set 118. Although three web pages 121 are shown with respect to the first group 116 and the second group 118, the first group 116 and the second group 118 may include any number of web pages 121. The web pages 121 in the second group 118 may represent a second task being performed by the user. For example, the web pages 121 in the second group 118 may be related to a second task topic, where the second task is different from the first task. Although two tasks are described with reference to fig. 1A and 1B, a user may be performing more than two tasks, and thus, there may be a third group, a fourth group, a fifth group, and so on.
In response to the content displayed in the web browser 122 being thematically related to one of the tasks (e.g., the first task or the second task), the server 102 may provide one or more navigation suggestions 128 to the web browser 122 over the network 130. For example, in response to the content displayed in the web browser 122 being related to the first set 116 of topics, the server 102 may send navigation suggestions 128 to the web browser 122 for display to assist the user in performing the first task. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include a list (or subset) of the web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first group 116 are filtered or sorted based on the time the web pages 121 were accessed or rendered and/or the level of user engagement with the web pages 121, and a filtered or sorted list of the web pages 121 in the first group 116 is provided as one or more navigation suggestions 128 on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122 that provides the web pages 121 that the user may revisit to complete or continue the first task.
In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include suggested web pages (e.g., not part of the first group 116) but are thematically related to the first group 116 to assist the user with respect to the first task. For example, in some implementations, the data 101 may indicate that other users performing tasks similar to the first task access a particular web page to continue or complete tasks similar to the first task. Based on the data 101, the suggested web pages may be provided as navigation suggestions 128.
In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include suggested course of action to assist the user with respect to the first task. For example, the navigation suggestions 128 may include sequences of the web page 121 (e.g., previously rendered or suggested), search ideas, and/or other actions that provide suggestions to assist the user in continuing or completing the first task.
In some implementations, the user can switch tasks and the content displayed by the web browser 122 can be related to a second task. In this case, in response to the content displayed in the web browser 122 being related to the second set 118 of topics, the server 102 may send one or more navigation suggestions 128 to the web browser 122 for display to assist the user in performing the second task. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include a list (or subset) of the web pages 121 in the second group 118. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the second group 118 are filtered or sorted based on the time the web pages 121 were accessed or rendered and/or the level of user engagement with the web pages 121, and a filtered or sorted list of the web pages 121 in the second group 118 is provided as one or more navigation suggestions 128 on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122 that provides the web pages 121 that the user may revisit to complete or continue the second task. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include suggested web pages (e.g., not part of the second set 118) but are thematically related to the second set 118 to assist the user with respect to the second task. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include a suggested course of action to assist the user with respect to the second task.
By programmatically providing one or more navigation suggestions 128 to a user to carry out and/or complete a task associated with use of the web browser 122, the navigation suggestions 128 may reduce the amount of computing resources (e.g., computing time and/or storage space used) of the computing device 120 consumed by the web browser 122. For example, through the use of the navigation suggestions 128, the number of browser tabs 126 that would otherwise be launched to perform the task may be reduced and/or the execution time required to re-search or re-find the relevant web page 121 to perform the task may be reduced, thus reducing the amount of computing resources consumed by the computing device 120 (e.g., computing resources may be "freed") and increasing the efficiency of the web browser 122 itself.
In some embodiments, the group's web pages 121 may be web pages that the user may revisit or return to in order to complete the task. Accordingly, web browser 122 may accelerate navigation to those web pages 121 by enabling users to quickly access those web pages 121. In some implementations, the web browser 122 can pre-fetch the web content of one or all of the web pages 121 in the group of web pages 121 or other web pages 121 provided by the navigation suggestions 128. For example, the web browser 122 may obtain web content from a website corresponding to some or all of the web pages 121 provided in the navigation suggestions 128 via the internet in a background operation of the web browser 122 prior to (i.e., prior to) the user selecting or navigating to one or more of the web pages provided in the navigation suggestions 128. In some implementations, in a background operation (and before the user selects or navigates to one or more of the web pages 121 in the navigation suggestions 128), the web browser 122 can obtain the web content by loading the native library of the web browser 122, performing a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup based on the URL associated with the particular web page 121, downloading the web content from a server, and caching the web content. These retrieval operations may be performed for some or all of the web pages 121 (e.g., the web pages 121 of the group or the suggested web pages 121) in the navigation suggestions 128.
This advantageously tends to allow faster rendering of the web content to the user. For example, because the web content has already been acquired, the web browser 122 may only display the web content in the browser tab 126 when the user actually selects or navigates to a particular web page 121 in the navigation suggestions 128. Again, this advantageously tends to allow web content to be rendered offline to the user. In some implementations, the web browser 122 can pre-fetch at least one resource of the web browser 122. The resources of the Web browser 122 may include language translation services, form auto-fill, password vault (password vault), and other browser resources. In some implementations, in a background operation (and before the user selects or navigates to one or more web pages 121 in the navigation suggestions 128), the web browser 122 can retrieve web content of the one or more web pages 121 in the navigation suggestions 128 and then translate the page into a language associated with the user account using a language translation service.
In some implementations, the computing device 120 is a mobile computing device such as a mobile phone, a tablet, or a personal digital assistant. Computing device 120 includes a network interface configured to connect computing device 120 to a network 130 (e.g., the internet). The network interface may include a mobile network interface and/or a Wi-Fi network interface. In some implementations, the web browser 122 is a mobile browser designed for use on the operating system of a mobile device. The mobile browser is configured to render and display a mobile tab having a web page in a mobile format (or in a desktop format). In some implementations, the computing device 120 is a laptop, desktop computer, or other computing device having an operating system configured to execute the web browser 122 to retrieve and display internet content in a desktop format.
The mobile format has a page layout that is different from the desktop format. In the mobile format, there is no tab bar identifying open browser tabs 126. In contrast, in mobile format, the web browser 122 includes a tab switcher User Interface (UI) that allows the user to switch to other open browser tabs 126. In some implementations, the tab switcher UI includes a vertical layout (or vertical carousel map) that lists open browser tabs 126 and sites loaded into those browser tabs 126. In some implementations, the browser tabs 126 are vertically stacked, with one browser tab 126 being fully displayed and the other browser tabs 126 in front of or behind the active browser tab 126. In some implementations, the tab switcher UI includes a horizontal layout (or horizontal carousel map). In some implementations, in the tab switcher UI, the browser tabs 126 are displayed in a horizontal layout and can slide to the right or left to select other open browser tabs 126.
Each browser tab 126 may be a container of a web page 121 of an internet site. Typically, on a mobile device, the browser tabs 126 are manually opened and closed, and creating a new browser tab 126 may take three taps, and in some cases, about two seconds (as opposed to, for example, one single tap on a desktop). Further, it has been found that closing the browser tab 126 is relatively common. For example, the user often closes the browser tab 126, just for collating purposes. However, as described further below, the navigation suggestion operations discussed herein may automatically provide navigation suggestions 128 that the user may again view or assist in completing his/her task.
The web pages 121 in the first group 116 may have been rendered (at some point) across one or more browser tabs 126. Similarly, the web pages 121 in the second group 118 may have been rendered (at some point) across one or more browser tabs 126. In some implementations, the first set 116 of web pages 121 can be considered a lineage (i.e., real-world tasks performed by the web browser 122) that occurs over time. A particular lineage may span one, two, or more browser tabs 126. In other words, the lineage can span multiple browser tabs 126, and the browser tabs 126 can be presented in multiple different lineages. As shown in FIG. 1A, the web browser 122 may include three browser tabs 126, namely a first browser tab 131, a second browser tab 132, and a third browser tab 133. In some implementations, a particular group of web pages 121 may be defined over a period of time and may span multiple browsing sessions over multiple days (weeks). In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first set 116 and/or the second set 118 can include web pages of active (or currently open) browser tabs 126 that are thematically related to each other. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first set 116 and/or the second set 118 are web pages 121 from previously opened or closed browser tabs 126. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first set 116 and/or the second set are a mix of web pages 121 from currently open browser tabs 126 and web pages from closed browser tabs 126.
Fig. 2 shows a graphical representation of the tab history of the first browser tab 131, the second browser tab 132, and the third browser tab 133. The various web pages 201-215 of FIG. 2 are examples of web page 121. The first browser tab 131 may include a web page 201, a web page 202, a web page 203, a web page 204, and a web page 205, where the web page 201 is the most recent web page (or the current web page) of the first browser tab. Second browser tab 132 may include web page 206, web page 207, web page 208, web page 209, and web page 210, where web page 206 is the most recent web page (or current web page) of second browser tab 132. The third browser tab 133 may include a web page 211, a web page 212, a web page 213, a web page 214, and a web page 215, where the web page 211 is the most recent web page (or current web page) of the third browser tab 133.
Referring back to fig. 1A, in some implementations, server 102 can be configured to synchronize user actions, browser history, and browser configurations across computing devices (including computing device 120) associated with a user account. For example, a user may bookmark a particular web page using a web browser 122 on computing device 120. If the other computing device is associated with the user's account on server 102, data may be transmitted from computing device 120 to server 102 and to the other user device such that bookmarks also appear in web browser 122 running on the other computing device.
In some implementations, user actions can be synchronized across computing devices. User actions that may be synchronized across computing devices may include, but are not limited to: open a window, close a window, open a web page or file, close a web page or file, navigate to a particular URL, scroll to a location in a document, play a stream of media content, run a Javascript element, or any other action associated with operating web browser 122. In some implementations, the user action can be a Document Object Model (DOM) event. DOM events may include standardized DOM events promulgated by the world wide web consortium (W3C), the main standards organization of the internet, and/or may include browser-specific DOM events. Generally, DOM events allow a web page to include code that is conditioned on the detection of some event. In some implementations, the DOM event can include receiving input from an interface device (e.g., a mouse or other pointing device, a keyboard, a touch screen display, etc.). For example, a DOM event may correspond to clicking a web page object using a mouse, pressing an up arrow on a keyboard, touching a touch screen display, or the like. The DOM events may also include actions such as loading or unloading a web page, changing the size of a window of web browser 122, performing a clipboard action (e.g., selecting an object, copying an object, pasting an object, etc.), dragging data within a web page or between web browser 122 and another application, opening or closing a window, detecting errors, or other events related to the operation of web browser 122.
In some examples, web browser 122 sends data about accessed web page 121 to server 102 over network 130 when web browser 122 executes on computing device 120.
The network 130 may include the internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a cellular network, a satellite network, or other types of data networks. Network 130 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computers, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) configured to receive and/or transmit data within network 130. The network 130 may also include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections.
Server 102 may include a navigation tree builder 104 configured to generate a navigation tree based on data 101. For example, navigation tree builder 104 may generate a new navigation tree 114 when a user begins a search (e.g., enters one or more terms in a search box of web browser 122), selects and/or selects a bookmark on a link in the browsing history. When a user navigates from a root node, such as when rendering a particular page in browser tab 126, navigation tree builder 104 may create a new page node. For example, each navigation tree 114 may begin a search or bookmark, and as the user navigates from a page or search result (e.g., selects a particular search result, selects a link on the page, selects a back/forward button, etc.), the navigation tree builder 104 may create page nodes corresponding to different web pages 121 and create connections or edges between the page nodes. There may be many separate navigation trees 114 for a particular user account. As an example, FIG. 1A shows a first navigation tree 114-1, a second navigation tree 114-2, and a third navigation tree 114-3. However, the navigation tree 114 may include more than three navigation trees 114.
Fig. 3 shows an example of a navigation tree 114. Navigation tree 114 may be an example of a first navigation tree 114-1, a second navigation tree 114-2, or a third navigation tree 114-3. The navigation tree 114 may be a hierarchical data structure that displays relationships between web pages 121 of an internet site navigated by a web browser 122. In some implementations, some of the data is represented in the navigation tree 114. The navigation tree 114 includes page nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) and connections 331 (e.g., incoming edges, outgoing edges) between the page nodes. Each page node corresponds to a respective different web page 121 rendered by the web browser 122. The page nodes may include a hub (hub) node 330, a leaf node 332, and an intermediate node 336 disposed between the hub node 330 and the leaf node 332.
As shown in FIG. 3, the user may direct web browser 122 to display a first web page (represented by page node 1) (e.g., by starting a new search) and navigate to a second web page (represented by page node 2), where a connection 331 is provided from page node 1 to page node 2. Page node 1 may be considered the root, the top node in navigation tree 114, and page node 2 is a child node of page node 1, a node that directly connects to another node when moving away from the root. The user may then navigate back to the first web page, where connection 331 is provided from page node 2 to page node 1. Page node 2 is leaf node 332 because page node 2 has no children. The user may then navigate to a third web page (represented by page node 3), where a connection 331 is provided from page node 1 to page node 3. Page node 1 is hub node 330 because page node 1 has at least two children nodes directly connected to it. The user may then navigate to a fourth web page (represented by page node 4) and then to a fifth web page (represented by page node 5). The user may navigate from the third web page to a sixth web page (represented by page node 6). Page node 3 is hub node 330, page node 5 is leaf node 332, and page node 6 is leaf node 332. Page node 4 is intermediate node 336.
The server 102 may include a lineage-centric task builder 106, the task builder 106 configured to determine the first task and/or the second task by building the first group 116 and/or the second group 118 (and any additional groups) from a web page 121 rendered by a browser tab 126. Further, the lineage-centric task builder 106 may filter and/or sort the web pages 121 in the first group 116 and/or the second group 118 to determine which web pages 121 are included in the navigation suggestions 128.
The lineage-centric task builder 106 can include a similarity analyzer 108, the similarity analyzer 108 configured to group similarly related navigation trees 114 into navigation groups using similarity analysis. In some embodiments, the similarity analysis includes hierarchical clustering. In some implementations, the similarity analyzer 108 is configured to determine the first group 116 of web pages 121 from the web pages 121 previously rendered by the web browser 122 based on a similarity analysis of the navigation tree 114, such that the first group 116 of web pages 121 includes two or more web pages having content that is thematically related to one another. In some implementations, the similarity analyzer 108 is configured to cluster a first subset (e.g., two or more navigation trees) of the navigation trees 114 into a first cluster group based on the similarity analysis, and identify a first group 116 of web pages 121 from the first cluster group. The similarity analyzer 108 is configured to cluster a second subset (e.g., two or more navigation trees) of the navigation trees 114 into a second cluster group based on the similarity analysis, and identify a second group 118 of web pages 121 from the second cluster group.
In some implementations, the similarity analyzer 108 may represent each navigation tree 114 with keywords and associate a probability with each of the keywords that indicates a relative likelihood that a particular keyword represents its navigation tree 114. For example, the similarity analyzer 108 may represent each web page 121 with a set of keywords, and each of the keywords may represent a relative likelihood that a particular keyword represents that web page 121. In some implementations, the probability is determined based on a word frequency and inverse document frequency technique. For a particular navigation tree 114, the similarity analyzer 108 may accumulate all keywords in all web pages 121 in the navigation tree 114. The similarity analyzer 108 may create a feature vector based on the keywords and their probabilities.
In one example, a navigation tree 114 related to a yellow stone national park may have a set of keywords associated with the yellow stone national park navigation tree, such as parks, bison, spa, camping, etc., and each of those keywords is associated with a respective probability that the keyword represents the navigation tree 114 (e.g., bison has a probability of 0.9, park has a probability of 0.3). The similarity analyzer 108 may use the keywords and probabilities to create a feature vector for each navigation tree 114 and determine a distance (or similarity) vector based on a comparison of the feature vectors. In some embodiments, the cosine distance between feature vectors is used as a distance (or similarity) metric in a clustering algorithm. If the value of the distance metric is above a threshold level, the similarity analyzer 108 server may determine that the corresponding navigation trees 114 are similarly related to the same topic and include these navigation trees 114 in the cluster group. The web pages 121 of the navigation trees 114 in the cluster group may be identified as web pages of the group.
In some implementations, the generation of the group of web pages 121 may indicate that the user is performing a task. In some implementations, the generation of the particular group of web pages 121 occurs when at least two navigation trees 114 are determined to be thematically related to each other. In some implementations, the generation of a particular group of web pages 121 occurs when the navigation tree 114 has more than a threshold number of nodes (e.g., more than 2 or 3 nodes). As described above, each navigation tree 114 is represented by a set of keywords having probabilities. When the keywords of the cluster group are topic-related to one or more keywords of the content viewed by the user (e.g., the keywords of the content currently displayed have a similarity measure above a threshold level with respect to the keywords of the cluster group), the system 100 may determine that the user is performing a task and provide one or navigation suggestions 128 on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122.
In some implementations, the similarity analyzer 108 may compare the content of the web pages 121 (e.g., page-by-page comparison) without using the navigation tree 114. For example, keywords associated with a first web page and keywords associated with a second web page may be compared and, if the similarity comparison results in a similarity measure above a threshold level, the first and second web pages are similar to each other in the sense that they are related to the same topic. However, the similarity analyzer 108 may use other types of similarity techniques, such as string-based similarity measurements (e.g., Longest Common Substring (LCS), Damerau Levenshtein, Jaro Winkler, etc.) and word-based similarity measurements (e.g., block distance, cosine similarity, Dice coefficient), corpus-based similarity (e.g., hyperspace language modeling (HAL), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)), and/or knowledge-based similarity, including character-based similarity.
In some implementations, the lineage-centric task builder 106 includes a page filter 110 configured to filter a first group 116 (or any other group) of web pages 121 to remove one or more web pages 121 from the first group 116. Note that any of the operations described with reference to the first group 116 may be equally applied to the second group 118. In some implementations, the page filter 110 filters the first group 116 based on timestamps associated with the web pages 121 in the first group 116. For example, the page filter 110 may remove one or more web pages 121 from the first group 116 that are longer than a predetermined time (e.g., remove web pages 121 that are longer than 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, etc.). In some implementations, the page filter 110 filters the first group 116 based on one or more user engagement metrics associated with the web pages 121 in the first group 116. The user engagement metric may determine or include an amount of user engagement with each web page 121 in the first group 116 based on the amount of user engagement with each page 121 in the first group 116. The user engagement metrics may include the amount of times a particular web page 121 is viewed, interacted with, or loaded, the amount of time spent on the particular web page 121, and the level of engagement with the particular web page 121. If one or more user engagement metrics for a web page 121 in the first group 116 are below a threshold level, the page filter 110 may remove the web page 121 from the first group 116. In some implementations, the page filter 110 can filter the first group 116 based on the navigation trees 114 in the first cluster group. For example, page filter 110 may filter web pages 121 to retain web pages 121 associated with hub node 330 and leaf node 332, but may remove web pages 121 associated with other nodes (e.g., intermediate node 336). In some implementations, the page filter 110 can filter the web pages 121 in the first group 116 based on any of the above-identified types of the acquired data 101.
FIG. 4 shows a graphical representation of an example manner of filtering of web pages 121 in the first group 116. As shown in FIG. 4, web page 121 may include web page 401, web page 402, web page 403, and web page 404. These web pages may be rendered (or have been rendered) in one or more browsing tabs 126 of a browsing session, and these web pages may be represented in one or more navigation trees 114 associated with a particular cluster group. The page filter 110 may filter the web pages using any of the filtering techniques described above to remove the web pages 402 and 403 from the first group 116.
Referring back to FIG. 1A, the lineage-centric task builder 106 includes a page sequencer 112 configured to sequence web pages 121 in the first group 116 and/or the second group 118. For example, the page ranker 112 may rank the first group 116 based on a timestamp (e.g., the time a particular web page 121 was rendered or accessed) such that the first group 116 includes chronologically, thematically related web pages 121. In some implementations, the page ranker 112 ranks the first group 116 based on one or more user engagement levels such that the first group 116 includes a list of topic-related web pages 121, where the web pages with higher user engagement levels are placed first on the list.
In some implementations, in the case of mobility (e.g., the computing device 120 is a smartphone, tablet, etc.), it may be unlikely that switching between multiple browsing tabs 126 to perform a task may occur. Conversely, in many cases, in order to locate previously viewed information, it is possible for a user to create a new browser tab 126 to find the desired web page 121. However, the navigation suggestions 128 are configured to provide a graphical arrangement of one or more web pages 121 in the first set 116 (or the second set 118) to assist the user in performing a task, as described further below.
In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 can be user interface elements (or elements) that provide at least a portion of the list of the first group 116 on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 are presented when it is determined that the currently viewed content is contextually relevant to the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 are a list of web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 identify at least a subset of the web pages 121 in the first set 116 as user-selectable links, where upon selection of one of the links, the web browser 122 is configured to reload the selected web page 121 (or provide pre-fetched or pre-rendered content of the web page 121). In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 identify the title (or phrase describing the page) of each of the web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 display representative images associated with one or more of the web pages 121. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 display a map and a location on the map associated with one or more of the web pages 121. In some examples, the navigation suggestions 128 provide for a sequential display of the web page 121 that should be executed to perform the task.
In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 that identify one or all of the web pages 121 in the first group 116 are provided on the browser page along with selectable links for reloading the web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the browser page identifies the web pages 121 in the first group 116 in chronological order, where the list is grouped by the number of days that the web pages 121 in the first group 116 were accessed. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first group 116 are arranged in a UI carousel view, either horizontally or vertically. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 identify the web pages 121 in the first group 116 chronologically. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 identify only a portion of the web pages 121 in the first group 116 and an option to expand the navigation suggestions 128 to view other web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 include a single vertical card, a visual grid layout that groups the web pages 121 in the first group 116, and/or other types of user interface layouts that present the web pages 121 in the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 identify multiple groups (e.g., the first group 116 and the second group 118) and an option for selecting one of the groups to view the web pages 121 of that group.
In some implementations, the web browser 122 can display links to groups in a page (or portion) of the web browser 122. In some implementations, web browser 122 can display links to groups in the bookmark portion of web browser 122. In some implementations, when the user is using web browser 122, web browser 122 can provide a suggestion for one of the groups. In some implementations, the web browser 122 can provide navigation suggestions to the first group 116 when the user is typing one or more search terms into the search box of the web browser 122. For example, in response to one or more search terms being determined to be related to the first group 116 of topics, the web browser 122 may display a link to the first group 116. After selecting the link, web browser 122 may display a list of web pages 121 in first group 116.
FIG. 5A shows an example of a navigation suggestion 128 as an auto tab list 518 having a collection of theme related auto tabs. The auto tabs may include a first auto tab 520-1, a second auto tab 520-2, and a third auto tab 520-3. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the first group 116 can be auto tabs in the auto tab list 518. In some implementations, the web pages 121 in the second group 118 may be auto tabs in the auto tab list 518. In some implementations, the user can select one of the auto tabs in the auto tab list 518, which causes the web browser 122 to reload the web page 121 (or provide pre-fetched or pre-rendered web content) in the particular browser tab 126.
In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is a collection of topic-related web pages 121 that have been filtered (as previously discussed above) to omit one or more web pages 121. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is a collection of theme-related web pages 121 that correspond to a working set of browser tabs 126. The working set of browser tabs 126 may be web pages in the currently opened browser tab 126 and/or web pages in the back stack of the currently opened browser tab 126. In some implementations, an auto tab list 518 that identifies a chronological list of web pages 121 in the first group 116 is rendered on the user interface 124 of the UI layout. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is a UI layout that identifies the web pages 121 in the first group 116 in order by likelihood of return based on one or more user engagement metrics, such as the number of times a particular web page 121 is viewed, interacted with, or loaded, the time spent on the particular web page 121, and the level of user engagement with the particular web page 121.
In some implementations, an auto tab list 518 is rendered in a list format on the user interface 124, the auto tab list 518 identifying titles of the web pages 121 in the first group 116 (or the second group 118), corresponding web sites, and images associated with the web pages 121. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is rendered in a comb style format on the user interface 124. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is rendered in a grid format on the user interface 124. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is rendered on the user interface 124 in a tab group format, where the auto tabs are grouped by subject matter into extensible cards. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is rendered on the user interface 124 in a tab stack format, where the auto tabs are grouped into stacks by subject matter and the top auto tab in each stack is the most recently used tab in the stack. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 includes a search portion (e.g., search box, search suggestions) that allows searching the internet.
In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is rendered by the web browser 122 with respect to the particular browser tab 126. For example, web browser 122 may cause first browser tab 131 and second browser tab 132 to open. In some implementations, with the first browser tab 131 in the foreground, the user can enter the tab switcher UI. An auto tab list 518 may be provided in the UI layout at a location proximate to the first browser tab 131. In some implementations, while in the tab switcher UI, the user can place the second browser tab 132 in the foreground, which causes the web browser 122 to provide the auto tab list 518 in the UI layout at a location proximate to the second browser tab 132. However, if the first browser tab 131 and the second browser tab 132 are thematically related to the first group 116, the auto tab list 518 may include the same (or similar) web pages 121 in the first group 116. If the first browser tab 131 is thematically related to the first group 116, the auto tab list 518 may include a list of web pages 121 in the first group 116, and the auto tab list 518 is rendered proximate to the first browser tab 131. If the second browser tab 132 is thematically related to the second group 118, the auto tab list 518 may include a list of web pages 121 in the second group 118, and the auto tab list 518 is rendered proximate to the second browser tab 132.
Fig. 5B shows an example of the relationship between the auto tab list 518 and the group (or lineage). The first auto tab list 518-1 may be associated with the first set 116 associated with the first lineage. For example, a first auto tab list 518-1 may include a list of web pages 121 in the first group 116. In this example, since the first browser tab 131 and the second browser tab 132 are related to the first set 116 of topics, the first browser tab 131 is associated with a first auto tab list 518-1 and the second browser tab 132 is associated with a first auto tab list 518-1. However, the third browser tab 133 is related to the second set 118 of topics for the second lineage, and the third browser tab 133 is associated with a second auto tab list 518-2 that includes a list of web pages 121 in the second set 118. The auto tab list 518 may change if a particular browser tab 126 is subject related to a different group. For example, if the first browser tab 131 becomes related to the second set 118 of themes, the second auto tab list 518-2 will be associated with the first browser tab 131.
Fig. 6 shows an example of switching to an auto tab in auto tab list 518. As shown in fig. 6, the browser tab (tab a) is associated with an auto tab list 518 that identifies auto tab B, auto tab C, and auto tab D. In some implementations, the auto tab list 518 is automatically provided in the area of the user interface 124 proximate to browser tab a when the user enters the tab switcher UI. The user may select auto tab C, which causes web browser 122 to reopen the tab. In some implementations, browser tab C is reopened with a post-stack and scrolled from its previous use position. The next time the user returns to the tab switcher UI, the page from which the user switches is at the top of the auto tab list 518. For example, when the user enters the tab switcher UI, the auto tab list 518 associated with browser tab C includes the same auto tab as well as browser tab a, which is the last browser tab viewed.
FIG. 7 shows an example of a navigation suggestion 128 as an item list 718 with a collection of theme-related item tabs. The tabs may include a first tab 720-1, a second tab 720-2, and a third tab 720-3. In some implementations, web pages 121 in the first group 116 can be represented by item tabs in the item list 718. In some implementations, web pages 121 in the second group 118 can be represented by item tabs in the item list 718. In some implementations, the user can select one of the item tabs in the item list 718, which causes the web browser 122 to reload the web page 121 in the particular browser tab 126.
In some implementations, the list of items 718 is a collection of items that the user is interested in purchasing, which are tracked and collected from the user and web pages accessed using the web browser 122. For example, item list 718 may be a UI element that displays the products (or services) and/or merchants in the user's consideration set in a manner that allows for easy comparison. Typically, for product comparison, a user uses multiple browser tabs 126 to make a comparison (e.g., sometimes referred to as page-parking) between the product and the merchant. In some implementations, similar to auto tab list 518, when web browser 122 enters the tab switcher UI, item list 718 is rendered on user interface 124. In some implementations, the list of items 718 is rendered in the bookmark portion of the web browser 122 on the user interface 124. In some implementations, the display of a particular item tab on web browser 122 can be associated with a selectable pin that, when selected, causes server 102 to track the particular item. In some implementations, the list of items 718 is in a bar or list, visible from the browser toolbar, or rendered available. For example, the user may manually pin the page pin to the item list 718. In some implementations, the page of manual tack fixes remains on item list 718 until removed. In some implementations, the manually pinned page is visually distinct from the automatic items in item list 718.
FIG. 8 illustrates the relationship between the item list 718 and the group (or lineage). The first list of items 718-1 may be associated with a first group 116 (which is associated with a first lineage). For example, first item list 718-1 may include a list of web pages 121 in first group 116. In this example, since the first browser tab 131 and the second browser tab 132 are thematically related to the first group 116, the first browser tab 131 is associated with the first list of items 718-1 and the second browser tab 132 is associated with the first list of items 718-1. However, third browser tab 133 is associated with second group 118, and third browser tab 133 is associated with second item list 718-2 that includes web pages 121 in second group 118.
FIG. 9 is a flowchart 900 illustrating certain exemplary operations of server 102 and/or web browser 122. Although the flowchart 900 of fig. 9 shows the operations in sequential order, it should be understood that this is merely an example and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, the operations and related operations of FIG. 9 may be performed in an order different than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping manner. In some implementations, the operations of fig. 9 are performed by the server 102. In some implementations, the operations of FIG. 9 are performed by the web browser 122. In some implementations, the operations of FIG. 9 are performed by a combination of the web browser 122 and the server 102.
In some implementations, the server 102 is configured to generate a plurality of navigation trees 114 based on the data 101, cluster subsets of the plurality of navigation trees 114 into cluster groups based on the similarity analysis, and identify the set of web pages 121 from the cluster groups. In some implementations, the navigation tree 114 includes page nodes and connections between page nodes, where a page node represents a web page 121 rendered by the web browser 122 and a connection represents a navigation path between the web pages 121.
In some implementations, web browser 122 and/or server 102 is configured to filter the set of web pages 121 based on the determined values of the one or more user engagement metrics to remove one or more web pages 121 from the set of web pages 121, where each determined value of the user engagement metric indicates an amount of user engagement with a respective web page 121 in the set. In some implementations, web browser 122 and/or server 102 is configured to rank the set of web pages 121 based on the determined values of the one or more user engagement metrics.
For example, the user may navigate to the tab switcher UI and select a particular browser tab 126 having content determined to be related to the first group 116 of topics of the web page 121, and the first group 116 of the web page 121 may be selected. The selected group may represent a task performed by a user of web browser 122. For example, since the currently viewed information is related to the first group 116, the system 100 (e.g., the server 102 and/or the web browser 122) may determine that the user is currently performing the first task.
In some implementations, the server 102 and/or the web browser 122 are configured to determine that a set of web pages 121 are thematically related to content rendered in a browser tab 126 open in the web browser 122, and provide the set of web pages 121 for selection in a location proximate to the browser tab 126 in a tab switcher interface of the web browser 122. In some implementations, server 102 and/or web browser 122 are configured to provide for selection of the networking page 121 in a bookmark portion of web browser 122. In some implementations, server 102 and/or web browser 122 are configured to provide for selection of the networking page 121 as a navigation suggestion associated with the search box of web browser 122.
In some embodiments, the set of web pages 121 is the first group 116 of web pages 121. In some implementations, the server 102 and/or web browser 122 is configured to determine the second group 118 of web pages 121 from a plurality of the plurality of web pages 121 based on a similarity analysis of the accessed data, where the second group 118 of web pages 121 has content that is of a different subject matter than the content of the first group 116, and the server 102 and/or web browser 122 is configured to provide the second group 118 of web pages 121 for selection on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122. In some implementations, the server 102 and/or the web browser 122 are configured to determine that the first set 116 of web pages 121 is thematically related to a first browser tab 131 opened on the web browser 122, determine that the second set 118 of web pages 121 is thematically related to a second browser tab 132 opened on the web browser 122, provide the first set 116 of web pages 121 for selection in response to selection of the first browser tab 131, and provide the second set 118 of web pages 121 for selection in response to selection of the second browser tab 132. In some implementations, the server 102 and/or the web browser 122 are configured to pre-fetch content of at least one web page 121 in the navigation suggestions 128 independent of a user selection of the at least one web page 121.
Fig. 10 is a flowchart 1000 illustrating exemplary operation of server 102. Although the flowchart 1000 of fig. 10 shows the operations in sequential order, it should be understood that this is merely an example and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, the operations of FIG. 10 and related operations may be performed in an order different than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping manner.
FIG. 11 is a flowchart 1100 illustrating certain exemplary operations of web browser 122. Although the flowchart 1100 of fig. 11 shows the operations in sequential order, it should be understood that this is merely an example and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, the operations of FIG. 11 and related operations may be performed in an order different than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping manner.
In some implementations, the web browser 122 can pre-fetch the web content of at least one web page 121 in the set of web pages 121 prior to user selection of the at least one web page 121. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 display the list of web pages 121 in chronological order. In some implementations, the group web page 121 is thematically related to content displayed in a browser tab 126 open on the web browser 122, and the web browser 122 is configured to display a list of the group web page 121 in a tab switcher interface of the web browser 122 in response to a user selection of the browser tab 126 within the tab switcher interface.
In some implementations, the networked page is a first group 116 of web pages 121, and the web browser 122 is configured to receive an identification of a second group 118 of web pages 121 from the server 102 over the network 130, wherein the second group 118 of web pages 121 has content that is of a different subject matter than the content of the first group 116 of web pages 121. The first group 116 of web pages 121 is thematically related to a first browser tab 131 opened on the web browser 122, and the second group 118 of web pages 121 is thematically related to a second browser tab 132 opened on the web browser 122. The Web browser 122 may display the first browser tab 131 and the second browser tab 132 for selection in a tab switch interface of the Web browser 122, display a list of the Web pages 121 of the first group 116 in the tab switch interface in response to a user selection of the first browser tab 121 within the tab browser interface, and display a list of the Web pages 121 of the second group 118 in the tab switch interface in response to a user selection of the second browser tab 132 within the tab switch interface.
In some implementations, the web browser 122 is configured to display the links to the group on the user interface 124 of the web browser 122 and to display the list of the group web pages 121 in response to a user selection of a link. In some implementations, the web browser 122 is configured to display the links to the group in a bookmark portion of the web browser 122. In some implementations, the web browser 122 is configured to display links to the group as navigation suggestions in response to one or more search terms being entered in a search box of the web browser 122.
Fig. 12A-12K illustrate example screen shots of the web browser 122 configured to display the first group 116 as an auto tab list 518. The example screenshot depicts a browsing session using a web browser 122 in which the user is performing a task, e.g., is deciding to watch a new Avengers movie. FIG. 12A shows a screenshot of an Internet search using the search term, avengers: definition war. The user then uses the web browser 122 to watch a trailer for the movie (see the screenshot of fig. 12B), articles about the movie (see the screenshot of fig. 12C), and the actor lineup for the movie (see the screenshot of fig. 12D). Then, fig. 12E, 12F, 12G, and 12H are screen shots showing the curiosity of the user about one of the actors, and search for Benedict cumbermatch. After reading the screen shot for cumberbaratch (see figure 12H), the user has decided to watch the movie, but now the user decides that he wants to persuade one of his friends to come and want to locate the trailer.
Upon selecting the connection 141, the web browser 122 displays a tab switcher UI142 as shown in FIG. 12I. The tab switcher UI142 provides a horizontal carousel graph to switch to other browser tabs in the user's work set, as shown in FIG. 12I. With respect to the selected tab in the tab switcher UI142, the web browser 122 provides an auto tab list 518 that identifies the set of topic-related web pages 121 that are related to the selected browser tab topic, as shown in the screen shots of FIG. 12I and FIG. 12J. The auto tab list 518 includes trailers for Avengers that the user can click on to load the page (see screenshot of fig. 12K) and share with another user.
Fig. 13A-13M illustrate example screen shots of a web browser 122 configured to display the first group 118 as a list of items 718. The example screenshot depicts a browsing session using the web browser 122 in which the user is performing a task, e.g., purchasing a new vacuum cleaner. Fig. 13A and 13B are screen shots showing a user using web browser 122 to load and view a review site. Fig. 13C, 13D, 13E are screenshots showing a user locating two potential items. The user wants to verify these options and find additional options, so the user searches for other comments, as shown in fig. 13F and 13G. From the comments in the screenshot of FIG. 13H, the user locates two other items, as shown in the screenshots of FIG. 13I and FIG. 13J. As shown in the screen shots of fig. 13K, 13L, and 13M, web browser 122 identifies an item list 718 that includes items that the user has viewed. For example, as shown in the screenshot of FIG. 13K, web browser 122 displays tab switcher UI142 and web browser 122 provides item list 718 for the selected browser tab. In some implementations, as shown in the screenshot of FIG. 13K, the web browser 122 also displays an auto tab list 518 associated with the selected browser tab. Upon selection of link 160, web browser 122 displays an auto tab list 518 with a complete list of items (in this example, the number of items is 4), as shown in the screenshot of FIG. 13L. Further, in some implementations, the user can manually pin the item to item list 718. For example, as shown in the screenshot of fig. 13M, the list of items 718 also includes manually pinned items that are distinguished from other items by displaying icons 162 associated with the manually pinned items.
Fig. 14 illustrates an example screenshot of navigation suggestions 128 that displays the first group 116 as a page (e.g., also referred to as a history page). As shown in fig. 14, the calendar page depicts the web pages in the first group 116 in a time sequence, separated by the number of days the web page 121 was rendered. The lineage page also includes a title (e.g., Seattle Hiking), which is the title of the first group 116. In some implementations, the navigation suggestions 128 also display the top web page 167 of the first group 116 (e.g., selected by the user engagement metric).
FIG. 15 illustrates an example screenshot of web browser 122. In some implementations, the web browser 122 can provide navigation suggestions 171 for the first group 116 when the user is typing one or more search terms into the search box 170 of the web browser 122. For example, in response to one or more search terms being determined to be relevant to the first group 116, the web browser 122 may display navigation suggestions 171 for the first group 116. Upon selection of the navigation suggestion 171, the web browser 122 may display a list of the web pages 121 of the first group 116, as shown in FIG. 14.
