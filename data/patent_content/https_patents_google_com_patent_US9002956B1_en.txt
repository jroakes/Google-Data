Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to social networks and electronic communication.
- the present disclosure relates to a system and methods for associating a “loudness,” relevance or importance to electronic communications in social networks.
- the present disclosure relates to a system and method for self-regulating social news feeds.
- Spam e-mail (known also as junk e-mail or unsolicited bulk e-mail) is generally identical e-mail messages sent to numerous recipients who did not request it.
- the phrase spam has also been applied to other communications such as those in social networks such as instant messages or posts. Spam used to be generated primarily and most often by unknown third-parties trying to sell you something. In recent years, however, spam has increasingly been generated by your own friends, and to some extent, possibly by yourself.
- the advent of social news feeds embedded in online social networks has made it clear that, if given an unlimited amount of bandwidth to express themselves, a loud minority of users will abuse that freedom and post excessively/frequently on these shared spaces, sharing random fleeting thoughts of little significance, making it time-consuming for everyone else to filter their way to more worthwhile messages. Even among users who think more carefully before posting, not all their messages are of equal importance.
- the present disclosure overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art at least in part by providing a system and method for self-regulating social news feeds.
- the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods that allow the user to specify a “loudness” or importance for messages that are posted.
- the system includes a user interface module, data storage, a loudness controller, a quality engine, and an output or news feed module.
- the user interface module is adapted to receive input from the user including loudness points associated with a particular message.
- the loudness points can be associated with an originally generated message or a reply to/review of an existing message.
- the messages and their associated loudness points are provided to the loudness controller.
- the loudness controller applies loudness points based upon the author's assigned points and points input by replies to the original message.
- the loudness controller then sorts the messages in order of loudness.
- the loudness points can also be modified based upon input from the quality engine.
- the quality engine modifies the loudness points based upon a quality rating associated with the user.
- the output of the loudness controller is provided for presentation to the user via the output or news feed module.
- the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it provides a system and interface that enable users posting messages to social news feeds to allocate importance/loudness points to each message they are about to post, from a slowly-replenishing but ultimately finite pool of points available to them. This ensures that each time a message is posted, the person posting the message has already prioritized the importance of that message relative to other messages posted by them. Furthermore, the present disclosure is advantageous because it allows ranking of messages not only based on how the audience perceives each message, but also based on how the person issuing the message feels it ought to be ranked relative to other messages they typically issue.
- the present disclosure also describes a number of methods including a method for posting a message with loudness points, a method for replying with loudness points, a method for modifying the loudness points for message, and a method for modifying a loudness point total of the user.
- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a functional view of a system for self-regulating messages in a social network according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a regulation module according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating data storage of the regulation module according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a method for sending or posting a message with loudness points according to one embodiment.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are a flowchart of a method for replying with loudness points according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of a method for modifying the points for message according to one embodiment.

- the first portion 300 comprises a plurality of records with each record including a user ID field 302 , an output points field 304 , a review points field 306 and the quality rating 308 .
- the user ID field 302 stores a unique number that identifies the user.
- the output points field 304 stores a value indicating a number of loudness points that are available to the user to associate with original messages (the pool of loudness points available to the user).
- the second portion 350 of the data storage 204 includes a plurality of records with each record corresponding to a particular message.
- the records for each message include a message identifier field 352 , a time reference field 354 , a total number of points field 356 , a payload field 358 and a history field 360 .
- the message identifier field 352 is used to store a unique number that identifies the message.
- the time reference field 354 stores a time value indicating the time and date when the message was first created and posted. This time reference field 354 is used by the loudness controller 206 to adjust the total point value associated with the message for decay over time.
- the total number of points field 356 stores a value indicating the original loudness points associated with the message plus any additional loudness points that have been given by other users during review or reply.
- the payload field 358 stores the original message content.
- the history field 360 stores information about the loudness history of the message such as how many loudness points the method originally had one posted, how many additional points have been added (or subtracted) because of replies or time. Similar to the records for the users, those skilled in the art will recognize that the records depicted in FIG. 3 are merely one example of an embodiment for the message records. Various modifications or adjustments to these records are possible and within the scope of the present disclosure such as eliminating the history field 360 or the payload field 358 .
- the loudness controller 206 is coupled to the user interface module 202 , the data storage 204 , the quality engine 208 , the news feed module 210 , the micro-blogging module 212 , the social network module 214 and the self regulation module 216 .
- the loudness controller 206 receives input from the user via the user interface 202 and assigns loudness points to messages.
- the loudness controller 206 also communicates with the data storage 204 to deduct loudness points from the total points available for the originator of the message.
- the present invention is particularly advantageous because each user is provided with only a finite number of loudness points to associate with messages. Once a user has used all their loudness points, they are not able to add loudness points to any additional messages that they send, thereby effectively losing their voice.
- the loudness controller 206 allows a user to create messages, but does not post them until a later time in the future when the user has accumulated enough loudness points for the message. However, the more loudness points the user assigns to the message the longer in the future the message will be delayed/scheduled for posting. In yet another embodiment, the loudness controller 206 allocates each user a limited number of emergency messages that can be posted.
- the loudness controller 206 also tracks the loudness points associated with each message and communicates with the data storage 204 to use the data structure that has been described above.
- the loudness controller 206 tracks not only the loudness points that were originally associated with the message, but also tracks reply or review points that have been added or subtracted from the loudness points by other users that have reviewed or replied to the original message.
- the loudness controller 206 also deducts loudness points from message due to time decay.
- the loudness controller 206 also communicates with the quality engine 208 to determine a quality for the user.
- This quality rating is used by the loudness controller 206 to increase or decrease the number of points associated with a message based upon the quality rating of the original author of the message or replies to the message. For example, if a particular originator of messages has a high quality ranking and thereby has a multiplier of two times, the loudness controller 206 will multiply the loudness points originally input by the message originator by a factor of two because of this quality rating. In a similar vein, the multiplier may decrease the loudness points for individuals of users that are notorious for sending messages with little or no value.
- the loudness controller 206 adjusts the total point values of messages based upon the time that has elapsed since the message was created and posted. For example, the loudness point value associated with each message can decay over time. The loudness controller 206 uses the timestamp associated with a message and adjusts the total points associated with the message based upon how much time has elapsed. In one embodiment, the messages are reviewed on a periodic basis such as daily, weekly, or monthly. In a similar way, the loudness controller 206 also adds loudness points to users after the passage of time. In one embodiment, each user is awarded additional loudness points such as on a daily basis. For example, users may be given an additional 3 points per day.
- additional points may be granted or awarded based upon different factors such as the number of messages that have been posted, an average number of messages that have been posted over time, the quality of the messages that have been posted, the number of replies that have been received, etc.
- the loudness controller 206 retrieves and orders messages relevant to a particular user according to the number of loudness points associated with each message. For example, the messages are selected based on their relevance or interest to a particular user. Once a set of messages has been determined, those messages are sorted from the messages with the highest number of loudness points to the messages with the lowest number of loudness points. In other embodiments, the loudness controller 206 applies a filter to provide only a predetermined number of messages from the messages with the highest loudness point values or only those messages that have a loudness point total above a predetermined threshold. The loudness controller 206 interacts with the user interface module 202 to present the messages as will be described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 9A and 9B .
- the quality engine 208 is coupled to the loudness controller 206 to provide a quality rating.
- the quality engine 208 is also coupled by the bus 220 to other systems in FIG. 1 to receive information and generates a quality rating from that information.
- the quality engine 208 provides a multiplier that is used for increasing or decreasing the number of points that are regenerated and given to the user.
- the quality engine 208 provides a multiplier of the number of points used per message thereby increasing or decreasing the voice of the user.
- the quality rating is a multiplier of the number of loudness points available to the user.
- the loudness points are adjusted based upon the user's reputation.
- particular users may be known or identified as experts in particular fields, thus when they sent messages on those topics about which they are an expert, their quality rating is increased.
- the user's points may be adjusted for quality of past messages or replies.
- the system tracks how many messages are posted by a particular user and those messages are analyzed based upon length and frequency. Users that post frequent short messages will have a lower quality rating compared to users that post infrequently but longer messages.
- the quality engine 208 tracks the number of rely post to an original message, and if there are no replies, the quality rating is low and if there are a large number of replies the quality rating is high.
- the quality engine 208 extracts information such as reputation from other systems such as the social network 109 and translates that reputation into a quality rating.
- the number of points may be multiplied or divided depending upon the size of the user's social graph.
- the loudness points can be divided by the audience, the number of friends of the user and thereby neutralize the statistical importance of the size of a user social graph.
- the quality engine 208 processes this information and generates a multiplier that is provided to the loudness controller 206 .
- the multiplier can be greater than one in which case it amplifies or increases the loudness points of the user.
- the quality rating can also be a fraction of one and thus will dampen or decrease the loudness points of the user.
- the news feed module 210 is a module that allows the loudness controller 206 to interface with a news feed of a social network or other system.
- the news feed module 210 is coupled to receive messages and associated loudness values from the loudness controller 206 and provide them to such other systems.
- the micro-blogging module 212 is a module that allows the loudness controller 206 to interface with the micro-blogging server 121 .
- micro-blog posts can also have an associated loudness value.
- the micro-blogging module 212 interfaces with the micro-blogging server 121 to provide loudness information and point values from the loudness controller 206 .
- the micro-blogging module 212 sends loudness point values and the micro-blog post to which they are associated, as well as loudness point values for re-blogs or other actions on the micro-blogging server 121 .
- Those skilled in the art will recognize that the above operations and modifications noted above are merely a subset of possible inputs that may be provided by micro-blogging module 212 to the micro-blogging server 121 .
- the social network module 214 is a module that allows the loudness controller 206 to interface with the social network application 109 .
- any type of message within the social network application 109 can be provided with an associated loudness value.
- the social network module 214 interfaces with the loudness controller 206 so that the loudness controller 206 can provide the loudness point values and perform the operations described above for the messages within the social network application 109 that have associated loudness values.
- the social network module 214 is coupled to the loudness controller 206 and to the social network application via the bus 220 .
- the self-regulation module 216 is for outputting the loudness point values of messages and users, and other information related to loudness points and quality to other systems 101 , 107 , 109 , 121 , 125 , 127 , 129 , 131 , 115 , 123 , 135 , 125 such as the social graph 125 , the user profile server 127 , etc.
- the self-regulation module 216 may include application interfaces that allow it to communicate with these other systems 101 , 107 , 109 , 121 , 125 , 127 , 129 , 131 , 115 , 123 , 135 , 125 .
- the self-regulation module 216 is coupled to receive loudness points, messages and other information from the loudness controller 206 or the data storage 204 .
- the self-regulation module 216 is coupled by bus 220 to the network 105 , and thus, the other systems 101 , 107 , 121 , 125 , 127 , 129 , 131 , 115 , 123 , 135 , 125 .
- FIGS. 4-7 the methods of the present disclosure will be described.
- the method begins by displaying 402 a user interface 800 for sending messages with associated loudness points.
- the user interface module 202 causes a user interface 800 to be displayed on the user device 115 .
- An example user interface 800 is described immediately below with reference to FIG. 8 .
- the user interface 800 may be integrated as part of other systems such as an e-mail client, a newsfeed interface or a social network interface.
- the user interface 800 includes a window having a number of components including a message box 802 in which the user can input a message, a loudness box 804 that allows the user to assign loudness points, a field 806 indicating the number of loudness points available to the user, a pull down menu 808 for selecting the audience that will receive the message, and a button 810 for sending or sharing the message.
- a message box 802 in which the user can input a message
- a loudness box 804 that allows the user to assign loudness points
- a field 806 indicating the number of loudness points available to the user
- a pull down menu 808 for selecting the audience that will receive the message
- a button 810 for sending or sharing the message.
- the message box 802 is an area in which the user can type in the message that they want posted or sent. As shown in FIG. 8 , the message box 802 has a caption of “What would like to say?” In an alternate embodiment, the message box 802 has other captions or for reply messages and includes the message to which the user is replying in the message box 802 .
- the loudness box 804 allows the user to input the number of loudness points that the user would like to be associated with the message in the message box 802 .
- the user can either manually input a number in the loudness box 804 or the user can use the “+” or “ ⁇ ” buttons to increment or decrement the value in the loudness box 804 .
- the user interface module 202 automatically inputs a loudness value such as one or two into the loudness box 804 . Awarding more loudness points to a particular message will make it appear more prominently in the audience's message feeds. For example, a message posted with five points is more likely to appear ahead of a message posted by others with four points or fewer. Points allocated to a message are deducted from the user's pool of loudness points.
- the user interface 800 includes a field 806 indicating the number of loudness points that the user has available for use. Once the user has zero loudness points, they effectively cannot speak; and therefore, cannot send messages.
- the user interface 800 also includes an indication of the rate at which loudness points will be regenerated or provided to the user. In this case, it is based upon time and each user receives an additional three loudness points per day. In other embodiments, the rate and factors upon which additional loudness points are given to each user may vary. For example, various factors such as time, quality, frequency, and number of replies may cause a particular user to have loudness points replenished or given at different rates.
- a user may be rewarded with additional loudness points where the quality of their messages is high or the rate at which loudness points are replenished is at a higher rate for the higher quality users. If a message that has been posted by the user receives a high number of replies, the user may be given additional loudness points because of the number of replies to their original message. In such a case, the number of replies is in a preferred measure of quality.
- users are allowed to borrow a loudness points up to a predefined limit. For example, users are able to lend/borrow points to others and be paid back with interest.
- users can also “invest” in other users they think will use these points wisely, but instead of (or in addition to) having points returned, the investment will produce an adjustment the investors quality score on the evolution of the quality score of the speaker in which you invested.
- the pull down menu 808 allows the user to select the audience that should receive the message.
- the audience may be everyone, family, coworkers, subscribers to a topic, or any other groups.
- the audience pull down menu 808 is populated based upon circles or groups that the user has created or that have been created for the user by the system in the social network application 109 .
- the share button 810 will cause the message with the associated loudness points in the loudness box 804 to be sent.
- the method continues with the user interface module 202 receiving 404 content for the message from the user.
- the user types in the desired message into box 802 of the user interface 800 .
- the user interface receives 406 a loudness value that is to be associated with the message. Again, the user can assign any number of points from their pool of available points using the loudness box 804 of user interface 800 . The user may also borrow points or send an emergency message as has been described above.
- the user selects 408 an audience that will receive the message.
- steps 404 , 406 , 408 can be performed by the user in any order, steps may be omitted, and the ordering in FIG. 4 is merely by way of example.
- the method determines 410 whether the user has decided to send the message, such as by selecting the share button 810 . If not, the method returns to step 402 and continues to display the user interface 800 and receives input from the user in steps 404 - 408 . If it is determined that the message should be sent, the method transitions to step 412 and the loudness controller 206 identifies the user and determines how many loudness points that the identified user has. The loudness controller 206 determines the user, accesses the data store and the record corresponding to the user to determine the number of loudness points that the user has available. Next loudness controller 206 determines 414 whether the user has enough loudness points to send a message.
- the method begins by receiving 502 posts or messages.
- the messages are received by the loudness controller 206 .
- the method then groups the messages according to relevance to particular users and sorts 504 the messages according to the number of loudness points associated with each message.
- the loudness controller 206 filters the messages relevant to a user and then sorts those messages from the message with the highest number of loudness points to the message with the lowest number of loudness points.
- the sorted messages are displayed 506 by the user interface module 202 in a user interface 900 .
- the user interface 900 includes a window 902 that displays a plurality of messages 904 .
- the user interface 900 shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B is populated with a plurality of example messages 904 .
- the user interface 900 advantageously sorts the messages 904 in order with the message 904 having the highest number of loudness points at the top to the message 904 with the lowest number of loudness points at the bottom.
- the message are also filtered with a date cutoff (or within a date range). For example, do not show messages older than 1 month, regardless of how they rank in loudness points.
- each message 904 also includes a number of fields 910 , 912 , 914 , 916 , 920 and a number of possible input commands 918 and 922 .
- the first field 910 of the message 904 provides identifying information for the author of the message.
- the first field 910 can include a photograph of the user, a user name, a login name, nickname or other identifying information of the author of the message.
- the second field 912 provides the date and time which the message was posted.
- a third field 914 indicates the number of users that have commented on this message.
- the third field 914 includes a hypertext or other type of link which when selected by the user displays the original message in a different user interface or new window as well as one or more of the reply messages.
- the reply messages are sorted in order of loudness points. In another embodiment, the reply messages are shown indented and ordered from most current to least current.
- the fourth field 916 indicates the number of loudness points associated with the message 904 .
- the current loudness is an indication of the cumulative loudness points that are associated with the message 904 from the original author of the message 904 as well as replies.
- the current loudness value is presented in multiple fields, one of which is a total number of loudness points, a second of which provides the original loudness points assigned to the message, the third field provides a total of the loudness points from reply messages and a fourth field provides a number of points lost to time decay.
- the order of the messages 904 is sortable on any of these three fields.
- the fourth field 916 is selectable and if the user selects the fourth field 916 the number of loudness points originally associated with the message and the number of reply loudness points are displayed to the user.
- the final field 920 provides the message content itself.
- each message 904 also includes a number of buttons 918 , 922 for taking action relative to the message 904 .
- the first button 918 will remove the message 904 from the user interface 900 , and thus the newsfeed.
- the user has the option to remove the particular message 904 associated with the button 918 .
- selection of the remove button 918 removes messages 904 by this author. This can either be done automatically, or by presentation of additional pop-up window that allows user selection.
- the other button 922 is to provide additional loudness points based on either review or reply to the message.
- each button 922 has a default loudness value shown thereon, and when the loudness button 922 is selected by the user, that number of loudness points are added to the loudness value for this message.
- the loudness point value associated with each button may be different such as “+n” or variable.
- the loudness points are also deducted from the user that selected the loudness button 922 . For example, the deduction can be one to one based on how many loudness points the user associated with the reply.
- selection of the loudness button 922 presents a pull down menu that allows the user to specify the number of points with which they would like to add to the message being reviewed.
- selection of the loudness button 922 causes a reply window to be presented.
- the reply window similar to that shown in FIG. 8 is presented with the original message as well as a box for the user to input their reply.
- the reply window includes the ability to associate any number of loudness points with the reply message, subject to the limitation that the points will be contacted from the user's pool of available points.
- buttons such as a reply but are added proximate the remove the loudness button 918 , 922 to allow the user to take other action relative to a particular message 904 .
- This user interface 900 is particularly advantageous because high importance messages start and stay at the top even if audiences take a while before commenting, while low importance messages start and stay at the bottom.
- the method continues receiving 508 input from the user by the user interface module 202 .
- the method determines 510 whether the input was to increase the loudness of the message. If so, the method determines 512 the message corresponding to the input provided by the user. In other words, the loudness controller 206 determines the message corresponding to the loudness button 922 that was selected. In one embodiment, the method determines 514 the number of loudness points, in other words, the volume, that should be added to the message. This step is shown with dashed lines in FIG. 5A because it is optional in some embodiments where the number of loudness points associated with the loudness button 922 is preset to be a default value.
- the number of loudness points may vary and the loudness controller 206 determines the loudness points associated with the particular loudness button 922 corresponding to the message. In still other embodiments, the number of loudness points is input by the user and to this number is received from the user interface module 202 .
- the method continues by increasing 516 the loudness points for the message. For example, the loudness controller 206 determines the number of loudness points and updates the loudness points in the record corresponding to the message that is stored in data store 204 .
- the method continues to adjust 518 the number of loudness points selected by the user and deducts them from the user's available loudness points stored in the data store 204 . After step 518 the method is complete and ends.
- step 510 the method determines whether the user has selected the loudness link or input and would like to show the breakdown of how the current loudness total is derived. If the user is interested in seeing the breakdown of the loudness points, the method continues to step 522 to modify the user interface 900 to show the breakdown of the loudness points, after which the method is complete and ends. If not, the method continues from step 520 in FIG. 5A to step 524 in FIG. 5B . In step 524 , the method determines the operation was input by the user. For example, the user may have input or selected the remove button 918 or reply button to perform some other action relative to the message 904 . Next to the method performs the action associated with the input and then updates the user interface 900 after which the method is complete and ends.
- the method begins by receiving 602 a message and its associated point value. Then the method stores 604 the message and its point value in the data store 204 .
- the loudness controller 206 receives 606 reply messages and reply loudness points that correspond to the message.
- the loudness controller 206 determines the original message corresponding to reply message and adjust the loudness points for that original message by the number of reply loudness points associated with the reply and then stores that information in the data store 204 .
- the method determines 610 whether there are additional replies that need to be processed. If so, the method performs steps 606 and 608 for each reply.
- the method continues to determine 612 whether a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. If not, the method returns to step 602 and continues to adjust the point values of the messages. On the other hand, if a predetermined amount of time has elapsed, then the loudness points for a particular message are adjusted 614 .
- the present invention reduces the loudness points for each message based on the passage of time. For example, messages with more than one loudness point will lose one point every day until they reach a small fraction of their maximal loudness. This is particularly advantageous because it assures that the most relevant and timely messages continue to appear near the top of the user interface 900 .
- the messages are processed and adjusted for time decay individually.
- the regulation module 103 adjusts the loudness point values for the messages in the data store such as once a day, once a week, once a month or at some other interval. After the messages have been adjusted for time decay, the method returns to step 602 continues to adjust loudness point values of the messages. While the method 600 disclosed above with reference to FIG. 6 anticipates a process in which the loudness point values are adjusted on a continual basis, those skilled in the art will recognize that this method may be performed at various different times, periodically, or in ways other than on a continual basis.
- a method 700 for modifying a point total of the user begins by retrieving 702 a user's loudness points from the data storage 204 .
- the method determines 704 whether the user has sent any messages. If not, the method continues in step 710 as will be described below. However, if the user has sent messages, the method determines 706 the loudness points that the user associated with each message. Then the method reduces 708 the number of loudness points associated with that user by the number of determined points in step 706 . For example, the loudness controller 206 updates the record for the user in the data store 204 . The method then continues in step 710 .
- step 710 the method determines whether the user has sent any reply messages. If not, the method continues in step 716 as will be described below. However, if the user has send reply messages, the method determines 712 the loudness points associated with each reply message. The available loudness points for the user is then reduced 714 by the number of loudness points determined in step 712 , after which the method continues on to step 716 .
- step 716 the method determines whether a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. If not, the method is complete and ends with no additional loudness points being given to the user. On the other hand, if a predetermined time has elapsed, the method continues to award 718 more loudness points to the user and adds them to the user's total of available loudness points, after which the method is complete and ends.
- the user interface 1000 includes a window having a number of components including a reply box 1002 in which the user can input a reply message, an approval points box 1004 that allows the user to assign approval points, a field 1006 indicating the number of approval points available to the user, a copy of the message 1008 being replied to and other metadata for the message, a button 1010 for sending or sharing the message.
- the reply box 1002 is an area in which the user can type in the message that they want posted or sent. As shown in FIG. 10 , the reply box 802 has a caption of “Would you also like to reply with a message?”
- the approval points box 1004 allows the user to input the number of approval points that the user would like to be associated with the reply in the reply box 1002 .
- the user can either manually input a number in the approval points box 1004 or the user can use the “+” or “ ⁇ ” buttons to increment or decrement the value in the approval points box 1004 .
- the user interface module 202 automatically inputs an approval points value such as one or two into the approval points box 1004 . Awarding more approval points to a particular message will make it appear more prominently in the audience's message feeds.
- the field 1006 indicates the number of approval points available to the user. As noted above this is a different pool for approval points than from loudness points.
- Field 1008 shows a copy of the message being replied to and other metadata for that message.
- modules, routines, features, attributes, methodologies and other aspects of the present invention can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of the three.
- a component, an example of which is a module, of the present invention is implemented as software
- the component can be implemented as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver, and/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of ordinary skill in the art of computer programming.
- the present invention is in no way limited to implementation in any specific programming language, or for any specific operating system or environment. Accordingly, the disclosure of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims.
