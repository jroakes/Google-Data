Embodiment
The system and method that the disclosure relates to is used in the position of program the instantaneous program guide (momentary program guide) that will on media device, show being provided, between the TV programme, advertisement or the program that show on TV.In addition, instantaneous program guide can provide the one or more recommendations to subsequent program based on programme content, user's viewing preference or other correlative factors of current operation.Then, of can select to recommend of user switches to recommend programs, or ignores this recommendation, makes the disappearance after the time period of setting of instantaneous program guide.
Figure 1A shows the demonstration 100 of the interim program guide grid around the media program in broadcast.Generally speaking, the user will watch TV or other media programs.Center system can be confirmed intermittently will occur in the program, such as the end or the ad break of program.At that time, system can generate the demonstration of recommending other program on screen, and this other program is that the user possibly want to switch to currently carries out or will begin soon.Such demonstration can also be triggered termly and manifest, such as in beginning hourly or end.Except program commending, demonstration can also comprise that the user maybe interested advertisement or other information.
As an alternative or in addition, this demonstration can be before advertisement and/or afterwards, or advertisement takes place when soon finishing.Such demonstration can next advertisement of preview, and allows the user to skip this advertisement, and alternatively sees different advertisement.And, after advertisement finishes, can present the program that will watch to the user, perhaps give the user and can select (for example, happy or sad) for the ability of selecting final result.Can be programmed operation displayed, and can be based on the visit to the parameter such as follow-up programs recommended ID number, so that make it possible to carry out selecting for program such as the user function of final result.
Can be based on the relation of the media program in recommend programs and the current broadcast, or itself and user watch programs recommended that the relation of preference selects to show.If the user sees that he or she has the program that interest is watched, then this user can select the program in this demonstration, and media device is incited somebody to action immediately or when the program of current program ends and selection begins, switch to the channel of the program of playing this selection.If the user selects to ignore program commending, then show and after the time period of setting, to disappear.
This demonstration can also take place as the full frame replacement to real time programme.For example, when program ends, TV shows the demonstration that possibly be switched to all-electronin program guide grid.Then, can give the user selects the next program that will watch in grid chance.The option that can supply the user to use can comprise the program that is about to broadcast (in ensuing a few minutes), and is stored in the program on the user client device, perhaps can be used for the program that send from the server flows that connects the internet.The user can select next program, and if they do not make a choice, then their display device can make a choice for it, or continue to play the previous channel of selecting simply.
Can format the program guide grid that shows with such technology in many ways.The program guide grid can comprise time dimension and channel dimension.In some implementations, the time dimension program that only limits to begin soon.This guide can also by be rendered as simply current available programs (though be through broadcasting, through stream give or through inserting the program that has before write down) tabulation.Can give prominence to demonstration with certain mode and confirm as some program the most relevant with the user.For example, related-program can be on the top of the rendition list, and the text or the program guide grid cell that perhaps are used for program can be red for very relevant program, drops to blueness (the spitting image of hygrogram typically) for very incoherent program.In addition, can be based on confirming the correlation of program to the classification of the program that be ready to finish or just finished or based on user or user friend or acquaintance's the former custom of watching.
In various realizations, this recommendation is relevant can to provide one or more benefits with the technology of relevant program.Find he or her to have the subsequent program that interest is watched with can allowing user easier, and needn't search all over the program guide of listing each available channel.This can improve user's satisfaction, and helps to set up customer loyalty.This program recommendation technologies can also provide that to align the program of watching interested and thereby more maybe be to making the spectators of response with this program associated advertisement to programmer and advertiser.In addition, the user can watch more TVs, and thereby is more income of broadcaster's generation.
The example of describing among Figure 1A shows and shows 100, and comprise: the program 102 of current operation, instantaneous program guide 104 and information board 106, this information board 106 is advertisement in this expression.Because the correlation of the advertisement that in information board 106, shows and the program 102 of current operation, perhaps because historical based on user's program viewing, it is relevant especially with the user that this advertisement has been considered to, so can show this advertisement.In other were realized, information board 106 can show news, Weather information, information or specific users possible interested other information relevant with the program of current operation 102.For example, information board 106 can comprise about how using the navigate instruction of instantaneous program guide 104 of remote control.Can also provide to show that 100 realization, the realization of this demonstration 100 only comprise the program 102 and instantaneous program guide 104 of current operation, and not comprise information board 106.
The program 102 of current operation can be the TV programme broadcasted through aerial, cable or satellite television supplier, be stored on PVR or other media storage devices program or by the files in stream media of remote web server trustship.The program 102 of current operation can dwindle from its original size; Think instantaneous program guide 104 and be information board 106 vacating spaces on display 100; Perhaps the program 102 of current operation can keep its original size, and the image of instantaneous program guide 104 and information board 106 can cover on the program 102 of current operation.
As shown in the figure, shown instantaneous program guide 104 in the bottom that shows 100, shown information board 106 on the right side that shows 100, but also can exist other to realize that this realization places instantaneous program guide 104 and information board 106 and shows other positions of 100.Time (such as a few minutes) of setting can appear in instantaneous program guide 104 before the program of current operation 102 finishes, during the ad break, between the program, perhaps appear at time of describing in advance (such as beginning in a hour or finish first few minutes).
Described in Figure 1A, instantaneous program guide 104 comprises the recommendation that the user is had other programs that interest watches.In this expression, instantaneous program guide 104 is shown as grid, and wherein, tabulation is shown soon the time slice that takes place, and row illustrates the channel of recommendation.Because showing, instantaneous program guide 104 is judged as the channel relevant especially by system, so instantaneous program guide 104 is different with typical program guide with the user who watches Visual Display 100.For example, one of channel can be personalized channels 108, this personalized channels 108 show to user individual or by the content of user individual.
Personalized channels 108 can be made up of user's selected various programs when some early.For example, the user can select specific program, and can each collection of this program be included in personalized channels 108 then.The user can also select program is dragged to from other channels in the personalized channels 108, to create the timetable of the program that will watch.In addition, the program that on personalized channels 108, shows can be the current program that does not have broadcast, but is inserted in the timetable of the PVR that is associated with Visual Display 100.For example, when the program in the personalized channels 108 was overlapping in time, the user can drag specific program to eliminate overlapping in time backward, and can write down the program of back, and carries out playback after a while.Can come from PVR, to select these programs based on the degree of correlation of the program 102 of program on the PVR and current operation.
Except personalized channels 108, show other channels, these channels are confirmed as and will broadcast program 102 some the similar programs with current operation soon, or otherwise are confirmed as and user-dependent program.For example, in the near future maybe be at other collection of dramas of the identical program of the program of different frequency channels broadcasting and current operation 102.Other recommend programs can comprise: the program of same type, comprise some identical performers' program or relate to the program with the program 102 similar themes of current operation.For example, if the program of current operation 102 is sitcoms, then instantaneous program guide 104 can show the recommendation at other sitcoms that will broadcast soon.
Recommend programs can also comprise: the collection of drama of the program that the collection of drama of the performer's that the collection of drama of the program of the type that the collection of drama of user's favorite program, user like, user like program or the theme of liking with the user are relevant.For example; Watch historical indication interesting if the user is previous to the documentary film of World War II, then instantaneous program guide 104 can show to will begin soon about the program on the history channel (The History Channel) of the fighter plane of World War II or the recommendation of the similar program on the current user of the being stored in PVR.
If the user has selected one of recommend programs, then media device can switch to the channel that broadcasts the program of selecting immediately, in case perhaps selected program to begin to broadcast (airing), then media device just can switch to the channel of the program of broadcasting selection.Media device can also wait for, up to the current program ends of watching of user, and if desired, then can other programs of opening entry, and make the user to broadcast and watch other programs after a while, and the part that can skip program is to catch up with program at program.Otherwise, if the user ignores instantaneous program guide 104, and do not select recommend programs, then instantaneous program guide 104 can disappear after the time period of setting.
In operation, the system of more than describing can follow like what described among Figure 1A and be used to appear the example to the recommendation of subsequent program.Among this example, the user is watching the collection of drama of The Simpsons.A few minutes before this assembles bundle, instantaneous program guide 104 occurs, and lists the recommendation at the program that will broadcast soon.Owing to do not have closely-related program to broadcast at 7:30, therefore instantaneous program guide 104 can be inserted into the collection of drama from the The Simpsons of the precedence record of user PVR the personalized channels 108 at the time slot place of 7:30.
In this example, instantaneous program guide 104 is gone back indicated channel FOX 110, and this channel FOX110 broadcasts the collection of drama of Family Guy at 8:00, and broadcasts the collection of drama of King of the Hill at 8:30.Because The Simpsons is cartoon, and Family Guy and King of the Hill also are cartoons, so recommend this channel.System can also visit following information, this information recommendation like the spectators of The Simpsons also to like The Family Guy and King of theHill usually.Instantaneous program guide 104 is recommended channel cartoon (Cartoon) 112 also, and it broadcasts the collection of drama of Futurama at 8:00 and 8:30.Because this program is identical type, and makes by the creator identical and make, so recommend this program with TheSimpsons.
In this example, the user had before selected film Ace Ventura is included in the personalized channels 108.Based on this user to programs feature or about the preference of Jim Carrey, instantaneous program guide 104 shown channel E! 114, this channel E! 114 will broadcast the documentary film about Jim Carrey soon.Be not confirmed as relevant or user's interest can be omitted in guide 104 at the program on each channel displayed with the user; Or can not be that recommended mode shows to show this program to the user, such as through present the text of such program with light gray rather than black.
Figure 1B shows the demonstration of the program guide relevant with physical culture on the media program in broadcast.Generally, the figure shows be used for when the user watches sports cast, showing instantaneous program guide for choosing method.Center system has been confirmed end of match, maybe will finish, maybe will have been suspended, such as midfield or ad break.As an alternative, center system possibly confirmed, because scoring gap is too high, so the current match of just watching has become dull.When making these in confirming, system will show instantaneous program guide, currently carry out other matches that maybe will begin with what the recommendation user possibly want to switch to.In addition, instantaneous program guide can comprise the information about each of the match of recommending, and such as score and remaining time, whether of match who makes the user can make recommendation possibly watch excellent more decision.
In the example of in Figure 1B, describing, show that 120 illustrate current sports cast 122 and instantaneous program guide 124.In this was realized, instantaneous program guide 124 was revealed as the pop-up window in the lower right corner of Visual Display 100.Instantaneous program guide 124 can be triggered to when current sports cast soon finishes and to occur, such as when rugby or Basketball Match time also are left less than 2 minutes.
In such situation, then, system can determine to collect about current and broadcast or soon will be on other channels or the information of other related-programs that possibly on current channel, broadcast.In addition, system can locate and be stored in such as related-program on the equipment of the PVR of subscriber's local, or the related-program on (such as Google Video or You Tube video) on the server away from the user.Then, the recommendation to other programs based on this information can appear and show in instantaneous program guide 124.In this example, because the program watched is a sports cast, so program commending can comprise the recommendation to current other matches of carrying out maybe will beginning.
In operation, the system of more than describing can follow the example of describing among Figure 1B.In this example, current sports cast 122 is the football game between Wisconsin and Northwestern.The scoring gap of having confirmed match such as one remote system of the system that had before mentioned is very high, and therefore match possibly become and seems very dull.This makes instantaneous program guide 124 appear on the Visual Display 100.
Although below will be described as taking place at special time to calling of instantaneous program guide 124, such as the time-out in the approaching program that is showing, this calls and can also take place through other mechanism.For example; Can keep remote control button or menucommand for instantaneous program guide 124; Make when the user is unsatisfied with the program that they are watching; They can press the button and see current some other programs that maybe will begin of playing, and system has confirmed that the user possibly have special interest to these programs.
In some implementations, when two tuners of media player visit (this is current situation with various digital video recorders), the content from the tuner of not sending the current main contents that are used to show can kept watch on and show to program guide.For example, the text in hiding (closed) caption system can be kept watch on by the system that generates guide, and when certain incident takes place, the program guide presented of demonstration from second tuner is provided.For instance; Program guide can be searched the term like " score ", " attacks ", touchdown and so on; And can be when such incident takes place; Ejection illustrates the appendicle from the video of second tuner, makes the user can channel be switched to other incidents, and sees the playback of recent excellent incident.
The video (for example) that can also be used for program guide from retrieve like fewer relatively purpose frame of video, and program guide can make equipment channel changed to the channel that is associated with this video.For example, Internet service may not be delivered to a lot of spectators with real-time football game stream, and perhaps such action possibly be invalid.Yet excellent movable signal and a limited number of video of whenever providing can appear in service in play.Can be to user's display video in such as the program guide in the corner (can the position of guide be adjusted to any corner or other positions) that is showing; Make the user can determine whether to switch to football game; In case but the user has selected switching, they just will be from their ground, satellite or wired provider received content.
Can be artificial or begin the generation of instantaneous program guide automatically.Can press suitable remote control button through the user, or the specific control that is chosen in the menu of demonstration produces artificial excitation (instigation).Can automatic control take place with those modes like above description; For example; Setting-up time before program ends; When interested incident has taken place in feeds of data indication in another program (for example, like client device such as closed caption text internally confirms through keeping watch on, perhaps as come externally to confirm such as the third party provider of the message through being sent in the score incident that has taken place during the sports cast).
When beginning the generation of guide, can come to prevent generating guide by the application of filtration device in the unsuitable time through auto-mechanism.For example, the user can be provided with the generation that variable stops program guide.The user can also indicate and lose interest in on specific favor program, generating program guide.
Can also come the specific guide of influence in the border on the scene with some mode except that mode discussed above.For example, guide can illustrate current on special channels, on the favorite channel such as the user, and the content of broadcasting.In addition, this guide can be configured to only be illustrated in the program that certain period of time is broadcasted on special channels, such as the next program on current channel.
The program that is provided in the guide can also be based on various other border clues.For example, can use the content of current program and/or in program the time of request guide select in order to show for selecting program.For example, XML can be used for time tagging and related this label to program.When with time that this label is associated on when generating guide, can use the information in the label to generate search, such as:
<XML?1.0>
<Channel?13>
<time gmtStart＝011020304 gmtEnd＝1020230430>
dog?car?anna?nicole?smith?money</time>
<time...>tagwords?tagword</time>
Can also use other border factors to select recommend programs.For example, the time in one day possibly influence selection, wherein possibly cause evening to cause more comedies and news program, and the selections before 8 can comprise the program with the friendly grading of family at night.Because equipment can not show some program and/or because some program be considered to relevant especially with the user of certain device category, so the device type of just being watched also influences this selection (for example, TV, computer or mobile device).Also can be correlated with in the position of equipment, such as confirming (coming targeted content based on area or country) with the IP address.
Can also come programs recommended selection according to social factor.For example, the user can be with a part that itself is designated social group, such as friend group or club's (for example, household is transformed fan's online group).Instantaneous program guide, such as guide with the form of the appendicle that is shown as " insect ", can recommending friends group or club a lot of member selected the program watched.Also can use the member's who is used for user and/or their social network profile information to make definite.For example; Analysis to transforming the member in the club possibly indicated: the much human among them is used the term such as " home decoration " on their webpage or in talking; Much human among them is used similar term in their searching request, perhaps the visit of the much human among them home decoration website.So as the member in the group during near program ends, even program that this user had before watched and transformation or home decoration are irrelevant, this instantaneous program guide also can present the option from HOME and HGTV channel.
Program guide can also provide control to the user, and this user's selection makes that the details relevant with collection of drama or program is shown.For example, the user can navigate to hyperlink, and selects this link to make to illustrate the whole webpage of the details (for example, the broadcast time of different collection of dramas, picture search result, cast etc.) about specific program to be shown.In application, can also in program guide or in details page, show video flowing from different programs about a plurality of programs shown in the demonstration of set program guide such as IPTV.
The channel that Fig. 1 C shows on the media program in broadcast changes the demonstration of inquiring about.Generally, this diagrammatic sketch shows when system to be wanted when the user presents single program commending, show instantaneous program guide for choosing method.Usually,, or be confirmed as and have when big correlation being arranged very, just use this to be used to show the technology of instantaneous program guide with the user only in recommend programs and current in progress media program height correlation.
In the figure, show that 146 show the program 142 and the channel change inquiry 144 that presents instantaneous program guide of current operation.In this was realized, channel changed the pop-up window in the lower right corner that inquiry 144 appears as Visual Display 100.This realization illustrates channel and changes inquiry 144, and this channel changes the single specific program that inquiry 144 recommendations maybe be relevant especially with the user.For example; If the program of current operation 142 is collection of dramas of The Simpsons; Then channel changes that inquiry 144 possibly recommend on different channel, to begin, or current storage (from record not long ago) another collection of drama of The Simpsons on user client equipment.Here, the user switches to the channel of recommendation in the time of can using their remote control to select " being " to finish with the program 142 in current operation, perhaps selects " deny " continuing to watch the program 142 of current operation, and makes channel change inquiry 144 disappearances.Change inquiry 144 if the user ignores channel, then it can disappear after the time period of setting.Select to change channel and will make the program that is associated with guide that order is sent to tuner or media controller, to switch to and to play the program of selection.
In operation, appearing of the tabulation of single channel change inquiry rather than recommendation is common and relevant to programs of other broadcasts soon---for example, and the program that when the program 142 of current operation finishes, just begins.Under suitable situation, this realization can also show the recommendation that is considered to user's height correlation, such as another collection of drama of the program identical with the program of current operation 142, or is confirmed as very programs of interest of user.For example, if user's viewing history indication to the height preference of program Seinfeld, then channel changes the new collection of drama of the Seinfeld that inquiry 144 can recommend on different channel, to begin.System can also be programmed by the user in advance, when specific program or competitive sports will begin, to show alarm.For example, the user can be programmed for system, when the baseball game of Twins is about to begin, channel just is shown changes inquiry.As use single channel to change another example of inquiry, if the program of current operation 142 is the programs about dog training, then channel changes the broadcast of the program of the dog that inquiry 144 can recommend to begin or just on different channel, to broadcast.
Fig. 2 is that what to be used for that spectators to media program provide the responsive recommendation in a border is the sketch map of the system 200 at center with the server.Usually; Be that the system 200 at center comprises and recommends generation system 202 with the server; This recommends generation system 202 to receive input from the plurality of data source, and this plurality of data source can comprise: the source of video media and TV list database or other such program schedule data storehouses.Recommend generation system 202 to use information to generate the program commending that is used for to spectators' demonstration of media program from these data sources.
Usually, recommend generation system 202 to comprise and hold mutual assembly with data and medium content server and end-user customer.In this example, recommending generation system 202 to be shown as via the network 204 such as internet or cable network communicates with the server and client side.Two examples of the end-user customer's end that here illustrates are desktop computer 206 and the receiver box 208 that is connected to flat screen TV 210.This is two kinds of common devices that are used to watch video media, but any suitable video media playback equipment such as the cellular handset of launching web, can be end-user customer's end of recommending generation system 202.
, recommend generation system 202 also to be connected to medium content server 212 via network 204 here, this medium content server 212 for example provides and presents from real-time video wired or satellite provider.In other were realized, medium content server 212 possibly needn't provide in real time and present, but other forms of video content can be provided.For example, medium content server 212 can provide the PVR or the web server of video content.
Recommend generation system 202 also to be connected to program schedule data storehouse 214 via network 204.This program schedule data storehouse 214 offers programme schedule data and recommends generation system 202.This program schedule data storehouse 214 can represent that one or more TV table datas provide company, such as TV Guide, Digi-Guide, XML TV, BDS or Ananova.These companies can provide the TV table data of multiple form, comprise XML, HTML, RTF and TSV (tab-delimited value).
The data server of in this example, being described, recommend generation system 202 can comprise from other data servers of its information extraction: with the weather or the news feed that show in the information board 106 similar information boards described Figure 1A.Recommend the generation system 202 can also be from the information extraction of sports statistics data server, this sports statistics data server provides presenting in real time of the match score that will show with the instantaneous program guide 124 similar forms in Figure 1B, described and program commending and other statisticss.
Recommend generation system 202 to use interface 216 and network 204 to communicate, it can adopt form one or more web servers or the hardware that other are such, maybe can adopt other suitable forms.In this example; The information of recommending generation system 202 to use medium content server 212 and program schedule data storehouse 214 to provide, with confirm when to show instantaneous program guide, should with which program or which program be included in the instantaneous program guide and how to user's display message.
Recommend generation system 202 to comprise request processor 218, it receives the request from desktop computer 206 and receiver box 208, such as relevant for the request of selecting programme information to illustrating.For example, this request processor 218 can parse information from request, the sign of the program of watching at present such as user identifier and user.Request processor 218 can also receive the notice from medium content server 212, and when the end or the time-out in the program of this notice indication program take place.Request processor 218 can use these data to confirm when to show instantaneous program guide.For example, if the user is watching football game, and should compete near half-court, then medium content server 212 can send signal to request processor 218, and this signal indication is about to take place for the time-out in this program program.Then, request processor 218 can determine whether this user is shown instantaneous program guide based on the information of the known channel of watching at present about the user of request processor.
Request processor 218 can also use the data from program schedule data storehouse 214 to determine whether to show instantaneous program guide.Whether this request processor 218 can near beginning hourly and finishing, be checked program schedule data with fixed distance, will on different frequency channels, begin to see user's favorite program or related-program.For example, if user's favorite program will begin, then recommend generation system 202 to show and be similar to the instantaneous program guide that changes inquiry 144 from the channel of Fig. 1 C, whether the inquiry user wants to switch to the channel that broadcasts this program.
In case request processor 218 confirmed to show instantaneous program guide, it just will send signals to the program selector in recommending generation system 202 220, and this program selector 220 will be selected the one or more programs to user's recommendation.For selecting will to which program of user's recommendation, program selector 220 extracts data from the plurality of data storehouse, and this plurality of data storehouse comprises: schedule information database 222, program information database 224 and user preference database 226.This example of describing illustrates and is positioned at these databases of recommending generation system 202, but can have other realizations, and in this was realized, the one or more quilts in these databases were remotely placed and visited via network 204.
Program selector 220 is at first confirmed user's head end (head-end), and thereby confirms that which channel can be used for the user.Schedule information database 222 is filled with data, comprises: the program schedule information that receives from the program schedule data storehouse 214 relevant with user's head end.For example, be under the situation of wired provider in medium content server 212, schedule information database 222 can comprise: the TV tabulation of all channels that can provide to the user through this wired provider.
Program information database 224 is included on the channel that can be used for the user current or in the information of the program that will broadcast soon, and it can be used for confirming the program commending that will show at instantaneous program guide.This program information database 224 also comprises the information about the program of current operation.This information can comprise: program title, program category, program subject matter, the performer in the program, program author, program creator, ratings data, spectators crowd or about the information of program audience.For example, because New York Times (New York Times) gives this program four stars, therefore possibly recommend this program.
The information that is stored in the program information database 224 can also comprise the information about the suffered awards of specific program.For example, can recommend to obtain the film of some Oscars, or obtain the TV programme of Amere Award recently.Under the situation of sports cast, program information database 224 can also comprise about following information: which team competes, whether this team has the branch of superseded meaning and match poor in which association, match.All these information can be used for confirming the possible excellent degree of competing, and therefore the user maybe be how interested in having of this sports cast.
In this example, user preference database 226 comprises the data about the user's viewing preference.This information can be by user's directly input in early, perhaps can be confirmed based on user's program viewing is historical by system.For example, the user can import the preference of program being acted the leading role AdamSandler, if perhaps the user has watched some programs about World War II recently, then system can confirm that the user is to about the program of World War II preference to some extent.The information that is stored in the user preference database 226 can comprise: user's favorite program, the type of liking, the theme of liking, the performer who likes, the author who likes, favorite program creator and favorite exercise team.
In case program selector 229 receives the signal that indication should generate one or more program commendings from request processor 218, program selector 220 just can be collected about the media program of current operation and the information of user's viewing preference from program information database 224 and user preference database 226.Then, program selector 220 can confirm to select from it time window of potential program commending.Usually, although time window is changeable, this time window will be ensuing several hrs.Then, program selector 220 can be shown information database 220 access time, to create the rendition list of the program that will in time window, broadcast.
Then; Program selector 220 can be collected in the information of each program the rendition list from program information database 224; And information and previous comparing of collecting about the media program of current operation and the information of user's viewing preference with this each program; Relevant to confirm which program among the rendition list with the media program of current operation, or with the user check that preference is relevant.Based on these relatively, program selector 220 can confirm that which program is the most relevant with the user, and the channel selection that will broadcast these programs is will be to the channel of user's recommendation.If single program is confirmed as, more especially relevant with the user compared with any other program in time window, then program selector can only select to recommend this program.In such situation, can show with channel change to the user and inquire about similar instantaneous program guide from Fig. 1 C.
In case program selector 220 has been selected the one or more programs to user's recommendation, it just transmits these information to program guide maker 228.Program guide maker 228 is created the code of the instantaneous program guide that will show to the user.This program guide maker 228 extracts data from recommend profiles database 230, this recommendation profiles database 230 comprises text and the figure that is used for various recommendation profiles, changes inquiry such as above-mentioned instantaneous program guide and channel.
Based on the number of program selector 220 selected programs and the type of program; Program guide maker 228 can select to recommend profile from recommend profiles database 230; And in recommending profile, insert the information that receives from program selector 220, arrange the time of the recommend programs of broadcast such as program title, the channel that broadcasts this recommend programs and quilt.For example, if receive a plurality of program commendings from program selector 220, then program guide maker 228 can be selected to recommend profile from recommend profiles database 230, is similar to the instantaneous program guide 104 shown in Figure 1A.Then, program guide maker 228 can be inserted the mesh space in the instantaneous program guide with the title of recommend programs, time of broadcasting the channel of recommend programs and will broadcast recommend programs.
In other were realized, program guide maker 228 can receive information from external data source.For example; If the program commending that program selector 220 generates is with being directed against current ongoing sports cast; Then program guide maker 228 can be visited score and presenting in real time to other statisticss of the sports cast of recommending; And show this information with program commending, be similar to the instantaneous program guide 124 shown in Figure 1B.In case program guide maker 228 has been created instantaneous program guide, then it will think that the end-user customer holds the code that sends instantaneous program guide via network 204, to show to the user.
In operation, the user can watch the TV programme that cable service provider is transmitting.For example, the user can watch the collection of drama of The Simpsons.When the approaching time-out of this program, the signal that wired provider of transmission program can the time-out in the current program of indication will take place send to recommends generation system 202.Then, request processor 218 can be confirmed and should show instantaneous program guide to the user.Then, request processor 218 will indicate the signal that should generate program commending to send to program selector 220.According to this example, program selector 220 can confirm that the user is just watching the collection of drama of The Simpsons.Then, program selector 220 can be from the information of program information database 224 collections about The Simpsons.
Program selector 220 can also be collected the information of watching preference about the user from user preference database, compares with this information with about the information of The Simpsons and about all programme informations that can be used for the user that in ensuing two hours, broadcast then.Because The Simpsons is usually to adult's cartoon, so program selector 220 can select to comprise other cartoons towards the adult of other collection of dramas of TheSimpsons, to recommend to the user.For example, if will begin the collection of drama of Family Guy and King of the Hill soon, then program selector 220 more likely selects these programs to recommend to the user.If soon will be not can broadcasting area to adult's cartoon, then program selector 220 can also be chosen in other programs in adult's comedy of wide range of types more.Program selector 220 can also select to want recommend programs based on the user's viewing preference.For example, if spectators have strong preference to John Candy film, the then broadcast of the program selector 220 film Uncle Buck that can recommend will to begin soon.
Then, program selector 220 can send to program guide maker 228 with selected program commending.According to this example, program guide maker 228 can be used for showing that the recommendation profiles database 230 of the grid of a plurality of recommendations of the channels selects to recommend profiles from expression.Then, program guide maker 228 can be inserted into the title of recommend programs, the channel of broadcast items and the time of arrangement broadcast items in the recommendation profile, to create instantaneous program guide.Then, can instantaneous program guide be transferred to end-user customer's end via network 204, and show this instantaneous program guide to the user.
Fig. 3 be used for the recommendation that the border, field is responsive offer media program spectators be the sketch map of the system at center with the client.Generally, this figure has described guide and has generated equipment 304, and it can be used for program commending is covered the media program of current operation.Guide generates the set that equipment 304 expressions are used to generate and show the hardware and software component of instantaneous program guide, and it can be positioned on the user side of network 306 usually, near the medium evaluation equipment of the media program of playing current operation.
Guide generates equipment 304 can have multiple other function of level.For example, the simple realization of guide generation equipment 304 only possibly be able to send to one or more remote servers with the information about user identity, user's viewing preference and the current program of watching of user.Then, this equipment can come to show simply from remote server and receives any content of returning by the specific format of server indication and special time.
The complicated more realization that guide generates equipment 304 can be carried out all functions of the above recommendation generation system of describing about program selector 220 202.Such complicacy realizes comprising the program guide generator of the program guide maker 228 that is similar among Fig. 2, selected information format is turned to the content of watching on showing.Guide generates a lot of other combinations that equipment 304 can comprise all or part of function.For example, can the Remote Selection program commending, and guide generates equipment 304 and can comprise the program guide maker, will turn to instantaneous program guide from the information format that remote server receives to user's demonstration.
In the example of Fig. 3, guide is generated equipment 304 be depicted as autonomous device, but also have following realization, wherein, it is the assemblies in television receiver or another medium receiving equipment that guide generates equipment 304.Guide generates equipment 304 and is connected to one or more remote servers 302 via network 306.Network 306 can be the internet, or is connected to the cable circuit of central cable network.The video media that remote server 302 is incited somebody to action in real time or write down in advance is fed to guide and generates equipment 304.Remote server 302 also sends to guide with program schedule data, programme information and other relevant informations and generates equipment 304.Guide generates equipment 304 and will use this information to generate program commending, and comes to show this recommendation to the user to be similar to the above process of describing to recommendation generation system 202.
Here, guide generation equipment 304 comprises network interface 308 with the media program information via 302 transmission of network 306 receiving remote servers.In other were realized, such as the simple realization of above description, network interface can also be to remote server 302 transmission information, and the program identification such as the media program of user's viewing preference and current operation makes remotely to generate program commending.
Guide generates equipment 304 and also comprises memory 310, its storage computation machine command set, and when carrying out this computer instruction set, making provides the recommendation about the media program in one or more non-broadcasts on the media program of current operation.Guide generates equipment 304 and comprises program selector 312, to read and to carry out the some or all of orders that are stored in the memory 310.Program selector 312 can use the information that receives from remote server 302 via network 306 and network interface 308, the tabulation of the program of the one or more non-broadcasts that are used for establishment recommending to the user.Program selector 312 can generate this program commending to be similar to the above process that program selector among Fig. 2 220 is described.
In case program selector 312 has been selected will be to one or more programs of user's recommendation, the graphic process unit 314 that are included in the guide generation equipment 304 just can be similar to the demonstration of generation about the information of recommend programs.The graphical display that graphic process unit 314 generates can with any one of the instantaneous program guide of previous description, the channel shown in the instantaneous program guide 104 shown in Figure 1A, the instantaneous program guide 124 shown in Figure 1B or Fig. 1 C changes inquiry 144.Image shows can also adopt multiple other suitable forms.When the graphical display of instantaneous program guide is described in establishment, graphic process unit 314 will be sent vision signal to output 316 (for example, the HDMI port), and this output 316 is connected to the display of the media program of playing current operation.
In operation, guide generation equipment 304 can be the receiver box that is connected to TV.Guide generation equipment 304 can be connected to wired TV and present.In normal operation, TV presents and can be transmitted simply through immovable guide generation equipment 304, and can be outputed to TV.When the current program of watching is about to take place to suspend, can will indicates the signal that should show instantaneous program guide to send to guide via network 306 for one of remote server 302 and generate equipment 304.Guide generates equipment 304 can also be programmed to time of being provided with in advance, such as in beginning hourly or end, shows instantaneous program guide.
Guide generates equipment 304 can pass through network interface, such as being connected to the Ethernet card that the internet connects, comes to receive from remote server 302 information of other programs that will broadcast soon about the program and the quilt arrangement of current operation.Network interface can be delivered to processor with this information, and this processor can be carried out the process of the program selector 312 of above description.This processor can read the computer command that is stored on hard disk or other memory devices, and carries out these orders then, to create program commending based on the information that receives from remote server 302.Then, guide generation equipment 304 can be through creating the figure output of describing program commending such as the graphic process unit of video card.Then, this graphic process unit can cover the demonstration of program commending on the media program of current operation, and via the TV that demonstration is outputed to connection such as the output of wired TV line or one group of RCA cable.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart of method 400 that is used for program commending is offered the spectators of TV programme.Usually, use the system of this method to show to broadcast at present or previous recorded TV program.This system will confirm to show the reasonable time of one or more follow-up program commendings.Then, this system obtains the information about current television program, and other relevant programs of discerning relevant program then or will beginning soon.Then, this system creation is to the recommendation of one or more programs, and shows this recommendation to the user.
In the example of describing, when the user watched the program of current operation, 402, method 400 confirmed to show the time of one or more subsequent program recommendations.This can be: just during the ad break before the current program ends, in current program or in the time that is provided with in advance, such as one hour beginning or end.Under the situation of sports tournament, this method 400 can confirm that scoring gap is very big, makes that this match has become dull, and therefore should recommend by display program.System can also be when the program of having confirmed height correlation be about to begin, triggering method 400 beginnings.For example, the new collection of drama of user's favor program, or the user likes the football game of team.
404, method 400 is obtained the information about the program of current operation.This information can comprise: program title, type, theme, performer, program author, program creator or about any other information of program.In realizing for choosing, this method can also be obtained the similar information of watching preference about the user, or about other information of user, such as user's position, age, sex etc.This information can be used to confirm to can be used for the user and the program of which program that will broadcast soon and current operation is relevant or be correlated with this user in addition.
406, method 400 is discerned the potential subsequent program that has interest with the relevant or other user of the program of current operation.The information of the potential subsequent program that collection is used for will on the channel that the user can use, broadcasting soon, and with this information with compare in 404 information about the program of current operation of collecting.Potential subsequent program can also comprise: be stored in the PVR that is connected to media device or the program of the precedence record on other video storaging equipments, or be stored in such as the video file on the remote server of Internet server.Based on the some or all of factors of before having listed or other possible factors, the program of potential subsequent program and current operation is compared.Being confirmed as the subsequent program particularly relevant with the program of current operation will be selected as to the user and show.
408, method 400 makes up graphical display, to appear program commending to the user.Make up graphical display based on the number of the recommendation of selecting and the form of recommendation.For example, if selected single program to recommend, then show that to the user channel that this single recommendation is provided changes inquiry.If selected the some programs on a plurality of channels to recommend, then can be to the instantaneous program guide of user's show grid form.Can there be multiple extended formatting, can comes to recommend with these forms to user's display program.
410, method 400 will be recommended to user's display program at reasonable time---for example, when ad break at the beginning, perhaps when operation is used for participant's list of program of current operation.Program commending has been triggered in the situation about manifesting because user's favorite program is about to begin therein, can be before user's favorite program begin momently display program recommend.
Can exist with method 400 and similarly replace choosing method, wherein, TV that additional step identification display program is recommended or the position on the media device.Whether this method can determine whether and should instantaneous program guide be covered on the program of current operation perhaps should the program of current operation be dwindled from its original size, and show instantaneous program guide along the avris of the program of current operation.
Instantaneous program guide can also adopt other suitable forms.In addition, this method can confirm whether instantaneous program guide should be positioned at the bottom of demonstration, the top of demonstration, the lower right corner of demonstration or other positions that show.
Another can be to generate program commending with method 400 identical modes through confirming the time that display program is recommended for choosing method; And only illustrate then to be positioned at and nestle up the current program guide of listing channel of watching channel, rather than the channel that comprises user's favor program or the program relevant with current operation program is shown.This method can be to be similar to the mode program guide of method 400.Yet, in this specific implementation, can not confirm channel displayed based on the border, field relevant with the program of user or current operation.
Another that is similar to method 400 can be waited for the input from the user for choosing method when showing instantaneous program guide.Usually, should can adopt following form from user's input, the user is chosen in of the recommend programs that illustrates on the instantaneous program guide.Then, this method can immediately or switch to the channel that broadcasts user selected program when the program of selecting begins.If the user does not select one of recommend programs, then after a time, can instantaneous program guide be removed from show, and media device can continue to illustrate the program of current operation.
Fig. 5 A is the swimming lane figure that is used for providing to the TV programme spectators method 500 of program commending.Usually, FTP client FTP is confirmed and should be recommended to user's display program of the TV programme of just watching current operation.Then, the FTP client FTP information that will watch preference about the program and the user of current operation is submitted to remote server.Then, remote server obtains the schedule information that is used for user's head end, and is chosen as user selected program based on the relation that the program and the user of program and current operation watches preference.Then, remote server generates the demonstration of instantaneous program guide, and this video data is sent to FTP client FTP.Then, FTP client FTP shows instantaneous program guide, and waits for that the user makes a choice.If the user selects one of recommend programs, then FTP client FTP will switch to the program of this selection.If the user does not make a choice, then FTP client FTP will remove instantaneous program guide after the time period of setting from show.
Among the example of in Fig. 5 A, being described, 502, FTP client FTP 501 is confirmed and should be shown one or more program commendings to the user.This possibly be because the program of current operation will finish or arrive time-out, such as ad break.504, the information that FTP client FTP 501 will be watched preference about the program and the user of current operation sends to remote server 505.The programme information that sends can comprise all relevant informations of selecting the necessary program about current operation of related-program, the programme information that perhaps sends can be simply current operation program title or even only be the current channel of watching.The user watches preference information to comprise: the author that the performer that the theme that the type that user's favorite program, user like, user like, user like, user like, user's favorite program creator, user's favorite exercise team, or help select maybe with any other information of user-dependent program.
506, remote server 505 receives the information of submitting to from FTP client FTP 501, and acquisition time table information.Remote server 505 confirms that based on user's head end current which program that is broadcasting or will broadcast soon can be used for this user.508, remote server 505 confirms to be used for to be used for the pertinent program information of all programs of this user.This information can comprise all information about available programs, and this information can be used to select program or the relevant recommend programs of user preference with current operation.Only is under the situation of programm name or current channel at FTP client FTP in 504 information about the program of current operation submitted to, and remote server also can obtain the information about the program of current operation in this step.Then, this remote server can be with comparing about the information of available programs and the program and the user preference of current operation, with one or more programs of selecting to recommend to the user.
510, remote server generates the demonstration of the instantaneous program guide that comprises program commending that will on the program of current operation, show.The recommend programs that can be based on 508 selections generates this instantaneous program guide, and can be with this instantaneous program guide format, with number and the type that presents recommend programs best.For example, if selected some programs of on a plurality of channels, broadcasting, the program guide that then is similar to grid possibly be suitable, and if selected single program, it possibly be suitable that then single channel changes inquiry.After generation was used for the code of instantaneous program guide, remote server sent to the client end system with video data.
512, the video data that FTP client FTP receiving remote server is generated.514, FTP client FTP shows the instantaneous program guide that comprises program commending to the user.516, of recommend programs is watched in FTP client FTP wait user selection.If the user has selected one of recommend programs, then 518, FTP client FTP is incited somebody to action immediately or when the program ends of current operation, is switched to the program of selection.If the user selects to ignore this instantaneous program guide, and does not select one of recommend programs, then 520, FTP client FTP will continue to play the program of current operation.After the time period that is provided with, 522, FTP client FTP removes instantaneous program guide from Visual Display.
Fig. 5 B is another swimming lane figure that is used for providing to the spectators of TV programme the method 550 of program commending.Usually, this method 550 is similar to the method 500 shown in Fig. 5 A.Main difference is that in method 550, server is selected recommend programs, does not show but do not create instantaneous program guide.This demonstration is generated by FTP client FTP.
In the example of in Fig. 5 B, describing, 552, FTP client FTP is confirmed and should be shown one or more program commendings to the user.554, the information that FTP client FTP will be watched preference about the program and the user of current operation is submitted to remote server.
556, remote server receives the information of submitting to from FTP client FTP, and acquisition time table information.Remote server confirms to be arranged in which program that will broadcast soon based on user's head end can be used for the user.558, remote server confirms to can be used for the pertinent program information of all programs of user.This information can comprise all information about available programs, and this information can be used to select watch the relevant recommend programs of preference with the program or the user of current operation.560, remote server will compare about the information of available programs and the program and the user preference of current operation, will be to one or more programs of user's recommendation with selection.Then, this remote server is transferred to FTP client FTP with the tabulation of recommend programs.
562, the tabulation of the recommend programs that the FTP client FTP reception server generates.564, FTP client FTP generates the demonstration of the instantaneous program guide of the program commending that comprises selection.Can be with this instantaneous program guide format, with number and the type that presents recommend programs best.Instantaneous program guide can comprise the relevant information about each of recommend programs; It can comprise: the concise and to the point description of the channel of program title, broadcast items, broadcast time, program, tabulation, author, the producer of featured performer or be confirmed as any other relevant information, next this information has the user's of helping decision will watch any program.
566, FTP client FTP shows instantaneous program guide on the program of current operation or along the avris of the program of current operation.568, FTP client FTP waits for that the user selects of recommend programs.If the user has selected one of recommend programs, then 570, FTP client FTP will be immediately or when current operation program ends, switches to the program of selection.If the user selects to ignore this instantaneous program guide, and does not select one of recommend programs, then 572, FTP client FTP will continue to play the program of current operation.After the time period of setting, 574, FTP client FTP removes instantaneous program guide from Visual Display.
Except two kinds shown in Fig. 5 A and Fig. 5 B the method; Also there are other realizations; Wherein, Be described as various functions more than can carrying out by FTP client FTP, perhaps wherein, be described as the various functions of carrying out by FTP client FTP more than can carrying out by remote server by the remote server execution.For example, the instead of client system, remote server can be confirmed to show instantaneous program guide.Remote server can also be stored the information of watching preference about the program of current operation and user.Can exist for choosing and realize, wherein, FTP client FTP acquisition time table information, and confirm that which program can be used for the user.FTP client FTP can also be confirmed the pertinent program information of potential subsequent program, and selects to recommend which program to the user.
Fig. 6 is the flow chart that is used to select and illustrate the method 600 of the program that is directed to the user.Usually, method 600 shows the more detailed version of the process of the subsequent program that is used to select above-mentioned recommendation.Method 600 receives the information that program and user about current operation watch preference.Then, method 600 confirms that which possible subsequent program can be used for the user, and will compare about the information of possible subsequent program and the program of current operation and user's preference information.Based on this information relatively, method 600 watches the degree of correlation of preference to come potential subsequent program is carried out rank based on potential subsequent program and current operation program and user.Then, method 600 selects to be confirmed as the program the most relevant with the user, and selects the channel of the related-program of the maximum numbers of broadcast.Then, recommend to user's display program.
In the example of in Fig. 6, describing, 602, method 600 receives the programme information and the user preference information of current operation.Except watching about the user the information of preference, method 600 can also receive position about the user, sex, age, child's number and age, the information of hobby, or possibly recommend any other relevant information with selecting subsequent program.Method 600 can also receive the information about the program on the PVR that is stored in the user.For example, if user's PVR comprises some collection of dramas of The Simpsons, then the collection of drama that is about to play of The Simpsons possibly be an associated recommendation.
604, method 600 identifications are arranged in all programs that can be used for the user that broadcast in definite time window.Usually, this time window can be ensuing several hrs, but time window is changeable.606, program and user that the correlation of each available programs that method 600 will take place in this time window is weighted to current operation watch preference.Here, compare based on some weight factors the subsequent program that each is potential and the program and the user's viewing preference of current operation.The weight factor that is used for program can comprise: the program identical with the program of current operation; The type identical with the program of current operation; The theme relevant with the program of current operation; With the program of current operation common performer is arranged; The author identical with the program of current operation; Identical producer with the program of current operation; User's favorite program; The type that the user likes; The theme that the user likes; The performer that the user likes; The author that the user likes; Public's favorite program; With prize-winning program.Weight factor can also comprise any other suitable means that are used for two programs of comparison or are used to select subsequent program.
In addition, but do not illustrate, system can consider " people like me (People like me) " factor.Such factor can be based on the characteristic vector that is used for the program that program that the user watches and other users watch.System can also follow the tracks of the grading of user to program.Use such technology, can confirm that the user has the interest similar with other people based on watching historical common ground (and common ground of possible front and negative reaction).Then; Can watch, like the program of (determined) according to other people that are similar to this user according to the front comment; Or other users have subscribed to the program of one or more collection of dramas of record series, are chosen in the reasonable time section program of (or being stored on server or the user client equipment) in one group of candidate program.
Except the equal weight factor of the program that will be used for potential subsequent program and current operation compares, can the cross reference weight factor.Can the theme of the performer of the program of current operation and potential subsequent program be compared.In this example, play if the film " Ace Ventura " that Jim Carrey acts the leading role is current, the documentary film about Jim Carrey that then is about to broadcast can be the related-program of recommending to the user.Also can be with the attribute cross reference of user's viewing preference and potential subsequent program.For example, if Friends is user's favorite program, be that the collection of drama of the Inside The Actor ' s Studio of characteristic can be the related-program of recommending to the user then with the Friends cast.
In the situation of sports cast, weight factor can comprise: the team that the user likes, user favorite exercise person, sports items identical, sports items that the user likes with the program of current operation, from the user like identical association of team team, score point difference, finals match, have superseded meaning match, from team or any other suitable factor of user's same area.
Plant weight factor for each and assign weighted value.The weighted value that is used for each weight factor is based on specific weight factor and has the degree of correlation of the program commending of interest with selecting the user.For example, can with the program weights identical be and user's height correlation, and public's favorite program can be not too relevant to the user with the program of current operation.In the example shown in Fig. 6, weighted value possibly be high, in and low.In other are realized, can give weight numerical value or other suitable values.For example, can give high weighted value to the program of liking theme about the user.Can give middle weighted value to the program of the type identical with the program of current operation.To common performer is arranged with the program with current operation is that the program of characteristic hangs down weighted value.
In case potential subsequent program has been assigned weighted value, 608, method 600 just can come based on the weighted value of its appointment potential subsequent program is carried out rank.Program with highest value will be the highest by rank.610, method 600 is selected to be included in the program in client's timetable that the user is shown.The program of high rank is chosen as program commending.If some programs have high similarly weighted value, then all these programs will be selected as to the user and recommend.If a program has the weighted value more much higher than any other program, then can select this single program to come to recommend to the user.Among this example, this single program commending most possibly is shown as channel and changes inquiry.
612, method 600 is selected will be to user's channel displayed.The channel of selecting will be a channel of arranging to broadcast the subsequent program of selecting.Can there be following realization; Wherein, Can select to broadcast channel, but not only broadcast the channel of a high weight program more than a relative higher weights program, though the related-program on second channel than first channel on the weight of any one related-program higher.
Having selected after which channel the user shows, 614, method 600 will offer data presentation system about the information of channel of selecting and the program that just on this channel, is broadcasting.Then, data presentation system can use this information to generate the instantaneous program guide that shows to the user.
In operation, the system that is positioned at client unit or remote server can receive the information of watching the TV programme that preference and user watching about the user.For example, the user can watch the collection of drama of The Simpsons.System can receive the following information of indication: current program is TheSimpsons; It is to adult's cartoon; Protagonist is Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright and Hank Azaria; It is created by Matt Groening; And about any other relevant information of this program.Other relevant informations can comprise the theme of current collection of drama or the star of the friendship that in current collection of drama, occurs performance.This system can also receive the information of watching preference about the user.For example, user's viewing history can be indicated the preference to cartoon or comedy routine.
In this example, system can confirm that then which program can be used for the user, and which program is arranged at broadcast in ensuing two hours.System then can be relatively about the information of these potential subsequent program, to confirm that which program maybe be relevant with The Simpsons or user's viewing preference.For example,, have the creator identical with TheSimpsons because Futurama also is to adult's cartoon, and with some identical voice-over actors, so can be chosen as the collection of drama that is about to broadcast of Futurama relevant with The Simpsons.Because South Part also is the cartoon to the adult, so also can select the collection of drama of South Park.The spectators of indication TheSimpsons like the information of South Park can be used to make this selection usually.If in ensuing two hours, other programs with The Simpsons height correlation do not broadcast, and then can come to recommend to the user collection of drama of The Daily Show based on user's program viewing history.
In case selected these programs to come to show to the user, system just will generate instantaneous program guide, and show the channel that broadcasts these programs to the user.
