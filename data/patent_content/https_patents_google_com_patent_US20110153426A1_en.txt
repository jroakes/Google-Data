Definitions
- Mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, laptop or notebook computers, and other mobile computing platforms may communicate via a wireless network. Advertisers may advertise to mobile device users by presenting advertisement content under select conditions. However, the presentation of advertisement content at a mobile device may be impaired during periods of degraded wireless communication with the mobile device.
- a method for a mobile device includes obtaining a plurality of advertisement content items at a mobile device via a communication network and storing the plurality of advertisement content items at a storage device of the mobile device. The method further includes selecting an advertisement content item from the plurality of advertisement content items stored at the storage device based, at least in part, on an advertisement selection parameter. The method further includes presenting the advertisement content item selected from the plurality of advertisement content items stored at the storage device via an output device of the mobile device.
- the advertisement selection parameter includes attributes of media content stored at the storage device of the mobile device or accessed by a user via the mobile device.
- FIGS. 1-8 depict example implementations of mobile device advertising as described in greater by the detailed description.
- FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram depicting an example network environment according to one implementation.
- FIG. 10 is a flow diagram depicting an example method for a mobile device according to one implementation.
- FIG. 11 is a flow diagram depicting an example method for a computing device according to one implementation.
- An advertising system and method of operation for mobile devices including a distributed advertising system and method of operation where the decisions for selecting or presenting advertising content may on one or more of an advertisement server, personal computer, or a mobile device.
- the implementation disclosed herein provide a system, method, and computer program for delivering and tracking mobile advertising asynchronously on mobile devices with intermittent or no data connectivity.
- Mobile devices may have reduced processing capability, data connectivity, and storage capacity as compared to personal computers.
- micro storage and expandable memory such as microSD cards are resulting in significant improvements in storage capacity of mobile devices.
- many mobile devices can support 16 GB and even up to 32 GB or more of expandable memory.
- Systems that can exploit this increase storage capacity to reduce application dependence on data networks can reduce latency and wait time for users, making applications more responsive and immediate. This is especially useful for advertising platforms where sluggish applications and long wait times result in high abandonment rates for advertising reducing the effectiveness and revenue generated by advertising screen real estate on a mobile device.
- the disclosed implementations provide a network-implementable computer architecture to intelligently store advertising on the local memory of a mobile device and enables applications on the mobile device to access, use and display locally stored advertising so that applications are not dependent on the mobile phone's data connection or web browser capabilities for advertising.
- the disclosed implementations further enable applications on a mobile device to store, use and display advertising even if the primary advertisement server is not available using a data connection available to the mobile device, or when there is no data connection or degraded data connection available to the mobile device.
- the disclosed implementations significantly improve the mobile advertising experience to users of mobile devices by reducing network wait time for advertising and enables applications running on mobile devices to use rich advertising making optimal use of the handsets media capabilities.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example interaction between a mobile browser 120 running on a mobile device and an advertisement server 125 .
- Current advertising platforms on mobile devices operate similar to the Internet advertising model on desktop computers.
- a user can start interacting with an application 130 on their mobile phone.
- the mobile application may request advertising 135 from the Advertisement server (using keywords or other means of context) to be displayed to the user.
- the Advertisement server using keywords or other means of context
- From time to time a user may click 150 or otherwise invoke the advertisement which results in the mobile application requesting and displaying further advertising details usually by transferring control to a web browser on the mobile device that may connect the user to the advertiser's website or other landing page or micro site created for the advertisement.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the system architecture of the present invention.
- Advertisement server 265 is the central repository that manages advertising inventory and performs statistics and tracking of advertising data centrally, which may be similar in at least some aspects to a traditional advertisement server. Advertisement server 265 may interface with a number of other systems to provide real time tracking and reports to advertisers. In the present disclosure, advertisement server 265 creates an advertising collection 225 from its inventory to be stored locally on mobile device 210 and manages and refreshes the advertising collection 225 from time to time over a wired or wireless data connection.
- the advertisement server may randomly choose advertising from its inventory 260 to create a collection or may uses information and data about the mobile device 210 and the user as well as information about the content or applications 250 and 255 present on or accessed via the mobile device to optimally create a collection of advertising 225 to store on the mobile device or to refresh a previously stored collection over a wired or wireless data connection. From time to time, mobile device 210 may send tracking and reporting data to advertisement server 265 or may be polled by advertisement server 265 for such data over a wired or wireless connection. This data may be used along with other available analytic data to refine the collection of advertising 225 on the mobile device and better determine and select advertisements for the mobile device during future updates. In at least some implementations, advertisement server 265 may be responsible for creating and managing collections of advertising stored on a mobile device and receiving tracking data for such advertising relating to usage and consumption.
- Advertisement module 230 is an interface between mobile applications and advertisement units on the mobile device 210 .
- Mobile applications 250 and 255 on the device may use the Advertisement module 230 as a gateway to interact with and use locally stored advertising 225 in a similar manner to a remote advertisement server.
- On-device advertisement module may be a separate application invoked by other applications or a process embedded in the device operating system accessible by applications running on the device.
- the advertisement module may use a database to maintain an index of advertising units and track statistics such as number of impressions served, click through rates etc.
- the database may contain a variety of information on Ad units including detailed descriptions and transcripts of audio/video advertising to perform contextual analysis using keywords.
- the advertisement module may also operate a communication interface to interact with the advertisement server. The interface may facilitate bi-directional communication over a wired or wireless network connection so that the advertisement module may send statistics and other tracking information to the advertisement server and receive new collections of advertising.
- An application on the mobile device may request an advertisement from the advertisement module by calling its API and passing relevant parameters (caller application, size parameters of the advertising, category, type, among other parameters described herein, etc.).
- the advertisement module may return an advertisement and a unique identifier or domain unique identifier to invoke advertising details if the user clicks or otherwise selects the advertisement.
- An personal computer proxy 270 may be used in at least some implementations to serve a number of useful functions described herein.
- the PC proxy may retrieve tracking data and statistics from the mobile device over a USB or Bluetooth connection when one is made between the device and the PC. The PC proxy may then transfer such data to the advertisement server over an internet connection. Similarly the PC proxy may download new advertising units from the advertisement server and sideload the collection of advertising on to the mobile device. This may be preferable over other implementations even if the mobile device is capable of downloading such content wirelessly for speed and bandwidth optimization. In this way, the PC Proxy may act as a data connection proxy to synchronize data between the mobile device and the advertisement server.
- the PC Proxy may also enable users to complete actions or transactions that started or were initiated on the mobile device. For example the user may indicate interest in purchasing content based on advertising displayed on the mobile device but actually complete the transaction on the personal computer. A user may also indicate interest in an advertisement by clicking on the advertisement but unable to view further advertising data because it is in a format that is not supported by the mobile device, in which case the user could be prompted by the PC software to continue viewing information at the personal computer.
- the present invention defines an ad unit to include both the advertisement and the advertisement details wherein the advertisement is linked to or used to display advertisement details as shown in FIG. 3A .
- the advertisement 325 may comprise traditional advertising content such as a picture banner or text advertising, or may comprise video or full screen content.
- the advertisement details 310 e.g., additional media content associated with the advertisement content
- the advertisement details may be a landing page, micro-website, or multi page digital brochure comprising rich media types including text 345 , 346 , images 330 and 335 , audio and video 340 .
- the advertisement details may also be interactive, such as a game and may accept user input. Advertisement details comprising multiple media types may be combined via a mark-up language such as HTML, to be displayed or otherwise presented within a compatible Web browser or defined using other scripting languages such as Flash or other proprietary mark up languages that may rely on a customized application for rendering.
- FIG. 3B demonstrates an example of an ad unit for an advertisement for a new car.
- the car maker may have created a microsite comprising images, videos and user input forms for desktop browsers as well as a mobile device.
- Banner ad 350 is displayed to a user in a mobile application and when clicked the user is presented with the microsite 315 that is locally cached.
- 352 shows the exterior
- 354 shows the interior
- 356 presents a video to the user
- 358 provides the user with detailed specifications and pricing and lastly 360 allows the user to enter their email address to receive more information or click a link to go to the car's website for further details.
- the ad units can be stored locally on a mobile device and be uniquely identifiable so that applications on the mobile device may request and display the advertisement.
- the ad unit maybe created from advertising media content for purposes of this system.
- the microsite maybe ingested/scanned by well-known indexing and transcoding processes to generate the ad unit from existing website content. Tracking and reporting would be handled by the advertisement server as described. User information captured during advertisement details may also be stored.
- the ad units may be rendered in a mobile web browser that may access the local cache on the mobile device or a proprietary application that can render the ad units.
- An ad unit may comprise any suitable media type supported by the mobile device (e.g., graphical content, audio, etc.) and may differ in implementation across different mobile devices based on capabilities.
- FIG. 4 demonstrates an example operation and interaction between example system components of the present disclosure.
- Advertisement server 430 receives user-specific information from the mobile device or the PC proxy to create a profile for the user.
- the user profile may include mobile device specific data such as GPS co-ordinates, preferences on applications or other configuration data.
- the profile maybe also be created based on the user's media collection and/or media preferences stored at a mobile device and/or at a personal computer associated with the mobile device.
- the Advertisement server 430 may create a collection of advertising content items 225 based on the user profile as described above and stores the collection 225 on the mobile device 210 .
- a user may begin using or otherwise interact with a mobile application 435 on a mobile device.
- Each application may request advertisements from the local advertisement module 420 .
- the advertisement module receives a request and performs analytics (further illustrated in FIG. 6 ) using its database to select a suitable advertisement to return.
- the advertisement module returns the advertising component (i.e., the advertisement content item) of the Ad Unit to the mobile application for presentation 445 .
- a user may click or otherwise select 450 on or otherwise invoke the advertisement which transfers control to the advertisement module 455 .
- the advertisement module retrieves advertising information for the advertisement and presents the media content associated with the advertisement (e.g., microsite) to the user 460 simulating a “virtual clickthrough”.
- the user may interact with the microsite and optionally request further details 465 .
- the advertisement module processes the request 470 , may end interaction 475 , and may transfer control back to the mobile application 480 .
- the advertisement module on the mobile device may track a number of advertisement impressions, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics for advertisement content items, and may store such information in local memory.
- the advertisement module may then transmit such data over a wired or wireless data connection to the advertisement server 482 as they may become available.
- tracking and reporting metrics may be transmitted in real-time or near real-time over the carrier data network to central servers for the mobile devices equipped with wireless data plans and are in coverage. For mobile devices without data plan capability, advertisers may select the inventory but acknowledge that tracking data may be delayed until communication can be established with the advertisement server or with a personal computer (e.g., via a local area network).
- certain interactive ad units may capture data from a user (email addresses, other personal information) responsive to user input. Such data may be stored with other advertisement metrics previously described, and may be transferred to the advertisement server along with other tracking and reporting data.
- the Advertisement server may be responsible for aggregating and disseminating data received from multiple devices and updating such data for advertisers. These metrics in combination with the user's demographic and information about the application or content on the device may be factored into optimizing the advertising cached on the mobile device and selection of advertising to be presented via the mobile device. The advertisement server may use such analytics to optimize ad units transferred to the mobile device.
- tracking data may be received by the PC proxy where it may be sent or forwarded to the advertisement server.
- new ad units may be retrieved by the PC proxy from the advertisement server and loaded onto the device over a wired connection (e.g., of a LAN).
- FIG. 5 demonstrates an example operation of the advertisement server.
- the advertisement server may receive a number of requests 510 from advertisement modules operating on a number of mobile devices or from PCs acting as a proxy for a mobile device.
- Statistics may be sent to the advertisement server over a wireless data connection, Internet, SMS messages, or using other suitable data transfer protocols.
- the advertisement server reference the user profile and write the updated statistics to a local database associated with the user records.
- the statistics may be used to uniquely identify a mobile device or user, and provide tracking or usage data regarding user behavior or advertising effectiveness.
- the data may then be aggregated or analyzed from the database using a variety of tools 540 . Further trend analysis may be conducted to optimize delivery of new ad units based on performance of previous ad units delivered.
- Another request type may be to refresh ad units on the mobile device 525 .
- the request may be made initiated by a user of the mobile device or may be performed according to a predefined schedule, or in response to specified events such as when a user initiates communication between a mobile device and a PC associated with the mobile device via a LAN.
- the advertisement server may maintain the state of the current ad units on the mobile device or may send such information to the advertisement server as part of the request.
- the advertisement server may analyze the user profile and ad effectiveness metrics to determine the optimal subset of ad units to transfer to the mobile device. This process may introduce new ad units that may be available for presentation at the mobile device.
- the advertisement server may also take into consideration device synchronization frequency and usage of the mobile device by the user to determine the number of ad units to send to the mobile device as well as the type of connection (e.g. is the mobile device wirelessly downloading the ad units or is the PC downloading the ad units over a high-speed Internet connection on behalf of the mobile device and then sideloading the ad units to the mobile device) to determine the number of Ad Units to refresh.
- the advertisement server may determine if the Ad Units require to be updated and if no updates are performed, may respond signaling no updates 560 . If on the other hand an update is to be performed the advertisement server may send a response that contains the updated Ad Units 555 .
- the response of the advertisement server may contain a file or other suitable collection of information that specifies the new ad units, ad units already present at the mobile device to be maintained at the mobile device and Ad Units that are to be deleted or otherwise disabled at the mobile device.
- the response may be sent in the form of an XML file or some other format suitable to the mobile device.
- the advertisement server may be enhanced to expose APIs that allow other advertisement servers or desktop software to target advertising based on user data.
- a request received by the advertisement server may be a request to set a user bookmark 530 from the mobile device for future retrieval on a PC associated with the mobile device.
- the bookmark may be set when a user requests a website or URL that is not able to be displayed on a mobile device.
- the advertisement server processes the request and updates the user profile 565 and sets the bookmark.
- a future request 570 may be made to the advertisement server to retrieve the bookmark from the PC software or a more capable portable computing device able to render the website or URL.
- the request may be generated by software or initiated by the user.
- the advertisement server retrieves bookmarks for the user 575 and sends them to the requesting computing device 580 .
- FIG. 6A shows the advertisement module processing a request for an advertisement content item 610 from an application on a mobile device.
- the advertisement module may determine the best match or most suitable match 615 by optimizing a variety of variables including advertiser specified cost per ad unit, number of ad units authorized, contextual data about the content of the application, personal information about a user as well as past performance of advertising effectiveness and user behavior.
- Personal information may include information discovered by accessing personal data (phonebook, contacts, calendar) as well as data such as current geographic (e.g., GPS) location and time.
- One advantage of the disclosed implementations is that highly personal data such as GPS location does not have to be transmitted to online servers continuously, and such data can be used by the local advertisement module for ad selection on the mobile device itself.
- the advertisement module selects the optimal ad unit and tracks the request from the calling application 620 as well as the advertisement served.
- the advertisement module returns an advertisement to the calling mobile application 625 as well as a unique identifier or domain unique identifier that the application can use to invoke the advertisement module with further details.
- the advertisement may be returned directly or a pointer to the advertisement may be returned such as the location of a picture on the disk and optionally a unique identifier that the application may use when the user clicks on an advertisement to invoke the display of advertisement details.
- the advertisement module may attempt to re-download the ad unit over a data connection or select another ad unit. If no ad units are present, the advertisement module may return a default advertising message or an error message to the calling application.
- FIG. 6B shows the advertisement module processing a virtual clickthrough.
- a user may click on an advertising which results in the user typically being directed to the advertiser's website. Advertisers often create landing pages for different advertisements so that a user may quickly be connected to details of the particular advertisement that was selected. These metrics may be tracked and measured, and are generally referred to as “click-throughs”.
- click-throughs On mobile devices, a user may not be able to click-through on an advertisement as they may not presently have a data connection. Further users that do click-through over an available data connection may find the experience slow over a mobile data connection and may choose to cancel the action.
- the advertisement details in this case a micro-site or landing page of the advertiser
- a user may click-through even without the presence of a data connection. Further the user may be connected with the advertising information almost instantly, avoiding wait time and reducing the likelihood of the user cancelling the action. In doing so, a user is able to “virtually click-through” an advertisement to a locally cached landing page or micro-site that exists on the device itself as described below.
- the advertisement module receives a clickthrough request 635 from the mobile application, along with the identifier that was returned with the original advertisement 625 (in the absence of the identifier, the advertisement module may be able to determine the ad details to render based on the calling application and tracking the most recent advertisement that was returned for that application).
- the advertisement module may record and timestamp the clickthough event and the application that generated the click through among other suitable information 640 , and retrieves the ad details from the local storage of the mobile device.
- the advertisement module may present the ad details to the user by assuming screen control from the calling application. In this way the application may avoid the complexity of having to deal with advertising data.
- the advertisement details may optionally be presented to the user within the application the user is currently using (e.g., if the application is able to render the advertisement details) or the application may simply invoke the advertisement module to render the advertisement details allowing the user to interact with the advertising details.
- the advertisement module may directly connect the user with the advertiser's website instead of serving locally cached advertising details (e.g., if a quality of the data connection exceeds a threshold quality).
- the advertisement module may then present further options for the user 650 to receive further details from the advertiser ranging from connecting the user to the advertiser's website or phone number, having email sent to the user by email or SMS or alternatively connecting the user with the advertiser the next time the user interacts with a PC associated with the mobile device (e.g., place-shifting advertising by setting bookmarks further as described below).
- the advertisement module may transfer control back to the caller application 655 so the user may resume where the user left off before interacting with the advertisement. From time to time the advertisement module may send back tracking and usage data to the advertisement server.
- FIG. 7A shows an example of the PC Proxy acting as a proxy for a mobile device to send device statistics and update ad units on the mobile device. This operation may be implemented, for example, if the mobile device is not able to establish wireless data connections directly with the advertisement server or is unable to transfer large amounts of data over a wireless network.
- the PC proxy may receive an incoming request from a mobile device 710 .
- the connection may be made over WiFi, Bluetooth, USB cable, or other suitable local area network protocol.
- the PC proxy identifies the connected mobile device 715 , retrieves usage statistics from the mobile device 720 , and transmits such information to the advertisement server 725 .
- the PC proxy may request updated ad units 730 for the specific mobile device, may transfer the ad units to the device 735 , and may send confirmation to the advertisement server of completion of the process 740 .
- the PC proxy may download new ad units for known devices before connection with the mobile device is established so that the ad units are available for transfer to the mobile device when the mobile device initiates communication with the PC.
- FIG. 7B shows an example operation of the PC proxy for a ‘place-shifted’ clickthrough.
- the advertisement module operation in addition to the advertisement details provided by an advertiser (if any), the user may be presented with further options to connect with the advertiser to obtain additional information relating to the advertisement, including e.g., via a phone call, SMS, or requests to have additional information emailed to the user, etc. Further, the advertisement details may optionally connect the user to the advertiser's website if a data connection is available on the mobile device.
- a click through may also be place-shifted so that when a user clicks through on a mobile device, the advertisement module tracks the click through and signals the user's PC by interfacing with PC software over a wired or wireless data connection (e.g., of a LAN).
- a wired or wireless data connection e.g., of a LAN.
- the user may continue viewing advertising details where they left off on the mobile device.
- the user may be presented on the mobile device with the option of being reminded about the product/service the next time the mobile device establishes communication with the PC, which would then invoke the process described above.
- a click through may be place-shifted so that a user may interact with an advertiser through their PC even though the click through was initiated on the user's mobile device.
- this approach may even be preferable to a user if, for example, the user is not able to purchase goods or perform some actions on the mobile device that may be performed on a PC, including e.g., rendering a Flash object, graphically intensive website, or completing a purchase that is supported by a PC based web browser.
- the Desktop Proxy may poll the advertisement server, from time-to-time or upon request, for bookmarks set for or by the user 745 .
- the advertisement server sends the response (e.g., as shown in 580 ), in one implementation, in the form of a URL that is received by the PC proxy 750 and may be opened, for example, via a web browser available on the PC 755 .
- the PC proxy may perform this process when a mobile device establishes connection with the PC, or before establishing a connection with the PC.
- the PC proxy may prompt the user and ask if the user would like to see details at that time or at a later time.
- the advertisement server may track such details as a PC clickthrough, similar to traditional clickthroughs in the Internet advertising environment, for example.
- One advantage of the disclosed implementations is that advertising data can be retrieved and displayed within mobile applications very quickly without network latency. This approach enables a higher degree of advertising integration into content unavailable with many of the present systems.
- an online digital store front such as an electronic music store can be represented as a set of individual advertising items for digital content that can be integrated into a media player on the mobile device.
- the disclosed implementations enable application integration points that maximize or increase the user's exposure to advertising, thereby increasing the likelihood of the user acting on an advertisement and/or purchasing content.
- PC based software may scan the user's PC media library and may pass a list of song names and artists to advertisement server 825 .
- Advertisement server 825 constructs a set of advertising items, in this case a discography of all music relating to the artist names received and subtracts the song names that the user presently has from the set. This set can be described as the superset of advertising items for the set of music the user has on their personal computer.
- the superset may be constructed, in the case of music, by looking up the music discography for each artist in a user's library to generate a complete list of tracks. Tracks in the superset that the user already has in their library may be marked as such.
- All or at least some of the remaining tracks not marked as part of a user's library represents a set of songs that the user is highly likely to purchase to reduce gaps in the user's music collection.
- the superset may contain information about the song such as the name, artist and album as well as link to purchase the song.
- Advertisement server 825 sends the superset of advertising items directly to mobile device 815 or to PC software 820 to be transferred to the mobile device.
- the data may be stored on the mobile device using a database or other well-known data structures that allow data to be queried. An example is shown in FIG. 8
- media player 810 When media player 810 displays a list of songs by an artist it can request a list of advertising from the advertisement module 815 .
- the advertisement module queries advertisement content items by the artist and returns the set 836 to the media player containing the display information required as well as the link to purchase the song from the music store.
- Media player 810 appends/inserts the advertisements to the list 840 so that the user is prompted to purchase music that is missing from the user's collection from the music store.
- the user clicks on a song they own the song plays in the media player, but the user may also click on a song 855 they wish to purchase which then purchases the song from the music store.
- Media player 810 perform the above described operations for some or all artists and albums the user selects, because the advertising data set 838 is locally stored on the mobile device and does not require use of the wireless network.
- media player 810 When media player 810 is playing a song, media player 810 may implement a recommendations feature and recommend media content the user may want to purchase based on the song they are listening to by querying the advertisement module for local recommendations 838 .
- the recommended songs may be inserted among other content related to the song the user is listening to.
- other advertisements maybe integrated here as shown in 838 .
- Media player 810 can track advertisements, in this case new songs, that the user clicks on or samples, and songs that the user purchases, and may report such data back to advertisement server 825 . Each time media player 810 is started or operated on the mobile device, the advertising data may be refreshed based on modifications to the user's music collection and analysis of user behavior towards previous recommendations.
- the above example relates to music
- the above media content items can be extended to include media types such as videos, audio such as ringtones, images such as themes and wallpapers and even other applications such as games.
- the present invention allows rich advertising integration of new songs into a mobile application such as media player 810 due to the speed, responsiveness and relevance of ad units locally stored on the mobile device.
- the disclosed implementations enable a user to interact seamlessly with their own music, and advertising for new music resulting in increased song purchasing due to an improved advertising experience.
- mapping application that uses GPS or similar location-aware mobile applications.
- the application may send the mobile device location to the advertisement server which constructs a set of ad units based on the mobile device location.
- the ad units may represent points-of-interest and local advertising within a certain proximity of the user.
- the superset in this example may be constructed based on user data, and may represent some or all points of interest of the surrounding city or location.
- the mobile application may query the advertisement module for advertising data (e.g., advertisement content items) to be displayed and recommend points-of-interest to the user in a similar manner as media player 810 for media content.
- advertising data e.g., advertisement content items
- the present disclosure describes how to implement a distributed advertising system where decisions on serving ad units may be made on a remote advertisement server, personal computer, or a mobile device.
- the present disclosure also describes how to implement localized ad units that may be used by the distributed advertising system. Together the advertising system and ad units allow for relevant advertising to be cached locally on mobile devices, thereby improving the experience and effectiveness of the advertising platform. The speed at which advertising maybe retrieved enable advertising to be integrated seamlessly into mobile applications without data network dependence or delays.

FIGS. 1-8 depict example implementations of mobile device advertising as described in greater by the detailed description. -
FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram depicting an example network environment according to one implementation. -
FIG. 10 is a flow diagram depicting an example method for a mobile device according to one implementation. -
FIG. 11 is a flow diagram depicting an example method for a computing device according to one implementation. - An advertising system and method of operation for mobile devices is disclosed, including a distributed advertising system and method of operation where the decisions for selecting or presenting advertising content may on one or more of an advertisement server, personal computer, or a mobile device.
- Recent advances in technology have resulted in users of mobile phones and other mobile devices to perform functions such as web browsing, media playback, media browsing, media purchasing, and operate productivity software much like they would on their personal computers.
- As users increase their time spent on mobile devices, online advertising platforms seek to effectively advertise to users on mobile devices as well. There are a number of challenges that currently degrade the advertising experience for users on mobile devices. For example, mobile applications need to deal with the complexity of managing a data connection to serve, present, and track advertising content on a mobile device. Certain devices may not have data storage or processing capability, and some devices may have sporadic data coverage affecting the reach and availability of the advertising service provided by remote computing devices. As a result, advertising may be ineffective because a user may be unable to ‘click through’ on an advertisement to obtain additional information if the data connection is interrupted, or a user may not be able to take action and complete a purchase on a mobile device if their browser is not capable of doing so. Further, since most advertising platforms are web-based, the richness of the advertising medium is limited by the capability of the mobile phone's web browser (the browser and website may not support audio/video, animations, etc. even though the phone may be capable of doing so). Downloading rich advertising can be slow over a data connection, especially if the advertising contains media elements such as pictures, audio and video. This usually results in high abandonment rates as user may cancel the action or skip the advertisement because of the delay in downloading media. For this reason mobile applications, and especially advertising, benefit from instant or improved responsiveness to keep users' attention. With traditional advertising platforms, delivering highly targeted advertising requires may involve sending sensitive private user information to centralized servers for processing which users may object to or may cause liability based on privacy laws in certain jurisdictions.
- Overview
- The implementation disclosed herein provide a system, method, and computer program for delivering and tracking mobile advertising asynchronously on mobile devices with intermittent or no data connectivity. Mobile devices may have reduced processing capability, data connectivity, and storage capacity as compared to personal computers. However recent trends in micro storage and expandable memory such as microSD cards are resulting in significant improvements in storage capacity of mobile devices. For example many mobile devices can support 16 GB and even up to 32 GB or more of expandable memory. Systems that can exploit this increase storage capacity to reduce application dependence on data networks can reduce latency and wait time for users, making applications more responsive and immediate. This is especially useful for advertising platforms where sluggish applications and long wait times result in high abandonment rates for advertising reducing the effectiveness and revenue generated by advertising screen real estate on a mobile device.
- The disclosed implementations provide a network-implementable computer architecture to intelligently store advertising on the local memory of a mobile device and enables applications on the mobile device to access, use and display locally stored advertising so that applications are not dependent on the mobile phone's data connection or web browser capabilities for advertising.
- The disclosed implementations further enable applications on a mobile device to store, use and display advertising even if the primary advertisement server is not available using a data connection available to the mobile device, or when there is no data connection or degraded data connection available to the mobile device.
- The disclosed implementations significantly improve the mobile advertising experience to users of mobile devices by reducing network wait time for advertising and enables applications running on mobile devices to use rich advertising making optimal use of the handsets media capabilities.
- Current Systems
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example interaction between amobile browser 120 running on a mobile device and anadvertisement server 125. Current advertising platforms on mobile devices operate similar to the Internet advertising model on desktop computers. A user can start interacting with anapplication 130 on their mobile phone. On one or more screens the mobile application may request advertising 135 from the Advertisement server (using keywords or other means of context) to be displayed to the user. From time to time a user may click 150 or otherwise invoke the advertisement which results in the mobile application requesting and displaying further advertising details usually by transferring control to a web browser on the mobile device that may connect the user to the advertiser's website or other landing page or micro site created for the advertisement. - There are two areas of dependence on data connections here. Firstly, interactions with the advertisement server require the presence of a wireless data connection to request and display advertising. Secondly, the data connection is required to complete a ‘click-through’ and allow the user to click on an advertisement within the application resulting in the application invoking the web browser to transfer the user to the advertiser's website. The service cannot function correctly if the data connection is interrupted during any of the above actions. Additionally, the advertisers are limited to the capability of the web browser which may not fully support the media capabilities of the phone such as support for audio and video playback. In all cases the service is unavailable on mobile devices that do not have or are not capable of facilitating data connections.
- System Architecture
-
FIG. 2 illustrates the system architecture of the present invention.Advertisement server 265 is the central repository that manages advertising inventory and performs statistics and tracking of advertising data centrally, which may be similar in at least some aspects to a traditional advertisement server.Advertisement server 265 may interface with a number of other systems to provide real time tracking and reports to advertisers. In the present disclosure,advertisement server 265 creates anadvertising collection 225 from its inventory to be stored locally onmobile device 210 and manages and refreshes theadvertising collection 225 from time to time over a wired or wireless data connection. The advertisement server may randomly choose advertising from itsinventory 260 to create a collection or may uses information and data about themobile device 210 and the user as well as information about the content orapplications advertising 225 to store on the mobile device or to refresh a previously stored collection over a wired or wireless data connection. From time to time,mobile device 210 may send tracking and reporting data toadvertisement server 265 or may be polled byadvertisement server 265 for such data over a wired or wireless connection. This data may be used along with other available analytic data to refine the collection ofadvertising 225 on the mobile device and better determine and select advertisements for the mobile device during future updates. In at least some implementations,advertisement server 265 may be responsible for creating and managing collections of advertising stored on a mobile device and receiving tracking data for such advertising relating to usage and consumption. - Advertisement Module
-
Advertisement module 230 is an interface between mobile applications and advertisement units on themobile device 210.Mobile applications Advertisement module 230 as a gateway to interact with and use locally storedadvertising 225 in a similar manner to a remote advertisement server. On-device advertisement module may be a separate application invoked by other applications or a process embedded in the device operating system accessible by applications running on the device. - In one implementation, the advertisement module may use a database to maintain an index of advertising units and track statistics such as number of impressions served, click through rates etc. The database may contain a variety of information on Ad units including detailed descriptions and transcripts of audio/video advertising to perform contextual analysis using keywords. The advertisement module may also operate a communication interface to interact with the advertisement server. The interface may facilitate bi-directional communication over a wired or wireless network connection so that the advertisement module may send statistics and other tracking information to the advertisement server and receive new collections of advertising.
- An application on the mobile device may request an advertisement from the advertisement module by calling its API and passing relevant parameters (caller application, size parameters of the advertising, category, type, among other parameters described herein, etc.). The advertisement module may return an advertisement and a unique identifier or domain unique identifier to invoke advertising details if the user clicks or otherwise selects the advertisement.
- Proxy Computer
- An
personal computer proxy 270 may be used in at least some implementations to serve a number of useful functions described herein. For data devices that are not capable of wireless data transfer, the PC proxy may retrieve tracking data and statistics from the mobile device over a USB or Bluetooth connection when one is made between the device and the PC. The PC proxy may then transfer such data to the advertisement server over an internet connection. Similarly the PC proxy may download new advertising units from the advertisement server and sideload the collection of advertising on to the mobile device. This may be preferable over other implementations even if the mobile device is capable of downloading such content wirelessly for speed and bandwidth optimization. In this way, the PC Proxy may act as a data connection proxy to synchronize data between the mobile device and the advertisement server. - The PC Proxy may also enable users to complete actions or transactions that started or were initiated on the mobile device. For example the user may indicate interest in purchasing content based on advertising displayed on the mobile device but actually complete the transaction on the personal computer. A user may also indicate interest in an advertisement by clicking on the advertisement but unable to view further advertising data because it is in a format that is not supported by the mobile device, in which case the user could be prompted by the PC software to continue viewing information at the personal computer.
- Ad Unit Creation
- The present invention defines an ad unit to include both the advertisement and the advertisement details wherein the advertisement is linked to or used to display advertisement details as shown in
FIG. 3A . Theadvertisement 325 may comprise traditional advertising content such as a picture banner or text advertising, or may comprise video or full screen content. The advertisement details 310 (e.g., additional media content associated with the advertisement content) may be a landing page, micro-website, or multi page digital brochure comprising rich mediatypes including text images video 340. The advertisement details may also be interactive, such as a game and may accept user input. Advertisement details comprising multiple media types may be combined via a mark-up language such as HTML, to be displayed or otherwise presented within a compatible Web browser or defined using other scripting languages such as Flash or other proprietary mark up languages that may rely on a customized application for rendering. -
FIG. 3B demonstrates an example of an ad unit for an advertisement for a new car. The car maker may have created a microsite comprising images, videos and user input forms for desktop browsers as well as a mobile device.Banner ad 350 is displayed to a user in a mobile application and when clicked the user is presented with themicrosite 315 that is locally cached. 352 shows the exterior, 354 shows the interior, 356 presents a video to the user, 358 provides the user with detailed specifications and pricing and lastly 360 allows the user to enter their email address to receive more information or click a link to go to the car's website for further details. - The ad units can be stored locally on a mobile device and be uniquely identifiable so that applications on the mobile device may request and display the advertisement. The ad unit maybe created from advertising media content for purposes of this system. Alternatively the microsite maybe ingested/scanned by well-known indexing and transcoding processes to generate the ad unit from existing website content. Tracking and reporting would be handled by the advertisement server as described. User information captured during advertisement details may also be stored. The ad units may be rendered in a mobile web browser that may access the local cache on the mobile device or a proprietary application that can render the ad units. An ad unit may comprise any suitable media type supported by the mobile device (e.g., graphical content, audio, etc.) and may differ in implementation across different mobile devices based on capabilities.
- Asynchronous mobile advertising platform interaction
-
FIG. 4 demonstrates an example operation and interaction between example system components of the present disclosure.Advertisement server 430 receives user-specific information from the mobile device or the PC proxy to create a profile for the user. The user profile may include mobile device specific data such as GPS co-ordinates, preferences on applications or other configuration data. The profile maybe also be created based on the user's media collection and/or media preferences stored at a mobile device and/or at a personal computer associated with the mobile device. TheAdvertisement server 430 may create a collection ofadvertising content items 225 based on the user profile as described above and stores thecollection 225 on themobile device 210. - A user may begin using or otherwise interact with a
mobile application 435 on a mobile device. Each application may request advertisements from thelocal advertisement module 420. The advertisement module receives a request and performs analytics (further illustrated inFIG. 6 ) using its database to select a suitable advertisement to return. The advertisement module returns the advertising component (i.e., the advertisement content item) of the Ad Unit to the mobile application forpresentation 445. - From time to time a user may click or otherwise select 450 on or otherwise invoke the advertisement which transfers control to the
advertisement module 455. The advertisement module retrieves advertising information for the advertisement and presents the media content associated with the advertisement (e.g., microsite) to theuser 460 simulating a “virtual clickthrough”. The user may interact with the microsite and optionally requestfurther details 465. The advertisement module processes therequest 470, may endinteraction 475, and may transfer control back to themobile application 480. - The advertisement module on the mobile device may track a number of advertisement impressions, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics for advertisement content items, and may store such information in local memory. The advertisement module may then transmit such data over a wired or wireless data connection to the
advertisement server 482 as they may become available. In at least one implementation, tracking and reporting metrics may be transmitted in real-time or near real-time over the carrier data network to central servers for the mobile devices equipped with wireless data plans and are in coverage. For mobile devices without data plan capability, advertisers may select the inventory but acknowledge that tracking data may be delayed until communication can be established with the advertisement server or with a personal computer (e.g., via a local area network). - In some cases, certain interactive ad units may capture data from a user (email addresses, other personal information) responsive to user input. Such data may be stored with other advertisement metrics previously described, and may be transferred to the advertisement server along with other tracking and reporting data.
- The Advertisement server may be responsible for aggregating and disseminating data received from multiple devices and updating such data for advertisers. These metrics in combination with the user's demographic and information about the application or content on the device may be factored into optimizing the advertising cached on the mobile device and selection of advertising to be presented via the mobile device. The advertisement server may use such analytics to optimize ad units transferred to the mobile device.
- In certain instances where a wireless connection is not available, degraded, or inefficient for transferring large amounts of data, tracking data may be received by the PC proxy where it may be sent or forwarded to the advertisement server. Similarly, new ad units may be retrieved by the PC proxy from the advertisement server and loaded onto the device over a wired connection (e.g., of a LAN).
- Advertisement Server Operation
-
FIG. 5 demonstrates an example operation of the advertisement server. The advertisement server may receive a number ofrequests 510 from advertisement modules operating on a number of mobile devices or from PCs acting as a proxy for a mobile device. Statistics may be sent to the advertisement server over a wireless data connection, Internet, SMS messages, or using other suitable data transfer protocols. - If the request type is an update for
statistics 520, the advertisement server reference the user profile and write the updated statistics to a local database associated with the user records. The statistics may be used to uniquely identify a mobile device or user, and provide tracking or usage data regarding user behavior or advertising effectiveness. The data may then be aggregated or analyzed from the database using a variety oftools 540. Further trend analysis may be conducted to optimize delivery of new ad units based on performance of previous ad units delivered. - Another request type may be to refresh ad units on the
mobile device 525. The request may be made initiated by a user of the mobile device or may be performed according to a predefined schedule, or in response to specified events such as when a user initiates communication between a mobile device and a PC associated with the mobile device via a LAN. The advertisement server may maintain the state of the current ad units on the mobile device or may send such information to the advertisement server as part of the request. The advertisement server may analyze the user profile and ad effectiveness metrics to determine the optimal subset of ad units to transfer to the mobile device. This process may introduce new ad units that may be available for presentation at the mobile device. The advertisement server may also take into consideration device synchronization frequency and usage of the mobile device by the user to determine the number of ad units to send to the mobile device as well as the type of connection (e.g. is the mobile device wirelessly downloading the ad units or is the PC downloading the ad units over a high-speed Internet connection on behalf of the mobile device and then sideloading the ad units to the mobile device) to determine the number of Ad Units to refresh. The advertisement server may determine if the Ad Units require to be updated and if no updates are performed, may respond signaling noupdates 560. If on the other hand an update is to be performed the advertisement server may send a response that contains the updatedAd Units 555. The response of the advertisement server may contain a file or other suitable collection of information that specifies the new ad units, ad units already present at the mobile device to be maintained at the mobile device and Ad Units that are to be deleted or otherwise disabled at the mobile device. The response may be sent in the form of an XML file or some other format suitable to the mobile device. The advertisement server may be enhanced to expose APIs that allow other advertisement servers or desktop software to target advertising based on user data. - Another example of a request received by the advertisement server may be a request to set a
user bookmark 530 from the mobile device for future retrieval on a PC associated with the mobile device. The bookmark may be set when a user requests a website or URL that is not able to be displayed on a mobile device. The advertisement server processes the request and updates theuser profile 565 and sets the bookmark. Afuture request 570 may be made to the advertisement server to retrieve the bookmark from the PC software or a more capable portable computing device able to render the website or URL. The request may be generated by software or initiated by the user. The advertisement server retrieves bookmarks for theuser 575 and sends them to the requestingcomputing device 580. - Advertisement Module Operation
-
FIG. 6A shows the advertisement module processing a request for anadvertisement content item 610 from an application on a mobile device. The advertisement module may determine the best match or mostsuitable match 615 by optimizing a variety of variables including advertiser specified cost per ad unit, number of ad units authorized, contextual data about the content of the application, personal information about a user as well as past performance of advertising effectiveness and user behavior. Personal information may include information discovered by accessing personal data (phonebook, contacts, calendar) as well as data such as current geographic (e.g., GPS) location and time. One advantage of the disclosed implementations is that highly personal data such as GPS location does not have to be transmitted to online servers continuously, and such data can be used by the local advertisement module for ad selection on the mobile device itself. The advertisement module selects the optimal ad unit and tracks the request from the callingapplication 620 as well as the advertisement served. The advertisement module returns an advertisement to the callingmobile application 625 as well as a unique identifier or domain unique identifier that the application can use to invoke the advertisement module with further details. The advertisement may be returned directly or a pointer to the advertisement may be returned such as the location of a picture on the disk and optionally a unique identifier that the application may use when the user clicks on an advertisement to invoke the display of advertisement details. If an ad unit is missing from the local cache, the advertisement module may attempt to re-download the ad unit over a data connection or select another ad unit. If no ad units are present, the advertisement module may return a default advertising message or an error message to the calling application. -
FIG. 6B shows the advertisement module processing a virtual clickthrough. In traditional Internet advertising a user may click on an advertising which results in the user typically being directed to the advertiser's website. Advertisers often create landing pages for different advertisements so that a user may quickly be connected to details of the particular advertisement that was selected. These metrics may be tracked and measured, and are generally referred to as “click-throughs”. On mobile devices, a user may not be able to click-through on an advertisement as they may not presently have a data connection. Further users that do click-through over an available data connection may find the experience slow over a mobile data connection and may choose to cancel the action. However, in the disclosed implementations, because the advertisement details, in this case a micro-site or landing page of the advertiser, is cached locally on the mobile device, a user may click-through even without the presence of a data connection. Further the user may be connected with the advertising information almost instantly, avoiding wait time and reducing the likelihood of the user cancelling the action. In doing so, a user is able to “virtually click-through” an advertisement to a locally cached landing page or micro-site that exists on the device itself as described below. - When a user is interested in an advertisement displayed by a mobile application they may clickthrough or otherwise invoke the advertisement. The advertisement module receives a
clickthrough request 635 from the mobile application, along with the identifier that was returned with the original advertisement 625 (in the absence of the identifier, the advertisement module may be able to determine the ad details to render based on the calling application and tracking the most recent advertisement that was returned for that application). - The advertisement module may record and timestamp the clickthough event and the application that generated the click through among other
suitable information 640, and retrieves the ad details from the local storage of the mobile device. The advertisement module may present the ad details to the user by assuming screen control from the calling application. In this way the application may avoid the complexity of having to deal with advertising data. The advertisement details may optionally be presented to the user within the application the user is currently using (e.g., if the application is able to render the advertisement details) or the application may simply invoke the advertisement module to render the advertisement details allowing the user to interact with the advertising details. In some implementations, the advertisement module may directly connect the user with the advertiser's website instead of serving locally cached advertising details (e.g., if a quality of the data connection exceeds a threshold quality). - The advertisement module may then present further options for the
user 650 to receive further details from the advertiser ranging from connecting the user to the advertiser's website or phone number, having email sent to the user by email or SMS or alternatively connecting the user with the advertiser the next time the user interacts with a PC associated with the mobile device (e.g., place-shifting advertising by setting bookmarks further as described below). When the user has finished interacting with the advertisement details, the advertisement module may transfer control back to thecaller application 655 so the user may resume where the user left off before interacting with the advertisement. From time to time the advertisement module may send back tracking and usage data to the advertisement server. - PC Proxy Operation
-
FIG. 7A shows an example of the PC Proxy acting as a proxy for a mobile device to send device statistics and update ad units on the mobile device. This operation may be implemented, for example, if the mobile device is not able to establish wireless data connections directly with the advertisement server or is unable to transfer large amounts of data over a wireless network. - The PC proxy may receive an incoming request from a
mobile device 710. The connection may be made over WiFi, Bluetooth, USB cable, or other suitable local area network protocol. The PC proxy identifies the connectedmobile device 715, retrieves usage statistics from themobile device 720, and transmits such information to theadvertisement server 725. The PC proxy may request updatedad units 730 for the specific mobile device, may transfer the ad units to thedevice 735, and may send confirmation to the advertisement server of completion of theprocess 740. - In another implementation, the PC proxy may download new ad units for known devices before connection with the mobile device is established so that the ad units are available for transfer to the mobile device when the mobile device initiates communication with the PC.
-
FIG. 7B shows an example operation of the PC proxy for a ‘place-shifted’ clickthrough. As described in the advertisement module operation, in addition to the advertisement details provided by an advertiser (if any), the user may be presented with further options to connect with the advertiser to obtain additional information relating to the advertisement, including e.g., via a phone call, SMS, or requests to have additional information emailed to the user, etc. Further, the advertisement details may optionally connect the user to the advertiser's website if a data connection is available on the mobile device. - A click through may also be place-shifted so that when a user clicks through on a mobile device, the advertisement module tracks the click through and signals the user's PC by interfacing with PC software over a wired or wireless data connection (e.g., of a LAN). When the mobile device is within communication proximity of the associated PC (e.g., as determined by a number of methods including the establishment of a wired or wireless connection) the user may continue viewing advertising details where they left off on the mobile device. In other cases where the user is not next to their PC, the user may be presented on the mobile device with the option of being reminded about the product/service the next time the mobile device establishes communication with the PC, which would then invoke the process described above.
- In this way, a click through may be place-shifted so that a user may interact with an advertiser through their PC even though the click through was initiated on the user's mobile device. In some examples this approach may even be preferable to a user if, for example, the user is not able to purchase goods or perform some actions on the mobile device that may be performed on a PC, including e.g., rendering a Flash object, graphically intensive website, or completing a purchase that is supported by a PC based web browser.
- As shown in
FIG. 7B , the Desktop Proxy may poll the advertisement server, from time-to-time or upon request, for bookmarks set for or by theuser 745. The advertisement server sends the response (e.g., as shown in 580), in one implementation, in the form of a URL that is received by thePC proxy 750 and may be opened, for example, via a web browser available on thePC 755. The PC proxy may perform this process when a mobile device establishes connection with the PC, or before establishing a connection with the PC. Alternatively, the PC proxy may prompt the user and ask if the user would like to see details at that time or at a later time. In these examples the advertisement server may track such details as a PC clickthrough, similar to traditional clickthroughs in the Internet advertising environment, for example. - Advertising Integration into Mobile Device Applications
- One advantage of the disclosed implementations is that advertising data can be retrieved and displayed within mobile applications very quickly without network latency. This approach enables a higher degree of advertising integration into content unavailable with many of the present systems.
- In one implementation, an online digital store front such as an electronic music store can be represented as a set of individual advertising items for digital content that can be integrated into a media player on the mobile device. The disclosed implementations enable application integration points that maximize or increase the user's exposure to advertising, thereby increasing the likelihood of the user acting on an advertisement and/or purchasing content.
- PC based software may scan the user's PC media library and may pass a list of song names and artists to
advertisement server 825.Advertisement server 825 constructs a set of advertising items, in this case a discography of all music relating to the artist names received and subtracts the song names that the user presently has from the set. This set can be described as the superset of advertising items for the set of music the user has on their personal computer. The superset may be constructed, in the case of music, by looking up the music discography for each artist in a user's library to generate a complete list of tracks. Tracks in the superset that the user already has in their library may be marked as such. All or at least some of the remaining tracks not marked as part of a user's library represents a set of songs that the user is highly likely to purchase to reduce gaps in the user's music collection. The superset may contain information about the song such as the name, artist and album as well as link to purchase the song.Advertisement server 825 sends the superset of advertising items directly tomobile device 815 or toPC software 820 to be transferred to the mobile device. The data may be stored on the mobile device using a database or other well-known data structures that allow data to be queried. An example is shown inFIG. 8 - When
media player 810 displays a list of songs by an artist it can request a list of advertising from theadvertisement module 815. The advertisement module queries advertisement content items by the artist and returns theset 836 to the media player containing the display information required as well as the link to purchase the song from the music store.Media player 810 appends/inserts the advertisements to thelist 840 so that the user is prompted to purchase music that is missing from the user's collection from the music store. In this implementation, when the user clicks on a song they own, the song plays in the media player, but the user may also click on asong 855 they wish to purchase which then purchases the song from the music store.Media player 810 perform the above described operations for some or all artists and albums the user selects, because theadvertising data set 838 is locally stored on the mobile device and does not require use of the wireless network. - When
media player 810 is playing a song,media player 810 may implement a recommendations feature and recommend media content the user may want to purchase based on the song they are listening to by querying the advertisement module forlocal recommendations 838. In the implementation shown inFIG. 8 , the recommended songs may be inserted among other content related to the song the user is listening to. In addition, other advertisements maybe integrated here as shown in 838. -
Media player 810 can track advertisements, in this case new songs, that the user clicks on or samples, and songs that the user purchases, and may report such data back toadvertisement server 825. Eachtime media player 810 is started or operated on the mobile device, the advertising data may be refreshed based on modifications to the user's music collection and analysis of user behavior towards previous recommendations. - Although the above example relates to music, those skilled in the art can appreciate that the above media content items can be extended to include media types such as videos, audio such as ringtones, images such as themes and wallpapers and even other applications such as games. The present invention allows rich advertising integration of new songs into a mobile application such as
media player 810 due to the speed, responsiveness and relevance of ad units locally stored on the mobile device. The disclosed implementations enable a user to interact seamlessly with their own music, and advertising for new music resulting in increased song purchasing due to an improved advertising experience. - Another example of a mobile application that implements the disclosed system and methods is mapping application that uses GPS or similar location-aware mobile applications. The application may send the mobile device location to the advertisement server which constructs a set of ad units based on the mobile device location. In this case, the ad units may represent points-of-interest and local advertising within a certain proximity of the user. The superset in this example may be constructed based on user data, and may represent some or all points of interest of the surrounding city or location. As the mobile device location changes within the proximity of the city or location, the mobile application may query the advertisement module for advertising data (e.g., advertisement content items) to be displayed and recommend points-of-interest to the user in a similar manner as
media player 810 for media content. The speed of presenting and integrating relevant advertising content into such a GPS application results in an improved advertising experience for the user. - The present disclosure describes how to implement a distributed advertising system where decisions on serving ad units may be made on a remote advertisement server, personal computer, or a mobile device. The present disclosure also describes how to implement localized ad units that may be used by the distributed advertising system. Together the advertising system and ad units allow for relevant advertising to be cached locally on mobile devices, thereby improving the experience and effectiveness of the advertising platform. The speed at which advertising maybe retrieved enable advertising to be integrated seamlessly into mobile applications without data network dependence or delays.

FIG. 10 is a flow diagram depicting anexample method 1000 for a mobile device according to one implementation. As one example,method 1000 may be performed, at least in part, by a mobile device such as previously describedmobile device 930. -
Operation 1010 comprises obtaining a plurality of advertisement content items at a mobile device via a communication network. An advertisement content item may refer to an electronic file or other suitable collection of information that may be presented via a computing device as a visual advertisement and/or an audio advertisement. As previously described, advertisement content may embody a number of forms. In at least some implementations, the mobile device (e.g., via an advertisement module) may obtain the plurality of advertisement content items from another computing device (e.g., an advertisement server or a personal computer associated with the mobile device) via a communication network (e.g., a WAN and/or a LAN). - As one example, the mobile device identifies attributes of media content stored at the storage device of the mobile device or accessed by the user via the mobile device, including audio content files (e.g., music), visual content files (e.g., videos, images, text documents, html, etc.), or executable files (e.g., applications, programs, etc.). The attributes of the media content may include, for example, identifiers of the media content, such as file names or other suitable metadata (e.g., artist name, album name, etc.).
- In at least some implementations, the mobile device may obtain the plurality of advertisement content items from a remote computing device (e.g., advertisement server or personal computer associated with the mobile device) by sending an advertisement request to the remote computing device via the communication network (e.g., WAN and/or LAN). As one example, the communication network is a local area network, and
operation 1010 comprises obtaining the plurality of advertisement content items at the mobile device from a personal computer associated with the mobile device via the local area network. As another example, the communication network is a wide area network, andoperation 1010 comprises obtaining the plurality of advertisement content items at the mobile device from an advertisement server. - The advertisement request may indicate the attributes of the media content. In at least some implementations, one or more of the plurality of advertisement content items may include advertisements for different media content than indicated by the identifiers of the media content stored at the storage device of the mobile device or accessed by the user via the mobile device.

Operation 1118 comprises sending the advertisement report that includes at least the advertisement activity information to a remote advertisement server via a wide area network. In at least some implementations, the computing device may aggregate advertisement activity information obtained from multiple advertisement reports received from the mobile device before sending the aggregated advertisement activity information to the advertisement server via the wide area network. As one example, the advertisement activity information may be utilized by the advertisement server for accounting or billing purposes with respect to paid advertising for the advertisement content items presented at the mobile device. - It should be understood that the embodiments or implementations described herein are illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds thereof are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims.
