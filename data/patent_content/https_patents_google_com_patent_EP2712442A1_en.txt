Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to recommending one or more applications for installation on a mobile computing device.
- Mobile computing devices may run a variety of software applications that extend existing device capabilities and that add new capabilities. Many types of applications are generally available, such as applications for information retrieval, communications and entertainment. Applications may be created by mobile device manufacturers and/or third parties (e.g., application developers), and may be pre-installed by the manufacturer, or may be downloaded and installed by device users.
- third parties e.g., application developers
- Users may discover new applications through an interface associated with an on-line application marketplace, by browsing a catalog of available applications. Additionally, information about new applications is generally available through advertising, industry reviews, "top 10" and “best” lists, and through word-of-mouth referrals.
- users may obtain, install, and use full versions of the applications, or user may access demonstration versions of the application that allow the user to try the application out with or without purchasing. Over time, users may keep applications, upgrade applications (e.g., from a demonstration version to a full version), and may delete applications that are no longer wanted.
- each time series includes a number of installs per time period for a predetermined number of time periods; the time period is one day and the predetermined number of time periods totals one week; processing the time series includes applying decay factors to modify impacts of time periods in calculating the score; the score is based on a second-order derivative of the time series; for each application, the score is based on a fractional installation volume of the application; the fractional installation volume is determined based on a total number of installations of all applications; the operations further include filtering applications from inclusion in the index of trending applications based on the metadata; filtering is executed prior to generating, processing and calculating for each application; the actions further include filtering applications from inclusion in the index of trending applications based on number of installs; an application is filtered when an associated number of installations is less than a threshold number of installations; filtering is executed prior to generating, processing and calculating for each application; the actions further include filtering applications from inclusion in the index of trending applications based on
- an application is filtered when a consecutive number of negative accelerations within the predetermined time period is greater than a threshold number of negative accelerations; an application is filtered when one or more negative accelerations occur within a specified sub-period of the predetermined time period; the actions are periodically executed to periodically update the index of trending applications; the installation data includes a number of installations, a number of uninstallations and a number of updates for each application.
- Implementations of the present disclosure assist users discover interesting applications that may otherwise be difficult to discover through searching, and can assist users with keeping track of what is going on in an application marketplace. Implementations further enable developers to better understand what kind of topics are trendy and generate high download volumes. Further, trending applications can be used as a signal in other products.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system that can execute
- FIG. 2 depicts an example mobile device for displaying a trending applications category.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system that includes example components for identifying trending applications.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process that can be executed in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for displaying trending applications.
- This specification describes systems and techniques for identifying trending applications within an application marketplace.
- users of computing devices e.g., mobile computing devices
- the users can find it cumbersome to search through the application marketplace to discover applications that are newly released and are relatively unknown, but are beginning to become more popular (i.e., trending applications).
- applications are identified as trending applications based on an acceleration of installations of the application and a volume of installations of the application.
- Acceleration can be defined as an increase or a decrease of a rate of change in the total number of installations of the application over a time period (e.g., each day).
- the total number of installations can be provided as the sum of the number of installations of the application and the number of updates of the application minus the number of uninstallations of the application.
- a positive acceleration indicates an increase in the rate of change of the number of installations of the application over the time period.
- a negative acceleration indicates a decrease in the rate of change of the number of installations of the application over the time period.
- the volume of installations of the application can be provided as a percentage of the number of installations of the application compared to the total number of installations of all applications within the application marketplace (e.g., a fractional volume).
- the fractional volume of the application is a percentage of a subset of the total application marketplace, for example, similar (or related) applications to the application or applications having the same category as the application.
- a trending score is generated for each application based on the acceleration and the fractional volume.
- the acceleration of the application is calculated for each day over a number of days (e.g. 7 days).
- a decay factor can be applied to the acceleration of each day. In some implementations, the decay factor increases the further the day is removed from the current day. As a result, less weight is associated with accelerations further in the past from the current day.
- the accelerations of each day are summed together to define a total acceleration of the application over the time period (e.g. 7 days).
- the trending score can be defined as the product of the total acceleration and the fractional volume.
- An index of trending applications is generated based on the trending scores of the applications.
- the applications can be ranked in the index of trending applications based on the respective trending scores. For example, the higher a trending score of an application, the higher it is ranked on the index.
- the index of trending applications can be stored in a database.
- the index of trending applications can be intermittently updated (e.g., every 6 hours, every day).
- the trending score of each application is compared to a threshold score. If the trending score is greater than or equal to the threshold score, the respective application is deemed to be a trending application and is included in the index of trending applications. If the trending score is less than the threshold score, the respective application is not deemed to be a trending application and is not included in the index of trending applications.
- a subset of applications can be filtered to remove the subset of applications from possible inclusion in the index of trending applications. Specifically, a trending score is not generated for such applications.
- the subset of applications can include applications, for example, having content such as adult content; applications having less than a minimum number of installs; applications having more than a maximum number of days of having a decreasing installation rate; and the like.
- such filtering can be executed prior to generating the index of trending applications.
- the applications can be filtered after generating the index of trending applications such that applications are removed from the index.

- the rate of change is the first order derivative of the time series.
- the total number of installations for the application over the time period can be determined based on the following relationship: where I, indicates the number of installations of the application for the time period (i); LI, indicates the number of uninstallations of the application for the time period (i); and Wi indicates the number of updates of the application for the time period (i).
- the time period (i) includes one day (i.e., 24 hours).
- a total number of installations is calculated for each of the 7 days to provide seven total number of installation values (i.e., ⁇ ,, NM , ... N I-6 ).

- the trending engine 306 can filter an application from consideration based on a number of ratings of the application and/or an average rating of the application. For example, if a number of ratings of the application is below a threshold number of ratings, the application is removed from consideration. As another example, if an average rating of the application is below a threshold average rating, , the application is removed from consideration.
- the trending engine 306 calculates the total acceleration (3TOTAL) for each of the remaining applications over the predetermined time period (e.g., 7 days). Specifically, the trending engine 306 calculates a summation of the each acceleration (e.g., each acceleration between consecutive days) over the predetermined time period (e.g., 7 days) to define a total acceleration of the application.
- a decay factor ( ⁇ ) can be provided to decrease the impact of time periods further back in time on the calculation of ⁇ .
- A can be set equal to one, such that the acceleration a, is not weighted, while AM to A I-Z include decreasing values that are less than one. In this manner, A, has the greatest impact and A I-Z has the least impact on the calculation of 3TOTAL-
- the trending engine 306 calculates the fractional volume (V F ) of each application as a percentage of the number of installations (N F ) of the application compared to the total number of installations (N T ) of all applications within the application marketplace (e.g., a fractional volume).

- the trending score for each application can be compared to a threshold trending score. If the trending score is greater than or equal to the threshold trending score, the trending engine 306 deems that the application is a trending application and the application is included in the index of trending applications. If the trending score is less than the threshold trending score, the trending engine 306 does not deem the application to be a trending application and the application is not included in the index of trending applications.
