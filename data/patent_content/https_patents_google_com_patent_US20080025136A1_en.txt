- the memory controller may provide sixteen row address bits and three bank address bits during a row (e.g. activate) operation, and provide eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column (e.g. read or write) operation.
- the individual DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack may require only fourteen row address bits and three bank address bits for a row operation, and eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column operation.
- the buffer chip 202 may receive two address bits more than are needed by each DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack.
- the buffer chip 202 may therefore use the two extra address bits from the memory controller during a column operation as are needed by each DRAM circuit 206 A-D in the stack.
- the buffer chip 202 may be designed to store the two extra address bits provided during a row operation and use the two stored address bits to select the correct DRAM circuits 206 A-D during the column operation.
- the mapping between a system address (e.g. address from the memory controller, including the chip select signal(s)) and a device address (e.g. the address, including the chip select signals, presented to DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack) may be performed by the buffer chip 202 in various manners.
- a lower order system row address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device row address and bank address inputs.
- the most significant row address bit(s) and, optionally, the most significant bank address bit(s) may be decoded to generate the chip signals from DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack during a row operation.
- the address bits used to generate the chip select signals during the row operation may also be stored in an internal lookup table by the buffer chip 202 for one or more clock cycles.
- the systems column address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device column address and bank address inputs, while the stored address bits may be decoded to generate the chip select signals.
- addresses may be mapped between four 512 Mb DRAM circuits 206 A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing the buffer chip 202 .
- There may be 15 row address bits from the system 204 , such that row address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 204 , such that bank address bits 0 through 1 are mapped directly to DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- the bank address bit 2 and the row address bit 14 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- Row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again used with bank address bit 2 to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- addresses may be mapped between four 1 Gb DRAM circuits 206 A-D that simulate a single 4 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing the buffer chip 202 .
- There may be 16 row address bits from the system 204 , such that row address bits 0 through 14 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 204 , such that bank address bits 0 through 3 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bits 14 and 15 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 206 A-D. Row address bits 14 and 15 may also be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index. During the column operation, the stored row address bits 14 and 15 may again be used to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- this mapping technique may optionally be used to ensure that there are no unnecessary combinational logic circuits in the critical timing path between the address input pins and address output pins of the buffer chip 202 .
- Such combinational logic circuits may instead be used to generate the individual chip select signals. This may therefore allow the capacitive loading on the address outputs of the buffer chip 202 to be much higher than the loading on the individual chip select signal outputs of the buffer chip 202 .
- the address mapping may be performed by the buffer chip 202 using some of the bank address signals from the memory controller to generate the individual chip select signals.
- the buffer chip 202 may store the higher order row address bits during a row operation using the bank address as the index, and then may use the stored address bits as part of the DRAM circuit bank address during a column operation.
- This address mapping technique may require an optional lookup table to be positioned in the critical timing path between the address inputs from the memory controller and the address outputs, to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack.
- addresses may be mapped between four 512 Mb DRAM circuits 206 A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM utilizing the buffer chip 202 .
- There may be 15 row address bits from the system 204 , where row address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 204 , such that bank address bit 0 is used as a DRAM circuit bank address bit for the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bit 14 may be used as an additional DRAM circuit bank address bit.
- the bank address bits 1 and 2 from the system may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again be used along with the bank address bit 0 from the system to form the DRAM circuit bank address.
- the column address from the memory controller may be mapped directly as the column address to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack. Specifically, this direct mapping may be performed since each of the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack, even if of the same width but different capacities (e.g. from 512 Mb to 4 Gb), may have the same page sizes.
- address A[ 10 ] may be used by the memory controller to enable or disable auto-precharge during a column operation. Therefore, the buffer chip 202 may forward A[ 10 ] from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack without any modifications during a column operation.
- the simulated DRAM circuit may be desirable to determine whether the simulated DRAM circuit behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification.
- a behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards and it may be desirable, in some embodiments, to exactly simulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM.
- the JEDEC standard defines control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals.
- the JEDEC specification for a DDR2 DRAM is known as JESD79-2B.
- the following algorithm may be used. Such algorithm checks, using a set of software verification tools for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as a desired standard or other design specification. This formal verification is quite feasible because the DRAM protocol described in a DRAM standard is typically limited to a few control signals (e.g. approximately 15 control signals in the case of the JEDEC DDR2 specification, for example).
- Examples of the aforementioned software verification tools include MAGELLAN supplied by SYNOPSYS, or other software verification tools, such as INCISIVE supplied by CADENCE, verification tools supplied JASPER, VERIX supplied by REAL INTENT, 0-IN supplied by MENTOR CORPORATION, and others. These software verification tools use written assertions that correspond to the rules established by the DRAM protocol and specification. These written assertions are further included in the code that forms the logic description for the buffer chip. By writing assertions that correspond to the desired behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit, a proof may be constructed that determines whether the desired design requirements are met. In this, one may test various embodiments for compliance with a standard, multiple standards, or other design specification.
- an assertion may be written that no two DRAM control signals are allowed to be issued to an address, control and clock bus at the same time.
- the aforementioned algorithm may allow a designer to prove that the simulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard or other design specification. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for buffer chips with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the interconnect between the buffer chips may be used and tested for compliance with the desired standard or other design specification.

- the high capacity DIMM 300 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1 and/or 2 A-F. Of course, however, the high capacity DIMM 300 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a high capacity DIMM 300 may be created utilizing buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 .
- a DIMM 300 may utilize a plurality of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 instead of individual DRAM circuits, thus increasing the capacity of the DIMM.
- the DIMM 300 may include a register 304 for address and operation control of each of the buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 . It should be noted that any desired number of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 may be utilized in conjunction with the DIMM 300 . Therefore, the configuration of the DIMM 300 , as shown, should not be construed as limiting in any way.
- the register 304 may be substituted with an AMB (not shown), in the context of an FB-DIMM.
- FIG. 4 shows a timing design 400 of a buffer chip that makes a buffered stack of DRAM circuits mimic longer CAS latency DRAM to a memory controller, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the design of the buffer chip may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-3 .
- the design of the buffer chip may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- any delay through a buffer chip may be made transparent to a memory controller of a host system (e.g. see the host system 204 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.) utilizing the buffer chip.
- the buffer chip may buffer a stack of DRAM circuits such that the buffered stack of DRAM circuits appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency.
- Such delay may be a result of the buffer chip being located electrically between the memory bus of the host system and the stacked DRAM circuits, since most or all of the signals that connect the memory bus to the DRAM circuits pass through the buffer chip. A finite amount of time may therefore be needed for these signals to traverse through the buffer chip.
- industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- DDR SDRAM register chips and advanced memory buffers
- Industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- Such industry standard protocols define the properties of a register chip and AMB but not the properties of the buffer chip 202 , etc. Thus, the signal delay through the buffer chip may violate the specifications of industry standard protocols.
- the buffer chip may provide a one-half clock cycle delay between the buffer chip receiving address and control signals from the memory controller (or optionally from a register chip, an AMB, etc.) and the address and control signals being valid at the inputs of the stacked DRAM circuits.
- the data signals may also have a one-half clock cycle delay in traversing the buffer chip, either from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits or from the DRAM circuits to the memory controller.
- the one-half clock cycle delay set forth above is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner whatsoever.
- a one clock cycle delay, a multiple clock cycle delay (or fraction thereof), and/or any other delay amount is incorporated, for that matter.
- the aforementioned delay may be coordinated among multiple signals such that different signals are subject to time-shifting with different relative directions/magnitudes, in an organized fashion.
- the cumulative delay through the buffer chip (e.g. the sum of a first delay 402 of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and a second delay 404 of the data signals through the buffer chip) is j clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency 408 of i+j clocks, where i is the native CAS latency of the DRAM circuits.

- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 6 (i.e. 4+2).
- FIG. 5 shows the write data timing 500 expected by a DRAM circuit in a buffered stack, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the write data timing 500 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-4 . Of course, however, the write data timing 500 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- Designing a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer chip 202 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.) so that a buffered stack appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency may, in some embodiments, create a problem with the timing of write operations.
- the DDR2 SDRAM protocol may specify that the write CAS latency is one less than the read CAS latency. Therefore, since the buffered stack appears as a DDR2 SDRAM with a read CAS latency of 6, the memory controller may use a write CAS latency of 5 (see 502 ) when scheduling a write operation to the buffered stack.
- the DRAM circuits may require a write CAS latency of 3 (see 504 ).
- the write data from the memory controller may arrive at the buffer chip later than when the DRAM circuits require the data.
- the buffer chip may delay such write operations to alleviate any of such timing problems. Such delay in write operations will be described in more detail with respect to FIG. 6 below.
- FIG. 6 shows write operations 600 delayed by a buffer chip, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the write operations 600 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-5 .
- the write operations 600 may be used in any desired environment.
- the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a buffer chip may provide an additional delay, over and beyond the delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip, between receiving the write operation and address from the memory controller (and/or optionally from a register and/or AMB, etc.), and sending it to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- the additional delay may be equal to j clocks, where j is the cumulative delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and the delay of the data signals through the buffer chip.
- the write address and operation may be delayed by a regular chip on a DIMM, by an AMB, or by the memory controller.
- FIG. 7 shows early write data 700 from an AMB, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the early write data 700 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-5 .
- the early write data 700 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- an AMB on an FB-DIMM may be designed to send write data earlier to buffered stacks instead of delaying the write address and operation, as described in reference to FIG. 6 .
- an early write latency 702 may be utilized to send the write data to the buffered stack.
- correct timing of the write operation at the inputs of the DRAM circuits in the stack may be ensured.
- a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer 202 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may have a cumulative latency of 2, in which case, the AMB may send the write date 2 clock cycles earlier to the buffered stack. It should be noted that this scheme may not be possible in the case of registered DIMMs since the memory controller sends the write data directly to the buffered stacks. As an option, a memory controller may be designed to send write data earlier so that write operations have the correct timing at the input of the DRAM circuits in the stack without requiring the buffer chip to delay the write address and operation.
- FIG. 8 shows address bus conflicts 800 caused by delayed write operations, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the delaying of the write addresses and operations may be performed by a buffer chip, or optionally a register, AMB, etc., in a manner that is completely transparent to the memory controller of a host system.
- the memory controller since the memory controller is unaware of this delay, it may schedule subsequent operations, such as for example activate or precharge operations, which may collide with the delayed writes on the address bus from the buffer chip to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- an activate operation 802 may interfere with a write operation 804 that has been delayed.
- a delay of activate operation may be employed, as will be described in further detail with respect to FIG. 9 .
- FIGS. 9A-B show variable delays 900 and 950 of operations through a buffer chip, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the variable delays 900 and 950 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-8 .
- the variable delays 900 and 950 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- either the write operation or the precharge/activate operation may be delayed.
- a buffer chip e.g. see the buffer chip 202 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.

- the memory controller may schedule a column operation to a bank 6 clock cycles after an activate (e.g. row) operation to the same bank.
- the DRAM circuits in the stack may actually have a tRCD of 4 clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay the activate operation by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack while still ensuring correct read and write timing on the channel between the memory controller and the buffered stack.
- the buffer chip may issue the activate operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the activate operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the activate operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of other DRAM operations that may conflict with the activate operation, and may optionally change from one activate operation to another.
- the buffered stack may appear to the memory controller as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with a tRP of 6 clock cycles, the memory controller may schedule a subsequent activate (e.g. row) operation to a bank a minimum of 6 clock cycles after issuing a precharge operation to that bank.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay issuing the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits in the stack by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- the buffer chip may still delay issuing a precharge operation in order to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the precharge operation to the same bank may be delayed by the buffer chip to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the buffer chip may issue the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the precharge operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the precharge operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of address bus conflicts or tRAS violations, and may change from one precharge operation to another.
- FIG. 10 shows a buffered stack 1000 of four 512 Mb DRAM circuits mapped to a single 2 Gb DRAM circuit, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the buffered stack 1000 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-9 .
- the buffered stack 1000 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- the multiple DRAM circuits 1002 A-D buffered in the stack by the buffer chip 1004 may appear as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit to the memory controller.
- the combined power dissipation of such DRAM circuits 1002 A-D may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic DRAM of the same capacity.
- the buffered stack may consist of four 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits that appear to the memory controller as a single 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit.
- the power dissipation of all four DRAM circuits 1002 A-D in the stack may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM.
- a DIMM containing multiple buffered stacks may dissipate much more power than a standard DIMM built using monolithic DRAM circuits. This increased power dissipation may limit the widespread adoption of DIMMs that use buffered stacks.
- the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D may be opportunistically placed in a precharge power down mode using the clock enable (CKE) pin of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D.
- CKE clock enable
- a single rank registered DIMM R-DIMM
- R-DIMM may contain a plurality of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 1002 A-D, where each stack consists of four x4 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits 1002 A-D and appears as a single x4 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit to the memory controller.
- a 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM may generally have eight banks as specified by JEDEC. Therefore, the buffer chip 1004 may map each 512 Mb DRAM circuit in the stack to two banks of the equivalent 2 Gb DRAM, as shown.
- the memory controller of the host system may open and close pages in the banks of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D based on the memory requests it receives from the rest of the system.
- no more than one page may be able to be open in a bank at any given time.
- a DRAM circuit 1002 A-D since each DRAM circuit 1002 A-D in the stack is mapped to two banks of the equivalent larger DRAM, at any given time a DRAM circuit 1002 A-D may have two open pages, one open page, or no open pages.
- the power management scheme may place that DRAM circuit 1002 A-D in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- the CKE inputs of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D in a stack may be controlled by the buffer chip 1004 , by a chip on an R-DIMM, by an AMB on a FB-DIMM, or by the memory controller in order to implement the power management scheme described hereinabove.
- this power management scheme may be particularly efficient when the memory controller implements a closed page policy.
- Another optional power management scheme may include mapping a plurality of DRAM circuits to a single bank of the larger capacity DRAM seen by the memory controller. For example, a buffered stack of sixteen x4 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may appear to the memory controller as a single x4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit. Since a 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit is specified by JEDEC to have eight banks, each bank of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be 512 Mb. Thus, two of the 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may be mapped by the buffer chip 1004 to a single bank of the equivalent 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit seen by the memory controller.
- bank 0 of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be mapped by the buffer chip to two 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits (e.g. DRAM A and DRAM B) in the stack.
- DRAM A and DRAM B 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits
- DRAM B may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- DRAM A may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- This technique may ensure that if p DRAM circuits are mapped to a bank of the larger capacity DRAM circuit seen by the memory controller, then p ⁇ 1 of the p DRAM circuits may continuously (e.g. always, etc.) be subjected to a power saving operation.
- the power saving operation may, for example, comprise operating in precharge power down mode except when refresh is required.
- power-savings may also occur in other embodiments without such continuity.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a method 1100 for refreshing a plurality of memory circuits, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the method 1100 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of any one or more of FIGS. 1-10 .
- the method 1100 may be carried out by the interface circuit 102 of FIG. 1 .
- the method 1100 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definition may apply during the present description.
- a refresh control signal is received in operation 1102 .
- such refresh control signal may, for example, be received from a memory controller, where such memory controller intends to refresh a simulated memory circuit(s).
- a plurality of refresh control signals are sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. see the memory circuits 104 A, 104 B, 104 N of FIG. 1 , etc.), at different times. See operation 1104 .
- Such refresh control signals may or may not each include the refresh control signal of operation 1102 or an instantiation/copy thereof.
- the refresh control signals may each include refresh control signals that are different in at least one aspect (e.g. format, content, etc.).
- At least one first refresh control signal may be sent to a first subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a first time and at least one second refresh control signal may be sent to a second subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a second time.
- a single refresh control signal may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. a group of memory circuits, etc.).
- a plurality of the refresh control signals may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits.
- refresh control signals may be sent individually or to groups of memory circuits, as desired.
- the refresh control signals may be sent after a delay in accordance with a particular timing.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to minimize a current draw. This may be accomplished in various embodiments by staggering a plurality of refresh control signals.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to comply with a tRFC parameter associated with each of the memory circuits.
- DRAM circuits of any desired size may receive periodic refresh operations to maintain the integrity of data therein.
- a memory controller may initiate refresh operations by issuing refresh control signals to the DRAM circuits with sufficient frequency to prevent any loss of data in the DRAM circuits.
- a refresh control signal is issued to a DRAM circuit, a minimum time (e.g. denoted by tRFC) may be required to elapse before another control signal may be issued to that DRAM circuit.
- the tRFC parameter may therefore increase as the size of the DRAM circuit increases.
- the buffer chip When the buffer chip receives a refresh control signal from the memory controller, it may refresh the smaller DRAM circuits within the span of time specified by the tRFC associated with the emulated DRAM circuit. Since the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits is larger than that of the smaller DRAM circuits, it may not be necessary to issue refresh control signals to all of the smaller DRAM circuits simultaneously. Refresh control signals may be issued separately to individual DRAM circuits or may be issued to groups of DRAM circuits, provided that the tRFC requirement of the smaller DRAM circuits is satisfied by the time the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits has elapsed. In use, the refreshes may be spaced to minimize the peak current draw of the combination buffer chip and DRAM circuit set during a refresh operation.
Abstract
Description
- The present invention relates to memory, and more particularly to multiple-memory circuit systems.
- The memory capacity requirements of computers in general, and servers in particular, are increasing rapidly due to various trends such as 64-bit processors and operating systems, multi-core processors, virtualization, etc. However, other industry trends such as higher memory bus speeds and small form factor machines, etc. are reducing the number of memory module slots in such systems. Thus, a need exists in the industry for large capacity memory circuits to be used in such systems.
- However, there is also an exponential relationship between a capacity of monolithic memory circuits and a price associated therewith. As a result, large capacity memory modules may be cost prohibitive. To this end, the use of multiple smaller capacity memory circuits is a cost-effective approach to increasing such memory capacity.
- A system and method are provided for use in the context of a plurality of memory circuits. In use, first information is received in association with a first operation to be performed on at least one of the memory circuits. At least a portion of the first information is stored. Still yet, second information is received in association with a second operation to be performed on at least one of the plurality of memory circuits. To this end, the second operation may be performed utilizing the stored portion of the first information in addition to the second information.

memory circuits interface circuit 102, andsystem 106 are shown to be separate parts, it is contemplated that any of such parts (or portions thereof) may or may not be integrated in any desired manner. In various embodiments, such optional integration may involve simply packaging such parts together (e.g. stacking the parts, etc.) and/or integrating them monolithically. Just by way of example, in various optional embodiments, one or more portions (or all, for that matter) of theinterface circuit 102 may or may not be packaged with one or more of thememory circuits memory circuit framework 100 will be set forth hereinafter during reference toFIGS. 2A-2E , and 3 et al. - In use, the
interface circuit 102 may be capable of various functionality, in the context of different embodiments. More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding such optional functionality which may or may not be implemented in the context ofsuch interface circuit 102, per the desires of the user. It should be strongly noted that the following information is set forth for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. For example, any of the following features may be optionally incorporated with or without the exclusion of other features described. - For instance, in one optional embodiment, the
interface circuit 102 interfaces a plurality ofsignals 108 that are communicated between thememory circuits system 106. As shown, such signals may, for example, include address/control/clock signals, etc. In one aspect of the present embodiment, the interfaced signals 108 may represent all of the signals that are communicated between thememory circuits system 106. In other aspects, at least a portion ofsignals 110 may travel directly between thememory circuits system 106 or component thereof [e.g. register, advanced memory buffer (AMB), memory controller, or any other component thereof, where the term component is defined hereinbelow]. In various embodiments, the number of the signals 108 (vs. a number of thesignals 110, etc.) may vary such that thesignals 108 are a majority or more (L>M), etc. - In yet another embodiment, the
interface circuit 102 may be operable to interface a first number ofmemory circuits system 106 for simulating at least one memory circuit of a second number. In the context of the present description, the simulation may refer to any simulating, emulating, disguising, transforming, converting, and/or the like that results in at least one aspect (e.g. a number in this embodiment, etc.) of thememory circuits system 106. In different embodiments, the simulation may be electrical in nature, logical in nature, protocol in nature, and/or performed in any other desired manner. For instance, in the context of electrical simulation, a number of pins, wires, signals, etc. may be simulated, while, in the context of logical simulation, a particular function may be simulated. In the context of protocol, a particular protocol (e.g. DDR3, etc.) may be simulated. - In still additional aspects of the present embodiment, the second number may be more or less than the first number. Still yet, in the latter case, the second number may be one, such that a single memory circuit is simulated. Different optional embodiments which may employ various aspects of the present embodiment will be set forth hereinafter during reference to
FIGS. 2A-2E , and 3 et al. - In still yet another embodiment, the
interface circuit 102 may be operable to interface thememory circuits system 106 for simulating at least one memory circuit with at least one aspect that is different from at least one aspect of at least one of the plurality of thememory circuits memory circuits - In the case of the signal, such signal may refer to a control signal (e.g. an address signal; a signal associated with an activate operation, precharge operation, write operation, read operation, a mode register write operation, a mode register read operation, a refresh operation; etc.), a data signal, a logical or physical signal, or any other signal for that matter. For instance, a number of the aforementioned signals may be simulated to appear as fewer or more signals, or even simulated to correspond to a different type. In still other embodiments, multiple signals may be combined to simulate another signal. Even still, a length of time in which a signal is asserted may be simulated to be different.
- In the case of protocol, such may, in one exemplary embodiment, refer to a particular standard protocol. For example, a number of
memory circuits memory circuits - In the case of capacity, such may refer to a memory capacity (which may or may not be a function of a number of the
memory circuits interface circuit 102 may be operable for simulating at least one memory circuit with a first memory capacity that is greater than (or less than) a second memory capacity of at least one of thememory circuits - In the case where the aspect is timing-related, the timing may possibly relate to a latency (e.g. time delay, etc.). In one aspect of the present embodiment, such latency may include a column address strobe (CAS) latency, which refers to a latency associated with accessing a column of data. Still yet, the latency may include a row address to column address latency (tRCD), which refers to a latency required between the row address strobe (RAS) and CAS. Even still, the latency may include a row precharge latency (tRP), which refers a latency required to terminate access to an open row, and open access to a next row. Further, the latency may include an activate to precharge latency (tRAS), which refers to a latency required to access a certain row of data between an activate operation and a precharge operation. In any case, the
interface circuit 102 may be operable for simulating at least one memory circuit with a first latency that is longer (or shorter) than a second latency of at least one of thememory circuits FIGS. 2A-2E , and 3 et al. - In still another embodiment, a component may be operable to receive a signal from the
system 106 and communicate the signal to at least one of thememory circuits memory circuits system 106 after a delay. - As an option, the delay may include a cumulative delay associated with any one or more of the aforementioned signals. Even still, the delay may result in a time shift of the signal forward and/or back in time (with respect to other signals). Of course, such forward and backward time shift may or may not be equal in magnitude. In one embodiment, this time shifting may be accomplished by utilizing a plurality of delay functions which each apply a different delay to a different signal. In still additional embodiments, the aforementioned shifting may be coordinated among multiple signals such that different signals are subject to shifts with different relative directions/magnitudes, in an organized fashion.
- Further, it should be noted that the aforementioned component may, but need not necessarily take the form of the
interface circuit 102 ofFIG. 1 . For example, the component may include a register, an AMB, a component positioned on at least one DIMM, a memory controller, etc. Such register may, in various embodiments, include a Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) register, a JEDEC register including one or more functions set forth herein, a register with forwarding, storing, and/or buffering capabilities, etc. Different optional embodiments which employ various features of the present embodiment will be set forth hereinafter during reference toFIGS. 4-7 , and 9A-B et al. - In a power-saving embodiment, at least one of a plurality of

memory circuit memory circuit - Similar to one or more of the previous embodiments, the present functionality or a portion thereof may be carried out utilizing any desired component. For example, such component may, but need not necessarily take the form of the
interface circuit 102 ofFIG. 1 . In other embodiments, the component may include a register, an AMB, a component positioned on at least one DIMM, a memory controller, etc. One optional embodiment which employs various features of the present embodiment will be set forth hereinafter during reference toFIG. 10 . - In still yet another embodiment, a plurality of the aforementioned components may serve, in combination, to interface the
memory circuits system 106. In various embodiments, two, three, four, or more components may accomplish this. Also, the different components may be relatively configured in any desired manner. For example, the components may be configured in parallel, serially, or a combination thereof. In addition, any number of the components may be allocated to any number of thememory circuits - Further, in the present embodiment, each of the plurality of components may be the same or different. Still yet, the components may share the same or similar interface tasks and/or perform different interface tasks. Such interface tasks may include, but are not limited to simulating one or more aspects of a memory circuit, performing a power savings/refresh operation, carrying out any one or more of the various functionalities set forth herein, and/or any other task relevant to the aforementioned interfacing.

FIG. 3 . - Additional illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional embodiments in which the foregoing techniques may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user.

FIG. 2F . Further, a technique is provided for refreshing a plurality of memory circuits, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. SeeFIG. 11 . - It should again be strongly noted that the following information is set forth for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. Any of the following features may be optionally incorporated with or without the exclusion of other features described.

FIGS. 2A-2E show various configurations of a buffered stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D with abuffer chip 202, in accordance with various embodiments. As an option, the various configurations to be described in the following embodiments may be implemented in the context of the architecture and/or environment ofFIG. 1 . Of course, however, they may also be carried out in any other desired environment (e.g. using other memory type, etc.). It should be also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - As shown in each of such figures, the
buffer chip 202 is placed electrically between anelectronic host system 204 and a stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. In the context of the present description, a stack may refer to any collection of memory circuits. Further, thebuffer chip 202 may include any device capable of buffering a stack of circuits (e.g. DRAM circuits 206A-D, etc.). Specifically, thebuffer chip 202 may be capable of buffering the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D to electrically and/or logically resemble at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit to thehost system 204. In this way, the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may appear as a smaller quantity of larger capacity DRAM circuits to thehost system 204. - For example, the stack of
DRAM circuits 206A-D may include eight 512 Mb DRAM circuits. Thus, thebuffer chip 202 may buffer the stack of eight 512 Mb DRAM circuits to resemble a single 4 Gb DRAM circuit to a memory controller (not shown) of the associatedhost system 204. In another example, thebuffer chip 202 may buffer the stack of eight 512 Mb DRAM circuits to resemble two 2 Gb DRAM circuits to a memory controller of an associatedhost system 204. - Further, the stack of
DRAM circuits 206A-D may include any number of DRAM circuits. Just by way of example, abuffer chip 202 may be connected to 2, 4, 8 ormore DRAM circuits 206A-D. Also, theDRAM circuits 206A-D may be arranged in a single stack, as shown inFIGS. 2A-2D . - The
DRAM circuits 206A-D may be arranged on a single side of thebuffer chip 202, as shown inFIGS. 2A-2D . Of course, however, theDRAM circuits 206A-D may be located on both sides of thebuffer chip 202 shown inFIG. 2E . Thus, for example, abuffer chip 202 may be connected to 16 DRAM circuits with 8 DRAM circuits on either side of thebuffer chip 202, where the 8 DRAM circuits on each side of thebuffer chip 202 are arranged in two stacks of four DRAM circuits. - The
buffer chip 202 may optionally be a part of the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. Of course, however, thebuffer chip 202 may also be separate from the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. In addition, thebuffer chip 202 may be physically located anywhere in the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D, wheresuch buffer chip 202 electrically sits between theelectronic host system 204 and the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. - In one embodiment, a memory bus (not shown) may connect to the
buffer chip 202, and thebuffer chip 202 may connect to each of theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. As shown inFIGS. 2A-2D , thebuffer chip 202 may be located at the bottom of the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D (e.g. the bottom-most device in the stack). As another option, and as shown inFIG. 2E , thebuffer chip 202 may be located in the middle of the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. As still yet another option, thebuffer chip 202 may be located at the top of the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D (e.g. the top-most device in the stack). Of course, however, thebuffer chip 202 may be located anywhere between the two extremities of the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D. - The electrical connections between the
buffer chip 202 and the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may be configured in any desired manner. In one optional embodiment, address, control (e.g. command, etc.), and clock signals may be common to allDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack (e.g. using one common bus). As another option, there may be multiple address, control and clock busses. As yet another option, there may be individual address, control and clock busses to eachDRAM circuits 206A-D. Similarly, data signals may be wired as one common bus, several busses or as an individual bus to eachDRAM circuits 206A-D. Of course, it should be noted that any combinations of such configurations may also be utilized. - For example, as shown in
FIG. 2A , the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may have one common address, control andclock bus 208 with individual data busses 210. In another example, as shown inFIG. 2B , the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may have two address, control and clock busses 208 along with two data busses 210. In still yet another example, as shown inFIG. 2C , the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may have one address, control andclock bus 208 together with two data busses 210. In addition, as shown inFIG. 2D , the stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may have one common address, control andclock bus 208 and onecommon data bus 210. It should be noted that any other permutations and combinations of such address, control, clock and data buses may be utilized. - These configurations may therefore allow for the
host system 204 to only be in contact with a load of thebuffer chip 202 on the memory bus. In this way, any electrical loading problems (e.g. bad signal integrity, improper signal timing, etc.) associated with the stackedDRAM circuits 206A-D may (but not necessarily) be prevented, in the context of various optional embodiments. -
FIG. 2F illustrates amethod 280 for storing at least a portion of information received in association with a first operation for use in performing a second operation, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. As an option, themethod 280 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and/or environment of any one or more ofFIGS. 1-2F . For example, themethod 280 may be carried out by theinterface circuit 102 ofFIG. 1 . Of course, however, themethod 280 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - In
operation 282, first information is received in association with a first operation to be performed on at least one of a plurality of memory circuits (e.g. see thememory circuits FIG. 1 , etc.). In various embodiments, such first information may or may not be received coincidently with the first operation, as long as it is associated in some capacity. Further, the first operation may, in one embodiment, include a row operation. In such embodiment, the first information may include address information (e.g. a set of address bits, etc.). - For reasons that will soon become apparent, at least a portion of the first information is stored. Note
operation 284. Still yet, inoperation 286, second information is received in association with a second operation. Similar to the first information, the second information may or may not be received coincidently with the second operation, and may include address information. Such second operation, however, may, in one embodiment, include a column operation. - To this end, the second operation may be performed utilizing the stored portion of the first information in addition to the second information. See
operation 288. More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional features with which the foregoingmethod 280 may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user. Specifically, an example will be set for illustrating the manner in which themethod 280 may be employed for accommodating a buffer chip that is simulating at least one aspect of a plurality of memory circuits. - In particular, the present example of the
method 280 ofFIG. 2F will be set forth in the context of the various components (e.g. buffer chip 202, etc.) shown in the embodiments ofFIGS. 2A-2E . It should be noted that, since the buffered stack ofDRAM circuits 206A-D may appear to the memory controller of thehost system 204 as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits, thebuffer chip 202 may receive more address bits from the memory controller than are required by theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. These extra address bits may be decoded by thebuffer chip 202 to individually select theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack, utilizing separate chip select signals to each of theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. - For example, a stack of four
x4 1Gb DRAM circuits 206A-D behind abuffer chip 202 may appear as asingle x4 4 Gb DRAM circuit to the memory controller. Thus, the memory controller may provide sixteen row address bits and three bank address bits during a row (e.g. activate) operation, and provide eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column (e.g. read or write) operation. However, theindividual DRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack may require only fourteen row address bits and three bank address bits for a row operation, and eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column operation. - As a result, during a row operation in the above example, the
buffer chip 202 may receive two address bits more than are needed by eachDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. Thebuffer chip 202 may therefore use the two extra address bits from the memory controller during a column operation as are needed by eachDRAM circuit 206A-D in the stack. - Thus, in order to select the
correct DRAM circuit 206A-D in the stack during a column operation, thebuffer chip 202 may be designed to store the two extra address bits provided during a row operation and use the two stored address bits to select thecorrect DRAM circuits 206A-D during the column operation. The mapping between a system address (e.g. address from the memory controller, including the chip select signal(s)) and a device address (e.g. the address, including the chip select signals, presented toDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack) may be performed by thebuffer chip 202 in various manners. - In one embodiment, a lower order system row address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device row address and bank address inputs. In addition, the most significant row address bit(s) and, optionally, the most significant bank address bit(s), may be decoded to generate the chip signals from
DRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack during a row operation. The address bits used to generate the chip select signals during the row operation may also be stored in an internal lookup table by thebuffer chip 202 for one or more clock cycles. During a column operation, the systems column address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device column address and bank address inputs, while the stored address bits may be decoded to generate the chip select signals. - For example, addresses may be mapped between four 512
Mb DRAM circuits 206A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing thebuffer chip 202. There may be 15 row address bits from thesystem 204, such thatrow address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to theDRAM circuits 206A-D. There may also be 3 bank address bits from thesystem 204, such thatbank address bits 0 through 1 are mapped directly toDRAM circuits 206A-D. - During a row operation, the
bank address bit 2 and the row address bit 14 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the fourDRAM circuits 206A-D. Row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index. In addition, during the column operation, the stored row address bit 14 may again used withbank address bit 2 to form the four DRAM chip select signals. - As another example, addresses may be mapped between four 1
Gb DRAM circuits 206A-D that simulate a single 4 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing thebuffer chip 202. There may be 16 row address bits from thesystem 204, such thatrow address bits 0 through 14 are mapped directly to theDRAM circuits 206A-D. There may also be 3 bank address bits from thesystem 204, such thatbank address bits 0 through 3 are mapped directly to theDRAM circuits 206A-D. - During a row operation, row address bits 14 and 15 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four
DRAM circuits 206A-D. Row address bits 14 and 15 may also be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index. During the column operation, the stored row address bits 14 and 15 may again be used to form the four DRAM chip select signals. - In various embodiments, this mapping technique may optionally be used to ensure that there are no unnecessary combinational logic circuits in the critical timing path between the address input pins and address output pins of the
buffer chip 202. Such combinational logic circuits may instead be used to generate the individual chip select signals. This may therefore allow the capacitive loading on the address outputs of thebuffer chip 202 to be much higher than the loading on the individual chip select signal outputs of thebuffer chip 202. - In another embodiment, the address mapping may be performed by the
buffer chip 202 using some of the bank address signals from the memory controller to generate the individual chip select signals. Thebuffer chip 202 may store the higher order row address bits during a row operation using the bank address as the index, and then may use the stored address bits as part of the DRAM circuit bank address during a column operation. This address mapping technique may require an optional lookup table to be positioned in the critical timing path between the address inputs from the memory controller and the address outputs, to theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. - For example, addresses may be mapped between four 512
Mb DRAM circuits 206A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM utilizing thebuffer chip 202. There may be 15 row address bits from thesystem 204, where row addressbits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to theDRAM circuits 206A-D. There may also be 3 bank address bits from thesystem 204, such thatbank address bit 0 is used as a DRAM circuit bank address bit for theDRAM circuits 206A-D. - In addition, row address bit 14 may be used as an additional DRAM circuit bank address bit. During a row operation, the
bank address bits DRAM circuits 206A-D. Further, row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation. During the column operation, the stored row address bit 14 may again be used along with the bank address bit 0 from the system to form the DRAM circuit bank address. - In both of the above described address mapping techniques, the column address from the memory controller may be mapped directly as the column address to the
DRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack. Specifically, this direct mapping may be performed since each of theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack, even if of the same width but different capacities (e.g. from 512 Mb to 4 Gb), may have the same page sizes. In an optional embodiment, address A[10] may be used by the memory controller to enable or disable auto-precharge during a column operation. Therefore, thebuffer chip 202 may forward A[10] from the memory controller to theDRAM circuits 206A-D in the stack without any modifications during a column operation. - In various embodiments, it may be desirable to determine whether the simulated DRAM circuit behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification. A behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards and it may be desirable, in some embodiments, to exactly simulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM. The JEDEC standard defines control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals. For example, the JEDEC specification for a DDR2 DRAM is known as JESD79-2B.
- If it is desired, for example, to determine whether a JEDEC standard is met, the following algorithm may be used. Such algorithm checks, using a set of software verification tools for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as a desired standard or other design specification. This formal verification is quite feasible because the DRAM protocol described in a DRAM standard is typically limited to a few control signals (e.g. approximately 15 control signals in the case of the JEDEC DDR2 specification, for example).
- Examples of the aforementioned software verification tools include MAGELLAN supplied by SYNOPSYS, or other software verification tools, such as INCISIVE supplied by CADENCE, verification tools supplied JASPER, VERIX supplied by REAL INTENT, 0-IN supplied by MENTOR CORPORATION, and others. These software verification tools use written assertions that correspond to the rules established by the DRAM protocol and specification. These written assertions are further included in the code that forms the logic description for the buffer chip. By writing assertions that correspond to the desired behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit, a proof may be constructed that determines whether the desired design requirements are met. In this, one may test various embodiments for compliance with a standard, multiple standards, or other design specification.
- For instance, an assertion may be written that no two DRAM control signals are allowed to be issued to an address, control and clock bus at the same time. Although one may know which of the various buffer chip/DRAM stack configurations and address mappings that have been described herein are suitable, the aforementioned algorithm may allow a designer to prove that the simulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard or other design specification. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for buffer chips with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the interconnect between the buffer chips may be used and tested for compliance with the desired standard or other design specification.

FIG. 3 shows ahigh capacity DRAM 300 using buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 302, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. As an option, thehigh capacity DIMM 300 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1 and/or 2A-F. Of course, however, thehigh capacity DIMM 300 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - As shown, a
high capacity DIMM 300 may be created utilizing buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 302. Thus, aDIMM 300 may utilize a plurality of buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 302 instead of individual DRAM circuits, thus increasing the capacity of the DIMM. In addition, theDIMM 300 may include aregister 304 for address and operation control of each of the buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 302. It should be noted that any desired number of buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 302 may be utilized in conjunction with theDIMM 300. Therefore, the configuration of theDIMM 300, as shown, should not be construed as limiting in any way. - In an additional unillustrated embodiment, the
register 304 may be substituted with an AMB (not shown), in the context of an FB-DIMM. -
FIG. 4 shows atiming design 400 of a buffer chip that makes a buffered stack of DRAM circuits mimic longer CAS latency DRAM to a memory controller, in accordance with another embodiment. As an option, the design of the buffer chip may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1-3 . Of course, however, the design of the buffer chip may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - In use, any delay through a buffer chip (e.g. see the
buffer 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may be made transparent to a memory controller of a host system (e.g. see thehost system 204 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) utilizing the buffer chip. In particular, the buffer chip may buffer a stack of DRAM circuits such that the buffered stack of DRAM circuits appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency. - Such delay may be a result of the buffer chip being located electrically between the memory bus of the host system and the stacked DRAM circuits, since most or all of the signals that connect the memory bus to the DRAM circuits pass through the buffer chip. A finite amount of time may therefore be needed for these signals to traverse through the buffer chip. With the exception of register chips and advanced memory buffers (AMB), industry standard protocols for memory [e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.] may not comprehend the buffer chip that sits between the memory bus and the DRAM. Industry standard protocols for memory [e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.] narrowly define the properties of chips that sit between host and memory circuits. Such industry standard protocols define the properties of a register chip and AMB but not the properties of the
buffer chip 202, etc. Thus, the signal delay through the buffer chip may violate the specifications of industry standard protocols. - In one embodiment, the buffer chip may provide a one-half clock cycle delay between the buffer chip receiving address and control signals from the memory controller (or optionally from a register chip, an AMB, etc.) and the address and control signals being valid at the inputs of the stacked DRAM circuits. Similarly, the data signals may also have a one-half clock cycle delay in traversing the buffer chip, either from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits or from the DRAM circuits to the memory controller. Of course, the one-half clock cycle delay set forth above is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner whatsoever. For example, other embodiments are contemplated where a one clock cycle delay, a multiple clock cycle delay (or fraction thereof), and/or any other delay amount is incorporated, for that matter. As mentioned earlier, in other embodiments, the aforementioned delay may be coordinated among multiple signals such that different signals are subject to time-shifting with different relative directions/magnitudes, in an organized fashion.
- As shown in
FIG. 4 , the cumulative delay through the buffer chip (e.g. the sum of afirst delay 402 of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and asecond delay 404 of the data signals through the buffer chip) is j clock cycles. Thus, the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with aCAS latency 408 of i+j clocks, where i is the native CAS latency of the DRAM circuits. - In one example, if the DRAM circuits in the stack have a native CAS latency of 4 and the address and control signals along with the data signals experience a one-half clock cycle delay through the buffer chip, then the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 5 (i.e. 4+1). In another example, if the address and control signals along with the data signals experience a 1 clock cycle delay through the buffer chip, then the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 6 (i.e. 4+2).

FIG. 5 shows thewrite data timing 500 expected by a DRAM circuit in a buffered stack, in accordance with yet another embodiment. As an option, thewrite data timing 500 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1-4 . Of course, however, thewrite data timing 500 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - Designing a buffer chip (e.g. see the
buffer chip 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) so that a buffered stack appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency may, in some embodiments, create a problem with the timing of write operations. For example, with respect to a buffered stack of DDR2 SDRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 4 that appear as a single larger DDR2 SDRAM with a CAS latency of 6 to the memory controller, the DDR2 SDRAM protocol may specify that the write CAS latency is one less than the read CAS latency. Therefore, since the buffered stack appears as a DDR2 SDRAM with a read CAS latency of 6, the memory controller may use a write CAS latency of 5 (see 502) when scheduling a write operation to the buffered stack. - However, since the native read CAS latency of the DRAM circuits is 4, the DRAM circuits may require a write CAS latency of 3 (see 504). As a result, the write data from the memory controller may arrive at the buffer chip later than when the DRAM circuits require the data. Thus, the buffer chip may delay such write operations to alleviate any of such timing problems. Such delay in write operations will be described in more detail with respect to
FIG. 6 below. -
FIG. 6 shows writeoperations 600 delayed by a buffer chip, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. As an option, thewrite operations 600 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1-5 . Of course, however, thewrite operations 600 may be used in any desired environment. Again, it should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - In order to be compliant with the protocol utilized by the DRAM circuits in the stack, a buffer chip (e.g. see the
buffer chip 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may provide an additional delay, over and beyond the delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip, between receiving the write operation and address from the memory controller (and/or optionally from a register and/or AMB, etc.), and sending it to the DRAM circuits in the stack. The additional delay may be equal to j clocks, where j is the cumulative delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and the delay of the data signals through the buffer chip. As another option, the write address and operation may be delayed by a regular chip on a DIMM, by an AMB, or by the memory controller. -
FIG. 7 shows early writedata 700 from an AMB, in accordance with another embodiment. As an option, theearly write data 700 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1-5 . Of course, however, theearly write data 700 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - As shown, an AMB on an FB-DIMM may be designed to send write data earlier to buffered stacks instead of delaying the write address and operation, as described in reference to
FIG. 6 . Specifically, anearly write latency 702 may be utilized to send the write data to the buffered stack. Thus, correct timing of the write operation at the inputs of the DRAM circuits in the stack may be ensured. - For example, a buffer chip (e.g. see the
buffer 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may have a cumulative latency of 2, in which case, the AMB may send thewrite date 2 clock cycles earlier to the buffered stack. It should be noted that this scheme may not be possible in the case of registered DIMMs since the memory controller sends the write data directly to the buffered stacks. As an option, a memory controller may be designed to send write data earlier so that write operations have the correct timing at the input of the DRAM circuits in the stack without requiring the buffer chip to delay the write address and operation. -
FIG. 8 showsaddress bus conflicts 800 caused by delayed write operations, in accordance with yet another embodiment. As mentioned earlier, the delaying of the write addresses and operations may be performed by a buffer chip, or optionally a register, AMB, etc., in a manner that is completely transparent to the memory controller of a host system. However, since the memory controller is unaware of this delay, it may schedule subsequent operations, such as for example activate or precharge operations, which may collide with the delayed writes on the address bus from the buffer chip to the DRAM circuits in the stack. As shown, an activateoperation 802 may interfere with awrite operation 804 that has been delayed. Thus, a delay of activate operation may be employed, as will be described in further detail with respect toFIG. 9 . -
FIGS. 9A-B show variable delays 900 and 950 of operations through a buffer chip, in accordance with another embodiment. As an option, thevariable delays FIGS. 1-8 . Of course, however, thevariable delays - In order to prevent conflicts on an address bus between the buffer chip and its associated stack(s), either the write operation or the precharge/activate operation may be delayed. As shown, a buffer chip (e.g. see the
buffer chip 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may delay the precharge/activateoperations 952A-C/902A-C. In particular, the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits that have longer tRCD (RAS to CAS delay) and tRP (i.e. precharge time) parameters. - For example, if the cumulative latency through a buffer chip is 2 clock cycles while the native read CAS latency of the DRAM circuits is 4 clock cycles, then in order to hide the delay of the address/control signals and the data signals through the buffer chip, the buffered stack may appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits with a read CAS latency of 6 clock cycles to the memory controller. In addition, if the tRCD and tRP of the DRAM circuits is 4 clock cycles each, the buffered stack may appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits with tRCD of 6 clock cycles and tRP of 6 clock cycles in order to allow a buffer chip (e.g., see the
buffer chip 202 ofFIGS. 2A-E , etc.) to delay the activate and precharge operations in a manner that is transparent to the memory controller. Specifically, a buffered stack that uses 4-4-4 DRAM circuits (i.e. CAS latency=4, tRCD=4, tRP=4) may appear as one or at least one larger capacity DRAM circuits with 6-6-6 timing (i.e. CAS latency=6, tRCD=6, tRP=6). - Since the buffered stack appears to the memory controller as having a tRCD of 6 clock cycles, the memory controller may schedule a column operation to a
bank 6 clock cycles after an activate (e.g. row) operation to the same bank. However, the DRAM circuits in the stack may actually have a tRCD of 4 clock cycles. Thus, the buffer chip may have the ability to delay the activate operation by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack while still ensuring correct read and write timing on the channel between the memory controller and the buffered stack. - As shown, the buffer chip may issue the activate operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the activate operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB. The actual delay of the activate operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of other DRAM operations that may conflict with the activate operation, and may optionally change from one activate operation to another.
- Similarly, since the buffered stack may appear to the memory controller as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with a tRP of 6 clock cycles, the memory controller may schedule a subsequent activate (e.g. row) operation to a bank a minimum of 6 clock cycles after issuing a precharge operation to that bank. However, since the DRAM circuits in the stack actually have a tRP of 4 clock cycles, the buffer chip may have the ability to delay issuing the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits in the stack by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack. In addition, even if there are no conflicts on the address bus, the buffer chip may still delay issuing a precharge operation in order to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- In particular, if the activate operation to a bank was delayed to avoid an address bus conflict, then the precharge operation to the same bank may be delayed by the buffer chip to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits. The buffer chip may issue the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the precharge operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB. The actual delay of the precharge operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of address bus conflicts or tRAS violations, and may change from one precharge operation to another.

FIG. 10 shows abuffered stack 1000 of four 512 Mb DRAM circuits mapped to a single 2 Gb DRAM circuit, in accordance with yet another embodiment. As an option, the bufferedstack 1000 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment ofFIGS. 1-9 . Of course, however, the bufferedstack 1000 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description. - The
multiple DRAM circuits 1002A-D buffered in the stack by thebuffer chip 1004 may appear as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit to the memory controller. However, the combined power dissipation ofsuch DRAM circuits 1002A-D may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic DRAM of the same capacity. For example, the buffered stack may consist of four 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits that appear to the memory controller as a single 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit. - The power dissipation of all four
DRAM circuits 1002A-D in the stack may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM. As a result, a DIMM containing multiple buffered stacks may dissipate much more power than a standard DIMM built using monolithic DRAM circuits. This increased power dissipation may limit the widespread adoption of DIMMs that use buffered stacks. - Thus, a power management technique that reduces the power dissipation of DIMMs that contain buffered stacks of DRAM circuits may be utilized. Specifically, the
DRAM circuits 1002A-D may be opportunistically placed in a precharge power down mode using the clock enable (CKE) pin of theDRAM circuits 1002A-D. For example a single rank registered DIMM (R-DIMM) may contain a plurality of buffered stacks ofDRAM circuits 1002A-D, where each stack consists of four x4 512 MbDDR2 SDRAM circuits 1002A-D and appears as asingle x4 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit to the memory controller. A 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM may generally have eight banks as specified by JEDEC. Therefore, thebuffer chip 1004 may map each 512 Mb DRAM circuit in the stack to two banks of the equivalent 2 Gb DRAM, as shown. - The memory controller of the host system may open and close pages in the banks of the
DRAM circuits 1002A-D based on the memory requests it receives from the rest of the system. In various embodiments, no more than one page may be able to be open in a bank at any given time. For example, with respect toFIG. 10 , since eachDRAM circuit 1002A-D in the stack is mapped to two banks of the equivalent larger DRAM, at any given time aDRAM circuit 1002A-D may have two open pages, one open page, or no open pages. When aDRAM circuit 1002A-D has no open pages, the power management scheme may place thatDRAM circuit 1002A-D in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input. - The CKE inputs of the
DRAM circuits 1002A-D in a stack may be controlled by thebuffer chip 1004, by a chip on an R-DIMM, by an AMB on a FB-DIMM, or by the memory controller in order to implement the power management scheme described hereinabove. In one embodiment, this power management scheme may be particularly efficient when the memory controller implements a closed page policy. - Another optional power management scheme may include mapping a plurality of DRAM circuits to a single bank of the larger capacity DRAM seen by the memory controller. For example, a buffered stack of sixteen x4 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may appear to the memory controller as a single x4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit. Since a 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit is specified by JEDEC to have eight banks, each bank of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be 512 Mb. Thus, two of the 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may be mapped by the
buffer chip 1004 to a single bank of the equivalent 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit seen by the memory controller. - In this way,
bank 0 of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be mapped by the buffer chip to two 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits (e.g. DRAM A and DRAM B) in the stack. However, since only one page can be open in a bank at any given time, only one of DRAM A or DRAM B may be in the active state at any given time. If the memory controller opens a page in DRAM A, then DRAM B may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input. As another option, if the memory controller opens a page in DRAM B, DRAM A may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input. This technique may ensure that if p DRAM circuits are mapped to a bank of the larger capacity DRAM circuit seen by the memory controller, then p−1 of the p DRAM circuits may continuously (e.g. always, etc.) be subjected to a power saving operation. The power saving operation may, for example, comprise operating in precharge power down mode except when refresh is required. Of course, power-savings may also occur in other embodiments without such continuity. -
FIG. 11 illustrates amethod 1100 for refreshing a plurality of memory circuits, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. As an option, themethod 1100 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of any one or more ofFIGS. 1-10 . For example, themethod 1100 may be carried out by theinterface circuit 102 ofFIG. 1 . Of course, however, themethod 1100 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definition may apply during the present description. - As shown, a refresh control signal is received in
operation 1102. In one optional embodiment, such refresh control signal may, for example, be received from a memory controller, where such memory controller intends to refresh a simulated memory circuit(s). - In response to the receipt of such refresh control signal, a plurality of refresh control signals are sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. see the
memory circuits FIG. 1 , etc.), at different times. Seeoperation 1104. Such refresh control signals may or may not each include the refresh control signal ofoperation 1102 or an instantiation/copy thereof. Of course, in other embodiments, the refresh control signals may each include refresh control signals that are different in at least one aspect (e.g. format, content, etc.). - During use of still additional embodiments, at least one first refresh control signal may be sent to a first subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a first time and at least one second refresh control signal may be sent to a second subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a second time. Thus, in some embodiments, a single refresh control signal may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. a group of memory circuits, etc.). Further, a plurality of the refresh control signals may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits. To this end, refresh control signals may be sent individually or to groups of memory circuits, as desired.
- Thus, in still yet additional embodiments, the refresh control signals may be sent after a delay in accordance with a particular timing. In one embodiment, for example, the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to minimize a current draw. This may be accomplished in various embodiments by staggering a plurality of refresh control signals. In still other embodiments, the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to comply with a tRFC parameter associated with each of the memory circuits.
- To this end, in the context of an example involving a plurality of DRAM circuits (e.g. see the embodiments of
FIGS. 1-2E , etc.), DRAM circuits of any desired size may receive periodic refresh operations to maintain the integrity of data therein. A memory controller may initiate refresh operations by issuing refresh control signals to the DRAM circuits with sufficient frequency to prevent any loss of data in the DRAM circuits. After a refresh control signal is issued to a DRAM circuit, a minimum time (e.g. denoted by tRFC) may be required to elapse before another control signal may be issued to that DRAM circuit. The tRFC parameter may therefore increase as the size of the DRAM circuit increases. - When the buffer chip receives a refresh control signal from the memory controller, it may refresh the smaller DRAM circuits within the span of time specified by the tRFC associated with the emulated DRAM circuit. Since the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits is larger than that of the smaller DRAM circuits, it may not be necessary to issue refresh control signals to all of the smaller DRAM circuits simultaneously. Refresh control signals may be issued separately to individual DRAM circuits or may be issued to groups of DRAM circuits, provided that the tRFC requirement of the smaller DRAM circuits is satisfied by the time the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits has elapsed. In use, the refreshes may be spaced to minimize the peak current draw of the combination buffer chip and DRAM circuit set during a refresh operation.
- While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. For example, any of the network elements may employ any of the desired functionality set forth hereinabove. Then, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.
