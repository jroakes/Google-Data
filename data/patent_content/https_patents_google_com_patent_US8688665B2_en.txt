- Some challenges to performing timely transformations include: discovery and management of information about the capabilities of various devices within the home media network, communication of the location and the availability of source content; and the availability and performance of devices for transforming the media into the desired form.
- the term “served” refers to content that has been played back, i.e., displayed or otherwise presented by a device or content that is transferred between devices. For example, if an entertainment center has played an audio file, the entertainment center has “served” the audio file content. Similarly, if a High Definition Television (HDTV) connected to a set top box has displayed an audio/video presentation, the HDTV and/or the set top box “served” the content.
- HDMI High Definition Television
- the term “served” is not restricted to content that is consumed by a user, but can describe content that is served by a first device to a second device for storage, transcoding, analysis, or display.
- the user may or may not actually consume the served content.
- a home security camera may serve content to a home gateway for archiving. The user may not view the majority of the audio/video content produced by the home security camera and stored on the home gateway.
- a first device may “serve” content by communicating content to a second device which forwards the content to a third device.
- FIG. 1 is an illustrative diagram of a home media network formed among devices belonging to a given user and accessible through local and group associations.
- the home media network illustrated in FIG. 1 is comprised of a number of electronic devices that act as intelligent distributed agents.
- the network is comprised of: a home gateway ( 140 ), a mobile phone ( 110 ), a mobile computing device ( 115 ), a Bluetooth transponder ( 125 ), a Bluetooth enabled headset ( 120 ), and a security camera ( 105 ).
- These electronic devices are operated in the context of a single residence ( 130 ).
- the electronic devices communicate with each other to form a home media or peer-to-peer network.
- the electronic devices may communicate using a variety of methods including both wired and wireless protocols.
- the home media network that results can share content and leverage other capabilities available through the various devices on the network.
- the security camera ( 105 ) may record a video sequence of the perimeter of the house, which it sends to the home gateway ( 140 ) for archiving.
- the house owner is on vacation, but has the mobile phone ( 110 ). If the home owner desires to view the video sequence recorded by the security camera ( 105 ), the home owner can request the archive footage from the home gateway ( 140 ). This video sequence is then transcoded into a video format compatible with the mobile phone ( 110 ) and transmitted to the mobile phone ( 110 ) for viewing by the home owner.
- the owner uses the mobile phone ( 110 ) to take pictures, record music, and make video sequences. When the owner returns home, the owner may want to share his vacation experience with a friend.
- the owner can use the mobile computing device ( 115 ) to request and display portions of the data stored on his mobile phone ( 110 ). If desired, portions of the data can be passed to the Bluetooth transponder ( 125 ) in the car.
- the Bluetooth transponder ( 125 ) may play audio portions of the data over the car's audio system and video portions over the car's built-in entertainment system. If desired, audio data can also be sent to the Bluetooth enabled headset ( 120 ).
- the devices shown in FIG. 1 are merely representative elements in a home media network.
- a variety of other devices with varying levels of computational and communication capacity may be included in the network.
- television sets, desktop computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants, mobile computing devices, printers, cameras, camcorders, gaming systems, and entertainment systems could all be included in the home media network.
- the home media network may be extended through a variety of local and neighbor group associations.
- the devices associated with a neighboring residence could be accessible, subject to desired privacy restrictions, through an extended home media network.
- FIG. 2 is an illustrative chart showing various collaborative dialogue levels within a home media network.
- the collaborative dialogue may include requests for content, requests for transcoding a piece of content from a first data format into a second data format, discovering transcoding capabilities of various devices that make up the network, and updating shared content histories of various devices within the network.
- These collaborative exchanges allow for media content to be more effectively delivered through a variety of network elements and provide more flexibility for the owner to playback the content at a desired time, place, and format.
- dialogs may have varying levels of priority.
- the network and network elements assign a high priority to this task so that the content is delivered to the owner in a timely fashion.
- the transcoding request take a high priority.
- the shared content history is a record of where content is located on the network and where and with what device content has been selected for playback by the user.
- the shared content history provides a method for communicating the availability and format of content distributed throughout the network.
- a display device receiving a request may not have the desired content stored locally.
- the display device may use a shared content history to ascertain which device within the network has the requested content and then download and display the requested content from the identified device.
- the content may not always be in a format compatible with the display device.
- the display device can request that another device transcode the requested content into the required format.
- peer devices within the home media network contain a collaborative transcoding engine which supervises the dialogue layers, manages the information obtained through the dialogue, responds to content requests, and takes advantage of unused processor power/bandwidth to proactively transcode content.
- a collaborative transcoding engine which supervises the dialogue layers, manages the information obtained through the dialogue, responds to content requests, and takes advantage of unused processor power/bandwidth to proactively transcode content.
- One or more of these collaborative dialogue layers can occur at any given time and may occur in any sequence.
- the collaborative dialogue types shown in FIG. 2 are only illustrative examples of the types of communications which could be implemented in a collaborative transcoding environment.
- FIG. 3 is an illustrative diagram of peer devices discovering each other and sharing information about their respective native formats and transcoding capabilities.
- a home gateway ( 140 ) is in communication with a mobile phone ( 110 ).
- the two devices exchange identifying information, such as a device name and the native format or formats of media content that can be played back by the device.
- the two devices also exchange information identifying the ability to transcode data from one format to another.
- a Set Top Box (STB) is used to implement home gateway functionality.
- STB and home gateway are separate devices.
- IPTV Internet Protocol TeleVision
- the home gateway ( 140 ) may transmit information that is listed in the illustration within a first box ( 300 ).
- the information identifies the home gateway ( 140 ) as “Home Gateway STB1” and having a native format of “MPEG2.”
- the home gateway ( 140 ) then identifies its capabilities to transform various data formats by identifying a source format, a target format, and an efficiency score.
- the source format is the original format of the data and the target format is the new format after transcoding.
- the home gateway ( 140 ) reports that it can transcode MPEG2 audio/video data into an MPEG4 data format with an efficiency score of 92.
- the efficiency score is used to compare various devices on the network which are capable of performing the same transcoding operation and to select the device which is more efficient in making the conversion.
- the efficiency score may be a combination of a variety of characteristics of a device, including, but not limited to, computational power and encoding capability.
- the efficiency score may be a static number or may reflect the dynamic condition of the device. For example, a static number could be assigned to a device based on the central processing unit (CPU), amount of random access memory (RAM), software used in the transcoding, hardware acceleration, etc.
- the efficiency score may be dynamically calculated to account for various conditions within the device and the network. For example, if a home gateway ( 140 ) is currently downloading and recording two programs, it may not have a large amount of excess CPU or RAM capacity to use in the transcoding process.
- the dynamic efficiency score of the home gateway would be lower due to lack of available capacity.
- the transcoding could then be performed on another device with a higher dynamic efficiency score and more available capacity.
- the workload can be more efficiently balanced and executed.
- the efficiency score is only one example of a transcoding score that could be used to discriminate between two or more devices that can each be selected to perform a desired transcoding.
- a quality score could be used.
- the quality score may measure the quality of the transcoding in a number of ways. For example, the quality may be measured by quantifying the number of dropped frames in a video sequence; the peak signal-to-noise ratio; the number of artifacts; calculating the total amount of compression; considering the algorithm/hardware used to perform the calculation, or considering a variety of other factors.
- the home gateway ( 140 ) has an efficiency score of 92 for transcoding of MPEG2 data into MPEG4 data, but only an efficiency of 25 for transcoding from MPEG4 data into MPEG2 data.
- This discrepancy in efficiency scores may result from a variety of factors.
- the home gateway ( 140 ) may use dedicated hardware to perform the MPEG2 to MPEG4 transcoding while the MPEG4 to MPEG2 transcoding may be performed solely in software.
- a variety of other factors may contribute to differences in efficiency scores including the transcoding and encoding algorithms.
- the mobile device ( 110 ) may similarly transmit its identifying information and communicate its native format.
- the mobile device ( 110 ) may use a Windows Mobile® operating system and support a variety of data transcoding including conversion of MPEG2 data into Windows Media version 9 (WMV9) data format.
- WMV9 Windows Media version 9
- the mobile device ( 110 ) has its highest efficiency in this transcoding, possibly because the operation system is optimized for this conversion.
- FIG. 4 is an illustrative diagram of a shared content history ( 400 ) showing the various content items that devices within the home media network rendered and/or served. To create a shared content history ( 400 ), devices dialog about what content they have served or transcoded.
- the shared content history ( 400 ) includes the content that various devices within the network have transcoded.
- a set top box “STB1” has transcoded content identified as “World Series 2009 Highlights” into an MPEG4 format. Additional information, such as a time stamp, can also be provided to uniquely identify the content.
- Various instances of content served by devices within the network can also be included in the shared content history. For example, following the transcoding by the set top box “STB1” of “World Series 2009 Highlights” the content was served by the set top box later the same day as shown by the associated time stamp “11/20/09 23:45:45.”
- a shared content history ( 400 ) is maintained separately by each of the devices and may not be identical to the shared content history of another device.
- the shared content history ( 400 ) can serve as an index from which the storage location and format of content can be ascertained by a device which has received a content request. Additionally, the shared content history ( 400 ) can be analyzed to acquire knowledge of supply and demand for content in various formats.
- FIG. 5 is an illustrative flowchart of a method for fulfilling a content request.
- device A receives or generates a request for content X in format Q (step 500 ).
- Device A determines if content X in format Q is available from locally stored content (determination 505 ). If content X in format Q is locally available, the request is served by Device A from the locally stored data (step 510 ).
- Device A determines if it can transcode locally stored content X into format Q (determination 515 ). If Device A has the content in another format stored locally and the required transcoding capability it transcodes the locally stored content X into format Q and serves the request (step 520 ).
- Device A determines if there is a device listed in the local shared content history with content X in format Q (determination 525 ). If there is, Device A requests a copy of content X in format Q from that device (step 530 ).
- Device A searches the shared content list for content X in any format (determination 535 ). If content X is discovered in an alternative format, Device A then requests a copy from the identified device (step 540 ). Device A then searches the known transcoding capabilities of devices within the network to identify the most capable/efficient device to transcode content X into format Q (step 550 ). Device A then makes a request for the transcoding and serves the original request for content X in format Q (step 555 ).
- Device A determines if there are any devices within the home network that know of any other device with content X (determination 545 ). If a device is identified, Device A requests a copy of content X from the identified device (step 540 ). If the received content X is in format Q, Device A servers the request. If the received content X is in another format, Device A identifies a transcoding device, makes a request to the transcoding device for transcoding of the content into format Q (step 550 ), and serves the request (step 555 ).
- FIG. 6 is an illustrative flowchart of a method for proactive content transcoding and storage.
- Proactive content transcoding and storage is a method for anticipating a future request and preparing the content in advance. For example, a user may work every night until 10 pm. When the user arrives home, the user requests that the kitchen laptop display the nightly program of a popular television series which was broadcast at 8 pm. Without proactive transcoding and storage the user must wait while the laptop queries devices within the home network to determine the location of the content, transcode the content into a format compatible with the laptop, and transfer the content to the laptop. However, if a proactive transcoding and storage method is in place, one or more devices within the home network may have anticipated the request and taken steps to fulfill the request before the request is actually made.
- Device A monitors the shared content history for trends in content utilization (step 600 ).
- the monitored trends may include a pattern of requests for particular content and/or playback of content at a particular time or in a particular location.
- Device A determines if the observed demand (as captured by the shared content history) for a given content item C in format F exceeds a threshold (determination 605 ).
- This threshold may be any combination of a number of factors. By way of example and not limitation, this threshold could be the number of times a request has been made for particular type or class of content to be transcoded or played back.
- the threshold or other prediction of future demand may be calculated using a variety of probabilistic models.
- Device A continues monitoring the shared content history. If the demand does exceed the threshold, Device A determines if it has the desired content C in a different format which Device A can transcode into format F (step 610 ). If Device A does not, Device A locates the content and finds a device capable of transcoding the content into format F (step 615 ). By way of example and not limitation, this step can be performed by following steps similar to those described with respect to FIG. 5 .
- Device A predicts when the next demand for the content C in format F will occur among peer devices (step 620 ). Device A then balances its current priorities and resources to determine if it would be advantageous for it to transcode the content (determination 625 ). If it would be advantageous, Device A transcodes the content C into format F and stores the content. If Device A determines that it has higher priorities, it can request that an alternative device transcode and store the content (step 630 ). For example, if Device A is a set top box, it may be recording a show when it determines that a future demand for content C in format F is likely to occur. Device A would then make an evaluation of its current excess capabilities to see if it would be more effective for Device A to transcode and store the content or if it should request assistance from an alternative device.
- a collaborative transcoding engine could be used to implement the transcoding methodology described above.
- the collaborative transcoding engine could be resident on one or more of the devices within the home media network. Less capable devices, such as devices intended primarily for presentation of content may not have the capability to efficiently host the collaborative transcoding engine. However, the users of an overall home media network could still gain significant benefits from the operation of the more capable devices which collaborate via the collaborative transcoding engine.
- the home media network collaboration described above increases the availability of content in the desired formats while efficiently utilizing the device and network resources in a home media network.
- the proactive sharing of information between devices allows for superior content location and access to efficient transcoding capabilities. Future requests can be anticipated using probabilistic models of when demand is likely to occur.
