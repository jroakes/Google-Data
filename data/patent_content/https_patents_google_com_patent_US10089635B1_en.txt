A method includes identifying view data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign; identifying a plurality of segments of the view data where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria; and providing data that cause presentation of a report interface that includes a segmentation control, a view data graph, and a video content item list.
Description
This specification relates to video content.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for presenting view data. The method comprises: identifying view data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign; identifying a plurality of segments of the view data where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria; and providing data that cause presentation of a report interface that includes a segmentation control, a view data graph, and a video content item list, where the segmentation control includes a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments, the view data graph includes a presentation of a summary of the view data for one or more video content items in the campaign, and the video content item list includes a listing of video content items including a name and view data for the associated video content item.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The segmentation control can be a bar and the elements can be tabs on the bar. The filter criteria can enable filtering the view data by demographic segment. The filter criteria can enable filtering the view data by location. The filter criteria can enable filtering the view data by time. The plurality of elements can include two or more elements for the identified segments. The view data graph can include a presentation of a summary of the view data for all video content items in the campaign. The video content item list can include a description of each video content item. The video content item list can include a preview control for previewing an associated video content item. The preview control can include an image selected from a frame of an associated video content item. The method can include receiving a selection of one of the video content items in the video content item list and providing data that cause the presentation of a modified report interface that includes the segmentation control, a view data graph for the selected video content item, and a tabular form of the information in the video content item list associated with the selected video content item. The method can include receiving a selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control and providing data that cause an update to the view data graph to include data for an associated data segment. The selections can be received from a content sponsor associated with the campaign. The method can include providing data that cause an update to the view data presented in the video content item list to include data for an associated data segment. The segments can be selected from the group comprising total views, organic views, views associated with an advertisement, views by a demographic segment, views by location, views by time period, views by dwell time, and views by quartiles associated with dwell time. Providing data that cause presentation of a report interface can include providing data that cause presentation of a video viewer in the report interface. Providing data that cause presentation of the video viewer can include providing data that cause presentation of a portion of the video content item within the video viewer. The view data can include quartile view data for videos viewed by dwell time in terms of percentage of a video content item viewed.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for presenting view data. The method comprises: identifying view data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign; identifying a plurality of segments of the view data where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria; providing data that cause presentation of a report interface that includes a segmentation control and a view data graph, where the segmentation control includes a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments, and the view data graph includes a presentation of a summary of the performance for one or more video content items in the campaign; receiving a selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control; and providing data that cause an update to the view data graph to include data for an associated data segment.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products which include a computer program product embodied in a tangible medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to: identify view data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign; identify a plurality of segments of the view data where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria; provide data that cause presentation of a report interface that includes a segmentation control and a view data graph, where the segmentation control includes a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments, and the view data graph includes a presentation of a summary of the performance for one or more video content items in the campaign; receive a selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control; and provide data that cause an update to the view data graph to include data for an associated data segment.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems which include a system for presenting view data. The system comprises: a content management system that provides content items responsive to received requests; a view analysis apparatus that tracks presentations of video content items, identifies view data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign, identifies a plurality of segments of the view data where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria; and a report interface, that is displayable on a user device, that includes a segmentation control and a view data graph, where the segmentation control includes a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments, the view data graph includes a presentation of a summary of the performance for one or more video content items in the campaign, and the report interface is configured, upon receiving a selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control, to update the view data graph to include data for an associated data segment.
Particular implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. View data for video content items included in a campaign can be viewed, including summary data, data for a particular video content item, and data corresponding to a particular segment of the view data. A campaign sponsor can filter view data for video content items in a campaign by various segments, including, for example, total views, organic views, views associated with an advertisement, views by a demographic segment, views by location, views by time period, views by dwell time, or views by quartiles associated with dwell time.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
View data corresponding to presentations of one or more video content items associated with a campaign can be identified. One or more segments of the view data can be identified, where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria. The filter criteria can enable the view data to be filtered, for example, by demographic segment, location, or time. A report interface can be displayed that includes in some implementations a segmentation control, a view data graph, and a video content item list. The view data graph can include a presentation of a summary of the view data for one or more video content items in the campaign and the video content item list can include a listing of video content items and associated data, such as a name and view data, for each respective video content item. The segmentation control can be of the form of a bar and can include a set of elements (e.g., tabs), where each element can correspond to a respective segment. In response to user selection of an element, the view data graph and the video content item list can be updated to show information associated with the segment corresponding to the selected element.
For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. As another example, if the number of data items stored for a particular user is less than a predetermined threshold, then certain information (e.g., demographic, geographic) may not be used for the user.
A website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
A resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102. A resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). Units of content that are presented in (or with) resources are referred to as content items.
A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
A user device 106 can submit a resource request 112 that requests a resource 105 from a website 104. In turn, data representing the requested resource 114 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106. The requested resource 114 can be, for example, a home page of a website 104, a search results page in which search results are presented, or another resource 105. The data representing the requested resource 114 can include data that cause presentation of resource content 116 at the user device including the display of content in one or more content slots 118.
As noted above, content slots 118 can be defined in a search results page. The search results page can be, for example, a general search results page that is presented in response to a general search query that is submitted to a general purpose search system (e.g., a search system that identifies resources of several different resource types). The search results page can also be, for example, a search results page that is presented in response to a search query that is submitted to a video content item search engine (e.g., a search system that identifies video content items that are responsive to the search query). Unless otherwise specified, the term “search results page” is intended to include both general search results pages as well as search results pages that present search results for pre-specified types of resources (e.g., video resources).
When a resource 105 is requested by a user device 106, the content management system 110 receives a request for content to be provided with the requested resource 114. The request for content can include characteristics of the content slots 118 that are defined for the requested resource 114, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the requested resource 114 for which the content slot is defined, a size of the content slot, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the content slot can be provided to the content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the requested resource 114.
Based on data included in the request for content, the content management system 110 selects one or more content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of the content slots 118 and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords. In some implementations, content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords are selected as eligible content items by the content management system 110.
The eligible content items can include video content items. Video content items can include, for example, video content items that have been created exclusively for presentation in content slots 118 or other video content items that have been identified, by a content provider 108, as being available for presentation in content slots 118 as well as being available in other viewing environments, such as online video sharing sites in which many different types of video content items may be presented (e.g., user provided videos).
A content provider 108 can create or edit a content campaign associated with one or more video content items using tools provided by the content management system 110. For example, the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
Content providers 108 (as well as other owners or publishers of video content items) may be interested in evaluating the performance of their video content items. Accordingly, the environment 100 includes a view analysis apparatus 120 that tracks presentations of video content items and provides information to the content providers 108 so that the content providers 108 can evaluate their video content items. The view analysis apparatus 120 is depicted as being implemented independent of the content management system 110, but can also be implemented entirely, or in part, in the content management system 110.
In some implementations, the view analysis apparatus 120 tracks presentations of video content items (e.g., VCIa-VCIx) and logs view data 122 for the video content items in a view data store 119. The view data 122 for each video content item can be indexed according to (and/or stored with a reference to) the video content item with which the view data 122 is associated. The view analysis apparatus 120 can use the view data 122 for each of the video content items to provide content providers 108 (or other video content owners or publishers) with information that facilitates evaluation of the performance of the video content items. In some implementations, the view analysis apparatus 120 can use the view data 122 for a particular video content item (e.g., VCI2) to determine a number of viewers that requested presentation (e.g., selected) or initiated play of the video content item.
In some implementations, a report interface can be displayed that includes a segmentation control (e.g., a segmentation bar as shown in the figures), a view data graph, and a video content item list. The view data graph can include a presentation of a summary of the view data for the video content items in a campaign and the video content item list can include a listing of the video content items and associated data, such as a name and view data, for each respective video content item. The content provider 108 can select one or more video content items in the video content item list. The content management system 110 can identify view data 122 that is associated with the selected video content items. The view data graph and the video content item list can be updated to show information associated with the selected video content items.
The segmentation control can include a set of elements (e.g., tabs on the bar), where each element can correspond to a respective segment. A segment defines a portion of the view data 122 in accordance with a filter criteria. The filter criteria can enable the view data 122 to be filtered, for example, by demographic segment, location, or time. Segments can include, for example, total views, organic views, views associated with an advertisement (e.g., paid views), views by a demographic segment, views by location, views by time period, views by dwell time, or views by quartiles associated with dwell time. In response to user selection of an element, the view data graph and the video content item list can be updated to show information associated with the segment corresponding to the selected element.
In response to selecting the videos control 208, a report interface 210 can be displayed. The report interface 210 includes a segmentation bar 212, a view data graph 214, and a video content item list 216. The video content item list 216 includes a listing of video content items 218, 220, and 222.
For each video content item 218, 220, and 220, the video content items list 216 includes a name, a description, a video length, associated view data, and a preview control. For example, for the video content item 218, the video content item list 216 includes a video length 224, a description 226, and a preview control 228. The preview control 228 can include, for example, an image selected from a frame of the video content item 218. The preview control 228 includes a control 230, which can be selected to preview a portion (or all) of the video content item 218.
A table 232 displays view data for the video content items 218, 220, and 222. The view data can correspond to presentations of the video content items 218, 220, and 222 at user devices associated with the “campaign # 1” campaign. The table 232 can display view data corresponding to a date range selected using a control 233. A totals row 234 displays view data totals for the video content items 218, 220, and 222.
The view data can include information on total views and can include information relating to content items (e.g., advertisements) that are displayed in association with a video content item, such as impressions, clicks, and click through rate (CTR). For example, as shown in a row 235 that corresponds to the video content item 218, the video content item 218 had thirty five thousand total views, one thousand associated impressions, three hundred clicks, and a click through rate of thirty percent. The view data can also include quartile view data for videos viewed by dwell time in terms of percentage of a video content item viewed. For example, as shown in the row 235, 12,890 of the total 35,000 total views of the video content item 218 are views of one hundred percent of the video content item 218 and 7,222 of the total views are views where only the first 25% of the video content item 218 was watched.
The segmentation bar 212 includes tabs 240-246, where the tabs 240, 242, and 244 each correspond to a particular segment of the view data. A segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria, where the filter criteria can enable filtering the view data, for example, by demographic segment, location, or time. For example, the tab 240 corresponds to a paid views segment, the tab 242 corresponds to a twenty four to thirty five year old male viewer segment, and the tab 244 corresponds to a United States viewer segment. Other types of segments can be identified, including views by time period, views by dwell time, and views by quartiles associated with dwell time, to name a few examples. As described in more detail below, one of the tabs 240-244 can be selected to cause an update to the report interface 210 to include data for an associated segment.
The view data graph 214 includes a presentation of a summary of view data for one or more of the video content items in the “campaign # 1” campaign. For example, the view data graph 214 currently shows information for total views for the video content items 218, 220, and 222. The campaign sponsor can select a particular video content item 218, 220, or 222, and in response, a modified report interface 210 can be displayed.
For example, FIG. 3 illustrates an example user interface 300 that includes a report interface 302. The report interface 302 can be displayed in response to selection of the video content item 218 (e.g., the video content item 218 can be represented in the report interface 302 as a video content item 304). The report interface 302 includes a segmentation bar 306, a view data graph 308, and a video content item area 310.
The video content item area 310 includes a table 324 which includes a row 326 which includes information for view data associated with the video content item 304. The table 324 includes a row 328 which includes totals for all filtered video content items (which, in this example, includes information for the one video content item 304). The table 324 also includes a row 330 which includes information for all video content items included in the “campaign # 1” campaign.
The view data graph 308 includes a presentation of a summary of the view data for the video content item 304 (e.g., views occurring on particular dates). The segmentation bar 306 includes a filter bar 312 which indicates that the information presented in the report interface 302 is filtered to include information associated with the video content item 304. The campaign sponsor can apply other filters using a filters control 313.
The segmentation bar 306 includes tabs 314-322 where each tab 314-322 is associated with a respective segment. In some implementations, some or all of the segments available from the tabs 314-322 (and possibly other segments) are available using a segments control 323. Some or all of the tabs 314-322 can include information which indicates a percentage of views and/or a count of views that are associated with the segment that is associated with the respective tab. For example, the tab 316, which corresponds to a paid views segment, indicates that 7,000 (twenty percent) of the 35,000 total views of the video content item 304 are paid views. As another example, the tab 322 indicates that seventy percent (e.g., 24,500) of the 35,000 total views of the video content item 304 were viewed in the United States. The campaign sponsor can select one of the tabs 316-322 to cause an update to the report interface 302 to include data for an associated segment.
For example, FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 which can be displayed in response to selection of a tab 402 corresponding to a paid views segment associated with a video content item 404. In response to selection of the tab 402, a view data graph 406 can be updated to include data for the paid views segment. For example, the view data graph 406 shows data 408 corresponding to the paid views segment and data 410 corresponding to an unpaid views segment.
A video content item area 412 can also be updated in response to selection of the tab 402 to include data for the paid views segment. For example, the video content item area 412 can be updated to include a table 414. The table 414 includes rows 416, 418, 420, and 422 corresponding to view data for paid sources, non-paid sources, filtered video content items, and all video content items, respectively.
As another example, FIG. 5 illustrates an example user interface 500 which includes a report interface 501 which can be displayed in response to selection of a tab 502 corresponding to a views-played-to segment associated with a video content item 504. In response to selection of the tab 502, a view data graph 506 can be displayed which displays view data according to a percentage of the video content item 504 watched. As indicated by a legend 508, the view data graph 506 can show data corresponding to various display formats, such as non-paid, search-result embedded, in-display, selected-from-group, and stream-embedded formats. A table 510 can be displayed which shows, among other information, tabular data for various display formats and various viewed-to quartile thresholds (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%).
View data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign is identified (802). For example, the view data 122 that is indicative of a number of presentations of the video content items VCI1, VCI2, . . . , and VCIX can be obtained from the view data store 119. As another example, view data corresponding to the video content items 218, 220, and 222 described above with respect to FIG. 2 can be identified.
A plurality of segments of the view data is identified (804), where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria. The filter criteria can enable filtering the view data by demographic segment, location, or time, to name a few examples. Segments can include, for example, total views, organic views, views associated with advertisements (e.g., paid views), views by a demographic segment, views by location, views by time period, views by dwell time, or views by quartiles associated with dwell time.
Data is provided that cause presentation of a report interface that includes, in some implementations, a segmentation control, a view data graph, and a video content item list (806). The segmentation control can include a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments. The view data graph can include a presentation of a summary of the view data for one or more video content items in the campaign. The video content item list can include a listing of video content items including a name and view data for the associated video content item. For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the report interface 210 can be presented, where the report interface 210 includes the segmentation bar 212, the view data graph 214, and the video content item list 216.
In some implementations, the video content item list can include a description of each video content item included in the list. For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the video content item list 216 includes a description 226 for the video content item 218. The video content item list can include a preview control for previewing an associated video content item and the preview control can include an image selected from a frame of an associated video content item. For example, the video content item list 216 includes a preview control 228 for the video content item 218. In response to selection of the preview control, data can be provided that cause presentation of a video viewer in the report interface. The video viewer can present all or a portion of the video content item.
The video content item list and the view data graph can each include information for all video content items in the campaign, a subset of two or more of the video content items in the campaign, or a single video content item in the campaign. For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the view data graph 214 and the video content item list 216 each include information for all videos included in the “campaign # 1” campaign. As another example, with respect to FIG. 3 , the view data graph 308 and the video content item list 310 each include information associated with the selected video content item 304. For example, the selection of the video content item 218 presented in the video content item list 216 can be received (e.g., from a content sponsor) and data can be provided that cause the presentation of the report interface 302, where the view data graph 308 included in the report interface 302 is for the selected video content item 218 and a tabular form of the information in the video content item list 216 associated with the selected video content item 218 is displayed in the updated video content item list 310.
The video content item list and the view data graph can each present information associated with all views of the videos for which information is presented or can present information for a portion of the view data as defined by one or more segments. For example, a selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control can be received (e.g., from a content sponsor) and data can be provided that cause an update to the view data graph to include data for an associated segment and an update to the view data presented in the video content item list to include data for the associated segment. For example, with respect to FIG. 4 , a selection of the tab 403 can be received, and the view data graph 406 and the video content item list 412 can be updated to include data for the associated paid views segment.
View data indicative of a number of presentations of a plurality of video content items at user devices associated with a campaign is identified (902). For example, the view data 122 that is indicative of a number of presentations of the video content items VCI1, VCI2, . . . , and VCIX can be obtained from the view data store 119. As another example, view data corresponding to the video content items 218, 220, and 222 described above with respect to FIG. 2 can be identified.
A plurality of segments of the view data are identified (904), where a segment defines a portion of the view data in accordance with a filter criteria. The filter criteria can enable filtering the view data by demographic segment, location, or time, to name a few examples. Segments can include, for example, total views, organic views, paid views, views by a demographic segment, views by location, views by time period, views by dwell time, or views by quartiles associated with dwell time.
Data is provided that cause presentation of a report interface that includes a segmentation control and a view data graph (906), where the segmentation control includes a plurality of elements that include at least one element for one or more of the identified segments, and the view data graph includes a presentation of a summary of the view data for one or more video content items in the campaign. For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the report interface 210 can be presented, where the report interface 210 includes the segmentation bar 212 and the view data graph 214 and where the segmentation bar 212 includes the tabs 240-246.
A selection of one of the elements of the segmentation control is received (908). For example, with respect to FIG. 2 , the tab 240 associated with a paid views segment can be selected.
Data is provided that cause an update to the view data graph to include data for an associated data segment (910). For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , the tab 402 corresponding to the tab 240 has been selected, and the view data graph 406 is updated to include data (e.g., the data 408 and the data 410) for the paid views segment. As another example, the table 414 in the video content item area 412 can be updated to include data for the associated data segment.
