Definitions
- the present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to eyeglass lenses and particularly relate to embedding a holographic optical element in an eyeglass lens.
- Eyeglass lenses are objects made of a transparent lens material, typically glass or plastic, that can be mounted in eyeglass lens frames. Eyeglass lenses may be converging lenses, diverging lenses, or plano. Converging and diverging lenses may provide vision correction as prescribed by an optometrist. Plano lenses may provide light blocking, as in sunglasses, or they may be worn solely for their aesthetic appeal.
- Eyeglass lenses may be manufactured by a grinding process, wherein material is carefully removed from a preformed “blank” (already of approximately the shape of the lens) to yield a lens with the correct shape.
- Eyeglass lenses may also be manufactured by a molding process, wherein a mold of the correct shape of the lens is filled with fluid plastic or glass; the fluid is then hardened by cooling or curing the plastic or glass. Once manufactured to the correct shape, eyeglass lenses typically require polishing to achieve a smooth surface. Eyeglass lenses may be coated to increase scratch resistance, block UV light transmission, or reduce reflections.
- An optic or optical element is a material which, when exposed to light, refracts, diffracts, attenuates or otherwise modifies the properties of the light.
- a hologram or holographic optical element is an optical element that comprises a series of ridges or fringes that form an optical element by diffracting light.
- Non-limiting examples of optical elements whose function may be replicated by a HOE include a lens, a mirror, a filter, a beamsplitter, a prism, a diffuser, a grating, and a polarizer.
- HOEs are generally fabricated using light-reactive substances, which when exposed to light under the correct conditions form a series of very small and carefully spaced fringes; it is the combined set of fringes that form the HOE.
- Non-exclusive examples of light reactive substances are silver-halide emulsions and photopolymers.
- the small size and careful spacing of the fringes makes the fringes fragile; i.e., any deformation of the HOE will cause damage which is generally irreversible. Deformation could be caused by mechanical forces or high temperatures which may cause the fringes or the material between the fringes to melt or expand.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.

- FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary eyeglass lens with embedded planar HOE suitable for use as a transparent combiner in a WHUD in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- WHUD heads-up displays
- Additional functionality may be imparted to an eyeglass lens by embedding a HOE in the eyeglass lens.
- the additional functionality provided by the HOE may, for example, enable the eyeglass lens to be used in advanced optical devices, including performing the role of transparent optical combiner in a WHUD.
- the HOE may comprise N holograms, where N ⁇ 1; at least two of the N holograms may be located in a single layer of the HOE (“multiplexed holograms”); each of the N holograms may be located in a respective one of N layers in the HOE.
- a HOE may include non-holographic diffractive elements, non-exclusive examples of non-holographic diffractive elements include a volume diffraction grating, a surface relief diffraction grating, a transmission grating, or a reflection grating.
- the HOE may be carried on or by another structure.
- one or more HOEs may be carried on or by a waveguide or lightguide structure and may serve as, for example, an in-coupler or out-coupler for such waveguide or lightguide structure.
- at least a portion (or an entirety) of the waveguide or lightguide structure may be embedded within an internal volume of an eyeglass.
- the term “HOE” includes a diffractive material combined with waveguide/lightguide structures.
- the HOE may be carried on or by other structures or layers, or may itself carry other structures or layers, depending on the specific implementation.
- Embedding a HOE in an internal volume of an eyeglass lens protects the HOE from damage; a HOE located on an outer surface of an eyeglass lens is easy to scratch, smudge, or otherwise physically damage.
- an eyeglass lens is one example of a lens, and that a HOE may be embedded in non-eyeglass lenses.
- Typical methods for embedding a layer of material in an eyeglass lens include hot-pressing, welding, lamination, injection molding, and gluing; typically with the use of high temperature and/or harsh chemicals that allow products to be manufactured quickly and inexpensively. Exposure to harsh chemicals and/or temperatures above the maximum stable temperature of a HOE will generally deform a HOE, causing irreparable damage to the HOE and consequent loss of optical performance.
- a typical HOE may have a maximum stable temperature of 60° C., 80° C., 100° C., or 120° C., where a higher maximum stable temperature corresponds to a more physically robust HOE.
- a person of skill in the art will appreciate that a more physically robust HOE typically has poorer HOE performance (for example, lower efficiency, lower transparency, and/or greater side lobes), therefore a HOE with a lower maximum stable temperature is advantageous.
- Eyeglass lens fabrication may include processes which require the eyeglass lens to be heated above the maximum stable temperature of the HOE.
- Non-exclusive examples of eyeglass lens fabrication processes that require the eyeglass lens to be heated above the maximum stable temperature of the HOE include: annealing the eyeglass lens and curing at least one coating applied to the eyeglass lens.
- a protective material may be used to protect a HOE.
- a protective material is a material that provides the HOE with increased resistance to harsh chemicals and/or elevated temperatures.
- a protective material may increase the maximum stable temperature of a HOE by up to 40° C., however the increased maximum stable temperature of the HOE is still typically below the temperature of at least one eyeglass lens fabrication process.
- a HOE may be embedded in an eyeglass lens without causing damage to the HOE if the lens undergoes all high-temperature processes prior to embedding the HOE via a low-temperature process.
- FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary eyeglass lens 100 with an embedded HOE 120 suitable for use as a transparent combiner in a WHUD in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- Eyeglass lens 100 with an embedded HOE 120 comprises lens assembly 110 , HOE 120 , first low-temperature optically clear adhesive (“LT-OCA”) layer 131 , and second LT-OCA layer 132 .
- An optically clear adhesive (OCA) is an optically transparent material that bonds one surface to another surface; typically the surfaces bonded together with an OCA are both optically transparent.
- Non-exclusive examples of OCAs include a flexible adhesive tape and a curable liquid adhesive.
- a LT-OCA is an OCA that is applied and, if necessary or otherwise advantageous, cured at temperatures below 40° C.
- the use of a LT-OCA in an eyeglass lens with embedded HOE is advantageous because the LT-OCA may be applied and/or cured at a temperature below the maximum stable temperature of the HOE, thus preventing damage to the HOE.
- the term “layer” generally refers to a thickness of some material that provides and/or is spread over a surface, such as a stratum or a coating on a surface.
- a layer may include or cover a single side or face of a structure, such as a dielectric layer in a printed circuit board or a layer of cheese on a pizza, or a layer may include or cover multiple sides or faces of a three-dimensional structure, such as a layer of clothing or a layer of planet Earth (e.g., the crust, mantle, etc.).
- a person of skill in the art will appreciate that the material of one layer may form the substrate of another layer.
- eye-side refers to the side of the eyeglass lens that, when employed in a device worn by a user, faces towards the eye of the user
- world-side refers to the side of the eyeglass lens that, when employed in a device worn by a user, faces away from the eye of the user and towards the outside world.
