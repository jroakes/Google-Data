- the present disclosure is directed generally to systems and methods of selecting content items such as ads for display on computing devices using a location feature index.
- the location feature index can map geographic areas to keywords that indicate non-geographic semantic features or characteristics of the geographic areas. These keywords can be used by the data processing system to identify content items that can be provided for display on computing devices that are present in the geographic location.
- the keywords and the content items identified using the keywords need not indicate the geographic area or actual goods or services available within the geographic area. Rather, the keywords can indicate a more general characteristic or feature of the geographic area.
- the data processing system can determine that a geographic location has high end retail clothing stores. From a semantic analysis of this information, the data processing systems can identify keywords “diamonds” “luxury car” or “tropical beach vacation” and associate or map these keywords to the geographic area.
- the data processing system can receive a request for content to display on a computing device in the geographic area, e.g., the computing device is in the vicinity of the high end retail clothing stores. Responsive to the request, the data processing system can use the “tropical beach vacation” keyword to select a content item for a luxury tropical resort as a candidate for display on the computing device responsive to the request.
- the geographic area having high end clothing stores can be unrelated to any tropical location, although a user of a computing device (e.g., a smartphone) walking down a street having high end clothing stores may also be interested in high end luxury vacations.
- the data processing system can identify a group of keywords for one or more geographic areas based on semantic features or characteristics of those areas, and content providers can select content for a type of geographic area (e.g., high end retail areas) in general rather than focusing on a single area such as one set of latitude and longitude coordinates near a particular clothing store.
- the data processing system can identify keywords “sunscreen” “umbrella” or “shoes” based on characteristics of a park, such as historical, current, or predicted climate conditions of the park, available shelter in the park, or hiking paths available in the park.
- the location feature index can indicate that these keywords correspond to the geographic area of the park.
- the data processing system may receive an indication from a content provider that the content provider would like to provide content items to “users who are walking in any park” as part of a computer network based content item placement campaign.
- the data processing system may also receive a request for content from a computing device located in a park.
- the data processing system can use the keywords “sunscreen” “umbrella” or “shoes” to select a content item of the content provider as a candidate for display on the computing device.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for identifying content via a computer network such as network 105 .
- the network 105 can include computer networks such as the Internet, local, wide, metro, or other area networks, intranets, satellite networks, and other communication networks such as voice or data mobile telephone networks.

- the information may include information about displaying the content on the user device 110 (e.g., a content slot size or position) or available resources of user device 110 to display or otherwise manipulate the content.
- the data processing system 120 determines a geographic location of the user device 110 associated with the request for content. As shown in the illustrative example of FIG. 2 , a user device 110 a making a request for content may be in a geographic location. The data processing system 120 may determine the geographic location based on, e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower triangulation techniques. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 may determine a latitude and longitude coordinate and identify a larger geographic area or tile (e.g., 260 , 262 , 264 , 266 , 268 , or 270 ) comprising the latitude and longitude coordinate.
- a larger geographic area or tile e.g., 260 , 262 , 264 , 266 , 268 , or 270
- the geographic location may correspond to a latitude or longitude coordinate, or the geographic location may correspond to a larger area such as, e.g., block 260 which may be adjacent to at least a portion of First Side St. and Main St.
- the geographic area may correspond to an area that is larger than a block; e.g., the data processing system 120 may determine that user devices 110 a , 110 b , and 110 c , which are on First Side St., Second Side St., and Third Side St., are in the same geographic area that corresponds to an area that includes at least a portion of Main St., First Side St., Second Side Street and Third Side St.
- the request for content received by the data processing system 120 may include geographic location information.
- Geographic location information may include, e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, geographic information system (“GIS”) information, country, state, city, county, town, or precinct.
- the data processing system 120 may obtain geographic location information associated with the user device 110 via an application programming interface (“API”) that can provide scripted access to geographic location information associated with the user device 110 .
- API application programming interface
- the geographic API specification may include a specification associated with the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”).
- the geographic location of the user device 110 can be determined via at least one of a global positioning system (“GPS”), cell tower triangulation, or Wi-Fi hotspots.
- the data processing system 120 may obtain geographic location information associated with at least one user device 110 . Geographic location information may include city, county, state, country, or region data, for example. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 infers or determines geographic location information based on a user's interaction with an information resource.
- the user device 110 may include a global positioning system (“GPS”) or the data processing system 120 may determine a geographic location based on an internet protocol (“IP”) address.
- the user device 110 may include a GPS sensor or antenna and be configured to determine a GPS location of the user device 110 .
- the data processing system 120 may determine the geographic location by using information obtained from one or more cell towers to triangulate the location of the user device 110 .
- the geographic location determined based on one cell tower, two cell towers or three cell towers may be sufficient for content selection.
- Wi-Fi hotpots may facilitate determining a geographic location because Wi-Fi hotspots may be stationary and can be used as a landmark.
- the relation of a user device 110 with respect to a Wi-Fi hotspot can facilitate determining a geographic location of the user device 110 .
- the data processing system 120 receives or determines a relatively more precise geographic location (e.g., a latitude and longitude coordinate) in order to identify a larger geographic area that includes the latitude coordinate and longitude coordinate.
- the larger area may include a geographic tile that includes the relatively more precise geographic location.
- the geographic area may include a map tile that includes the latitude and longitude coordinate.
- the data processing system 120 may receive or obtain the larger, less precise geographic area from the user device 110 .
- a mobile application of a smartphone may provide to the data processing system 120 a geographic area or map tile.
- the geographic area may be any shape or resemble any region that includes a geographic location of the user device 110 and facilitates identifying keywords using a location feature index.
- a location feature index as described further herein, may map larger geographic areas to keywords instead of or in addition to mapping relatively more precise latitude and longitude coordinate pairs to keywords.
- the data processing system 120 identifies a keyword.
- the data processing system 120 may identify the keyword using or based on the determined geographic location associated with the user device 110 .
- the data processing system 120 may identify the keyword based on the determined geographic location and from a location feature index.
- a location feature index can map geographic areas or locations to keywords that may indicate one or more non-geographic semantic features of the determined geographic location.
- the location feature index may be accessed from a server or stored in database 145 .
- the geographic areas can be of any granularity or resolution that facilitates content selection using a location feature index.
- Non-geographic semantic features may indicate general characteristics or features of a geographic area, rather than indicate a specific geographic area or actual goods or services of a specific geographic area. For example, non-geographic semantic features may indicate that a place is sunny or warm, a park, a playground, a vacation spot, a honeymoon spot, or a luxury vacation spot, a high end retail area, or other semantic characteristic or metric.
- the data processing system 120 identifies a plurality of keywords based on a feature metric of the geographic area.
- the feature metric can include at least one of a cost of living metric of the geographic area, a retail metric of the geographic area, a services metric of the geographic area, and online user reviews associated with the geographic area.
- the cost of living metric can be obtained from a database or determined based on, e.g., one or more of publicly available real estate information, cost of food in the area, cost of commodities, or real estate tax information.
- the cost of living metric can indicate the cost of living relative to other geographic areas or a normalized cost of living metric. For example, the cost of living metric in a metropolitan city may be higher than the cost of living in a rural area.
- the retail metric of the geographic area be based on, e.g., one or more of the number of retail stores, the type of retail stores, the size of the retail store, or the price of goods sold in the retail stores. For example, if the three retail stores on a block sell expensive jewelry, expensive clothes, and expensive shoes, the retail metric may indicate that there are a relatively high number of high end retail stores in the geographic area (e.g., a high value). In the other hand, if there are no retail stores in a geographic area, the retail metric may indicate that that there are no retail stores in a geographic area (e.g., a low value).
- the services metric of the geographic area can be based on, e.g., one or more of the number of service providers in the geographic area, type of service providers, price of service providers, or quality of service providers.
- Types of service providers can include, e.g., consulting, legal, real estate, education, communications, storage, or processing. For example, if a geographic area comprises mostly of financial and legal service providers, then the services metric may indicate that the geographic area corresponds to a financial district of a city.
- the online user reviews metric may indicate what positive, negative, or neutral feedback associated with a geographic area or an entity of a geographic area.
- the user review metric may indicate whether a retail store or restaurant is looked at favorably by patrons.
- the user reviews metric may combine the user review information associated with a plurality of retail establishments of an area to generate an overall online review metric for an area. For example, retail stores and restaurants of a geographic area may each have a different rating, where the combined average rating may indicate an online user review metric for the geographic area.
- the data processing system 120 can generate, receive or update the location feature index. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 generates the location feature index prior to receiving a request for content from a user device 110 . In some implementations, the data processing system 120 can update the location feature index before, during, or after receiving a request for content. For example, the data processing system may update the location feature index responsive to the request for content or an interaction associated with content that was provided for display on the user device 110 (e.g., a click or conversion of a content item). In some implementations, the data processing system 120 may update or modify a location feature index responsive to a user of user device 110 interacting with the displayed content in a desired manner or based on a user not interacting with the displayed content.
- the data processing system 120 can receive semantic information about a geographic location or area 200 to facilitate generating the location feature index.
- the geographic area 200 may receive semantic information about condos 208 on First Side St.
- the semantic information about one or more of the condos 208 may include the rental price, the sale price, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the number of square feet in a unit, the year the units were built, etc.
- the data processing system 120 may obtain this information from an online databases or web page via the network 105 . Based on this semantic information, the data processing system 120 may identify one or more keywords that indicate non-geographic semantic features and include them in the location feature index for that geographic area. For example, FIG.
- a location feature index 300 that includes geographic locations (e.g., 305 , 315 , 325 and 335 ) mapped to semantic keywords (e.g., 310 , 320 , 330 , and 340 ).
- the keywords are mapped to a geographic area (e.g., area 200 of FIG. 2 ) they indicate non-geographic semantic features such as “wedding” “picnic” or “jewelry” rather than geographic based features such as keywords indicating a particular good or service at a defined geographic location, such as a particular coffee shop or sports team located in or near (e.g., in the same city) as the area 200 .
- the data processing system 120 may determine that the geographic location (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) of the user device 110 a corresponds to a geographic area 260 , (or in some examples to the more general geographic area 200 ). Based on the determined geographic area 260 , the data processing system may identify at least one keyword using the location feature index 300 .
- the location feature index 300 may including a mapping of geographic location 260 to keywords 320 of FIG. 3 .
- the geographic location 260 can include a beach 202 , luxury resort 204 and a spa 206 .
- Keywords associated with the geographic location 264 may be based on semantic information about the geographic location 260 , including, e.g., semantic information about beach 202 , luxury resort 204 , and spa 206 .
- the location feature index may map geographic location 260 to keywords 310 including, e.g., resort, vacation spot, luxury, jet ski, fine dining, or warm, as shown in the location feature index 300 .
- the semantic information arises from a non-geographic interpretation of the features of the geographic area. For example, the keywords “resort” or “vacation spot” or “jet-ski” are not bound to any particular geographic location.
- the semantic information can indicate various metrics such as a quality of life metric, an education metric, a population metric, a topographical metric, or a climate metric.
- the quality of life metric can be based on publicly available real estate information including, e.g., real estate prices, sale prices, assessed values, property taxes, rental prices, foreclosure information, property information (e.g., square foot, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of garages, lot size, or whether there is a pool).
- the semantic information indicates an education metric, based for example on the amount of education attained by individuals in the geographic area including, e.g., whether they have high school diplomas, associates degrees, bachelors degrees, masters degrees, doctor of philosophy, medical degree, juris doctor degree, for example.
- the education metric may be further based on the type of degrees such as, e.g., technical degree, liberal arts degree, science degree, for example.
- the data processing system 120 may obtain this information from publicly available college graduation metrics or types of employers in an area.
- the semantic information may indicate a population metric such as, e.g., the population density, household size, or other population-related metrics.
- the semantic information may indicate a topographical metric or a climate metric.
- Topographical metrics may include natural or man made features on the ground such as, e.g., elevations, landforms, whether the geographic area is near a body of water (e.g., on or near a lake, ocean, beach, pond, swamp, marsh, etc).
- climate metrics may include, e.g., current temperature or a historical temperature for a certain time of year, season, month, week, or day.
- climate metrics may include precipitation information including, e.g., amount of rainfall or snow for a given time interval.
- climate metrics may include general weather-related information such as, e.g., warm, hot, sunny, cloudy, windy, cold, or freezing.
- a vendor that sells high end rain jackets may indicate that they want to display advertisements for their products to users who are walking near a luxury clothing store in the rain or in geographical area during a time of year associated higher than average precipitation.
- the data processing system 120 may select the content providers content for display on the user device 110 associated with the request for content.
- the data processing system 120 selects content (e.g., an advertisement) for display on the user device 110 .
- the data processing system 120 may select the content based on the keyword.
- the data processing system 120 can identify the keyword using the location feature index and select a content that is related or associated with the keyword.
- the content may include the identified keyword, be synonymous with the keyword, or be semantically or topically related to the keyword.
- the data processing system 120 selects a content item (e.g., an ad) as a candidate for display.
- the data processing system 120 may provide a candidate content item to an online auction with a plurality of content items where the content item associated with the highest bid (e.g., the highest bid price made for content of a content provider 125 ) or other factors such as the highest quality content item is selected and provided for display on the user device 110 .
- the data processing system 120 may select or identify multiple candidate content items based on at least one keyword, and further select a content item from the candidates to provide for display on the user device 110 based on relevance factors, quality factors, click through rate, or conversion rate.
- the geographic area 200 includes additional geographic areas (e.g., 260 , 262 , 264 , 266 , 268 , 270 ) that may have, for example, streets, residential and commercial property, retail stores, service stores, educational buildings, recreational areas, or lakes.
- the data processing system 120 can obtain information about one or more of these geographic areas. For example, at the geographic location 266 , the data processing system 120 may identify restaurant 232 , office building 234 , salon 236 , diner 238 , pizza restaurant 240 , and jewelry store 242 . In some implementations, the data processing system 120 can further identify or obtain semantic information about a geographic area or a property within the geographic area.
- the data processing system may obtain semantic information for restaurant 232 within geographic area 266 that includes, e.g., menu items, menu prices, customer reviews, type of cuisine, seating capacity, popularity of the restaurant, dress requirements, reservation wait time, number of years in business, or other semantic information that may facilitate the identification or generation of keywords associated with the geographic area. For example, if the average menu prices for lunch at restaurant 232 is less than $3, the restaurant 232 does not take reservations, there is no dress code, and there is take out, the data processing system 120 may identify a keyword “fast food”. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 may generate or update a location feature index by mapping the geographic area 266 to keywords fast food, lunch, or inexpensive.
- the data processing system 120 may receive additional semantic information about the geographic location 266 such as, e.g., semantic information relating to the office building 234 , pizza restaurant 240 , and diner 238 .
- the data processing system 120 may identify that the office building 234 includes an engineering entity, software entity, and a financial services entity. Based on this information, the data processing system 120 may identify keywords work, education, busy, and employed.
- the data processing system 120 may generate or update a location feature index by further mapping the geographic area 266 to keywords work, education, busy, and employed.
- the data processing system 120 may map geographic locations to keywords that are directed to a different geographic location.
- semantic information related to luxury jewelry store 220 may map to keywords such as, “wedding location” “honeymoon location” or “luxury vacation spot”.
- the data processing system 120 can determine that a request for content was received from a user device 110 d located in geographic area 268 , and can proceed to select a content item for a luxury resort 204 or spa 206 located in a different geographic area, such as, e.g., geographic area 260 using the keywords that indicate non-geographic semantic features of the geographic area 260 .
- a content item for a luxury resort 204 or spa 206 located in a different geographic area, such as, e.g., geographic area 260 using the keywords that indicate non-geographic semantic features of the geographic area 260 .
- the data processing system 120 may employ one or more techniques to generate a location feature index that maps geographic areas to keywords that indicate non-geographic semantic features.
