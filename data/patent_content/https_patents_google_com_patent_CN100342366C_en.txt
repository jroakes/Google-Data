Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although described a broadcast event about Figure 14 here, this process is equally applicable to a plurality of broadcast event.Similarly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although the process about Figure 14 described herein has been utilized first client 18 and second client 20 in the mode of example, being to use independently data in each equipment (client runs in this equipment) to shift application program, to finish jump operation also be within the scope of the present invention.
Figure 15 is the process flow diagram that communication system 10 operating process are described according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.Particularly, Figure 15 has illustrated the process when accounting number users 42 begins to shift in a plurality of broadcast event 14 and a plurality of supervision by first client 18.Beginning in step 472, accounting number users 42 use first client 18 to monitor broadcast event 34.Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, first client 18 can operation in such as first equipment 422 of the first cable machine box 404 of first mobile device 354 of first network equipment 384 of Figure 10, Fig. 9 and/or Figure 11.And those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that although described a broadcast event here, this process is equally applicable to a plurality of broadcast event.Next step, in step 496, accounting number users 42 begins " media interviews " by user interface at first client 18.Next step, in step 498, first client 18 is determined the included information that is sent to second client 20 in the monitor for notifications.For example, monitor for notifications can comprise current link information, a plurality of broadcast message 74, monitor licence, first client profile and/or the time mark.Next step, in step 500, first client 18 is identified for broadcast event 34 and monitors the second obtainable possible client that shifts.For example, a plurality of transfer client profiles 58 of being stored can be visited and be checked to first client 18.Replacedly, first client 18 can be visited the client side list in first client, 18 communication ranges.This visit can be finished by the webserver, perhaps directly visits a plurality of clients 12 by first client 18 and finishes, and perhaps finishes by the method for any equivalence well known in the art.Next step, in step 502, whether first client 18 is determined to exist for first client 18 may second client more than one obtainable.In step 504, if for obtainable possibility second client of first client, 18 existence more than one, then this process determines whether the first client preference is set to automatically select second client 20.In step 506, if preference is set to automatically select second client 20, then first client 18 is selected second client 20.For example, the second client profile can be linked to broadcast event 34, be linked to the broadcast channel 102 of broadcast event 34, be linked to event time period 100 broadcast event 34, event type, that broadcast event connects, perhaps be linked to any other attribute of broadcast event 34.First client 18 is automatically selected second client 20 based on link then.In addition, based on being complementary with the user friendly title that is stored in first client 18 by first client, 18 checking second clients 20 and/or second client user's friendly name, first client 18 can automatically be selected second client 20.If the first client preference is not set to automatically select second client 20 in step 504, then in the step 508, first client 18 provides alternative to accounting number users 42.This alternative can be that whole tabulations that possible second client, the part tabulation (only being to have the ability to use obtainable connection to monitor the client of broadcast event 34) of client, obtainable broadcast event monitor the tabulation (for example, audio frequency, text and video) that the tabulation that connects or broadcast event monitor medium type.Next step, in step 510, accounting number users 42 makes one's options.Next step, in step 512, the step that first client 18 is selected based on the front accounting number users is selected second client 20.
If in step 502, only there is possibility second client, then selected second client 20, perhaps use step 506 or 512 to select second client, after this, in step 514, first client 18 directly to second client, 20 transmitting monitorings notice, is perhaps notified to second client, 20 transmitting monitorings by broadcasting server 16 or by communication system.For example, monitor for notifications can comprise a plurality of broadcast messages 74, monitor licence, first client profile and/or the time mark.Next step, in step 516, second client 20 determines to use information in the monitor for notifications, be stored in or be programmed into the information in second client 20 and/or monitor the method for broadcast event 34 from the input information of accounting number users 42.Next step, in step 494, accounting number users 42 uses second client 20 to monitor broadcast event 34.
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although described a broadcast event about Figure 15 here, this process is equally applicable to a plurality of broadcast event.Similarly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although the process about Figure 15 described herein has been utilized first client 18 and second client 20 in the mode of example, being to use independently data in each equipment (client runs in this equipment) to shift application program, to finish jump operation also be within the scope of the present invention.
Figure 16 is the process flow diagram that communication system 10 operating process are described according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.Particularly, Figure 16 has illustrated the more detailed details of the step 498 of the step 488 of Figure 14 and Figure 15, and in these two steps, first client 18 has been determined the information that comprises in the monitor for notifications.From step 520, first client 18 determines that whether a plurality of broadcast message 74 together transmits with the broadcast event 34 of current supervision.A plurality of broadcast messages 74 can be directly together transmit with the broadcast event 34 of current supervision.Similarly, can together transmit with broadcast event 34, point out how to obtain a plurality of broadcast messages 74 such as the information of path of navigation.First client 18 can use the information of transmission to obtain a plurality of broadcast messages 74.If a plurality of broadcast messages 74 or be used to are obtained the information of a plurality of broadcast messages 74 and together do not sent with broadcast event 34, then in step 522, first client 18 determines whether they are allowed to definite a plurality of broadcast messages 74.This decision can be made based on the ability of system design (for example, design system to make first client 18 obtain a plurality of broadcast messages 74), first client, the user preference of first client or the information of equivalence.If do not allow first client 18 to determine a plurality of broadcast messages 74, then in step 524, comprise link information 104 in the monitor for notifications.For example, link information 104 can be the channel (for example, channel 35) that monitoring, the system that monitoring (for example, the rich mattress of Fla. pause the Adelphia cable at sandy beach) and time mark.Similarly, link information 104 can be the catchword of URI or URL, broadcasting station and/or in company with the FM frequency that is monitoring of certain position (for example, Palm Beach) (for example 92.7).Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that link information 104 can be any information or the equivalent information of mentioning here.Then, the process of determining information included in the monitor for notifications finishes.
In step 526, if allow first client 18 to determine a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in step 522, then first client 18 is used the broadcast event 34 of link information 104 inquiry broadcasting servers 16 in order to determine from link information 104 monitoring.Next step, in step 528, first client 18 receives a plurality of broadcast messages 74 that comprise from the link information 104 of broadcasting server 16.Next step, in step 530, and if link information 104 together transmit with broadcast event 34, then first client 18 comprises a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in the monitor for notifications.For example, first client 18 determines to monitor all possible methods of broadcast event 34, and it is included in the link information 104 a part as a plurality of broadcast messages 74.Next step in step 532, determined whether to allow first client 18 to use a plurality of broadcast messages 74 of the second client profile modification in order to be fit to the ability of second client more up hill and dale before the transmitting monitoring notice.This decision can be made based on the information of system design, first client end capacity, first client user's preference or equivalence.If in step 532, do not allow first client 18 to revise a plurality of broadcast messages, determine that then the process of information included in the monitor for notifications finishes.
In step 534, if allowed first client 18 to revise a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in order to be fit to the ability of second client before transmitting monitoring notice, then first client 18 is determined whether the ability of second clients has stored and is obtainable for first client 18.For example, be stored in first client 18 or be stored in a plurality of transfer client profiles 58 in the storer of the equipment that first client 18 moves therein and can comprise the second client profile.In step 536, if the visit approach that first client 18 does not have at the client profile of second client 20 of being stored, then first client 18 is to second client, 20 inquiries, second client end capacity.Next step, in step 538, first client 18 receives second client end capacity from second client 20.Next step, if and first client 18 has visit approach at the client profile of second client 20 of being stored in step 534, then before monitor for notifications comprised a plurality of broadcast messages 74, first client 18 was revised a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in order to mate the ability of second client 20.Next step, in step 542, this process determines whether second client 20 lacks the application program that monitors that broadcast event 34 is required.Can notify the application program that lacks to first client 18 by second client 20, notify the application program that lacks by broadcasting server 16 to first client 18, use the second client profile to determine the application program that lacks by first client 18, perhaps, make this decision by the method for equivalence.If second client 20 does not lack the application program that monitors that broadcast event 34 is required, determine that then the process of information included in the monitor for notifications finishes.In step 544, if second client 20 lacks application program in step 542, then first client 18 sends this application program to second client 20.For example, second client 20 can locally be stored this application program, and this application program can together send with broadcast event 34, and perhaps first client 8 can be downloaded application program from the Internet.Replacedly, first client 18 can send path of navigation in order to obtain the application program that lacks to second client 20.Then, the process of determining information included in the monitor for notifications finishes.
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although described a broadcast event about Figure 16 here, this process is equally applicable to a plurality of broadcast event.Similarly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although the process about Figure 16 described herein has been utilized first client 18 and second client 20 in the mode of example, being to use independently data in each equipment (client runs in this equipment) to shift application program, to finish jump operation also be within the scope of the present invention.
Figure 17 is the process flow diagram that communication system 10 operating process are described according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.Particularly, Figure 17 has illustrated the more detailed details of the step 516 of the step 492 of Figure 14 and Figure 15, and in these two steps, second client 20 has been determined the method that monitors.From step 550, whether comprise a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in the monitor for notifications that second client 20 is determined to be sent by first client 18.In step 552, if do not comprise a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in the monitor for notifications, then use link information 104 inquiry broadcasting servers 16, this broadcasting server 16 will be from link information 104 definite broadcast event that monitoring.This broadcasting server 16 can determine to monitor all possible method of broadcast event 34, and comprises the part of these methods as a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in link information 104.Next step, in step 544, second client 20 receives a plurality of broadcast messages 74 from broadcasting server 16.Next step, and if in step 550, comprise a plurality of broadcast messages 74 in the monitor for notifications, then in step 556, this process determines whether to allow second client 20 to select used connection automatically.For example, if the equipment that second client 20 is moved therein can be exported stream-type video, the output streaming audio, carry out call, tuning FM radio, and all connections are the connection types that can be used for monitoring broadcast event, then can to 20 programmings of second client in order to determine to select which connection.Whether second client 20 should automatically select to connect the number that can depend on connection type that can monitoring events (for example, if 1 connection is only arranged, then decision automatically).It can also depend on user preference or client end capacity (for example, client can not automatically determine).If will automatically select in the second client step 556 to connect, then second client 20 selects to be used to monitor the connection of broadcast event 34 in step 558.For example, this selection can be made based on user preference (for example, select the most cheaply, selection function is maximum), perhaps can make based on client end capacity (for example, only can monitor FM wireless station).In step 560, if second client 20 is not automatically selected to connect, then second client 20 provides alternative to accounting number users 42.This alternative can be that the tabulation of all possible connection, the part tabulation of connection (only are that second client 20 can be used, be used to monitor the connection of broadcast event 34), the title that connects, the type (type of radio, TV, http, tcp/ip, RealVideo or equivalence) and/or the medium type (type of for example, text renewal, audio clips, video or equivalence) of connection.Next step, in step 562, accounting number users 42 makes one's options.
After step 562 and after step 558, in step 564, this process determines whether second client 20 lacks the application program that monitors that broadcast event 34 is required.Can notify the application program that lacks by broadcasting server 16 to second client 20 by first client 18 to the application program that second client, 20 notices lack, perhaps, make this decision by the method for equivalence.In step 566, if second client 20 lacks application program in step 564, then second client 20 is downloaded the program that lacks.For example second client 20 can receive application program from first client 18, and second client 20 can be from broadcasting server 16 down load application programs, and second server 20 can perhaps adopt the method for equivalence from the Internet down load application program.Next step, and if in step 564, do not lack application program, then this process need to determine whether prerecorded content in step 568.If do not need prerecorded content, this process finishes.If need prerecorded content in step 568, then second client 20 is downloaded prerecorded content in step 570.For example, if be used to monitor that the medium of broadcast event can use prerecorded content, then second client 20 can be downloaded this prerecorded content.It can be from the device downloads of server independently, broadcasting server 16, first client 18 or equivalence.This process finishes then.
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although described a broadcast event about Figure 17 here, this process is equally applicable to a plurality of broadcast event.Similarly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, although the process about Figure 17 described herein has been utilized first client 18 and second client 20 in the mode of example, being to use independently data in each equipment (client runs in this equipment) to shift application program, to finish jump operation also be within the scope of the present invention.
Although described the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that without departing from the scope of the present invention for those and can carry out different variations and modification according to preferred embodiment.Therefore, its purpose is, considers all described variation and modification in the defined the spirit and scope of the present invention of appended claims.
