- TE time of subject entry
- TE has not yet occurred.
- two key frames may be inserted into the focus timeline, one at the time of transition start and one at TE, that may allow for a transition of focus from the first depth to a second focus depth (for example, the focus depth that brings the subject into sharp focus).
- the resulting focus timeline is displayed in FIG.
- the focus timeline is conceptually composed of three partitions: the earliest period of time has a focus depth corresponding to the background, the latest part, beginning at TE, has a focus depth corresponding to a subject that has entered the scene, and the middle part has a transition in focus from the background to the subject of interest.
- the focus depth of the focus timeline at Acquisition Time A changes between the times represented in FIGS. 27A and 27B , due to an event that occurred temporally after AT-A.

- From the current light field frame captured by the system, generate, compute and/or determine a set of images refocused at a set of depths that includes depths closer and further than the depths that may be focused at the desired or predetermined level of sharpness.
- For each region in the image, generate, compute and/or determine the image that contains predetermined details (for example, the sharpest details) in that portion of the image. One method for doing so applies a focus metric, such as an edge detection image processing algorithm to the images, and determines the image in which the focus metric is highest in the region of interest.
- Each region is conceptually tagged with the focus depth of the image containing the predetermined details (for example, the sharpest details). If the focus depth corresponds to a depth outside the range of a predetermined depth that allows a predetermined focus at the desired or a predetermined level of sharpness, the region is conceptually tagged with an “out of range” marker.
- In embodiments where the appearance is set according to the focus depth, the focus depth label is used. In another exemplary embodiment regions marked with an “out of focus” indicator are presented with a blinking appearance in the view in order to draw the user's attention to that problem area.
“Out of Refocusable Range Icon”
-
- From the current light field frame captured by the system, generate, compute and/or determine a set of images refocused at a set of depths that includes depths closer and further than the depths that may be focused at the desired level of sharpness.
- For each region in the image, compute and/or identify the image that contains the sharpest details in that portion of the image. One method for doing so applies a focus metric, such as an edge detection image processing algorithm to the images, and determines the image in which the focus metric is highest in the region of interest. As such, in one embodiment, the refocusable video processing circuitry implements an edge detection technique to identify the image that contains the sharpest details in that portion of the image.
- If any region of the image is sharpest in an image corresponding to a depth outside the range of depths that can be refocused sharply, the refocusable video processing circuitry generates “out of refocusable range” information which may be displayed on the user interfaces as an “out of refocusable range icon.
Another exemplary method, using sub-aperture images, is as follows: - From the current light field frame captured by the system, determine a set of sub-aperture images to be generated and/or computed, where each sub-aperture image is a view of the light field from a small portion of the aperture. In one embodiment, these sub-aperture images can be identified by target U,V coordinates in the X,Y,U,V light field coordinate system. In this embodiment, each
sub-aperture image 2 dimensional sampling of the light field where U and V are held constant or near constant. In an exemplary embodiment, the set of sub-aperture images to be generated and/or computed is determined by a regular sampling of the U,V coordinate space (for example, sampling on a square or hexagonal grid). - From the current light field frame captured by the system, generate and/or compute the determined set of sub-aperture images or representations, where each sub-aperture image or representation is a view of the light field or specific light field characteristics from a small portion of the aperture. In some embodiments, a sub-aperture image or representation is an image created by sampling the current light field frame. In one embodiment, a sub-aperture image may be generated for a U,V value by sampling each microlens and returning the single pixel value with U,V coordinates closest to the target U,V coordinates. In another embodiment, the pixels under each microlens are sampled and return a pixel value from bilinear interpolation of the four pixels with nearest U,V coordinates to the target U,V coordinates. (See
FIG. 24A ,FIG. 24B ,FIG. 24C andFIG. 24D ). Indeed, any interpolation technique(s) now known or later developed may be used, including but not limited to: nearest neighbor interpolation, linear interpolation, non-linear interpolation, cubic interpolation, Bezier curve interpolation, and/or spline-based interpolation. In some embodiments, a sub-aperture image or representation may be obtained by applying a function to another sub-aperture image or representation. In one specific exemplary embodiment, a sub-aperture image or representation may be generated by applying an N by M or N by N (for example, 3 by 3, 5 by 5, or 7 by 7) Laplacian operator to a previously generated sub-aperture image or representation (seeFIG. 25 ). In another specific exemplary embodiment, a sub-aperture image or representation may be generated by applying a derivative operator (for example, sum modified Laplacian or gradient magnitude) to a previously generated sub-aperture image or representation. In other embodiments, a sub-aperture image or representation may be generated by applying an edge detection algorithm (for example, Canny edge detection) to a previously generated sub-aperture image or representation. - For each region of the image, compute and/or determine similarity, consistency and/or difference scores. In one embodiment, for a series of focus depths, each sub-aperture image or representation is shifted relative to the other sub-aperture images or representation and then compared for regional image similarity and/or consistency. In one exemplary embodiment, the sub-aperture images or representations are shifted relative to each other according to the following formula:
Dx=U*Focus_Depth
Dy=V*Focus_Depth - In one embodiment, the shifted sub-aperture images or representations are compared for regional similarity or consistency by applying a localized cross-correlation across all sub-aperture images for each image region (See
FIG. 24E ). In an exemplary embodiment, for each location, an N by N (for example, 11 by 11) pixel cross-correlation window is used, centered at the target location. In this embodiment, sampling of the sub-aperture images can be nearest neighbor, bilinear, or any other sampling image sampling method now known or later developed. In another embodiment, the shifted sub-aperture images or representations are compared for regional similarity, consistency and/or differences by applying localized statistical metrics across all sub-aperture images for each image region. In a specific exemplary embodiment, each shifted sub-aperture image or representation is sampled at each location, and the set of sample values at each location are statistically analyzed to determine a score representing the similarity, consistency and/or difference of the sample values at that location. In one embodiment, the metric is the statistical variance of the values. In another embodiment, it is the standard deviation of the values. In another embodiment, the metric is the square root of the standard deviation of the sample values. Indeed, any statistical metric now known or later developed by be used to calculate, generate or determine a similarity, consistency and/or difference score for a location. In some embodiments, the similarity, consistency and/or differences may be locally or spatially combined or aggregated. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the similarity, consistency and/or difference scores are summed together over an N by N (for example, 9 by 9) region to create an aggregate value. - For each region of the image, compute and/or determine the depth or depths of sharpest focus based using the similarity, consistency and/or difference scores. In some embodiments, the similarity, consistency and/or difference scores may be used directly to determine a localized depth of sharpest focus by choosing the focus depth corresponding most “in-focus” scores (for example, by choosing the largest value for scores representing consistency or similarity (for example, cross correlation scores) or the smallest values for scores representing differences (for example, variance or standard deviation scores). In other embodiments, the similarity, consistency and/or difference scores may be aggregated, combined and/or processed to determine the focus depth that is most “in-focus”. In one specific exemplary embodiment, the similarity, consistency and/or difference scores are combined over an N by N region (for example, 5 by 5) and then selecting the most “in-focus” depth based on the aggregate score. In another exemplary embodiment, similarity, consistency and/or difference scores are aggregated until a minimum total score or confidence level is reached for the region (for example, aggregation is performed until the total score is 10 times the maximum score for any single location), and then selecting the most “in-focus” depth based on the aggregate score.
- If any region of the image is sharpest in an image corresponding to a depth outside the range of depths that can be refocused sharply, the refocusable video processing circuitry generates “out of refocusable range” information which may be displayed on the user interfaces as an “out of refocusable range icon.

In particular, in one exemplary embodiment, for each frame, refocusablevideo editing system 100 generates and/or computes a set of images at a range or a plurality of focus depths.

-
- The operator provides a gesture/input to indicate a change in focus depth. For example, the gesture/input may be pointing and clicking on the display of the current frame on the subject or object that the operator would like to be brought into focus; processing circuitry may calculate, determine and/or derive the focus depth of that subject or object, and thereafter calculate, adjust and/or generate the video data/frame having the new (virtual) focus depth, which correlates to or is the depth of the indicated subject or object. As another example, the gesture may be clicking and dragging on a slider that represents the currently displayed focus depth. After the gesture, the system implements the new focus depth by calculating, adjusting, generating, producing and/or outputting the video data/frame of the image using the new focus position corresponding to the subject depth where the operator has pointed. For example, let the old focus depth be A, and the new focus depth be B.
- “Slow focus pull” —In one exemplary embodiment of the current inventions, the user or operator, via the user interface of refocusable
video editing system 100, defines, designates and/or inserts a key frame at the current time with a focus depth of B. The refocusablevideo editing system 100 implements a visual effect within the frames of the video data stream that provides an extended transition in the focus depth from the time of the previously (first) defined, designated or set key frame to the newly (second) defined, designated or set (that is, newly added) key frame (which was set to a virtual focus parameter of B). The slow focus pull is graphically illustrated inFIGS. 11A-11C . Notably, the user or operator may implement or include one or more “slow focus pull” techniques in a given video data stream. - “Jump focus pull” —In another exemplary embodiment, user or operator defines, designates and/or inserts, via the user interface of refocusable
video editing system 100, two key frames. The first key frame includes a focus depth parameter of A (which may be defined, designated and/or set by the user), at a time corresponding to a number of frames before the second key frame. The second key frame includes a focus depth parameter of B (again, which may be defined, designated and/or set by the user), which may be relatively close to the focus depth parameter of the currently displayed frame. As such, in this embodiment, refocusablevideo editing system 100 implements a visual effect that includes a relatively rapid or quick transition (for example, within 3-5 frames) from the previous or first focus depth to the subsequent or second focus depth. This embodiment is graphically illustrated inFIG. 12A-12C . Notably, the user or operator may implement or include one or more “jump focus pull” techniques in a given video data stream. - “Peek focus pull” —In yet another exemplary embodiment, the user may define, designate and/or insert three key frames as well as define and/or designate the focus depth of each key frame, via the user interface of refocusable
video editing system 100. The first and third key frames may be set to a focus depth parameter of A, wherein there are a number of frames before and after the second key frame. As such, in this embodiment, refocusablevideo editing system 100 implements a visual effect that includes a temporary transition from a first focus depth (A) to the second focus depth (B) and back to the initial, first or original focus depth (A). This embodiment is graphically illustrated inFIG. 13A-13C . Notably, the user or operator may implement or include one or more “peak focus pull” techniques in a given video data stream.
- “Slow focus pull” —In one exemplary embodiment of the current inventions, the user or operator, via the user interface of refocusable
- In another exemplary embodiment, a multi-step gesture/input may be implemented or used to, for example, provide control over the duration of a focus pull or a portion thereof. For example, the gesture may correspond to a click, drag and release of the mouse. That is, the click on the current frame chooses the new focus depth corresponding to the indicated subject. Let the old focus depth be A, and the new focus depth be B. The drag transitions the video backwards in time according to how far it has been dragged. The release sets the start time of the focus pull. Two key-frames are designated, defined inserted and/or added: the first is at the time corresponding to the release, at focus depth A; the second is at the time corresponding to the click, at focus depth B. Thus, in this embodiment, the user may define, determine and/or designate the duration of a focus pull, or a portion thereof.
- The operator provides a gesture/input to indicate a change in focus depth. For example, the gesture/input may be pointing and clicking on the display of the current frame on the subject or object that the operator would like to be brought into focus; processing circuitry may calculate, determine and/or derive the focus depth of that subject or object, and thereafter calculate, adjust and/or generate the video data/frame having the new (virtual) focus depth, which correlates to or is the depth of the indicated subject or object. As another example, the gesture may be clicking and dragging on a slider that represents the currently displayed focus depth. After the gesture, the system implements the new focus depth by calculating, adjusting, generating, producing and/or outputting the video data/frame of the image using the new focus position corresponding to the subject depth where the operator has pointed. For example, let the old focus depth be A, and the new focus depth be B.
-
- For the subject key frame, an output frame may be generated using a small computed aperture.
- For the subject(s) of interest chosen, regional pixel analysis may be performed on the output frame for the region(s) of the frame corresponding to the subject(s) of interest. In some embodiments, the regional pixel analysis may analyze the frame region(s) for image content, which may include the average color of the region, shapes and colors of portions of the region(s) as determined by an image segmentation algorithm, edge information based on color derivatives in the region(s), and/or statistical metrics of the contrast, brightness, and/or color variation in the region(s).
- For each subsequent frame, the region(s) containing the subject(s) of interest is/are determined in the following manner:
- An output frame may be generated using a small computed aperture.
- For each of the subject(s) of interest, a set of possible regions for the subject in the current frame may be computed using the corresponding regions(s) of interest from the previous frame(s). In one embodiment, the set of possible regions in the current frame the permutations of translations of the region(s) of interest in the previous frame within N pixels (for example, 20 pixels), rotation within M degrees (for example, 5 degrees), and growing or shrinking the region within P percent (for example, 5 percent).
- For each subject of interest and possible region for the subject in the current frame, regional pixel analysis may be performed on the output frame for the possible region of the frame corresponding to the subject(s) of interest. In some embodiments, the regional pixel analysis may analyze the frame region(s) for image content, which may include the average color of the region, shapes and colors of portions of the region(s) as determined by an image segmentation algorithm, edge information based on color derivatives in the region(s) (for example, by creating a derivative image), and/or statistical metrics of the contrast, brightness, and/or color variation in the region(s).
- For each subject of interest, the selected region of interest for the subsequent frame may the possible region of interest with the regional pixel analysis that most closely matches the regional pixel analysis of the selected region of the previous frame. In some embodiments, the most closely matching region may be the region with the most similar average color. In some embodiments, the most closely matching region may be the region where the cross-correlation score of a derivative image of the possible region and the derivative image of the region of interest from the previous frame is the highest.
-
- Face detection, tracking, analysis and/or recognition may be performed to determine if any individuals and/or specific individuals are entering the field of view, are present, performing a specific action (for example, speaking or gesturing) and/or leaving the field of view.
- Object detection, tracking, analysis and/or recognition may be performed to determine if any objects and/or specific objects are entering the field of view, are present, performing a specific action (for example, moving quickly) and/or leaving the field of view.
- Scene analysis and/or recognition may be performed to determine the current scene type (for example, outdoors) and/or any changes to the scene.
Indeed, any type of video, image and/or light field analysis presented herein, whether now known or later developed, may be performed to generate events of interest. These events may be stored in memory for P seconds prior to the current frame and Q seconds following the current frame. In some embodiments, P is equal to the total time before the current frame that the system has been recording (for example, all events since prior to the current frame since the user/operator last started recording). In some embodiments, Q may be equal to M. In some embodiments, N may be 0, indicating that only events and not refocusable frames are stored prior to the current frame.
-
- The subject is not part of the background (for example, by using automatic foreground-background segmentation based on pixel clustering). In this case, the subject may be more likely to be selected.
- The length of time the subject is in the field of view. If the duration of time that the subject is in the field of view is very short, the subject may be less likely to be selected.
- Proximity of the subject to the center of the field of view. The closer the subject is to the center, the more likely it may be to be selected.
- The size of the subject. The larger the subject is, the more likely it may be to be selected.
- Whether the subject is or includes a face. Face detection methods (for example, a suitably configured Haar cascade classifier) may be used to identify whether the subject region is a face. If so, it may be more likely to be selected.
- The identity of the face. If the subject region is a face, it may be more likely to be selected if a face recognition method determines that it is someone from a set of known identities. Any facial recognition method now known or later developed may be used, including principal component analysis (PCA) or elastic bunch graph matching (EBGM).
- Whether the subject is talking or moving (for example, running, climbing and/or fighting). If the subject is determined to be a face, it may be more likely to be selected if the person is talking (for example, by using a detection approach based on latent semantic indexing) or moving (for example, running, climbing and/or fighting).
