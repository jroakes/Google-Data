- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated in a way that no personally identifiable information of the user is revealed.
- information indicative of a user's geographic location is generalized so that a particular location of a user is not uncovered.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server or a content item selection system.
- a third-party content provider when providing third-party content items for presentation with requested resources via the Internet or other network, utilizes a content item management service to control or otherwise influence the selection and serving of the third-party content items.
- a third-party content provider may specify selection criteria, such as keywords, and corresponding bid values that are used in the selection of the third-party content items.
- the bid values may be utilized by the content item selection system in an auction to select and serve content items for presentation with a resource.
- a third-party content provider may place a bid in the auction that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if a user interacts with the provider's content item, e.g., the provider agrees to pay $3 if a user clicks on the provider's content item.
- a third-party content provider places a bid in the auction that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if the content item is selected and served, e.g., the provider agrees to pay $0.005 each time a content item is selected and served or the provider agrees to pay $0.05 each time a content item is selected or clicked.
- the content item selection system uses content item interaction data to determine the performance of the third-party content provider's content items.
- auction bids to place the third-party content items may be relatively high for high-performing webpages, categories of webpages, and/or other criteria, while the bids may be relatively low for low-performing webpages, categories of webpages, and/or other criteria.
- one or more performance metrics for the third-party content items are determined and indications of such performance metrics are provided to the third-party content provider via a user interface for the content item management account.
- the performance metrics may include a cost per impression (CPI) or cost per thousand impressions (CPM). An impression may be counted whenever a content item is selected to be served for presentation with a resource.
- the performance metric includes a click-through rate (CTR), defined as the number of clicks on the content item divided by the number of impressions.
- CTR click-through rate
- Other performance metrics may include cost per action (CPA), conversion rate (CVR), cost per click-through (CPC), cost per sale (CPS), cost per lead (CPL), effective CPM (eCPM), and/or other performance metrics.
- an action may include clicking on the content item or a link therein, a purchase of a product, a referral of the content item, or the like.
- CPC Click-through is counted when a content item is clicked.
- a webpage or other resource such as, an application, includes one or more content item slots in which a selected and served third-party content item is displayed.
- a computer code e.g., JavaScript®, HTML, etc., defining a content item slot for a webpage or other resource includes instructions to request a third-party content item from the content item selection system to be presented with the resource.
- the selection of a third-party content item to be served with the resource by a content item selection system is based on several influencing factors, such as a predicted click through rate (pCTR), a predicted conversion rate (pCVR), a bid associated with the content item, etc.
- influencing factors may be used to generate a value, such as a score, against which other scores for other content items are compared by the content item selection system through an auction.
- An auction may include bids based on whether a user clicks on the third-party content item, whether a user performs a specific action based on the presentation of the third-party content item, whether the third-party content item is selected and served, and/or other types of bids.
- a bid based on whether the third-party content item is selected and served is a relatively low bid, e.g., $0.005
- a bid based on whether a user performs a specific action is a relatively high bid, e.g., $5.
- the bid is adjusted to account for a probability associated with the type of bid and/or adjusted for other reasons.
- the probability of the user performing the specific action may be low, such as 0.2%, while the probability of selecting and serving the third-party content item may be 100%, e.g., the selecting and serving of the content item occurs when the content item is selected during the auction, and, as such, the bid is unadjusted.
- a value such as a score or a normalized value, is generated to be used in the auction based on the bid value and the probability or another modifying value.
- the content item selection system may select the third-party content item with the highest value from the auction.
- the content item selection system may select the content item associated with the bid based on whether the user performs the specific action due to the higher value or score associated with that bid.
- Some consumers are likely to become frustrated by their inability to acquire this information, causing them to forgo certain non-touch shopping environments, e.g., online shopping. Many shoppers browse merchandise online, but buy in stores. Such phenomenon puts online-only merchants at disadvantage. Also, even merchants having physical store(s) close to their potential customers look forward to increase their online transactions with their customers. For merchants, selling online is less costly and allows easier management of inventory and labor force than traditional selling.
- interactive content items are delivered to client devices of end users through a communications network.
- media content associated with the received interactive content item is displayed.
- the received interactive content item and the client device provide interactive tools enabling the end user to customize a three-dimensional (3-D) representation of an object illustrated in the displayed media content.
- the received interactive content item and the client device may also provide interactive tools for causing the customized 3-D representation of the object to be 3-D printed through a 3-D prototyping device coupled to the client device.
- the end-user has the chance to get a touch, or feel, experience, in relation with the printed 3-D prototype.
- the interactive content item may be an advertisement content item and the object illustrated in the displayed media content may be an advertised object.
- the interactive content is provided, e.g., as demo item, on a merchant web page. The interactive content item is accessed and customized through the merchant web page. In some implementations, a non-customized 3-D representation of the object is 3-D printed.
