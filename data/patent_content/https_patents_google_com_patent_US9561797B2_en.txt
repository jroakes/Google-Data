Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- the present application discloses embodiments that relate to predictive reasoning for controlling speed of a vehicle.

- FIG. 2 illustrates an example automobile.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example method for adjusting a speed of an autonomous vehicle.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an example for determining a distance at which to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle.
- FIG. 4B illustrates an example for determining a distance at which to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle when a traffic control object is present.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an implementation of the example method on a road of travel.
- FIG. 6 is a schematic illustrating a conceptual partial view of a computer program.
- An autonomous vehicle operating on a road or path of travel may be configured to identify objects within an environment of the autonomous vehicle in order to determine an adjustment to the autonomous vehicle's current speed.
- the objects can be other vehicles, traffic control objects, or other types of objects.
- each identified object may be considered independently, and the respective characteristics of the object, such as its current speed, acceleration, and range to the vehicle, may be used to determine a speed for the autonomous vehicle to adjust to.
- the autonomous vehicle or computing device associated with the autonomous vehicle, may be configured to predict behaviors of the identified objects based on the characteristics of the objects and a state of the surrounding environment (e.g., traffic, rain, ice on the road, etc.), and the objects may all be considered together—each dependent on each other's behavior.
- the autonomous vehicle can then adjust its speed based on the predicted behaviors of the objects.
- the autonomous vehicle can determine what steady state the vehicle will need to adjust to (e.g., speed up, slow down, or stop) based on the predicted behaviors of the objects.
- Other characteristics/factors may be considered as well in order to determine the speed of the autonomous vehicle, such as a lateral position of the autonomous vehicle in a road/lane of travel, curvature of the road, proximity of static and dynamic objects, etc.
- a computing device configured to adjust the speed of an autonomous vehicle, may identify multiple objects ahead of the vehicle.
- the objects may include, for example, other vehicles travelling ahead of the autonomous vehicle in the same lane as the autonomous vehicle, such as trucks, bicycles, and motorcycles.
- the objects may also include other types of static or dynamic objects, such as pedestrians, stop signs, a toll booth, trees, guard rails, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to estimate characteristics of each object, such as the object's speed, acceleration, size, weight, direction of travel, and longitudinal and lateral speeds.
- the computing device may determine a buffer distance for each object between the autonomous vehicle and the farthest identified object from the autonomous vehicle. For example, if the computing device identifies a first and second object ahead of the vehicle, the second object being at a greater distance from the autonomous vehicle than the first object, the computing device may determine a first buffer distance at which the autonomous vehicle will substantially reach a speed of the first object, and also determine a second buffer distance at which the first object will substantially reach a speed of the second object.
- the buffer distances may be based on the speeds of the identified objects. In some examples, the buffer distances may also be based on other characteristics of the identified objects.
- the computing device may then determine a distance at which to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle.
- the distance may also be a function of other characteristics of the objects and the autonomous vehicle, as well as any predetermined (e.g., calibrated) constants.
- the computing device may be configured to then provide instructions to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle based on the distance.

- the points may be represented by the LIDAR device in terms of azimuth and elevation angles, in addition to range, which can be converted to (X, Y, Z) point data relative to a local coordinate frame attached to the autonomous vehicle.
- the LIDAR device may be configured to provide to the computing device intensity values of the light or laser reflected off the obstacles that may be indicative of a surface type of a given object. Based on such information, the computing device may be configured to identify the objects and characteristics of the objects such as type of the object, size, speed, whether the object is a traffic sign with a retroreflective surface, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to receive, from a RADAR device (e.g., the RADAR unit 130 in FIG. 1 ) coupled to the autonomous vehicle and in communication with the computing device, RADAR-based information relating to location and characteristics of the objects.
- the RADAR device may be configured to emit radio waves and receive back the emitted radio waves that bounced off the surface of objects on the road and in the vicinity of the road.
- the received signals or RADAR-based information may be indicative, for example, of dimensional characteristics of a given object, and may indicate whether the given object is stationary or moving.
- the computing device may be configured to have access to map information that identifies static objects that are permanently placed on the road such as traffic lights, traffic signs, guard rails, etc.
- the map information may also be updated periodically, and may include information about accidents that have recently occurred and the resulting wreckage or traffic that may be in the vicinity of the autonomous vehicle.
- the computing device may be configured to detect and identify the objects and characteristics of the objects based on information received from multiple sources such as the image-capture device, the LIDAR device, the RADAR device, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from a subset of the multiple sources. For example, images captured by the image-capture device may be blurred due to a malfunction of the image-capture device, and in another example, details of the road may be obscured in the images because of fog.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR units and may be configured to disregard the information received from the image-capture device.
- the autonomous vehicle may be travelling in a portion of the road where some electric noise or jamming signals may cause the LIDAR device and/or RADAR device to operate incorrectly.
- the computing device may be configured to identify the objects based on information received from the image-capture device, and may be configured to disregard the information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR units.
- the computing device may be configured to rank these sources of information based on a condition of the road (e.g., fog, electronic jamming, etc.).
- the ranking may be indicative of which device(s) to rely on or give more weight to in identifying the objects.
- the LIDAR and RADAR devices may be ranked higher than the image-based device, and information received from the LIDAR and/or RADAR devices may be given more weight than respective information received from the image-capture device.
- the computing device may also be configured to receive, from sensors and devices coupled to the autonomous vehicle, information associated with, for example, condition of systems and subsystems of the autonomous vehicle. Further, the computing device may be configured to receive information associated with the surrounding environment of the autonomous vehicle, such as driving conditions and road conditions (e.g., rain, snow, etc.). For example, information indicating that the road is icy or wet ahead of the vehicle may cause the computing device to modify its adjustment of the autonomous vehicle's speed. Other examples are also possible.
- the method 300 includes determining a first buffer distance, the first buffer distance being a minimal distance behind the first object at which the autonomous vehicle will substantially reach a speed of the first object. Further, at block 308 , the method includes determining a second buffer distance, the second buffer distance being a minimal distance behind the second object at which the first object will substantially reach a speed of the second object. Still further, at block 310 , the method includes determining a distance at which to adjust a speed of the autonomous vehicle based on the first and second buffer distances and the speed of the autonomous vehicle. It should be understood that other buffer distances may be determined as well when other objects are identified within an environment of the autonomous vehicle in addition to the first and second objects.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an example scenario for determining the buffer distances and the distance at which to adjust the speed of the vehicle.
- an autonomous vehicle 400 e.g., a computing device of the autonomous vehicle travelling in the +y-direction may identify a plurality of objects 402 - 408 substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle 400 and also travelling in the +y-direction.
- the plurality of objects 402 - 408 may include an object travelling ahead of the autonomous vehicle 400 , such as vehicle 402 , and multiple objects between the autonomous vehicle 400 and vehicle 402 , such as vehicle 404 , vehicle 406 , and vehicle 408 .
- each vehicle may have respective characteristics that can be used to determine the distance, such as a range from the vehicle to the autonomous vehicle 400 , r i , a speed/velocity of the car, v i , and an acceleration (or deceleration) of the car, a i .
- the autonomous vehicle 400 may also have characteristics that can be used to determine the distance, such as a speed/velocity of the autonomous vehicle 400 , r 0 , and an acceleration/deceleration of the autonomous vehicle 400 , a 0 . Further, the distance may be based on a longitudinal speed of the autonomous vehicle, v LONG , and a lateral speed of the autonomous vehicle, v LAT . In some examples, in addition to the distance being based on the speed of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., the current speed of the autonomous vehicle), the distance may be further based on other characteristics of the vehicle, including the autonomous vehicle's direction of motion, size, position on a path of travel, and type, among other characteristics.
- the autonomous vehicle 400 may also determine a buffer distance for each of the vehicles 402 - 408 and may use each buffer distance to predict the behavior of the vehicles 402 - 408 and determine a distance behind the vehicles that the autonomous vehicle 400 should adjust its speed.
- Each buffer distance may represent a minimal distance behind a given vehicle at which another vehicle directly following the given vehicle will match (or substantially reach) the speed of the given vehicle. By determining the buffer distances, the autonomous vehicle 400 can determine when (or at what distance from the nearest or furthest object) it will need to adjust its speed.
- the autonomous vehicle 400 may determine that vehicle 404 will match the speed of vehicle 402 at buffer distance b 4 , that vehicle 406 will match the speed of vehicle 404 at buffer distance b 3 , and that vehicle 408 will match the speed of vehicle 406 at buffer distance b 2 .
- buffer distance b 1 is approximately zero since vehicle 408 is closest in proximity to the autonomous vehicle 400 and thus the autonomous vehicle 400 can be assumed to be matching the speed of vehicle 408 .
- the autonomous vehicle 400 may determine the buffer distances and thus determine that for each vehicle between the autonomous vehicle 400 and vehicle 402 , the autonomous vehicle 400 will need to slow down earlier (at a certain distance from vehicle 402 ). The autonomous vehicle 400 may then begin to slow down before vehicles 404 - 408 react to the speed change of vehicle 402 and begin to slow down as well.
- the buffer distance may be a function of the range from the vehicle to the given vehicle, and may be shorter when the vehicle is further away from the autonomous vehicle 400 .
- the buffer distance of vehicle 402 , b 4 may be shorter than the other buffer distances because vehicle 402 is the furthest away from the autonomous vehicle 400 and thus its future behavior does not affect the autonomous vehicle 400 as much as the behaviors of the vehicles closer to the vehicle 400 .
- the buffer distance may be determined by multiplying a given time constant by the speed of the vehicle 400 . Other examples of determining buffer distances are also possible.
- FIG. 4B another example scenario for determining the distance at which to adjust the speed of the vehicle.
- an autonomous vehicle 450 similar to the autonomous vehicle 400 of FIG. 4A that is travelling in the +y-direction may identify a plurality of objects 452 - 458 substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle 450 .
- the autonomous vehicle 450 may identify a red traffic light 452 (e.g., the second object) at a range of r S from the vehicle 450 .
- the autonomous vehicle 450 may identify vehicle 454 , vehicle 456 , and vehicle 458 , each travelling in the +y-direction, and determine characteristics of each vehicle, such as respective speed (longitudinal and lateral), acceleration, range from the autonomous vehicle 450 , and others.
- the autonomous vehicle 450 may be configured to determine a distance at which to adjust its speed. Further, the autonomous vehicle 450 may determine the distance before the vehicles 454 - 458 begin to slow down and stop due to the upcoming red traffic light ahead. In other words, the autonomous vehicle 450 may predict that the vehicles 454 - 458 will need to begin slowing down and stop before the red traffic light 452 and thus adjust its speed before the vehicles 454 - 458 come to a stop or begin to decelerate. In some scenarios, the red traffic light 452 may instead be a stopped vehicle or other object that is not moving, and would be identified and treated the same way by the autonomous vehicle 450 in such scenarios (e.g., as an object travelling at zero speed).
- the autonomous vehicle 450 may determine that it needs to come to a stop over the distance r S . However, in examples such as the one illustrated in FIG. 4B , the autonomous vehicle 450 may determine that it has a shorter distance to come to a stop since vehicles 454 - 458 are in front of it. As such, the autonomous vehicle 450 may determine the distance at which to adjust its speed based on the range, r S , and a buffer distance, b S .
- the buffer distance may be based on a length of a given object or objects and a predetermined minimal gap between each object at zero speed.
- each vehicle may have a length, y.
- the length of the objects may be different in other examples.
- the predetermined (e.g., estimated) minimal gap between each vehicle when stopped may be a gap, x.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine the distance at which to adjust its speed based on the current state of the traffic light.
- the autonomous vehicle may be configured to predict a change in a state of the traffic light. For instance, the autonomous vehicle may determine that, while the traffic light is currently red, the traffic light may change to green after a given period of time. Depending on the given period of time, the autonomous vehicle may consider the traffic light as a green traffic light and predict that the vehicles between the autonomous vehicle and the traffic light will begin to increase their speed. The autonomous vehicle may then speed up, slow down, or maintain speed, depending on its current speed.
- the autonomous vehicle may be approaching a red traffic light, but may be a far enough distance away from the traffic light and stopped vehicles in front of the traffic light that it has not yet begun to slow down.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine that the traffic light will change from red to green after a short period of time and thus determine that the vehicles will begin to accelerate soon. Since the autonomous vehicle may still be a far distance from the traffic light and the vehicles, the autonomous vehicle may maintain its current speed (or increase its speed) if it determines that the vehicles will have sped up enough by the time the autonomous vehicle gets closer to them so that the autonomous vehicle's current speed (or increased speed) may substantially match the speed of the previously-stopped vehicle closest to the autonomous vehicle that the autonomous vehicle is approaching (e.g., vehicle 458 in FIG. 4B ). Other examples are also possible.
- the reasoning applied in the example described with respect to FIG. 4B can also apply to examples where the plurality of identified objects are moving (e.g., no traffic control devices), such as the example described with respect to FIG. 4A .
- the distances/ranges between the autonomous vehicle 450 , the red traffic light 452 , and the vehicles 454 - 458 as illustrated in FIG. 4B may not be to scale. Specifically, it is likely that the distance between vehicle 454 and the red traffic light 452 would be much greater than the minimal gap distance between vehicles, x.
- the method 300 includes providing instructions to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle based on the distance.
- the computing device may adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle prior to determining a change of the speed of one or more of the dynamic objects.
- the control system of the autonomous vehicle may comprise multiple control strategies that may be predetermined or adaptive to changes in a driving environment of the autonomous vehicle, the driving environment including the predicted actions of objects substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle, behind the autonomous vehicle, and/or to the side of the autonomous vehicle.
- a control strategy may comprise sets of instructions or rules associated with traffic interaction in various driving contexts.
- the control strategy may comprise rules that determine a speed of the autonomous vehicle, steering angle, and a lane that the autonomous vehicle may travel on while taking into account safety and traffic rules and concerns (e.g., other vehicles stopped at an intersection and windows-of-opportunity in yield situation, lane tracking, speed control, distance from other vehicles on the road, passing other vehicles, and queuing in stop-and-go traffic, and avoiding areas that may result in unsafe behavior such as oncoming-traffic lanes, etc.).
- the computing device may be configured to determine, based on the distance determined at block 310 , a control strategy comprising rules for actions that control speed, steering angle, and lane of the autonomous vehicle.
- the control strategy may also be further based on a lateral distance between the autonomous vehicle and nearby objects (e.g., road boundaries and vehicles travelling in adjacent lanes). Further, a given control strategy (or multiple strategies) may comprise a program or computer instructions that characterize actuators controlling the autonomous vehicle (e.g., throttle, steering gear, brake, accelerator, or transmission shifter).
- actuators controlling the autonomous vehicle e.g., throttle, steering gear, brake, accelerator, or transmission shifter
- the instructions provided by the computing device to adjust the control of the autonomous vehicle may be based on road geometry, such as if the road is straight, curving slightly, curving sharply, etc.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an implementation of the example method on a road of travel.
- the vehicle 500 may be in a lane 501 on a road such as a highway.
- the computing device configured to control the autonomous vehicle 500 may be configured to identify a plurality of objects substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle 500 on the road of travel.
- the plurality of objects may include an object 502 , such as a moving object (e.g., cars, trucks, etc.), that is in the same lane 501 as the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the plurality of objects may also include moving objects 504 , 506 , 508 , and 510 that are in an adjacent lane 511 to the lane 501 of the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the computing device may not be configured to identify object 510 until the entirety of the length of the object 510 is in front of the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the computing device may be configured to identify other objects within the environment of the autonomous vehicle 500 , such as object 512 located behind the autonomous vehicle 500 in an adjacent lane. In other examples, the computing device may be configured to ignore objects, such as object 514 , that may be beyond a threshold distance from the autonomous vehicle 500 . The computing device may also identify static objects such as a guard rail 516 . The computing device further may be configured to determine characteristics of the objects 502 - 516 , such as size, location, speed, etc.
- the autonomous vehicle 500 may be configured to only identify objects substantially in front of it, and may thus ignore objects 512 and 514 .
- the computing device may be configured to identify objects 512 and 514 , but may ignore them until they are within a threshold distance from the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the computing device may monitor characteristics of objects 512 and 514 so as to predict their future behavior while not yet taking their characteristics into account in determining the distance at which to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 until the objects are within the threshold distance from the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the autonomous vehicle 500 may predict that object 512 will accelerate, exceed the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 , and pass the autonomous vehicle 500 .
- the autonomous vehicle 500 may predict other actions of the object 512 as well (e.g., object 512 may pass the autonomous vehicle and move into the same lane as the autonomous vehicle).
- the computing device may determine the distance at which to adjust the speed of the autonomous vehicle 500 based on identified objects 502 - 516 , their characteristics, and respective buffer distances. In some examples, however, the computing device may determine that one or more objects substantially in front of the autonomous vehicle 500 , such as object 508 , may change lanes or are in the process of changing lanes. As such, the computing device may modify the distance to account for this (e.g., adjust the buffer distances). For instance, if object 508 changes lanes from lane 511 to lane 501 , object 508 may be closer in proximity to the autonomous vehicle 500 and thus the autonomous vehicle 500 may need to adjust its speed in order to match the speed of object 508 .
- the autonomous vehicle 500 may have been travelling at a higher speed since no objects were identified to be in the same lane 501 as the autonomous vehicle 500 and object 502 , and after detecting that object 508 has changed lanes, the autonomous vehicle 500 may reduce its speed. Further, the computing device may predict that object 510 will speed up to match the speed of object 506 once object 508 has fully or partially entered lane 501 . The computing device may be configured to make other determinations/predictions as well, and modify the distance accordingly.
- the computing device may be configured to prioritize amongst the identified objects 502 - 516 in order to determine the distance. For instance, if object 508 is in the same lane 501 as the autonomous vehicle 500 and object 502 , the behavior of object 508 may be taken more into account than the behaviors of objects 504 , 506 , and 510 , which are in the adjacent lane 511 . Such prioritization may take the form of modified buffer distances, for example (e.g., the buffer distance of object 510 may be shorter than the buffer distance of object 508 , despite object 510 being closer in proximity to the autonomous vehicle 500 ). Thus, the computing device may be configured to add or subtract a buffer amount of distance to the determined distance to account for or compensate for such lane changes, as well as for any other changes in the environment of the autonomous vehicle 500 . The prioritization may be implemented in other ways as well.
- the method described above may only be implemented by the computing device when there is at least one moving object between the autonomous vehicle and the second object, in addition to the identified first object. In examples where there are no moving objects between the autonomous vehicle and the second object, the method described above may not be implemented, or may be implemented in accordance with another method or methods not described herein.
