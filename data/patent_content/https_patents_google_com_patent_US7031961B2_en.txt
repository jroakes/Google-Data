Definitions
- the invention relates to the field of information searching and browsing, and more particularly to a system and method for enhancing searches and recommending documents in a collection through the use of bookmarks shared among a community of users.
- the World Wide Web is a loosely interlinked collection of documents (mostly text and images) located on servers distributed over the Internet.
- each document has an address, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in the exemplary form “http://www.server.net/directory/file.html”.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- the “www.server.net” specifies the name of a computer, or server, on which the document resides; “directory” refers to a directory or folder on the server in which the document resides; and “file.html” specifies the name of the file.
- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- external content such as images and other multimedia data types
- hotlinks or “links” to other documents to be placed within the document, among other things.
- Hotlinking allows a user to navigate between documents on the Web simply by selecting an item of interest within a page. For example, a Web page about reprographic technology might have a hotlink to the Xerox corporate web site.
- the hotlink By selecting the hotlink (often by clicking a marked word, image, or area with a pointing device, such as a mouse), the user's Web browser is instructed to follow the hotlink (usually via a URL, frequently invisible to the user, associated with the hotlink) and read a different document.
- Bookmarks allow a user to identify which documents he would like to keep track of. The user's local machine then keeps track of the URLs for those sites, allowing the user to reload and view the sites' contents at any desired time. Bookmarks can be thought of as “pointers” to content on the Web, each specifying an address that identifies the location of the desired document, but not including the document's content (except, perhaps, in a descriptive title of the document).
- a user's bookmarks are stored and maintained in a special HTML file stored on the user's local machine.
- This file includes a list of sites represented as title and URL pairs (in a user-defined hierarchy, if desired).
- the user's entire set of bookmarks is contained within a single HTML file.
- Recent versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer store user bookmarks (or “favorites,” using Microsoft's preferred terminology) as individual files on the local machine's file system. Each favorite is a small file containing the site's URL, while the favorite's title is stored as the filename.
- None of the foregoing browsers permit much sophisticated user of a user's collection of bookmarks, although some limited manipulations are possible. For example, it is usually possible to create and modify a hierarchy of bookmarks (including sorting and moving existing bookmarks around within the hierarchy); to modify the titles paired with the URLs, to search for words within the titles or URLs; and often to derive some additional information about the bookmarks, such as the date and time of the user's most-recent visit to the site, the collected number of visits, and possibly other information.
- the bookmark facilities of Web browsers act as a “filter” for those documents a particular user finds to be important or useful. While a user might view hundreds of Web pages in a day, only a few of those are typically found to provide useful information. If that information is expected to be useful again in the future, the user will often set a bookmark for those pages. This is a useful way for users to be able to access the Internet; however, traditional bookmarks have the distinct limitation that they are only useful to the extent a user has seen the sites before, since adding a bookmark to a collection is a manual act, typically performed when either the desired page is already being viewed or a URL has been manually received from another person.
- bookmarks can be exported to a public web page, allowing others to view and use the bookmarks, but that in itself does not provide any additional functionality.
- search engine serves as an index into the content stored on the Internet.
- search engines There are two primary categories of search engines: those that include documents and Web sites that are analyzed and used to populate a hierarchy of subject-matter categories (e.g., Yahoo), and those that “crawl” the Web or document collections to build a searchable database of terms, allowing keyword searches on page content (such as AltaVista, Excite, and Infoseek, among many others).
- subject-matter categories e.g., Yahoo
- keyword searches on page content such as AltaVista, Excite, and Infoseek, among many others.
- recommendation systems which are capable of providing Web site recommendations based on criteria provided by a user or by comparison to a single preferred document (e.g., Firefly, Excite's “more like this” feature).
- Google is an example of a search engine that incorporates several recommendation-system-like features. It operates in a similar manner to traditional keyword-based search engines, in that a search begins by the user's entry of one or more search terms used in a pattern-matching analysis of documents on the Web. It differs from traditional keyword-based search engines (such as AltaVista), in that search results are ranked based on a metric of page “importance,” which differs from the number of occurrences of the desired search terms (and simple variations upon that theme).
- traditional keyword-based search engines such as AltaVista
- Google's metric of importance is based upon two primary factors: the number of pages (elsewhere on the Web) that link to a page (i.e., “inlinks,” defining the retrieved page as an “authority”), and the number of pages that the retrieved page links to (i.e., “outlinks,” defining the retrieved page as a “hub”).
- a page's inlinks and outlinks are weighted, based on the Google-determined importance of the linked pages, resulting in an importance score for each retrieved page.
- the search results are presented in order of decreasing score, with the most important pages presented first.
- Google's page importance metric is based on the pattern of links on the Web as a whole, and is not limited (and at this time cannot be limited) to the preferences of a single user or group of users.
- CLEVER CLient-side EigenVector Enhanced Retrieval
- Google operates like a traditional search engine, and uses inlinks/authorities and outlinks/hubs as metrics of page importance. Again, importance (based on links throughout the Web) is used to rank search results.
- page content e.g., the words surrounding inlinks and outlinks
- CLEVER does not use its own database of Web content; rather, it uses an external hub, such as an index built by another search engine, to define initial communities of documents on the Web. From hubs on the Web that frequently represent people's interests, CLEVER is able to identify communities, and from those communities, identify related or important pages.
- Direct Hit is a service that cooperates with traditional search engines (such as HotBot), attempting to determine which pages returned in a batch of results are interesting or important, as perceived by users who have previously performed similar searches.
- Direct Hit tracks which pages in a list of search results are accessed most frequently; it is also able to track the amount of time users spend at the linked sites before returning to the search results. The most popular sites are promoted (i.e., given higher scores) for future searches.
- Alexa is a system that is capable of tracking a user's actions while browsing. By doing so, Alexa maintains a database of users' browsing histories. Page importance is derived from other users' browsing histories. Accordingly, at any point (not just in the context of a search), Alexa can provide a user with information on related pages, derived from overall traffic patterns, link structures, page content, and editorial suggestions.
- Knowledge Pump a Xerox system, provides community-based recommendations by initially allowing users to identify their interests and “experts” in the areas of those interests. Knowledge Pump is then able to “push” relevant information to the users based on those preferences; this is accomplished by monitoring network traffic to create profiles of users, including their interests and “communities of practice,” thereby refining the community specifications.
- Knowledge Pump does not presently perform any enhanced search and retrieval actions like the search-engine-based systems described above.
- the present system and method facilitate searching and recommending resources, or documents, based upon a collection of user document preferences shared by a large group of users.
- the invention leverages several of the key properties of document collections: only valuable documents are bookmarked; documents are usually categorized into a hierarchy; and documents can be shared.
- the present system combines some attributes of bookmark systems, as discussed above, with some attributes of search engines and recommendation systems, also discussed above.
- the present system and method maintain a centralized database of bookmarks or user document preferences.
- This centralized database is maintained as a hierarchy, with individual users' bookmarks maintained separately from other users' bookmarks.
- the maintenance of the centralized database facilitates harnessing the power and flexibility of being able to use, in various ways, all users' public bookmarks and the information contained in and referenced by those bookmarks.
- the system and method of the present invention allows for several operations to be performed, including enhanced search and retrieval, enhanced subject-matter-based recommendation generation (for both documents and groups), and automatic document categorization and summarization.

- FIG. 19 is a flow chart illustrating the sequence of steps performed in generating an augmented search and contextually ranked results in accordance with the system of FIG. 17 .
- a bookmark system can be implemented as set forth in FIG. 1 .
- the exemplary system includes at least one user 110 , and typically a plurality of users 110 , 112 , 114 , and 116 .
- Each user 110 – 116 is coupled to a document repository 118 , such as the Internet (or the World Wide Web), a corporate Intranet, a library, or any other collection of documents.
- Documents in this context, refers to any data file containing information readable by a machine or a human; the term includes (but is not limited to) text files, formatted text files, bitmapped image files (including images representing text-based documents), vector-based image files, sound files, multimedia files, and any other data files of possible interest.
- Documents may be static or dynamically generated based on information in the URL or other request presented to access the document as well as other contextual information, such as the time of day.
- the repository 118 may be situated on distributed servers such as Web servers on the Internet, a single group of dedicated servers such as a corporate information center, or a single host server.
- bookmark database 120 Also in communication with the repository 118 (and the users 110 – 116 ) is a bookmark database 120 .
- the bookmark database 120 maintains a set of bookmarks for each user 110 – 116 ; each user may maintain private bookmarks, which are shielded by the database 120 from the other users, as well as public bookmarks, which are made available by the database 120 for various uses by other users.
- the specific operation of the bookmark database 120 will be set forth in additional detail below.
- a user's primary interaction with the bookmark database 120 takes place through a main bookmark window 210 ( FIG. 2 ) provided by the user's browser 122 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the illustrated bookmark window 210 includes a list of bookmarks 212 , a list of categories 213 , the user's screen name “cwixon” 214 , and several cosmetic separators 216 .
- a data entry area 218 is also provided, and will be discussed in further detail below.
- the user 110 can access bookmarks within the list 212 in several possible ways.
- a single bookmark e.g., the White House bookmark 220
- the user's browser 122 will open a new window and bring up the document referenced by the bookmark 220 , in this case the White House's Web site.
- the browser 122 will bring up the document in that window.
- the system in its preferred embodiment, logs the event of accessing the bookmark 220 to facilitate tracking frequency and recency of use for all bookmarks.
- the main bookmark window 210 next to the list of bookmarks 212 , there are three columns 222 , 224 , and 226 for informational icons representing whether the documents corresponding to each bookmark are available, relatively new, or popular.
- the first column 222 is reserved for an icon representing that a particular document is presently unavailable.
- an unavailability icon 228 is shown next to the “This is a Bad Link” bookmark; the system is able to alert the user that no such document exists without the need for the user to manually verify the site's availability.
- the system is able to recommend alternative documents when a preferred document is unavailable; that capability will be discussed in further detail below.
- the second column 224 is reserved for an icon representing that a particular document is new or has been revised within the last thirty days.
- a newness icon 230 is shown next to the Infoseek bookmark; the presence of that icon in the presently implemented and illustrated embodiment tells the user that the Infoseek main page (the one referenced by the bookmark) has been updated recently, within the last thirty days.
- the newness icon 230 can be used in combination with the recency-of-access tracking performed by the invention, thereby alerting the user that a document has been updated since the user last accessed or viewed the document.
- the third column 226 is reserved for an icon representing the popularity of a particular document.
- a popularity icon 232 is shown next to the AltaVista bookmark because that bookmark is present in over 50% of all users' bookmark collections.
- the popularity icon 232 can thus be an indication of the quality of the information likely to be found in the document, since other users are also relying upon it.
- 50% over all users
- the threshold percentage may be made a user-definable preference, or may be based on some other metric (such as the percentage over a specified group of users).
- each icon is explained via a popup message when the user's mouse pointer (or other selection tool) is positioned over the icon. For example, by positioning the mouse pointer over the unavailability icon 228 , a “Document Unavailable” message would be presented to the user.
- the icons in columns 222 , 224 , and 226 are presented to each user on the basis of information tracked and maintained by the bookmark database 120 .
- the database 120 tracks availability and newness for each bookmark in the background, without user intervention, to achieve some efficiencies that would not otherwise be possible when each user maintains a separate local collection of bookmarks. Specifically, and particularly in the case of popular bookmarks, the information on availability and newness can be updated for the benefit of plural users at one time through one simple attempted access operation by the bookmark database 120 .
- a user's bookmarks can be divided into categories (such as the categories in the list 213 ); the list 212 shown in FIG. 2 is the “top level” list in user cwixon's hierarchy, as illustrated by the “slash” 234 presented after the user's screen name 214 .
- This is consistent with the traditional Unix-like method for specifying hierarchies of directories, in which a slash character alone represents the root or top-level directory.
- the user 110 can access the other categories in the list 213 by clicking on those category names.
- the list of bookmarks 212 will be replaced with a different list taken from the chosen category (such as News or Weather in the illustrated example), and the slash 234 will be followed by the name of the chosen category.
- the user 110 can return to the top level (or any intermediate level) by clicking on the screen name 214 or any following category name.
- the main bookmark window 210 contains a notation 236 that the displayed category (in this case, the top-level category) is private. When that is the case, only the user 110 that owns (i.e., contributed) the list 212 can access those bookmarks. By selecting a “Publish” button 238 in the data entry area 218 , the user 110 can make those bookmarks available to all users; otherwise, the bookmarks in the category remain private.
- a user can choose to publish any category of bookmarks (or even a single bookmark or selection of bookmarks) to the community of users as a whole, or only to selected groups of users. The concept of groups will be described in further detail below.
- main bookmark window 210 shows the bookmarks for a single user, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is also possible to browse, view, and use public bookmarks, either as an entire categorized collection, or broken down via groups of users.
- a “quick add” option 240 is available; when selected, any URL or document location dragged into the window 210 will be immediately added to the list 212 without any intermediate confirmation step.
- the ordinary “add” function of the main bookmark window 210 will cause a confirmation window ( FIG. 5 , described below) to appear before a bookmark is added via the drag-and-drop method.
- a search text-entry box 242 is also provided in the data entry area 218 .
- the system will search for bookmarks containing (either in the title or in the URL) the requested keywords.
- a “Search Public Bookmarks” option 244 the search can be extended to all users' public bookmarks (see FIG. 4 , described below).
- the main bookmark window 210 also provides a command selection drop-down listbox 246 ; the contents of the command selection listbox 246 are shown in FIG. 3 .
- the user can add bookmarks, separators, and categories; import and export bookmarks between the bookmark system of the invention and, for example, Netscape's internal bookmark system (described in the background section above), edit the user's preferences (such as password, e-mail address, etc.); log out of the system; edit a document; show a document (ordinarily performed by simply clicking or dragging a bookmark, as described above); or show a directory of users (used to access a particular user's public bookmarks).
- command selection drop-down listbox 246 as illustrated in the window 310 of FIG. 3 , involve simple data manipulation and will not be described in further detail (except in the context of the general operation of the system in FIGS. 9–12 ). These functions would be easily implemented by a person of ordinary skill in the art of Web-based application programming.
- FIG. 4 is a search results window 410 illustrating a sample set of search results; the keyword entered into the text entry box 242 in the illustrated embodiment was “internet.” Accordingly, the search results window 410 includes a list 412 of bookmarks containing, either in the title or URL, the word “internet.”
- the exemplary search was performed with the “Search Public Bookmarks” option 244 selected, so the list 412 can include bookmarks from all users.
- the category in which each bookmark in the list 412 was found is presented next to the corresponding bookmark. For example, an “Internet Info” bookmark 414 was found in some user's “Internet” category; for privacy reasons, the user's identity is concealed.
- the user can click or drag bookmarks from the search results window 410 to access the documents referenced by the bookmarks in the list 412 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates an “Add New Bookmark” window 510 used by the user interface of the presently implemented embodiment of the invention.
- this window 510 is accessed by selecting the “add bookmark” command from the command selection listbox 246 ( FIG. 2 ).
- the user 110 can then manually select a category 512 in which to add the bookmark, enter the URL or other identifier 514 for the bookmark, and enter a title 516 for the bookmark.
- An “Add” button 518 is provided, and when chosen, the bookmark system adds the specified bookmark to the list 212 .
- the category field 512 and URL field 514 are already filled in, and can be edited by the user if desired before confirming the action by pressing the “Add” button 518 .
- FIG. 6 represents a bookmark editing window 610 presented by the user interface of the presently implemented embodiment of the invention.
- This window 610 is accessed by pressing an “Edit” button 248 in the main bookmark window 210 ( FIG. 2 ).
- the editing window 610 has been scrolled down to reveal the bottom of the window; the top (not seen) includes the data entry area 218 ( FIG. 2 ).
- a list 614 of bookmarks to be edited is presented within the editing window 610 ; the bookmarks are preceded by a column of checkboxes 616 available to indicate which bookmarks are to be edited.
- a “Select None” button 618 or a “Select All” button 620 none or all of the checkboxes 616 will be selected, respectively. Editing operations, as indicated by the remaining buttons within the editing window 610 , can then be performed on the selected bookmarks. For example, after selecting one or more bookmarks, pressing a “Delete” button 622 will remove the selected bookmarks from the list 614 (and from the list 212 in the main bookmark window 210 ).
- a “Move to” button 624 and corresponding category selection listbox 626 are provided to move one or more selected bookmarks to a different category.
- a “Move Bookmarks to Top” button 628 and a “Move Bookmarks to Bottom” button 630 are provided to facilitate moving one or more selected bookmarks around within the displayed category.
- these editing commands will not be discussed in further detail, as they represent simple data manipulation operations easily implemented by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
- the present invention harnesses the power of online communities to allow enhanced search-and-retrieval and recommendation operations. These operations are enhanced through the use of data derived from a collection of users' shared bookmarks.
- the present invention uses communities of users as follows.
- FIG. 7 the millions of users participating in the Internet are represented by eighteen representative users 710 .
- Two groups 712 and 714 are highlighted.
- a first group 712 contains six users; for the purposes of this example, suppose that the first group 712 is interested in financial information.
- a second group 714 also contains six users; for exemplary purposes, suppose that the second group 714 is interested in computer programming.
- the groups need not be (and in this example are not) mutually exclusive, as one user 716 is a member of both the first group 712 and the second group 714 .
- not every user must have a defined interest.
- the present invention is able to use the preferences of the entire Internet 710 , one or more groups 712 or 714 , or even a single user 716 to provide recommendations on preferred documents and to enhance search queries and results. The operations performed in doing so will be described in further detail below in conjunction with FIGS. 14 and 15 .
- FIG. 8 illustrates schematically a similar breakdown of documents on the Internet.
- the millions of documents available on the Internet are represented by 24 exemplary documents 810 . While there are many, many documents available, only a small portion of them 812 are typically used or accessed by a community of users. And of those accessed, only a small number are preferred and bookmarked 814 .
- the distillation of the entire Internet down to those documents that are bookmarked 814 is a powerful two-step filter that tends to pull out only the most relevant, interesting, and valuable documents.
- a community of users' bookmarks are shared, other users' efforts in locating useful documents can work to the entire community's advantage through a system according to the invention.
- the browser 112 can be used relatively passively, to collect user input and pass it along to the database 120 for processing.
- This presently preferred mode of operation is illustrated as a block diagram in FIG. 9 .
- a user's system or terminal 910 hosts a Web browser 912 such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer; the browser 912 is able to interpret both HTML and JavaScript (or another HTML-embeddable scripting language) by way of an HTML interpreter 914 and a JavaScript interpreter 916 .
- the user's system 910 also includes an input device 917 allowing the user to interact with the system 910 , as well as some storage space 918 .
- the user's system 910 and browser 912 receive display information and scripts (arrow 920 ) from the database 922 ; the browser 912 simply passes along user input (arrow 924 ) to the database 922 .
- Essentially all processing is performed at the database 922 by way of a bookmark server 926 and a data processor 928 . The details of the processing will be discussed below in conjunction with FIG. 11 .
- FIG. 10 An alternate mode of operation, in which some of the processing is performed by the user's system, is set forth as a block diagram in FIG. 10 .
- a user's system or terminal 1010 hosts a Web browser 1012 , which in turn includes an HTML interpreter 1014 and a language interpreter 1016 .
- the language interpreter 1016 is able to receive and execute computer programs in a high-level language such as Java; most modem Web browsers include that capability.
- this system also includes a user input device 1017 and temporary storage 1018 .
- the browser 1012 receives bookmark data and a shared bookmarks (“SB M”) computer program (arrow 1020 ) from the database 1022 at the beginning of a session of use; the SBM program allows the user's system 1010 to perform many of the operations disclosed herein (except for those that require large amounts of data in the database).
- SB M shared bookmarks
- a user's bookmark collection can be maintained and modified locally at the user's system 1010 without sending data to and receiving data from the database 1022 .
- the modified bookmark collection (and any other collected information) is transferred back (arrow 1024 ) to the database 1022 for storage and manipulation by the database.
- the persistent data maintained by the shared bookmark system is kept at the database 120 ( FIG. 1 ); the user's local storage 124 is used only for temporary storage during a session. Accordingly, if the user 110 wishes to access the Internet 118 from a different terminal 126 , the shared bookmark system is still operational (provided the user is able to log in using a memorized screen name and password) because all necessary data is received from the database 120 at the beginning of a session, and sent back to the database 120 at the conclusion of the session. Any custom software required, other than the Web browser, is downloaded from the server 120 to the alternate terminal 126 .
- the approach set forth in FIG. 9 has some advantages, in that a complicated bookmark-processing program and a potentially large collection of bookmarks do not need to be downloaded from the database 120 to the user 110 at the beginning of each session. This reduces any lag or delay between the user initiating the service and the availability of the bookmarks, which can be an inconvenience.
- the approach set forth in FIG. 10 has a different set of advantages. To the extent there are any communications bottlenecks between the database 120 and the user 110 , the effects of these bottlenecks will be reduced when the user 110 is able to perform as much computation as possible, without the need to shuttle information back and forth between the user 110 and the database 120 . This approach will also be advantageous if the database 120 tends to be computationally overloaded. However, as stated above, the database 120 still must be accessed for certain operations.
- FIG. 11 illustrates the steps performed in the passive client-side embodiment of the invention (illustrated in block form in FIG. 9 ).
- the system operates by simply awaiting user input (step 1110 ), transmitting that user input from the user's system 110 to the database 120 (step 1120 ), receiving a response from the database 120 (step 1130 ), and refreshing the display (step 1140 ) according to specific HTML and JavaScript instructions received from the database 120 .
- the specific operations on the database side of the system typically represent simple data manipulation operations, which will not be described further. To the extent those operations are more complicated or contain novel steps, they will be described in further detail below.
- FIG. 12 illustrates the steps performed in the active client-side embodiment of the invention (illustrated in block form in FIG. 10 ).
- the system operates by the user 110 initially receiving the shared bookmark program and bookmark collection from the database 120 (step 1210 ).
- the user's system then awaits user input (step 1220 ) and processes the input (step 1230 ) to determine if it requires the processing resources of the database 120 . If the user input comprises a query (step 1240 ) involving other users' bookmarks, the query is transmitted (step 1250 ) to the database 120 and a response is received (step 1260 ) from the database.
- the function of the database 120 at this point will be discussed in further detail below with reference to FIGS. 14 and 15 .
- the user's bookmark collection is updated (step 1270 ) as specified in the shared bookmark program. In both cases, the display is then refreshed (step 1280 ) to reflect the operation, regardless of whether it was performed locally or remotely.
- the user's system 110 transmits back to the database 120 all necessary updated information, including any changes to the user's bookmark collection and any logged events (such as bookmark accesses) used by the invention to determine frequency and recency of use.
- the database 120 performs certain operations in the background maintain the bookmark collections of its users; those operations are set forth in FIG. 13 .
- the database 120 monitors changes (step 1310 ) for each document referred to in each user's bookmark collection. This operation can be performed on a regular basis, for example hourly or daily.
- an icon indicates to the user whether a document has been updated within the last thirty days (see FIG. 2 ), a daily check for updates is sufficient.
- the database 120 can keep either a cached copy of the document referred to (thereby enabling word-for-word comparisons between the old cached copy and an updated version), or preferably, can maintain a simple suitably robust hash value representing the document's contents, whereby any change in the document's contents will cause the hash value to change.
- the database 120 also monitors the availability (step 1320 ) for each document referred to in each user's bookmark collection. This operation can also be performed on a regular basis. For the presently implemented and preferred embodiment of the invention, an icon indicates to the user whether a document is available (see FIG. 2 ). To derive this information, the database periodically attempts to access each document, and if an HTTP error (such as “404 Not Found”) or no data is returned, the document is marked unavailable for all users who have the bookmark in their collection. Unavailable documents are checked again at a later time.
- HTTP error such as “404 Not Found”
- the database 120 monitors the popularity (step 1330 ) for each document referred to in each user's bookmark collection by periodically determining how many users, out of the total number of system users, have a bookmark in their collection. This information is also represented by an icon (see FIG. 2 ).
- various other metrics of popularity are trackable by the system, such as frequency and recency of access. Every time a bookmark is used by a user to access a document, the time, date, and nature of that access is logged. Accordingly, the system is able to use various popularity metrics in the enhanced searching and recommendation operations discussed below.
- metadata is extracted from documents by the database 120 (step 1340 ).
- metadata may include information on the date and time a document was created, the author of the document, search keywords, and many other possible items of data that are typically concealed when a user views a document. This information can optionally be kept with bookmarks in the database 120 to facilitate further search options.
- the contents of documents referred to by users' bookmarks are summarized (step 1350 ) and stored at the database 120 .
- summarization is not performed in the background, it can be specifically performed at the time of a search or upon a user request for a summary.
- summarization techniques are well known in the art. A particularly advantageous summarization method is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,543 to Pedersen et al., entitled “Method and Apparatus for Automatic Document Summarization,” the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all it teaches as though set forth in full herein.
- document summaries optionally can be presented to users as part of a list of search results or within a list of bookmarks, enabling the users to better and more easily determine which documents from a collection are most relevant to their particular interests.
- a similar technique can be used to summarize a group or collection of documents.
- a document summary can be generated based on a concatenation of selected documents, or even all documents referenced in a category of bookmarks.
- the database 120 also maintains itself (step 1360 ) in the background by analyzing users' bookmark collections, eliminating duplicate bookmark entries as necessary, and performing additional tasks (such as “garbage collection”) well known in the art of computer systems.
- the browsing, searching, and bookmark-using habits of users of the shared bookmark system of the invention all contribute additional information to the system for use in improving and refining user group profiles. For example, if a user in a computer programming group searches for, views, and ultimately bookmarks several sites relating to, say, the Objective C programming language, then the user's profile will be automatically updated to include information derived from the bookmarks, and the computer programming group's profile can also be similarly updated. This is accomplished, as will be described in further detail below, by calculating a content vector representative of the bookmarks in a user's (or group's) collection.
- a user can manually choose to become a member of a group having similar interests (as evidenced by manually inspecting the users' public bookmarks), or in an alternative embodiment, can be assigned automatically to groups based on clustering on the user's public bookmarks (or, preferably, the contents of the documents pointed to by the bookmarks).
- clustering or, preferably, the contents of the documents pointed to by the bookmarks.
- One method of automatically grouping users involves identifying the centroid related to each user's public bookmark vectors (either collectively or on a category-by-category basis) in document space, and collecting the mutually-nearest sets of users into topic-related groups.
- a less-automatic method includes computing a centroid, as above, but using that information simply to recommend related groups to the user.
- Another possibility, related to the foregoing automatic grouping scheme, is to create virtual groups based on the topic categories in each user's public bookmarks. For example, if a user has a public bookmark category entitled “Java,” that user can be treated as belonging to a group having an interest in the Java programming language.
- each user and group can have a profile associated therewith.
- a user's profile consists simply of a normalized content vector representing the aggregate contents of all of the user's public bookmarks. For a description of how this vector is calculated, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,778 to Pedersen et al., described above.
- a profile for a group includes a normalized content vector representing the aggregate contents of all public bookmarks belonging to the users within the group.
- the user and group profiles are used in the search and recommendation aspects of the invention, which will be described in further detail below.
- a recommendation service is set forth as a flow chart.
- this service is initiated by a user by selecting a command in the main bookmark window 210 and entering text representative of the desired subject (step 1410 ).
- the user then identifies the context (step 1420 ) within which the recommendation should be generated.
- This step is preferably performed by manually selecting a user or group profile, which as described above, has a content vector associated therewith. If no existing single user or group is satisfactory, a special-purpose group can be assembled by the user by manually selecting users and having those users' profiles merged into a special-purpose content vector.
- the user selects a level of “relevance feedback” (step 1430 ). Relevance feedback allows the user to select whether the desired documents are those similar to the selected context or dissimilar to the selected context.
- a known example of positive relevance feedback is the “more like this” option provided by the Excite search engine.
- the subject, context, and relevance feedback are then processed by the database 120 to generate recommendations (step 1440 ).
- This step uses the popularity (proportion of users having a bookmark) metric 1450 , frequency of use metric 1460 , and recency of use metric 1470 described above.
- the recommendation generation step searches the public bookmarks belonging to the user or group selected as the context (or alternatively, all public bookmarks) for the keywords identified as the subject. These keywords can be found in the title or URL of the public bookmarks, or alternatively, in the content belonging to the public bookmarks. The matches are then analyzed with respect to the content vector and the popularity, frequency, and recency metrics. Alternatively, the keywords are combined with the content vector into an enhanced keyword vector, which is then compared to the entire search corpus in a single search step and then ranked according to popularity, frequency, and recency.
- the recommendation service is also able to use link structure (as described above in connection with the Google and CLEVER systems discussed in the background section above, for example) in generating recommendations.
- link structure as described above in connection with the Google and CLEVER systems discussed in the background section above, for example
- the number of inlinks or outlinks may be weighted and incorporated into the step of generating recommendations (step 1440 ) via the content vector, popularity, frequency, and recency.
- a spreading activation methodology may be used to re-rank recommendations (or search results, as will be described below), or may be used as a weighted factor in the recommendation operation set forth above.
- a spreading activation methodology may be used to re-rank recommendations (or search results, as will be described below), or may be used as a weighted factor in the recommendation operation set forth above.
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,905 to Pirolli et al. entitled “System for Predicting Documents Relevant to Focus Documents by Spreading Activation Through Network Representations of a Linked Collection of Documents,” the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all it teaches as though set forth in full herein.
- Spreading activation techniques are based on representations of Web pages as nodes in graph networks representing usage, content, and hypertext relations among Web pages.
- activation is pumped into one or more of the graph networks at nodes representing some starting set of Web pages (i.e. focal points, which in the context of the present invention may be a set of highly ranked recommendations or search results) and it flows through the arcs of the graph structure, with the amount of flow modulated by the arc strengths (which might also be thought of as arc flow capacities).
- the asymptotic pattern of activation over nodes will define the degree of predicted relevance of Web pages to the starting set of Web pages. By selecting the topmost active nodes or those above some set criterion value, Web pages may be aggregated and/or ranked based on their predicted relevance.
- the closest context matches in the previously-keyword-matched public bookmark collection are returned as the highest-ranking. If the user selected negative relevance feedback (i.e., “documents unlike these”), the closest context matches in the collection are given the lowest rankings.
- the recommendation list is then returned to the user for viewing (step 1480 ).
- recommendations need not be provided only in the context of an explicit request for recommendations in through the main bookmark window 210 ; recommendations can also be provided while a user is browsing the Web. If a Web page the user is viewing contains a link that is also a popular link (by any of the metrics defined above) in the shared bookmark collection (as a whole, or within one or more groups), then the user can be alerted to that via the presentation of a message in the browser window. Alternatively, if there is a historical pattern of documents chosen from the shared bookmark collection (as defined by the frequency and recency metrics), then that pattern can be highlighted for the user.
- One embodiment of the recommendation service is adapted to provide a user with a “substitute” bookmark when a preferred document is unavailable, as indicated by the unavailability icon 228 ( FIG. 2 ).
- This capability is implemented through a variation on the recommendation service set forth in FIG. 14 .
- the user instead of entering text representative of the desired subject (step 1410 ), the user identifies an unavailable bookmark.
- Information stored by the database 120 pertaining to the unavailable bookmark is then used to generate a recommendation; that information may (in various embodiments of the invention) include a content vector, keywords, or a summary of the expected (but missing) content.
- FIG. 15 A search and retrieval system according to the invention is set forth in FIG. 15 as a flow chart.
- the user begins by formulating a keyword query (step 1510 ), identifying a context (step 1520 ), and identifying relevance feedback (step 1530 ).
- the query, context, and feedback are provided to the database 120 , where the query is augmented (step 1540 ).
- query augmentation is performed by selecting the most important (i.e., highest magnitude) words from the context's content vector and adding them to the query.
- the query is augmented by adding the additional context words as words that should be found in the results; if negative feedback has been selected, the query is augmented by adding the additional context words as words that should not be found in the results.
- positive relevance feedback i.e., “documents like these”
- negative feedback the query is augmented by adding the additional context words as words that should not be found in the results.
- the query is then performed.
- the query is performed on the database 120 of public bookmarks (step 1550 ) at the same time it is performed on an external search engine (step 1560 ). If the community of users is sufficiently large, results obtained from the public bookmarks may be superior in quality to those received by querying the Internet; this approach is similar to the recommendation system described above ( FIG. 14 ).
- the search results obtained from the database 120 can be presented to the user separately from or as a part of the search results obtained from the Internet.
- the results are then ranked (step 1570 ) according to the user's selected context, as with the recommendations described above (see step 1440 ). Also, the user may be given the option to employ popularity, frequency, and recency in the ranking operation. And in an alternative embodiment, as described above, link structure may also be used.
- the relative weights of the context match, link structure, popularity, frequency, recency, and any other metrics in the ranking operation are matters of preference, and in a preferred embodiment of the invention, can be adjusted by the user.
- the weights are dynamic and adjustable by the system based on user habits. For example, if a user consistently chooses relatively low-ranked selections in search results lists, that may be seen as an indication that the current metric weights are incorrect, leading to a de-emphasis of the highly weighted factors.
- Such learned weightings can be maintained as global system defaults or, preferably, applied on a user-by-user basis.
- a spreading activation methodology may be used to re-rank search results, or as a factor in the ranking operation set forth above.
- the ranked results are finally returned (step 1580 ) to be viewed by the user.
- the results retrieved from the public bookmark collection can be presented separately from the Internet results, or they can be incorporated into the same list (most likely with higher scores, because of influence from the popularity metric).
- the results retrieved from the public bookmark collection are highlighted to identify their origin.
- a search service according to the invention need not provide both query augmentation and results ranking.
- Advantageous results can be obtained by using either technique alone.
- a query can be augmented by a system according to the invention, after which Internet search engine results are viewed without further modification.
- a user-formulated query can be passed directly to a search engine, with the results being passed through the context and popularity-based ranking scheme of the invention.
- the search and retrieval system discussed in connection with FIGS. 14 and 15 has particular utility when it is used in conjunction with third-party search and retrieval systems, such as the Google information search and retrieval engine, commonly used to examine information repositories such as the World Wide Web.
- third-party search and retrieval systems such as the Google information search and retrieval engine, commonly used to examine information repositories such as the World Wide Web.
- contemporary search and retrieval systems are generally limited in their ability to effect a true understanding of the type of information being sought by a user, particularly when the information search request is presented as a simple key word query.
- a user will provide a key word, or a set of key words, to the search engine which, in turn, attempts to match the search key words with some form of content or content designations, representing the various documents available through the World Wide Web.
- Search engines make use of various weighting techniques, all of which are well understood by those having skill in the art, in order to attempt to extract relevant documents from the information pool in accordance with a key word query.
- search engines are very limited in their ability to handle result diversity, where documents' content might contain all the relevant key words, but represent a topic totally out of context.
- performing a key word search for “java” might naturally result in a search engine's returning a vast number of documents relating to the JAVA programming language, with only a relatively few documents relating to java the coffee, or Java the island. If the relevant user were more interested in obtaining information on java the coffee, particularly grown on Java the island, they would have to wade through a collection of perhaps thousands of documents relating to JAVA the programming language before reaching their goal.
- the system and method of the present invention provides unique query augmentation and contextualization features that can be incorporated within, or provided as an adjunct to, the various conventional search and retrieval systems that are presently employed.
- Combining the inventive system with a conventional search and retrieval engine is particularly advantageous when it is realized that the World Wide Web comprises an information repository, which might be considered as organized in accordance with a rational structure, the use of which might enable the researcher to more efficiently extract relevant information.
- a suitable hierarchical structure might be that defined by ODP, which is a well known and well understood classification model for Web content.
- ODP appropriately labels the nodes, from top level domains to the bottom, with content descriptors, in order that the hierarchical structure can be traversed, from the more general to the more specific, by a perceptive user.
- Implicit in this conceptualization of the Web as a hierarchical structure is the realization that a user need not begin at a top level node in order to traverse the hierarchy and reach a specific sub-level that contains the information they are seeking.
- a user familiar with the ODP structure is able to conduct a search directly within a particular sub-category, provided they are aware of the existence of that sub-category.
- system and method of the present invention allows for a significant degree of query augmentation and contextualization to be added to a conventional key word query search, such that a user is not compelled to remember or even be aware of the identity of a particular sub-category in order to avail themselves of the hierarchical structure comprising the Web.
- the system of the present invention is interposed between a user's terminal or interface device and a search engine, where it functions as both a query augmentation engine and as a contextualization filter.
- the novel system is identified as a relevance engine and is identified generally at 1601 .
- the relevance engine 1601 is functionally interposed between a user 1602 and is configured to receive key word query information from the user and provide a filtered response back to that user.
- the relevance engine 1601 is further coupled to a search engine 1604 , to which it provides an augmented query and from which it receives conventional search results.
- Search engines are conventional in nature and need not be described further herein, except to mention that the engine accesses the Web 1606 and extracts what it feels to be relevant information therefrom in accordance with matching parameters defined by a received query.
- the search engine 1604 is able to provide some degree of recommendation ordering to the search results, but that recommendation ordering is based solely on relevance metrics defined by the Web community as a whole.
- the relevance engine 1601 provides additional relevance filtering to the results returned by the search engine 1604 and offers the filtered search results (either documents, URLs, or some other form of object) to the user 1602 .
- the relevance engine 1701 is interposed between a user 1702 and a search engine 1704 and is configured to receive key word query data from the user and pass, not only an augmented query, but also a contextualized query, to the search engine 1704 .
- context information is provided as a content vector which might, in turn, be made up of individual profile information, group profile information, or a relevance vector derived from an individualized hierarchical relevance model, as will be described in greater detail below.
- Search engine 1704 is able to internalized the augmented query and contextualization information and conduct a search of an information repository 1706 such as the Web with greater efficiency and extract a collection of objects, such as documents, that contain a greater degree of relevance to the user 1702 .
- the relevance engine 1601 or 1701 might be allocated between a user's terminal and database server in the manners described in connection with FIGS. 9 and 10 , above. Indeed, it is not particularly material how the relevance engine is allocated between a user's terminal and a database server, so long as the component portions of the relevance engine are so disposed so as to receive relevant input from a user, process that input in accordance with the invention, and pass the results of such processing to a search engine.
- the system might be implemented, for use in connection with a conventional search engine, by having the search engine's website contain an offering of the novel system, which might be accessed by a user by depressing a button bar, activating a pop-up window, traversing a link, or the like.
- a user activates a link to their favorite search engine, and as the search engine's main screen appears, the user is given the opportunity to subscribe to the novel system and, after having done so, the system is now available for use in conjunction with the user's chosen search engine.
- Relevant portions of the system are downloaded to the user's computer in a manner described above, and gives the user the same functionality and capability as was described above in connection with FIGS. 2–6 .
- the user may organize selected bookmarks (typically found in a user's Favorites folder) into a user-defined categorical structure, join a group and import either all or some portion of that group's hierarchical categorical structure, or both.
- the user is also requested to complete a personalized data form which will be subsequently used as the basis for a personal profile script unique to that user.
- the profile form contains data fields into which certain customary demographic information might be entered by the user, such as age, gender, geographic place of residence, as well as certain particularized interest fields that the user may optionally designate.
- These personalized interest fields correspond to the top level categorical node designators of the categorical hierarchy of the directory system used by the particular search engine in question.
- the particular interest fields might be those 12 to 15 top-level categories identified by ODP, i.e., Sports, Entertainment, News, Business, and the like.
- each individual user's personalized profile information is set forth in a manner which is related to the categorical structure of hierarchical model of the information repository (the Web) used by the search engine.
- the system may be used in conjunction with a search engine in order to provide more directly relevant search results to that particular user.
- the browsing, searching and bookmark-using habits of users of the system all contribute additional information to the system for its use in improving and refining each user's profile information.
- the system is able to use group browsing, searching and bookmark-using habits in order to define and refine that group's profile.
- profile development for both individual users and groups proceeds in a manner as described above, with the user and/or group file being automatically updated to reflect the changing interests and preferences of profile membership.
- a user or group profile comprises a normalized content vector representing the aggregate contents of all of the bookmarks, whether public or private, pertaining to that user or group. Additionally, the profile represents not only the content of a user or group's content collection but also the structure or organization of that content in accordance with the user or group categorical hierarchy scheme. Content contained within a particular categorical designation is processed by the system, as described above, and associated with that categorical hierarchical designation as a further component to the profile's content vector. In this manner, the system builds up a relevance profile for each individual and/or group and maps that profile in accordance with a determined relevance model to collection content.
- individual relevance profiles can be mapped to a global hierarchical structure, such as the ODP categorical model into which Web documents are organized. All that is required is a knowledge of hierarchical categorical structure of the Web organizational model and a training set of documents which are each assigned to particular categorical nodes within the structure.
- the categorical designators for the nodes and the content of the documents associated to each categorical node provides the correspondence metrics between the global hierarchical model (the Web) and a user or group's relevance model represented by an individual or group profile.
- the individual or group profile (also termed a relevance model) defines a simple interest model for the individual or group to which that profile pertains.
- a user's choice of particular bookmarks and the categories to which those bookmarks might be assigned will be understood to represent that user's hierarchical content interest model and that the user's interest model represents a subset or overlay to the global hierarchical model defining the Web.
- Relevance data is mined from each user's profile information and particularly from the structure, organization and content of that user's bookmark collection.
- the system functions, in conjunction with a search engine, to provide augmented query information to the search engine and further to function as a relevance filter to information returned by the search engine from an information repository.
- the user initiates a key word query search by typing the search key words into a data entry field and forwarding the query to the inventive system.
- the inventive system augments the query with information derived from that user's profile information and additionally, with information derived from where that user might be positioned within the user's information space when initiating the query.
- the system would augment a query for the term “java” with additional key words associated to content derived from the “computer programming” category.
- the user's location within the computer programming category would suggest an immediate interest in JAVA the programming language with respect to the user's key word query search.
- the system is able to recognize a “temporal” interest expressed by the user in JAVA the programming language, due to the user's spatial location within their own categorical hierarchy when the search was initiated.
- the user's location within their categorical hierarchy defines a content vector which is added to key word query terms and passed to the search engine as an augmented key word query.
- the search engine uses the augmented key word query to examine the collection of documents compiled in the information repository, computer match thereto, and return a more relevant set of documents to the user than what might be expected from the initial, simple key word query.
- the key word query augmentation performed by the system is a type of contextualization that implicitly recognizes a user's immediate interest depending on a user's spatial positioning within their categorical hierarchy.
- Positioning might be with respect to the user's individual categorical hierarchy, as represented by the structure and organization of their own bookmark collection, or alternatively, by the user positioning within a group hierarchy when initiating the search.
- the system recognizes that a user's initiating space is often highly relevant to the next form of information that they might wish to receive. This is analogous to the “hub” methodology used by various websites, wherein a particular site might include links to various other, related sites which comprise content that is relevant in one degree or another to the content provided by the “hub” site.
- the system according to the invention is not limited to providing augmentation of key word queries depending upon the location of a user within the user's categorical hierarchy when initiating the query. Indeed, a user might wish to initiate a key word query even if the user is not accessing the system by positioning themselves within either their categorical hierarchy or that of a group. In this particular case, the user is deemed to be positioned within their top-level domain and, accordingly, the user's profile information forms the basis for the query augmentation. In this particular instance, the user's entire bookmark collection might be decomposed into a single content vector. The selective decomposition of portions of the collection based upon similarity or dissimilarity to the initial query augments the query with suitably derived content vectors from the document collection. Once this augmented query is passed to the search engine, the search engine searches the information repository and returns results that match or correspond to the augmented key word query terms.
- the system functions as a recommendation engine in order to filter the returned search results and provide the filtered results to a user in keeping with the degree of relevance of each document to the user's initial query.
- Certain forms of recommendation engines are well understood by those having skill in the art, but all of these conventionally recognized recommendation engines rank or order documents on the basis of a relevance metric established by the entire Web-using community as a whole. None of the conventionally understood recommendation engines are able to deal with result diversity of the kind that frequently obtains when queries, even augmented queries, might pertain to totally different subject matter.
- the relevance engine is able to order or rank results return from a conventional key word search in accordance with a model based on a “standard directory model of the universe” such as represented by ODP.
- a user's search results are evaluated for their allocated positions within standard directory model and are allocated a content vector accordingly.
- This content vector identifies the category in which such a document was found, along with sufficient content information relating to that document so as to position it, with fine-grained detail, within the global model comprising the corpus of information.
- Such information may be mined from the content of the document itself, from a document's metafile information or some other content designator or descriptor that might be allocated or assigned to that document by the entity in charge of maintaining the global model. Any document's relevance to a particular user's search is discerned by comparing its hierarchical or categorical content information, in conjunction with its content, to not only the query or augmented query which initiated the search, but also to an interest categorization or classification model developed by the system with respect to each user.
- the interest categorization model (or interest classifier) is a personalized hierarchical interest model constructed in accordance with a system and method described in a co-pending patent application entitled HIERARCHICAL MODEL FOR DYNAMIC PERSONALIZATION OF OBJECT SPACES AND PRIVACY PROTECTION, filed on instant day herewith and commonly owned by the assignee of the present invention, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
- a user's choice of categorical organization for their personal bookmark collection, as well as the titles and/or descriptor fields used to denote the categorical nodes of the collection provide a highly reliable inference as to which fields of information that particular user is likely to find relevant.
- search results returned by a search engine may be filtered by comparing the content of the documents to a content vector derived from a user's profile.
- category from which those documents were extracted is compared to the categorical structure of the user's collection and, documents extracted from corresponding categories might be given additional weight as relevant documents.
- Documents extracted are then ordered or ranked in accordance with a degree of correspondence or matching between the document's category and content and the content and categorical (contextualization) metrics derived from a user's interaction with the system.
- categorical (contextualization) metrics derived from a user's interaction with the system.
- standard directory model categories are found to contain content corresponding to content contained within a user's categorical model, the standard directory model category is mapped to the user's equivalent category. This mapping is then stored in the user's profile for future reference.
- query augmentation and contextualization is an example of what might be termed topical or categorical contextualization. It is an additional feature of the present invention that it is able to inform the relevance characteristics of a search by time or temporal contextualization as well.
- the system is able to monitor a user's activity when the user is engaged with the system. For example, as a user surfs the Web, the system monitors the user's click stream and stores the historical series of URLs which defines a user's path through the Web during a session.
- That user might have recently traversed a number of travel-related sites, such as airlines, travel agencies, and the like, looking for information on booking such a vacation. Additionally, that user might have traversed a number of sites relating to Java the island. Combining this user's recent interest in travel along with their recent interest in Java the island, a subsequent key word search for “java” would imply the necessity of some measure of result differentiation.
- travel-related sites such as airlines, travel agencies, and the like
- the system Given the recentcy of “travel” and “Java” in the user's surf and search focus, the system is able to place a recentcy weighting on the topic “travel” and the document content “Java” and “island.” Accordingly, although one would expect a substantial number of high ranking documents returned by the search to be concerned with JAVA the programming language due the user's profile, a substantial number of documents will also be returned pertaining to travel to Java the island, due to the user's recentcy of interest in those topics.
- both topical and temporal relevance information can be data mined from the structure, organization and usage of the system and can be formed into a personalized set of relevance vectors that are unique to each user.
- Topical and categorical information contained within each user's relevance vectors are mapped to corresponding categorical nodes of a standard directory model, such that there is a relevance correspondence between content in an information repository and a collection of relevant content maintained by a user.
- the relevance engine described in connection with FIGS. 16 and 17 might have its components allocated between a user's terminal and a database server, so might the functionality of the relevance engine be allocated between the relevance engine and a search engine.
- the relevance engine might contain all of the functionality required to both augment a key word query and to provide context based relevance filtering of results returned by the search engine.
- the user provides an initial key word query to the system which processes the user input and augments the key word query in accordance with the user's relevance model, a simple interest model or the hierarchical content model, as described above.
- the system develops an additional set of descriptive key words other used to augment the initial key word query search.
- the augmented query is then passed to the search engine which searches and evaluates the contents of an information repository, such as the Web in conventional fashion.
- a response is received from the search engine, which response might include a set of documents ranked in accordance with the search engine's own recommendation scheme.
- the relevance engine receives the search results and re-ranks or re-orders the results in accordance with contextualization information developed from the user's personal relevance profile, the user's immediacy metrics, the user's position and/or activity while engaging with the system, and the like. These re-ordered, contextualized results are then presented to the user over the user's browser screen.
- portions of the system's functionality can be incorporated into a search engine such that a search engine is able to more efficiently derive relative content from an information repository such as the Web.
- the user initiates a key word query search, in conventional fashion, through the system application appearing on the user's browser.
- the system augments the user's key word query with additional key words extracted from the structure, organization and content of the user's content pointer collection hosted by the system.
- the system adds contextualization information to the key word query terms in the form of directed content vectors and passes the entire contextualized query to the search engine for execution.
- Contextualization information is derived from not only the user's structure, organization and content of the user's content pointer collection hosted on the system, but also from other aspects of the user's personalized relevance model, such as the user's immediacy interest, certain document recentcy metrics, certain document frequency metrics, and the like. It should also be noted that although the contextualization content vector has been described as being added to the key word query, the contextualized content vector may just as easily include the key word query information, whether augmented or otherwise, so as to define a single contextualized content vector which is passed to the search engine for execution.
- the system In situations where the user has engaged the system for a certain period of time, the system also translates any user-defined categorical descriptors into their corresponding standard directory model categorical states, as they have been so mapped by the system through usage.
- the content vector is then utilized directly by the search engine to filter and extract only relevant documents from the information repository, i.e., only those documents meeting the full criteria of content as well as context match.
- the contextualization portion of the search vector tells the search engine what portion of the standard directory to access, while the augmented query portion of the search vector tells the search engine just which documents in that portion of the standard directory are relevant and which pointers to that content should be extracted for presentation to the user.
- the search engine then returns an explicitly relevant set of content pointers to the user through the relevance engine, which may or may not perform additional filtering, such as relevance feedback filtering, at the option of the user.
- a particular user might have access to more than one personalized relevance model for interaction with a particular information repository, such as the Web.
- the user may have their own relevance model which is invoked if the user logs onto the system as an individual or engages with the relevance model from an electronic space which the system recognizes as “individual.” If the user were to enter a “group” space, by perhaps clicking on a group or community bookmark icon, or by taking any one of a number of defined user interactions which put the user into a “group” space, this space is identified to the inventive system when a search or recommendation procedure is requested and the corresponding “group” relevance model is invoked.
- the system From the object training set, i.e., from the over one million documents classified into the ODP hierarchical structure, the system develops a database of content key words, category vectors, and other relevant information that might be used to assign or allocate a particular object into a particular structure category. Performing this content analysis on a content training set which has already been categorized, the system is able to match content to category and develop its own “quasirelevance” model for the categories which comprise the standard directory model. In effect, for each ODP category, the system retrieves classified (categorized) pages within that category, strips all textual and contextual information those pages and populates a database item associated to that category. The process is repeated until all of the ODP categories have an associated database item identified to that category, such that a set of indicia is defined and linked to each category, so that each category's content is well characterized.
- unclassified (uncategorized) objects or documents are retrieved from the information repository, it is understood that they will at least contain a match with a query key word, if not a match with some contextual indicia that they have been provided by the query search initiator.
- the textual information and/or contextual information contained in the object is stripped from the object and compared to the contents of the various database items which characterize the global hierarchy. Once an uncategorized object's content is processed and a suitable category match is found, the object is assigned to that category and the categorical assignment is maintained for that object for all future purposes.
- the object may not be processed for relevance. All content, no matter how derived, can be analyzed for relevance, so long as the content (or object) is extracted from an information repository organized in accordance with a defined structure, and there exists a training set of content pages or objects which have already been classified or categorized within that structure. Any and all content (or objects) can be analyzed with regard to the results of the training sequence and can be efficiently and rationally allocated to a categorical position without further invention by any other authority.
- One further embodiment of the invention incorporates automatic document categorization. If this feature is implemented, a user is able to create a hierarchy of objects (whether bookmarks, document pointers, or the like) without having to manually create the categories.
- a topical categorization methods are known in the art; for example “k nearest neighbors,” “support vector machines,” and “winnow,” among other methods, can be used.
- document categories may be formed, see U.S. Pat. No. 08/842,926 to Pirolli et al., entitled “System for Categorizing Documents in a Linked Collection of Documents”; U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,443 to Nakayama.
- the automatic categorization scheme uses, as a topical reference, a global hierarchy of categories.
- An object or collection of objects is compared (by the scheme described above) against the possible topics or categories in the global hierarchy and the user is presented with a resulting categorical name that “fits” properly within the global hierarchy.
- This approach has the particular advantage of ensuring that searches initiated by members of a group, from within a “community” space, return consistent categorically contextualized results.
- a document or collection of documents is compared (by the scheme described above) against the possible topics in the global hierarchy, and the user is presented with a resulting category name that “fits” properly within the global hierarchy.
- This approach has the advantage of ensuring that searches across multiple users' public bookmarks return consistent category names.
- Deriving the global hierarchy can be accomplished as follows. First, represent each category as the centroid of the titles of the documents (or, preferably, the content of the documents). The centroids of the categories are then clustered into a preferred number of top-level clusters (e.g., ten clusters). Then recursively cluster each of the clusters until the “leaves” of the hierarchy are individual clusters.
- HTML is described as the most common format or language for describing documents on the Web; it should be noted that other document formats (such as XML, SGML, plain ASCII text, plain Unicode text, and other standard and proprietary formats) are also in use on the Internet and in various other document-based applications; this invention will function equally well in the context of networks utilizing other formats or even multiple formats.
- the format be decomposable into a language (which can even be accomplished, in image-based formats, through character recognition).
- the term “document” is intended to refer to any machine-or human-readable data file (or collection of related files) from which information can be retrieved.
- URLs are typically used to access information on the Internet, and frequently on other networks, as well.
- other means of specifying the location, identity, and nature of a requested document are also possible; such alternative schemes would be apparent to a practitioner of ordinary skill in the art, and the invention is deemed to cover these variations.
