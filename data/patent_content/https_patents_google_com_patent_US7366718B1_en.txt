Definitions
- the present invention concerns information management and retrieval in general. More specifically, the present invention concerns detecting, and optionally removing, duplicate and near-duplicate information or content, such as in a repository of documents to be searched for example.
- document(s) should be broadly interpreted and may include content such as Web pages, text files, multimedia files, object features, link structure, etc. Also, it should be noted that when near-duplicate documents are detected, exact duplicate documents will also be detected as a consequence (though such exact duplicates might not necessarily be distinguished from near-duplicates).
- Detecting near-duplicate documents has many potential applications. For example, duplicate or near-duplicate documents may indicate plagiarism or copyright infringement.
- One important application of near-duplicate document detection is in the context of information storage and retrieval.
- the World Wide Web (referred to as “the Web”) may include the same document duplicated in different forms or at different places. (Naturally, other networks, or even stand alone systems, may have duplicate documents.) Sources of such duplication are introduced here.
- Some documents are “mirrored” at different sites on the Web. Such mirroring is used to alleviate potential delays when many users attempt to request the same document at the same time, and/or to minimize network latency (e.g., by caching Web pages locally).
- a given document may have plain text and HTML (hyper-text markup language) versions so that users can render or download the content in a form that they prefer.
- HTML hyper-text markup language
- devices e.g., computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, etc.
- a given document may have more and more different versions with different formatting (text only, text plus other media, etc.).
- documents are often prepended or appended with information related to its location on the Web, the date, the date it was last modified, a version, a title, a hierarchical classification path (e.g., a Web page may be classified under more than one class within the hierarchy of a Web site), etc.
- a hierarchical classification path e.g., a Web page may be classified under more than one class within the hierarchy of a Web site
- a new document is generated from an existing document using a consistent word replacement.
- a Web site may be “re-branded” for different audiences by using word replacement.
- Duplicate and near-duplicate documents raise potential problems for both people accessing information (e.g., from the Web) and entities helping people to access desired information (e.g., search engine companies). These potential problems are introduced below.
- Search engines have been employed to help users find desired information.
- Search engines typically search databased content or “Web sites” pursuant to a user query.
- a rank-ordered list which typically includes brief descriptions of the uncovered content, as well as hyper-texts links (i.e., text, having associated URLs) to the uncovered content, is returned.
- the rank-ordering of the list is typically based on a match between words appearing in the query and words appearing in the content.
- search engines perform three main functions: (i) crawling the Web; (ii) indexing the content of the Web; and (iii) responding to a search query using the index to generate search results. Given the large amount of information available, these three main functions are automated to a large extent. While the crawl operation will associate words or phrases with a document (e.g., a Web page), the indexing operation will associate document(s) (e.g., Web page(s)) with words or phrases. The search operation then (i) uses that index to find documents (e.g., Web pages) containing various words of a search query, and (ii) ranks or orders the documents found in accordance with some heuristic(s).
- crawl operation will associate words or phrases with a document (e.g., a Web page)
- document(s) e.g., Web page(s)
- the search operation uses that index to find documents (e.g., Web pages) containing various words of a search query, and (ii) ranks or orders the documents
- documents may be “mirrored” at different sites on the Web, documents may have a number of different formats so that users can render or download the content in a form that they prefer, documents may have a different versions with different information prepended or appended, some documents may have been generated from others using consistent word replacement, and some documents may aggregate or incorporate documents available from another source on the Web. It would be desirable to eliminate such duplicates or near-duplicates.
- eliminating duplicate or near-duplicate documents is desirable to search engine hosting entities to (i) reduce storage requirements (e.g., for the index and data structures derived from the index), and (ii) reduce resources needed to process indexes, queries, etc.
- Some previous techniques for detecting duplicate and near-duplicate documents involve generating so-called “fingerprints” for elements (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, words, or shingles (i.e., overlapping stretches of consecutive words)) of documents. See, e.g., the articles: A. Z. Broder, “On the Resemblance and Containment of Documents,” Proceedings of Compression and Complexity of Sequences 1997, pp. 21-27, IEEE Computer Society (1988); and S. Brin et al., “Copy Detection Mechanisms for Digital Documents,” Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Annual Conference, San Jose 1995 (May 1995). Some or all of the generated fingerprints could be used in a duplicate/near-duplicate determination.
- two documents would be considered to be near-duplicates if they share more than a predetermined number (at least two, and generally much higher) of fingerprints. That is, such methods determine when documents share multiple common fingerprints. Generally, if the predetermined number is too low, too many false positives would be generated.
- the present invention may detect near-duplicate documents by (i) for each document, generating fingerprints, (ii) determining near-duplicate documents based on the fingerprints.
- the fingerprints may be preprocessed to eliminate those that only occur in one document. In such an embodiment, only the remaining fingerprints would be used when determining near-duplicate documents.
- the act of generating fingerprints for each document may be effected by (i) extracting parts (e.g., words) from the documents, (ii) hashing each of the extracted parts to determine which of a predetermined number of lists is to be populated with a given part, and (iii) for each of the lists, generating a fingerprint.
- parts e.g., words
- the present invention may also function to eliminate duplicate documents.
- the present invention may function to generate clusters of near-duplicate documents, in which a transitive property is assumed.
- Each document may have an identifier for identifying a cluster with which it is associated.
- in response to a search query if two candidate result documents belong to the same cluster and if the two candidate result documents match the query equally well, only the one deemed more likely to be relevant (e.g., by virtue of a high PageRank, being more recent, etc.) is returned.
- the present invention may also be used during a crawling operation to speed up the crawling and to save bandwidth by not crawling near-duplicate Web pages or sites, as determined from documents uncovered in a previous crawl. Further, by reducing the number of Web pages or sites crawled, the present invention can be used to reduce storage requirements of downstream stored data structures.
- the present invention may also be used after the crawl such that if more than one document are near duplicates, then only one is indexed. The present invention can instead be used later, in response to a query, in which case a user is not annoyed with near-duplicate search results.
- the present invention may also be used to “fix” broken links. That is, if a document (e.g., a Web page) doesn't exist (at a particular location or URL) anymore, a link to a near-duplicate page can be provided.

- the following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements.
- Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications.
- the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown and the inventor regards his invention as the following disclosed methods, apparatus, articles of manufacturers, and data structures and any other patentable subject matter to the extent that they are patentable.
- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of an environment 100 in which at least some aspects of the present invention may be used.
- This environment 100 may be a network (such as the Internet for example) 160 in which an information access facility (client) 110 is used to render information accessed from one or more content providers (servers) 180 .
- a search facility (server) 130 may be used by the information access facility 110 to search for content of interest.
- the information access facility 110 may include a browsing operation 112 which may include a navigation operation 114 and a user interface operation 116 .
- the browsing operation 112 may access the network 160 via input/output interface operations 118 .
- the browsing operation 112 may be a browser (such as “Internet Explorer” from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., or “Netscape” from Netscape Communications, Inc.) and the input/output interface operations may include a modem or network interface card (or NIC) and networking software.
- Other examples of possible information access facilities 110 include untethered devices, such as personal digital assistants and mobile telephones for example, set-top boxes, kiosks, etc.
- Each of the content providers 180 may include stored resources (also referred to as content) 136 , a resource retrieval operation 184 that accesses and provides content in response to a request, and input/output interface operation(s) 182 .
- These operations of the content providers 180 may be effected by computers, such as personal computers or servers for example.
- the stored resources 186 may be embodied as data stored on some type of storage medium such as a magnetic disk(s), an optical disk(s), etc.
- the term “document” may be interpreted to include addressable content, such as a Web page for example.
- the search facility 130 may perform crawling, indexing/sorting, and query processing functions. These functions may be performed by the same entity or separate entities. Further, these functions may be performed at the same location or at different locations.
- a crawling operation 152 gets content from various sources accessible via the network 160 , and stores such content, or a form of such content, as indicated by 154 .
- an automated indexing/sorting facility 140 an automated indexing/sorting operation 142 may access the stored content 154 and may generate a content index (e.g., an inverted index, to be described below) and content ratings (e.g., PageRanks, to be described below) 140 .
- a query processing operation 134 accepts queries and returns query results based on the content index (and the content ratings) 140 .
- the crawling, indexing/sorting and query processing functions may be performed by one or more computers.
- FIG. 2 is a process bubble diagram of such an advanced search facility 200 in which at least some aspects of the present invention may be used.
- the advanced search facility 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 performs three main functions: (i) crawling; (ii) indexing/sorting; and (iii) searching.
- the horizontal dashed lines divide FIG. 2 into three parts corresponding to these three main functions. More specifically, the first part 150 ′ corresponds to the crawling function, the second part 140 ′ corresponds to the indexing/sorting function, and the third part 134 ′ corresponds to the search (or query processing) function. (Note that an apostrophe “′” following a reference number is used to indicate that the referenced item is merely one example of the item referenced by the number without an apostrophe.) Each of these parts is introduced in more detail below. Before doing so, however, a few distinguishing features of this advanced search facility 200 are introduced.
- the advanced search facility uses the link structure of the Web, as well as other techniques, to improve search results. (See, e.g., the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia. Incorporated herein by reference.)
- the crawling part 150 ′ may be distributed across a number of machines.
- a single URLserver (not shown) serves lists of uniform resource locations (“URLs”) 206 to a number of crawlers. Based on this list of URLs 206 , the crawling operation 202 crawls the network 160 ′ and gets Web pages 208 .
- a pre-indexing operation 210 may then generate page rankings 212 , as well as a repository 214 from these Web pages 208 .
- the page rankings 212 may include a number of URL fingerprint (i.e., a unique value), PageRank value (as introduced above) pairs.
- the repository 214 may include URL, content type and compressed page triples.
- the indexing/sorting operations 220 may generate an inverted index 226 .
- the indexing/sorting operations 220 may also generate page ranks 228 from the citation rankings 212 .
- the page ranks 228 may include document ID, PageRank value pairs.
- the searching operations 230 may be run by a Web server and may use a lexicon 232 , together with the inverted index 226 and the PageRanks 228 , to generate query results in response to a query.
- the query results may be based on a combination of (i) information derived from PageRanks 228 and (ii) information derived from how closely a particular document matches the terms contained in the query (also referred to as the information retrieval (or “IR”) component).
- IR information retrieval
- One goal of the present invention is to provide a better near-duplicate determination technique.
- Such a technique should be less computationally expensive than the prior techniques introduced in ⁇ 1.2.3 above.
- Such a technique should not generate too many false positives (i.e., false indications that documents are duplicates or near-duplicates when, in fact, they are not).
- the present invention should also be able to detect documents that are duplicates or near-duplicates, but that include a consistent word replacement, as introduced in ⁇ 1.2.1 above.
- the present invention may function to detect near-duplicate documents (e.g., Web pages). To reiterate, it will be presumed that detecting near-duplicate document will necessarily also detect exact duplicate documents. Therefore, when the term “near-duplicate detection” is used, it will be understood that exact duplicates will also be detected, though not necessarily identified as “exact”, as opposed to near, duplicates.
- the present invention may detect near-duplicate documents by (i) for each document, generating fingerprints, (ii) preprocessing (optionally) the fingerprints to eliminate those that only occur in one document, and (iii) determining near-duplicate documents based on the (remaining) fingerprints.
- the act of generating fingerprints for each document may be effected by (i) extracting parts (e.g., words) from the documents, (ii) hashing each of the extracted parts to determine which of a predetermined number of lists is to be populated with a given part, and (iii) for each of the lists, generating a fingerprint.
- parts e.g., words
- the present invention may also function to eliminate duplicate documents (e.g., keeping the one with best PageRank, with best trust of host, that is the most recent)
- the present invention may function to generate clusters of near-duplicate documents, in which a transitive property is assumed (i.e., if document A is a near-duplicate of document B, and document B is a near-duplicate of document C, then document A is considered a near-duplicate of document C).
- Each document may have an identifier for identifying a cluster with which it is associated.
- the present invention may also be used during a crawling operation 202 to speed up the crawling and to save bandwidth by not crawling near-duplicate Web pages or sites, as determined from documents uncovered in a previous crawl. Further, by reducing the number of Web pages or sites crawled, the present invention can be used to reduce storage requirements for other “downstream” stored data structures. Alternatively, the present invention may be used after crawling such that, if there are more two or more near duplicate documents, only one is indexed. The present invention can instead be used later, in response to a query, in which case a user is not annoyed with near-duplicate search results. The present invention may also be used to “fix” broken links. That is, if a document (e.g., a Web page) doesn't exist (at a particular location or URL) anymore, a link to a near-duplicate page can be provided.
- a document e.g., a Web page
- FIG. 3 is a process bubble diagram that illustrates operations that may be performed by the present invention.
- a near-duplicate detection fingerprint generation operation 330 may be used to generate a plurality of fingerprints 365 for each of a number of documents 320 / 214 ′.
- an extraction operation 340 may be used to extract parts (e.g., words, terms, numbers, etc.) from documents, and associate a document identifier with the extracted parts, as indicated by 345 (each record including a document identifier and associated extracted parts may be referred to as “document extracted parts”). Exemplary methods for effecting the extraction operation 340 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.1 below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the documents 320 may be accepted from any source, such as the repository 214 ′ of the search engine 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the documents 320 to be processed may be identified in a list 310 .
- a list population operation 350 may be used to process the document extracted parts 345 and place each extracted part 345 into one of a predetermined number (e.g., four) of lists 355 (each record including a document identifier and associated lists may be referred to as “document lists”).
- a predetermined number e.g., four
- lists 355 each record including a document identifier and associated lists may be referred to as “document lists”.
- a document identifier will be associated with a predetermined number of lists, each of the lists being populated (though some lists may be empty) with extracted document parts.
- the list population operation 350 may use a hash function that is repeatable, deterministic, and not sensitive to state. For example, the word “the” will always be sent to the same list, without regard to the number of times it occurs in a document, and without regard to which document it occurs in. Exemplary methods for effecting the list population operation 350 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.2 below with reference to FIG. 5 . An example illustrating the operation of an exemplary list population operation 350 is provided in ⁇ 4.4 below with reference to FIGS. 12A and 12B .
- a fingerprint generation operation 360 may be used, for each document, to process the populated document lists 355 to generate a fingerprint for each of the lists (each record including a document identifier and associated fingerprints may be referred to as “document fingerprints”). Exemplary methods for effecting the fingerprint generation operation 360 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.3 below with reference to FIG. 6 .
- a document identifier will be associated with a predetermined number (e.g., four) of fingerprints as indicated by 365 .
- the predetermined number of fingerprints may correspond to the predetermined number of lists.
- the fingerprint generation operation 360 should be designed such that it is very unlikely that two different lists would produce the same fingerprint, but such that two identical lists will always generate the same fingerprint.
- a near-duplicate detection operation 376 may be used to determine whether or not any two documents are “near-duplicates”. In one embodiment of the invention, if two documents have any one fingerprint in common, they are considered to be “near-duplicates”. If each of the fingerprints are the same, the two documents could be considered to be “exact-duplicates”. Exemplary methods for effecting the near-duplicate detection operation 376 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.4 below with reference to FIG. 7 .
- a very large collection of documents 320 will generate a very large collection of document fingerprints 365 . Reducing the size of the collection of document fingerprints 365 without impacting the efficacy of the near-duplicate detection operation 376 is clearly desirable.
- One or more fingerprint preprocessing operations 372 may be used for this purpose. For example, a fingerprint preprocessing operation 372 may be used to eliminate fingerprints that only occur in a single document, leaving only those fingerprints occurring in more than one document 374 . Such fingerprints may be removed since, in accordance with one embodiment of the near-duplicate detection operation 376 , they will never indicate a near-duplicate document because they have no matching fingerprint in another document.
- the near-duplicate detection operation 376 may use a reduced collection of document fingerprints 374 , rather than the full collection 365 .
- a near-duplicate detection operation other than that of the present invention may be used. That is, the present invention may be used solely for generating a reduced collection of document fingerprints 374 . Any near-duplicate detection technique may then operate on such a reduced collection.
- the techniques of the present invention can be used as a pre-filtering step in a more careful and (e.g., computationally and/or storage) expensive near-duplicate determination technique.
- pairs of objects (e.g., documents) indicated by the technique of the present invention as being near-duplicates would be checked using the second, more careful, near-duplicate determination technique. Pairs indicated by the technique of the present invention as not being near-duplicates would simply be discarded.
- the present invention could be tuned to err on the side of generating false positive near-duplicate indications.
- near-duplicate documents can be extended to have a transitive property. That is, in such a case, if document A is a near-duplicate of document B, which is a near-duplicate of document C, then A is considered to be a near-duplicate of document C (even if a near-duplicated detection operation 376 would not otherwise consider documents A and C to be near-duplicates).
- a document cluster determination operation 382 e.g., a known union-find technique
- a document will only belong to a single cluster—if it belonged to two separate clusters, the two clusters could be combined into one by virtue of the common document.
- a data structure 383 associating a document (e.g., a document identifier) with a cluster (e.g., a cluster identifier) may be used to reflect the clusters determined.
- a document e.g., a document identifier
- cluster e.g., a cluster identifier
- Exemplary methods that may be used to effect this clustering operation 382 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.5 below with reference to FIG. 8 .
- search operation will often return search results in response to a query.
- the search results may be grouped into a predetermined number (e.g., ten) of search results (e.g., snippets of documents with hyper-text links to the documents).
- a query-responsive duplicate detection operation 384 may function as follows. If the search results include two documents that belong to the same cluster, and those two documents match (in terms of traditional information retrieval) the query equally well, then only the higher quality document (e.g., more recent, higher PageRank, more relevant, etc.) is kept, the other being eliminated.
- Exemplary methods that may be used to effect the query-responsive duplicate detection operation 384 are described in ⁇ 4.3.2.5 below with reference to FIG. 9 .
- An example illustrating the operation of an exemplary query-responsive duplicate detection operation 384 is described in ⁇ 4.4 below with reference to FIGS. 13 through 18 .
- FIG. 4 is a high-level flow diagram of an exemplary method 340 ′ that may be used to effect the extraction operation 340 .
- unit type e.g., word, sentence, character, paragraph, section, etc.
- part size as a number of units
- part overlap e.g., no overlap or shingles defined by an overlap having a predetermined of units
- a document is accepted.
- the method 340 ′ is left via RETURN node 460 . Note that the extraction method 340 ′ may be applied to some or all documents of a collection to be analyzed.
- extraction may be effected using any one of a number of known techniques.
- the parts to be extracted from a document may be sections, paragraphs, sentences, words, or characters for example. See, e.g., the article, S. Brin et al., “Copy Detection Mechanisms for Digital Documents,” Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Annual Conference , San Jose (May 1995), downloaded from www-db.Stanford.edu/ ⁇ sergey/copy.html on Nov. 27, 2000 (hereafter referred to as “the Brin article”).
- a document Before extraction occurs, a document may be preprocessed to remove formatting information and non-textual components thereby generating a so-called “canonical form” document consisting of ASCII characters with white-space separating words, punctuation separating sentences, etc. See, e.g., the Brin article.
- the document is not a text document, or if it includes non-textual components, other features may be extracted using known techniques. Further, the techniques of the present invention can be used in other applications in which some measure of similarity is needed. For example, in the context of providing a thesaurus operation, words which have similar (e.g., near-duplicate) “context vectors” may be considered synonyms.
- a context vector of a given word may be thought of as words that frequently (e.g., at least a predetermined number of times) appear close to (e.g., within a predetermined proximity of) the word in the given collection of documents.
- the extraction operation 340 may be modified so that short or common words or terms (e.g., stop words) are not processed (i.e., ignored or removed by preprocessing).
- short or common words or terms e.g., stop words
- the extraction operation 340 may be modified so that short documents (e.g., documents with 50 words or less) are not processed at all.
- short documents e.g., documents with 50 words or less
- standard error pages e.g., informing a user about a dead link, etc.
- FIG. 5 is a high-level flow diagram of an exemplary method 350 ′ that may be used to effect the list population operation 350 .
- a predetermined number of lists to be populated is accepted.
- This list number parameter e.g., four
- document parts extracted from a document are accepted.
- a current part is hashed to determine which of the predetermined number of lists to populate with the current part, and to populate the determined list accordingly.
- hashing functions are used to compress data (e.g., a variable-size input) in a deterministic way, to generate a hash value (e.g., a fixed-size string). That is, given data always hashes to the same hash result.
- Hash functions may be one-way (non-reversible). That is, given a hash value, it is impractical to find the data from which the hash value was generated. For purposes of the present invention, the hash function need not be non-reversible.
- the document identifier may be associated with the populated lists before the method 350 is left via RETURN node 570 .
- the number of lists to be populated with document elements may be changed and adjusted, as follows, so that two different documents do not share any common fingerprints. If the number “x” of lists increases, the expected number of document differences (or changes from one document to obtain the second document) needed before two documents no longer share any common fingerprints increases.
- each part can go into zero, one, or more lists.
- the hash functions for each list should be independent.
- the hash function and/or the number of lists can be tuned in accordance with the following principles. Assume that the probability that a particular hashing function returns a “true” value in response to a part (e.g., word) is “p”. Accordingly, the probability that a particular list will change given the part (e.g., a word) is p, and the probability that the given list will not change given the part (e.g., word) is 1 ⁇ p. The probability that the given list will not change given a number “k” of parts (e.g., words) is therefore (1 ⁇ p) k .
- the probability that the given list will change given a number “k” of parts (e.g., words) is 1 ⁇ (1 ⁇ p) k . If there are x lists, the chance that two documents having k different parts (e.g., words) will have a common list (and therefore share a fingerprint in common, and therefore be considered to be near-duplicates) is 1 ⁇ (1 ⁇ (1 ⁇ p) k ) x .
- the hashing functions (and thus, p) and the number “x” of lists can be adjusted based on the foregoing relationship.
- the probability(ies) “p” associated with the hash function(s) may be chosen to be determined based on the size of a document.
- FIG. 6 is a high-level flow diagram of an exemplary method 360 ′ that may be used to effect the fingerprint generation operation 360 .
- the document identifier and its associated lists are accepted.
- a fingerprint to the current list is generated (See block 630 ).
- the document identifier is associated with the generated fingerprints, as indicated in block 650 , before the method 360 ′ is left via RETURN node 660 .
- fingerprinting may simply be a strongly collision-free hashing function, or a hashing function with a low probability of collision.
- the present invention may use any one of a number of known fingerprinting methods. See, e.g., the article M. O. Rabin, “Fingerprinting by Random Polynomials”, Report TR -15-81, Center for Research in Computing Technology, Harvard University (1981) (hereafter referred to as “the Rabin article”). See also, the article A. Z. Broder, “Some Applications of Rabin's Fingerprinting Method,” found in the text R. Capocelli et al., editors, Sequences II: Methods in Communications, Security, and Computer Science , pp. 143-152, Springer-Verlag (1993) (hereafter referred to as “the Broder Fingerprint article”).
- the fingerprinting function used for processing lists may be made to be order sensitive (i.e., sensitive to the order of parts (e.g., words) in a list), or not.
- FIG. 7 is a high-level flow diagram of an exemplary method 376 ′ that may be used to effect the near-duplicate detection operation 376 .
- This method 376 ′ can be provided with any two documents to be analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not they are near-duplicates.
- document fingerprints for a first document and those for a second document are accepted.
- a NEAR_DUP flag may be initialized to “False”.
- the current fingerprints are compared to determine whether or not they match (See decision branch point 750 ).
- a near duplicate indicator is set (e.g., the NEAR_DUP flag is set to “True”) as indicated by block 752 .
- one of the two documents may then be deleted as indicated by phantom block 754 , before the method 376 ′ is left via RETURN node 780 .
- a next fingerprint of the second document is used, as indicated by loop 740 - 760 .
- a next fingerprint of the first document is used, as indicated by loop 730 - 770 .
- the method 376 ′ is left via the RETURN node 780 . Note that if no matches are found, the documents are indicated as not being near-duplicates (e.g., NEAR_DUP flag remains set to “False”).
- a near-duplicate indicator may be provided for each possible pair of documents.
- a document-fingerprint pair for each of the at least two fingerprints may be generated for each of the documents. Such fingerprint-document pairs may then be sorted based on values of the fingerprints. In this way, only documents with matching fingerprints need be analyzed.
- FIG. 8 is a high-level flow diagram of an exemplary method 382 ′ that may be used to effect the document cluster determination operation 382 ′.
- a number of actions are taken.
- the loop 820 - 840 nested within loop 810 - 870 , through each previously processed document, it is determined whether or not a current document is a near-duplicate of a current previously processed document (See decision branch point 830 ). If so, it is determined whether or not the current document is already a member of a cluster (with other documents), as depicted in conditional branch point 860 .
- the current document is associated with the cluster to which the current previously processed document belongs (e.g., is associated with the cluster ID of the current previously processed document) as indicated by block 862 , and the method 382 ′ continues to block 840 .
- the current document is already a member of a cluster, then the two clusters are merged (e.g., by associating each member of the cluster to which the current document belongs with the cluster identifier of the current previously processed document), as indicated by block 864 , and the method 382 ′ continues to block 840 .
- the current document is not a near-duplicate of the current previously processed document, as indicated by loop 820 - 840 , a next previously processed document is tried. If, however, there are no more previously processed documents, the current document is associated with a new cluster (e.g., a new cluster identifier is created and the current document is associated with it), as indicated by block 850 . Then, another (unprocessed) document is processed as indicated by loop 810 - 870 . If there are no more unprocessed documents, the method 382 ′ is left via RETURN node 880 .
- a new cluster e.g., a new cluster identifier is created and the current document is associated with it
- FIG. 9 is a high-level block diagram of an exemplary method 384 ′ that may be used to effect the query-responsive near-duplicate detection operation 384 .
- a group of candidate search results is accepted (e.g., from a searching operation 230 ).
- a number of actions are taken.
- the current candidate search result is removed from the group of candidate search results as indicated by block 942 .
- a next highest ranking candidate search result may be added to the group.
- a search operation returns search results in groups of ten
- a document associated with a fifth candidate result is a near-duplicate of (e.g., belongs to the same cluster as) a document associated with a second candidate result
- the fifth candidate result may be removed (leaving nine candidate results), and a next highest ranking (eleventh) candidate search result may be added to the group (resulting in ten candidate search results).
- Another (unprocessed) candidate search result is checked as indicated by loop 920 - 960 . If there are no more (unprocessed) candidate search results left, then the method 384 ′ is left via RETURN node 970 .
- conditional branch point 940 if, on the other hand, the current candidate search result and the document associated with the previously processed candidate search result are not near-duplicates (e.g., do not belong to the same cluster), then a next previously processed candidate search result is tried as indicated by loop 930 - 950 . If there are no more previously processed candidate search results left, another (unprocessed) candidate search result is checked as indicated by loop 920 - 960 . If there are no more (unprocessed) candidate search results left, then the method 384 ′ is left via RETURN node 970 .

- FIGS. 11 through 18 Examples of operations of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to FIGS. 11 through 18 .
- FIG. 11 is an example illustrating an operation of an exemplary extraction operation.
- a document 320 a is shown in canonical form.
- An extraction operation 340 ′ uses a “word” unit type, a part size of one word, and no (zero word) overlap. As shown, the extraction operation 340 ′ returns document extracted parts 345 a including a document identifier 1110 and parts 1120 .
- FIGS. 12A and 12B collectively, provide an example illustrating an operation of an exemplary list population operation 350 ′.
- the number of lists is set to four, the document parts extracted in the example of FIG. 11 are processed, and each part goes to one and only one list.
- FIG. 12A illustrates the four lists 1220 as populated after four parts (e.g., words) have been processed. Note that a document identifier 1210 is associated with the lists.
- FIG. 12B illustrates the four lists 1220 ′ as populated after eight parts (e.g., words) have been processed. Note that since the (e.g., hashing) process used to determine which list the part is to be sent is repeatable and not sensitive to state, the second “the” part is sent to the same list 1220 c ′ as the first “the” part.
- FIG. 13 illustrates a Web page 1300 of eight results 1310 - 1380 to a search query 1390 .
- the search results 1310 - 1380 include a title of a corresponding document, a hyper-text link to the corresponding document, and snippets from the corresponding document. These search results 1310 - 1380 would be returned (and rendered to an end-user) if a query-responsive near-duplicate detection operation were not used.
- FIG. 14 illustrates the document (e.g., Web page) 1310 ′ associated with the first search result 1310
- FIG. 15 illustrates the document (e.g., Web page) 1320 ′ associated with the second search result 1320
- FIG. 16 illustrates the document (e.g., Web page) 1330 ′ associated with the third search result 1330
- FIG. 17 illustrates a document (e.g., Web page) 1340 ′ associated with the fourth search result 1340
- FIG. 18 illustrates a document (e.g., Web page) 1350 ′ associated with a fifth search result 1350 .
- these five documents are near-duplicates of one another. Most users would not want to see the others after seeing one, since no additional useful information would be conveyed.
- These documents differ only in the date the page was retrieved (e.g., by a crawler operation 202 ) (“Monday, July 3”, or “Tuesday, July 4”) the category for the page (“Home: Personal Care: Aeron Chair”, or “Home: Back Care: Chairs: Aeron Chair”), and/or the title (“aeron chair.aeron, aerons, ergonomic chairs”, or “Herman Miller AERON Chair from AHC.herman, miller”).
- An exemplary query-responsive near-duplicate detection method 384 ′ could be used to remove, the second 1320 , third 1330 , fourth 1340 , and fifth 1350 candidate search results and add other search results to the group of search results to be returned (and rendered to the end-user).
- the near-duplicate detection techniques have a number of important practical applications.
- these techniques can be used during a crawling operation to speed-up the crawling and to save bandwidth by not crawling near-duplicate Web pages or sites, as determined from documents uncovered in a previous crawl. Further, by reducing the number of Web pages or sites crawled, these techniques can be used to reduce storage requirements of a repository, and therefore, other downstream stored data structures. These techniques can instead be used later, in response to a query, in which case a user is not annoyed with near-duplicate search results. These techniques may also be used to “fix” broken links. That is, if a document (e.g., a Web page) doesn't exist (at a particular location or URL) anymore, a link to a near-duplicate page can be provided.
- a document e.g., a Web page
