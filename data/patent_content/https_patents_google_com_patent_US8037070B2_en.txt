- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to systems and methods for Internet web-browsing or searching for particular web pages based on keyword queries. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to automatically generating search queries through speech recognition and contextual influence of a telephone conversation or other audio streamed over a telephone.
- web-enabled telephones include packet switching capability for access to the Internet.
- conventional keyword-based searches run on telephones take time and imperfect formulation of the keyword terms oftentimes produces search results that lack relevancy to the information sought for by a user.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary system 100 for automatically generating, on various types of telephones, search queries based on a user conversation, which may be over a telephone.
- a mobile phone 105 and a wireless (or smart) phone 110 are some of the types of telephones over which the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented.
- the telephones 105 , 110 may wirelessly communicate with base transceiver stations 114 , also referred to as cell sites. Note that the scope of these embodiments is not intended to be limited by the type of phone used, except where specifically indicated. Conversations may also be obtained through means other than a telephone, such as through a tape or CD recorder, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
- the base transceiver stations 114 communicate through a cellular or wireless network 116 , which may include various pieces of switching hardware such as routers, switches, hubs, etc.
- the cellular network 116 may communicate through, or be coupled with, a Public Switched Data (and/or Telephone) Network (PSDN/PSTN) 124 .
- PSDN/PSTN Public Switched Data (and/or Telephone) Network
- the phrase “coupled with” is defined to mean directly connected to or indirectly connected through one or more intermediate components.
- the system 100 may also include a local wireless (or cordless) connection 120 through which the telephones 105 , 110 may obtain network communication for voice and data.
- the local wireless connection 120 is coupled with the wireless network 116 and/or is coupled with the PDSN/PSTN 124 .
- the PSDN/PSTN 124 may be coupled with an Internet 130 or other network such as an intranet or a local area network (LAN) for communication with a speech recognition server 134 and a search engine 138 that likewise have Internet (or “Web”) 130 access. As shown by the dashed line, however, the PSDN/PSTN 124 may directly communicate with the speech recognition server 134 without needing to first pass data through the Internet 130 .
- the speech recognition server 134 discussed in more detail below, may include an entity lists database 140 , which includes keywords or keyword phrases used frequently enough in telephone conversation to be used for comparison with real-time digitized conversations.
- the dialogue of wireless communication between handsets 105 , 110 and the base transceiver stations 114 is a stream of digital data that includes digitized audio, except for the first generation analog networks. Digitization of such first generation analog networks has to take place elsewhere, such as at the speech recognition server 134 .
- the technology that achieves the digitization depends on the system which a mobile phone operator has adopted, wherein the system 100 may support various different mobile phone operators. The technologies are grouped by generation.
- the first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, all of which are analog and include AMPS and NMT.
- Second-generation systems started in 1991 in Finland, and are all digital and include GSM, CDMA, and TDMA.
- Third-generation (3G) networks which are still being deployed, began in Japan in 2001.
- W-CDMA known also as UMTS
- CDMA2000 EV-DO High-speed data access in addition to voice services
- China will launch a third generation technology on the TD-SCDMA standard. Operators use a mix of predesignated frequency bands determined by the network requirements and local regulations.
- SMS short message service
- WAP Wireless Application Protocol
- WML Wireless Markup Language
- IVR Interactive Voice Response
- VoiceXML a markup language for voice applications based on Extensible Markup Language
- voice browsers and screen readers are used to allow navigation of the screen presented by the operating system, using speech or Braille output.
- Voice browsers allow voice-driven navigation, some with voice-in and voice-out, and some allowing telephone-based web access.
- Voice browsers allow users to access the Web using speech synthesis, pre-recorded audio, and speech recognition. This can be supplemented by keypads and small displays. Complete hands free access to the Web through the voice browser, however, is especially useful in some contexts such as while driving an automobile, for telephone access to web pages where the telephone does not have a regular web browser, and for the visually impaired.
- FIG. 2 is the diagram of FIG. 1 displaying details of implementation of the speech recognition server 134 to generate queries from conversational speech and of the search engine 138 to generate search results based on those queries.
- the speech recognition server 134 may include a memory 204 , a processor 208 , a digitizer 212 , an identifier 216 , a comparator 224 , and a search string generator 228 , wherein one or more of the elements 212 through 228 may be included within the processor 208 , and/or be executed by the processor 208 when software code is executed by the server 134 .
- the search engine 138 may also include a memory 204 , a processor 208 , a search results generator 232 , a web pages database 236 , and a search diaries database 240 . All other connections or possible connections are as were explained previously with reference to FIG. 1 , regardless of whether the details are displayed in FIG. 2 .
- the speech recognition server 134 may be included as an integrated part of the search engine 138 , or may be directly coupled thereto, as indicated by the dashed line. Note that the elements (or modules) of the speech recognition server 134 and/or the search engine 138 may be executed through hardware, or a combination of hardware and software, with the use of the memory 204 and the processor 208 .
- the audio data of the conversation passes through the local wireless connection 120 and/or the cellular or wireless networks 116 and gains access to the Internet 130 , for instance, through the PSDN 124 .
- the audio data may be communicated directly from the PSDN/PSTN 124 to the speech recognition server 134 without passing through the Internet 130 , as indicated by the dashed line.
- the wireless dialogue between the mobile telephone 105 and the transceiver base stations 114 , for second and third generation networks includes digitized audio.
- the digitizer 212 of the speech recognition server 134 may be required when receiving communication from a purely analog, first generation network.
- the digitizer 212 may also further digitize any audio that was insufficiently digitized before reception thereof, regardless of origin, to generate as many possible words or phrases that may be utilized by the speech recognition server 134 to generate search queries.
- the identifier 216 may then identify words or phrases in the digitized audio of the telephone conversation through voice recognition technology such as IVR.
- the identifier 216 may include the IVR (or similar) application, a call processing system (not shown), and telephony and voice hardware (not shown) required to communicate with the PSDN/PSTN 124 network(s).
- a possible identifier 216 or speech recognizer includes that developed by Nuance Communications of Burlington, Mass. The Nuance engine capacity is measured in recognition units based on CPU type as defined in the vendor specification.
- the natural speech recognition grammars e.g., that which a user can say that will be recognized by the identifier 216 , were originally developed by Webley Systems, which partnered with EffectNet, both of which merged into Parus Interactive of Bannockburn, Ill. in 2001.
- Parus Interactive's Unified Communications solutions and services are Internet Protocol (IP)-based and powered by natural language voice recognition and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) technologies.
- IP Internet Protocol
- SIP Session Initiation Protocol
- An integrated service creation platform allows Parus to rapidly deliver communications services.
- Voice recognition technology can, for instance, detect pauses or stop words at which to insert natural breaks between possible keyword phrases. Stop words are words pre-selected by the voice recognition software designer that will be extracted from all recognized word strings as having no meaning in the context of a typical search string used to query the search engine 138 . As search strings are to be generated automatically, without the need of using commands, such stop words may be left in as an exception in the case of a question or other phrase in which the stop word may be especially important, e.g., “Boy Scouts of America.”
- the entity lists database 140 contains keywords or keyword phrases used frequently enough in telephone conversation to be used for comparison with real-time digitized conversations.
- the entity lists database 140 may include at least two different sub-databases, such as a global “hot list” for tracking the most popular identified words or phrases in conversations of all users, and a personalized entity list for tracking the most frequently-used words or phrases as per individual users. The latter could be tracked according to identification of the telephone 105 , 110 used by each user, either by a data signature from the telephone 105 , 110 itself or through a registration process wherein the user opts-in to automatic query generation based on his or her conversations.
- the personalized entity list could include most anything, including movies, contacts in an address book, favorite restaurants, favorite news types, favorite travel destinations, favorite foods, celebrities, subjects of interest, and combinations thereof.
- the comparator 224 may then compare the words and phrases identified through voice recognition with the extant keywords and keyword phrases saved in the various entity lists of the entity lists database 140 . Based on hits indicating matches, the search string generator 228 may then automatically generate one or more search strings to submit to the search engine 138 .
- the search string generator 228 may also take into account a context of the search strings, to include, but not limited to, words uttered in proximity to the search string but not included therein, a location of the mobile phone 105 , 110 determined from a GPS device (see FIG. 3 ), a time stamp of the mobile phone 105 , 110 and a detected gender of the user.
- the time stamp may be generated through network time protocol (NTP) built into the cellular or wireless network 116 which synchronizes the local time stamp of the phone's clock-calendar with NIST Internet Time Service (ITS) servers (not shown). Furthermore, although less accurate, the time stamp can be obtained directly through an on-board clock-calendar of a mobile phone that is not normally synchronized with a network clock.
- NTP network time protocol
- ITS Internet Time Service
- the search string generator 228 may insert one or more additional terms, e.g., “Washington D.C.” or zip code “20500” into the search string before it is sent to the search engine 138 .
- additional terms e.g., “Washington D.C.” or zip code “20500”
- the search string generator 228 may integrate the term “grocery store,” resulting in a search string of “Coffee and Grocery Store in Washington D.C.”
- the search string generator 228 may also identify the term “tonight” as a contextual word, indicating a specific date and time that is then included in the search query. The date and time, however, may be independently obtained or verified from NTP as discussed above. Having the time information in the search query subsequently affects the show times returned by the search engine 138 . Furthermore, as discussed, the search string generator 228 may receive a location of the mobile phone 105 , 110 and insert location information of the user, which may further limit search results to only a few of the nearest theaters.
- the search results generator 232 After the search strings 228 are received by the search engine 138 , the search results generator 232 generates a set of search results that most relevantly correlate to each search string, ranking the most relevant results highest.
- the search results of a conversation session are returned to the mobile telephone 105 , 110 of the user for viewing and access by the user, and for storage in a search diary ( 326 of FIG. 3 ).
- the user may also optionally configure the search diary to be saved in the search diaries database 240 in relation to the user's identification by which that user may later access the search diary.
- the option of saving the search results remotely with the search engine 138 allows a user to increase the storage limit available for continuously-generated search results when compared with that available on a mobile phone 105 , for instance.
- the search diaries database 240 may also be accessible via a user account from a web page on a personal computer of the user, allowing perusal of relevant and interesting search results based on user conversations on a machine and browser more amenable to quicker linking and faster reading.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary telephone 105 , 110 , shown as a mobile or wireless phone with global positioning capability, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
- the mobile phone 105 , 110 includes an antenna 301 , a transmitter 302 , a receiver 304 , a processor 306 , a storage 308 , a power supply 310 , a display 312 , a duplexer 318 , and a global positioning system (GPS) unit 322 .
- the storage 308 may include a search diary 326 , which is a continuously-updated record of automatically-generated search results according to the present disclosure.
- the search diary 326 may allow deletion of the oldest saved search results as the portion of the storage 308 allocated for is depleted, to make room for newer search results.
- the processor 306 , the storage 308 , the power supply 310 , the display 312 , and the GPS unit 322 are coupled to a communications bus 330 .
- the communications bus 330 is operable to transmit control and communications signals from and between the components connected to the bus 330 , such as power regulation, memory access instructions, GPS location, and other system information.
- the processor 306 is coupled to the receiver 304 and to the transmitter 302 .
- the processor 306 may include the GPS unit 322 .
- the antenna 301 could be configured to connect through the local wireless connection 120 , to include a Wi-Fi connection, ect.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an exemplary method for automatically generating search queries based on an entity list that includes words used sufficiently often in conversation.
- the speech recognition server 134 digitizes the voice conversation between the user of a telephone 105 , 110 and at least one other person into words and phrases.
- the speech recognition server 134 recognizes (or identifies) the words and phrases contained in the digitized audio of the voice conversation.
- the speech recognition server 134 determines, through comparison, whether any of the recognized words and phrases are located in the entity lists database 140 . If there are matches found, at block 416 , the search string generated is sent to the search engine 138 to perform a Web search based thereon.
- the search results are returned to the mobile phone 105 , 110 for display thereon.
- the search results and corresponding query are stored in the search diary 326 , and optionally, in the search diaries database 240 of the search engine 138 .
- the search string of the query is tracked by incrementing a counter for the number of times a search for the same has been submitted to the search engine 138 . This counting could take place either on the speech recognition server 134 or at the search engine 138 .
- the method asks whether the counter, representing the frequency with which the search string has been submitted to the search engine 138 , is above a threshold value. If the answer is yes, at block 444 , the search string (which could be one or more words) is added to each relevant entity list in database 140 , including the global hot-list and/or the personalized entity list. If the answer is no, at block 448 , the counter remains updated, but no further action is taken.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of another embodiment of a method for automatically generating search queries based on words or phrases detected during a user conversation.
- the method provides, at block 500 , a database containing a global hot-list including universal popular keywords or keyword phrases and containing a personalized entity list including keywords and keyword phrases used with a frequency above a determined threshold value in conversations involving a user.
