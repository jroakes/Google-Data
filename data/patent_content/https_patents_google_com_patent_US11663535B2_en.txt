Definitions
- Some computing platforms may provide a user interface from which a user can chat, speak, or otherwise communicate with a virtual, computational assistant (e.g., also referred to as “an intelligent personal assistant” or simply as an “assistant”) to cause the assistant to output useful information, respond to a user's needs, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks.
- a computing device may receive, with a microphone, voice input (e.g., audio data) that corresponds to a user utterance.
- An assistant executing at least in part at the computing device may analyze the voice input and attempt to satisfy the utterance by outputting useful information based on the utterance, responding to a user's needs indicated by the utterance, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks based on the utterance.
- techniques of this disclosure may enable users to communicate with multiple virtual, computational agents/assistants. For instance, there may be several agents available to a user via a computing device that may be at least somewhat capable of responding to an utterance (e.g., request, question, query, order, etc.). An agent may respond to an utterance by performing elements of a task that is identified from the utterance. However, in some scenarios, while a single agent may be capable of performing some elements of a task identified from an utterance, the single agent may not be capable of performing every element needed to complete performance of the task.
- an agent may respond to an utterance by performing elements of a task that is identified from the utterance.
- the single agent may not be capable of performing every element needed to complete performance of the task.
- performance of the elements may be divided up across multiple agents. For instance, a first agent may perform a first sub-set of elements of a task and a second agent may perform a second sub-set of the elements of the task. As some agents may be more computationally efficient at performing certain elements than other agents, dividing performance of elements of a task across multiple agents may allow agents to perform elements at-which they are more computationally efficient, even if the more efficient agents are not capable of performing all of the elements of the task. In this way, the techniques of this disclosure may enable more efficient performance of tasks, which may reduce the power consumption and/or system resource requirements of agent performed tasks.
- a method includes receiving, by one or more processors, a representation of an utterance spoken at a computing device; identifying, by a first computational agent from a plurality of computational agents and based on the utterance, a multi-element task to be performed; and performing, by the first computational agent, a first sub-set of elements of the multi-element task, wherein performing the first sub-set of elements comprises selecting a second computational agent from the plurality of computational agents to perform a second sub-set of elements of the multi-element task, wherein: the first computational agent is a first party computational agent and the second computational agent is a third party computational agent, or the first computational agent is a third party computational agent and the second computational agent is a first party computational agent.

- Some example information fields that may be included in the document, or which may be used to construct the document, include but are not limited to: a description of the agent, one or more entry points of the agent, a category of the agent, one or more triggering phrases of the agent, a website associated with the agent, an indication of a voice to use when synthesizing audio data based on text generated by the agent, and/or a list of the agent's capabilities (e.g., a list of tasks, or task types, that the agent is capable of performing).
- one or more of the information fields may be written in free-form natural language.
- one or more of the information fields may be selected from a pre-defined list.
- the category field may be selected from a pre-defined set of categories (e.g., games, productivity, communication).
- an entry point of an agent may be a device type(s) used to interface with the agent (e.g., cell phone).
- an entry point of an agent may be a resource address or other argument of the agent.
- agent indices 124 may store information related to the use and/or the performance of the available agents.
- agent indices 124 may include an agent-quality score for each available agent.
- the agent-quality scores may be determined based on one or more of: whether a particular agent is selected more often than competing agents, whether the agent's developer has produced other high quality agents, whether the agent's developer has good (or bad) spam scores on other user properties, and whether users typically abandon the agent in the middle of execution.
- the agent-quality scores may be represented as a value between 0 and 1, inclusive.
- Agent indices 124 may provide a mapping between trigger phrases and agents. As discussed above, a developer of a particular agent may provide one or more trigger phrases to be associated with the particular agent. In some examples, to improve the quality of agent selection, local assistant module 122 A may expand upon the provided trigger phrases. For instance, local assistant module 122 A may expand a trigger phrase by expanding the trigger phrase's structure and the synonyms of the key concept of the trigger phrase. Regarding structure expansion, local assistant module 122 A may insert terms, which are commonly used in users' natural language utterances like “please”, “could you” etc., in between the compound of the triggering phase, and then permutate the compound of the phrase.
- the concept of the capabilities of a trigger phrase can be represented as verb and noun.
- local assistant module 122 A may examine a query log of web searches, tag the verb and noun for each query (e.g., using a natural language framework), and build verb clusters based on the tagged verbs and nouns. Within each cluster, all verbs may be considered to have a similar meaning in the context of the same noun. As such, using the verb cluster model, local assistance module 122 A may expand the synonyms of verbs in a triggering phrase associated with an agent, and store the results in agent indices 124 (i.e., as alternate triggering phrases for the agent).
- some trigger phrases may also contain variables that represent relevant sets of data. These data sets may be defined by schema.org types or as a custom specification by the developer. These triggering and parameter value sets are fed into a training system for a text-matching system.
- the training system may convert the specified patterns into a set of rules, represented in an efficient for online query-matching.
- Local assistance module 122 A may also maintain a mapping of text-matching system's rules to the applicable agents.
- One or more components to system 100 may attach metadata about the agent to any associated web site in the web search index.
- This metadata may include the agent's id and the associated agent entry point.
- one or more components to system 100 may log details of the interaction to the user's personal history. As discussed above, the logging may be subject to one or more user controls such that the user may disable logging of agent interactions. In particular, the one or more components of system 100 may only log the details after receiving explicit authorization from the user.
- local assistant module 122 A may receive, from UI module 120 , an indication of a user input provided by a user of computing device 110 .
- local assistant module 122 A may receive an indication of a voice input that corresponds to an utterance provided by a user of computing device 110 .
- local assistant module 122 A may receive an indication of text input provided by a user of computing device 110 (e.g., at a physical and/or a virtual keyboard).
- local assistant module 122 may select an agent from a plurality of agents to satisfy the utterance.
- local assistant module 122 A may determine whether to satisfy the user utterance using a 1P agent (i.e., a 1P agent provided by local assistant module 122 A), a 3P agent (i.e., a 3P agent provided by one of 3P agent modules 128 ), or some combination of 1P agents and 3P agents.
- a 1P agent i.e., a 1P agent provided by local assistant module 122 A
- a 3P agent i.e., a 3P agent provided by one of 3P agent modules 128
- some combination of 1P agents and 3P agents may be determined whether to satisfy the user utterance using a 1P agent (i.e., a 1P agent provided by local assistant module 122 A), a 3P agent (i.e., a 3P agent provided by one of 3P agent modules 128 ), or some combination of 1P agents and 3P agents.
- Local assistant module 122 A may base the agent selection on an analysis of the utterance. As one example, local assistant module 122 A may select, at least initially, a 1P language agent where it is not possible to satisfy the utterance solely using a 3P language agent. As another example, local assistant module 122 A may identify a task based on the utterance and select an agent from the available agents (e.g., the 1P agents and the 3P agents) based on rankings of the agents and/or the capabilities of the available agents to perform the task.
- the available agents e.g., the 1P agents and the 3P agents
- local assistant module 122 A may determine (e.g., based on data included in agent index 124 A) whether the voice input includes one or more pre-determined trigger phrases that are associated with 1P agents or one or more pre-determined trigger phrases that are associated with 3P agents.
- local assistant module 122 A may base the agent selection on whether the voice input includes one or more pre-determined trigger phrases. For instance, if the voice input includes one or more pre-determined trigger phrases that are associated with 1P agents, local assistant module 122 A may select one or more of the 1P agents to satisfy the utterance. In some examples, one or more of the 1P agents are selected, the resulting engagement may be referred to as a 1P experience.
- local assistant module 122 A may select one or more of the 3P agents to satisfy the utterance. For instance, local assistant module 122 A may select a 3P agent of the 3P agents that is associated with the trigger phrases included in the voice input. To perform 3P agent selection, local assistant module 122 A may rank one or more 3P agents based on the utterance. In some examples, local assistant module 122 A may rank all known 3P agents. In some examples, local assistant module 122 A may rank a subset of all known 3P agents. For instance, local assistant module 122 A may rank 3P agents that are pre-configured for use by the user of computing device 110 .
- local assistant module 122 A may select a 3P agent based on rankings. For instance, local assistant module 122 A may select a 3P agent with the highest ranking to satisfy the utterance. In some examples, such as where there is a tie in the rankings and/or if the ranking of the 3P agent with the highest ranking is less than a ranking threshold, local assistant module 122 A may solicit user input to select a 3P language agent to satisfy the utterance. For instance, local assistant module 122 A may cause UI module 120 to output a user interface requesting that the user select a 3P agent from the top N (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) ranked 3P agents to satisfy the utterance.
- N e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
- the selected agent may attempt to satisfy the utterance. For instance, the selected agent may perform one or more actions (e.g., output useful information based on the utterance, respond to a user's needs indicated by the utterance, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks based on the utterance) to satisfy the utterance.
- one or more actions e.g., output useful information based on the utterance, respond to a user's needs indicated by the utterance, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks based on the utterance
- the agents represented by modules 122 may not both be 1P agents.
- the agent represented by local assistant module 122 A may be a 1P agent whereas the agent represented by remote assistant module 122 B may be a 3P agent.
- local assistant module 122 A may utilize 3P remote assistant module 122 B to perform some (or all) of the 3P agent selection, identification, ranking, and/or invoking of other 3P agents.
- local assistant module 122 A may not be able utilize 3P remote assistant module 122 B to perform some (or all) of the 3P agent selection, identification, ranking, and/or invoking of other 3P agents and may perform such tasks locally.

- Agent selection module 227 may select one or more agents to satisfy a user utterance.
- some utterances i.e., user requests
- 3P agents such as utterances that need special assistance (e.g., assistance from a publisher of assistant module 222 ).
- Situations where special assistance is needed to satisfy an utterance may be referred to as 1P experiences because the publisher of assistant module 222 may implement (at least part of, but not always all of) the logic necessary to satisfy the utterance.
- Two examples of utterances that may need special assistance are home automation and overly broad queries.
- assistant module 222 may enable users to register their home automation equipment, such as with assistant module 222 .
- assistant module 222 may look up the configuration information of the user's home automation equipment, and then send an appropriate request to the automation system (e.g., downstairs thermostat) based on to details.
- agent selection module 227 may select a 1P agent to satisfy the utterance. In other words, this process may be implemented as 1P experience.
- agent selection module 227 may select a 1P experience.
- assistant module 222 may ask the user a series of questions to determine what they want to do. For instance, assistant module 222 may say “Do you feel like a movie or a game?” If the user responds by stating that they feel like a game, assistant module 222 may say “Ok, do you like strategy or fantasy games?
- the publisher of assistant module 222 may provide a set of 1P solutions built internally.
- the 1P solutions may be referred to as 1P agents.
- the 1P agents may be associated with (i.e., identified by) a set of 1P triggering phrases identified by the publisher of assistant module 222 .
- 1P experiences may follow two basic models.
- the publisher of assistant module 222 may handle the full experience.
- One such example would be for the utterance “Ok assistant, where were you made?”
- An internally developed experience may respond with a fun response about how and where the assistant was made.
- agent selection module 227 may invoke an agent that implements such a game.
- agent selection module 227 may initially select assistant module 222 (i.e., initially trigger a 1P experience) to asks the user for necessary information such as pick-up and drop-off locations, time, and taxi class.
- agent selection module 227 may select a 3P agent capable of booking a taxi and assistant module 222 may pass the gathered information to the selected 3P agent.
- assistant module 222 may directly pass the gathered information to an external API of an entity capable of booking a taxi. In either of these ways, agent selection module 227 may broker a referral to a 3P agent.
- a user of computing device 210 may provide an utterance at UID 212 , which may generate audio data based on the utterance.
- Some example utterances include, but are not limited to, “I need a ride to the airport”, “tell me a joke”, “show me the recipe for beef wellington.”
- the utterance includes an identification of the 3P assistant that the user wishes to execute the action, such as “Order a small cheese pizza using the GoPizza app.”
- no explicit reference to a 3P agent is made by the user, in which case there is a need to identify candidate 3P agents and select a preferred 3P agent from those candidates.
- Agent selection module 227 may select one or more agents to satisfy the utterance. For instance, agent selection module 227 may determine whether the utterance include any trigger phrases associated with 1P agents or 3P agents. If the utterance matches a 1P triggering phrase, agent selection module 227 may execute the 1P experience. For instance, agent selection module 227 may cause assistant module 222 to satisfy the utterance. If the phrase matches a 3P experience, agent selection module 227 may then send an agent-search request to a service engine.
- the agent-search request may contain the user utterance (i.e., audio data corresponding to the utterance), any matching triggering phrases, and user context determined by context module 230 (e.g., a unique identifier of the user, a location of the user, etc.).
- the service engine may be a component of agent selection module 227 and actions performed by agent selection module 227 may, in some examples, be performed by a separate service engine.
- Agent selection module 227 may consult agent index 224 based on the utterance and any matching triggering phrases. Agent selection module 227 may identify agent documents in agent index 224 that match either the utterance or the triggering phrases. Agent selection module 227 may rank the identified agent documents (e.g., based on a capability level to satisfy the utterance). For instance, agent selection module 227 may multiply a text-match score with an agent-quality score. As discussed above, the agent-quality score may be stored in agent index 224 . The text-match score may be a weighted sum of the matches between the text in the utterance and the text in the agent document. In some examples, agent selection module 227 may give inside the title field, triggering phrases, or category a high weight. In some examples, agent selection module 227 may give matches in the description are given a lower weight.
- agent selection module 227 may also send the utterance through a normal web search (i.e., cause search module 282 to search the web based on the utterance). In some examples, agent selection module 227 may also send the utterance through a normal web search in parallel with the consultation of agent index 224 .
- Agent selection module 227 may analyze the rankings and/or the results from the web search to select an agent to satisfy the utterance. For instance, agent selection module 227 may inspect the web results to determine whether there are web page results associated with agents. If there are web page results associated with agents, agent selection module 227 may, insert the agents associated with the web page results into the ranked results (if said agents are not already included in the ranked results). Agent selection module 227 may boost the agent's rankings according to the strength of the web score. In some examples, agent selection module 227 may also then query a personal history store to determine whether the user has interacted with any of the agents in the result set. If so, agent selection module 227 may we give those agents a boost (i.e., increased ranking) depending on how often the strength of the user's history with them.
- Agent selection module 227 may select a 3P agent to satisfy the utterance based on this final ranked set of agent results. For instance, agent selection module 227 may select a 3P agent with the highest ranking to satisfy the utterance. In some examples, such as where there is a tie in the rankings and/or if the ranking of the 3P agent with the highest ranking is less than a ranking threshold, agent selection module 227 may solicit user input to select a 3P language agent to satisfy the utterance. For instance, agent selection module 227 may cause UI module 220 to output a user interface (i.e., a selection UI) requesting that the user select a 3P agent from N (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) moderately ranked 3P agents to satisfy the utterance. In some examples, the N moderately ranked 3P agents may include the top N ranked agents. In some examples, the N moderately ranked 3P agents may include agents other than the top N ranked agents.
- N e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
- Agent selection module 227 can examine attributes of the agents and/or obtain results from various 3P agents, rank those results, then invoke (i.e., select) the 3P agent providing the highest ranked result. For instance, if the utterance is to “order a pizza”, agent selection module 227 may determine the user's current location, determine which source of pizza is closest to the user's current location, and rank the agent associated with that current location highest. Similarly, agent selection module 227 can poll multiple 3P agents on price of an item, then provide the agent to permit the user to complete the purchase based on the lowest price. Finally, agent selection module 227 can first determine that no 1P agent can fulfill the task, try multiple 3P agents to see if they can, and assuming only one or a few of them can, provide only those agents as options to the user for implementing the task.
- the selected agent may attempt to satisfy the utterance.
- agent selection module 227 may output a request to an entry point of the selected agent, which may be determined by consulting agent index 224 .
- the selected agent may perform one or more actions (e.g., output useful information based on the utterance, respond to a user's needs indicated by the utterance, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks based on the utterance).
- agent selection module 227 may cause assistant module 222 to request user feedback on how well an agent just fulfilled their request. For instance, assistant module 222 may say “You just interacted with the City Transit Schedule agent. In one or two words, how well did it work?” Assistant module 222 may determine, based on the user's response, whether it was a good or bad experience (e.g., using sentiment analysis). Assistant module 222 may determine a score of the experience, and feed the determined score back into ranking. For instance, assistant module 222 may modify the agent-quality score of the agent that fulfilled the request based on the user's feedback about the fulfillment. In this way, the techniques of this disclosure enable agent selection module 227 to select agents based on how well the agents have functioned in the past.
- the utterance includes an identification of the 3P assistant that the user wishes to execute the action, such as “Order a small cheese pizza using the GoPizza app.”
- no explicit reference to a 3P agent is made by the user, in which case there is a need to identify candidate 3P agents and select a preferred 3P agent from those candidates.
- the complexity with such situations is that there may be multiple agents that may be able to order the user a pizza.
- agent selection module 227 may output a selection UI asking the user to select between a Pizza House agent, and a Pizza4U agent.

- An agent selection module e.g., agent selection module 224 and/or agent selection module 324 ) may access this data as part of selecting an agent to satisfy a user's utterance. These techniques may enable the system to better respond to queries such as “order a bottle of prosecco”. In such a situation, an agent selection module can match this utterance to an agent more confidently if the agent has provided their real-time inventory and the inventory indicated that the agent sells prosecco and has prosecco in stock.
- assistant server system 360 may provide an agent directory that users may browse to discover/find agents that they might like to use.
- the directory may have a description of each agent, a list of capabilities (in natural language; e.g., “you can use this agent to order a taxi”, “you can use this agent to find food recipes”). If the user finds an agent in the directory that they would like to use, the user may select the agent and the agent may be made available to the user.
- assistant module 322 may add the agent into agent index 224 and or agent index 324 .

- remote assistant module 122 B while executing at one or more processors of assistant server system 160 may perform operations 500 - 506 , in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is described below within the context of computing device 110 of FIG. 1 .
- computing device 110 may receive an indication of user input that is indicative of a conversation between a user of a computing device and an assistant ( 502 ). For example, a user of computing device 110 may provide the utterance “I need a ride to the airport” at UID 112 that is received by local assistant module 122 A as voice data.
- Computing device 110 may select, based on the user input, an agent from a plurality of agents ( 504 ). For instance, local assistant module 122 A may determine whether the utterance includes one or more triggers words associated with agents of the plurality of agents. If the computing device 110 is able to identify one or more agents that are associated with trigger words included in the utterance, computing device 110 may rank, based at least in part on a comparison between information related to the identified agents and text determined from the utterance, the identified agents. Computing device 110 may select, based at least in part on the ranking, an agent of the identified agents to satisfy the utterance.
- the plurality of agents may one or more first party agents and a plurality of third party agents.
- computing device 110 may determine to select a third party agent (i.e., determine to bring in a third party agent) when the user input does not include any trigger words associated with first party agents.
- the selected agent may determine one or more actions to respond to the user input.
- computing device 110 may perform, at least in part, the one or more actions determined by the selected agent ( 506 ). For instance, where the utterance is to “play a song by Artist A”, the selected agent may cause computing device 110 to play a song by Artist A.
- the one or more actions determined by the selected agent may be performed at least in part by a computing device other than computing device 110 . For instance, where the utterance is “I need a ride to the airport,” the selected agent may output a request to a computing device of a transportation company, and the computing device of the transportation company may route a vehicle to transport the user of computing device 110 to the airport.
- an agent may refer to another agent in the course of interacting with a user.
- a product search agent may refer to a payment agent to arrange payment from a user (e.g., such as when the product search agent cannot handle payment by itself). This may be done as a matter of convenience for the user (e.g., so the user can use a common payment interface and/or to enhance security), or may be done for a fee or other consideration paid by the party to whom the referral is made (e.g., the publisher of the payment agent may receive some consideration for processing the payment).
- FIGS. 6 A- 6 C are flowcharts illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors to select a virtual agent to perform a task, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 6 A- 6 C are described below in the context of system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- local assistant module 122 A while executing at one or more processors of computing device 110 , may perform one or more of operations 602 - 628 , in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- remote assistant module 122 B while executing at one or more processors of assistant server system 160 , may perform one or more of operations 602 - 628 , in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 6 A- 6 C are described below within the context of computing device 110 of FIG. 1 .
- computing device 110 may receive a representation of an utterance spoken at computing device 110 ( 602 ). For example, one or more microphones of UID 112 of computing device 110 may generate audio data that represents a user of computing device 110 saying “turn on my basement lights.” UID 112 may provide the audio data to the assistant provided by local assistant module 122 A and/or remote assistant module 122 B of assistant server system 160 .
- the assistant may identify, based on the utterance, a task to be performed ( 604 ). As one example, where the utterance is “turn on my basement lights,” the assistant may parse the audio data to determine that the task is to activate lights in a room called basement. As another example, where the utterance is “order me a pizza from Pizza Joint delivered home,” the assistant may parse the audio data to determine that the task is to place an order for a pizza for delivery to the user's home address from a place called Pizza Joint. As another example, where the utterance is “ask Search Company what is the average airspeed velocity of a raven,” the assistant may parse the audio data to determine that the task is to perform a web search for the average airspeed velocity of a raven.
- the assistant may determine whether the utterance includes any trigger words (e.g., words or phrases) associated with a first party agent of a plurality of agents ( 606 ). For instance, the assistant may compare words in the utterance with first party trigger phrases included in agent index 124 A. If the utterance includes any trigger words associated with a first party agent (“Yes” branch of 606 ), the assistant may select the first party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the selected first party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- trigger words e.g., words or phrases
- the assistant may select and cause the first party search agent to perform a web search for the average airspeed velocity of a raven.
- the assistant may determine whether the utterance includes any trigger words associated with a third party agent of the plurality of agents ( 612 ). For instance, the assistant may compare words in the utterance with third party trigger phrases included in agent index 124 A. If the utterance includes any a trigger word associated with a particular third party agent (“Yes” branch of 612 , the assistant may select the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- the assistant may select and cause the particular third party ordering agent to create an order for a pizza to be delivered to the user's residence.
- the assistant may rank the agents (e.g., based on their capabilities to perform the task). For instance, if the utterance does not include any trigger words associated with a third party agent (“No” branch of 612 ), the assistant may determine capability levels of a first party agent ( 616 ) and third party agents ( 618 ) to perform the identified task. As one example, to calculate the capability level of the first party agent, the assistant may calculate a metric that indicates how capable the assistant would be of performing the identified task. As another example, the assistant may calculate a respective metric for respective third party agents that indicates how capable the respective third party agent would be of performing the identified task.
- the assistant may calculate a metric for a first 3P agent that indicates how capable the first 3P agent would be of performing the identified task and a metric for a second 3P agent that indicates how capable the second 3P agent would be of performing the identified task.
- the metric may have a positive correlation with capability such that higher values indicate more capable performance.
- the metric may have a negative correlation with capability such that lower values indicate more capable performance.
- the metrics may be calculated in a variety of manners. As one example, the metrics may be calculated based on the agent quality scores (either modified based on the web search or not) or other information stored in agent index 124 as discussed above.
- the assistant may select an agent based on the rankings. For instance, the assistant may determine whether the capability level of the first party agent satisfies a threshold capability level ( 620 ). For example, if the metrics are positively correlated with capability, the assistant may determine whether the capability level of the first party agent is greater than or equal to the threshold capability level. If the capability level of the first party agent satisfies the threshold capability level (“Yes” branch of 620 ), the assistant may select the first party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the selected first party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- a threshold capability level 620
- the assistant may select the first party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the selected first party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- the assistant may determine whether the third party agent with the greatest capability level (hereinafter the “particular third party agent”) satisfies the threshold capability level ( 622 ). If the capability level of the particular third party agent satisfies the threshold capability level (“Yes” branch of 622 ), the assistant may select the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- the assistant may select the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- the assistant may select an agent with a bias toward first party agents. For instance, by evaluating the first party agent before evaluating the third party agents, the assistant may select the first party agent to perform the task so long as the capability level of the first party agent satisfies the threshold capability level (even if a third party agent has a greater capability level than the first party agent). In other examples, the assistant may select an agent without a bias toward first party agents. For instance, if the agent with the greatest capability level satisfies the threshold capability level, the assistant may select the agent to perform the task regardless of whether the agent is first party or third party.
- the assistant may determine capability levels of non-configured third party agents ( 624 ) and determine whether the non-configured third party agent with the greatest capability level (hereinafter the “particular non-configured third party agent”) satisfies the threshold capability level ( 626 ). If the capability level of the particular non-configured third party agent satisfies the threshold capability level (“Yes” branch of 626 ), the assistant may offer to configure the particular non-configured third party agent. For instance, the assistant may output synthesized voice data to ask the user if they would like to configure the particular non-configured third party agent.
- the assistant may select the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 608 ), and cause the particular third party agent to perform the task ( 610 ).
- some 3P agents may require configuration (e.g., being enabled or activates) prior to being used by the assistant.
- configuration e.g., being enabled or activates
- the assistant may output an indication that the utterance cannot be satisfied ( 628 ). For instance, the assistant may output synthesized voice data to say that they assistant “is not sure how to help with that.”
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors to facilitate task performance by multiple virtual agents, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 7 is described below in the context of system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- local assistant module 122 A while executing at one or more processors of computing device 110 may perform one or more of operations 702 - 710 , in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- remote assistant module 122 B while executing at one or more processors of assistant server system 160 may perform one or more of operations 702 - 710 , in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 7 is described below within the context of computing device 110 of FIG. 1 .
- a multi-element task may be a task having elements that may be performed by different agents in order to accomplish the overall task. While the elements of a multi-element task may be performed by multiple agents (e.g., a first agent may perform a first element of a two element task and a second agent may perform the second element), a single agent may still be able to perform all of the elements. In some examples, the selection of another agent to perform a sub-set of elements of a multi-element task may be considered to be an element of the multi-element task.
- computing device 110 may receive a representation of an utterance spoken at computing device 110 ( 702 ). For example, one or more microphones of UID 112 of computing device 110 may generate audio data that represents a user of computing device 110 saying “get me a large cheese pizza delivered home.” UID 112 may provide the audio data to the assistant provided by local assistant module 122 A and/or remote assistant module 122 B of assistant server system 160 .
- a first computational agent from a plurality of computational agents may identify, based on the utterance, a multi-element task to be performed ( 704 ). For instance, where the utterance is “get me a large cheese pizza for delivery,” the first computational agent (e.g., the assistant or an agent provided by one of local 3P agent modules 128 A of FIG. 1 ) may identify the multi-element task as having the following elements 1) determine location of delivery, 2) select agent to order the pizza, and 3) process the order for the large cheese pizza.
- the first computational agent may perform a first sub-set of the elements of the multi-element task ( 706 ) including selecting a second computational agent to perform a second sub-set of the multi-element task ( 708 ).
- the first computational agent may determine the location of delivery and select an agent to order the pizza. To determine the location of delivery, the first computational agent may ask the user where they would like the pizza delivered. For instance, the first computational agent may cause computing device 110 to output synthesized audio data asking “where would you like that delivered to.” The first computational agent may receive the user's reply via one or more microphones of computing device 110 .
- the first computational agent may select a second computational agent to order the pizza to the provided address. For instance, the first computational agent may utilize the techniques of FIGS.
- the first computational agent may select a second computational agent to order the pizza based on capability levels of agents to arrange for delivery of a pizza to the address.
- the first computational agent may communicate with the selected second computational agent to cause the second computational agent to process the order for the large cheese pizza.
- the first computational agent may receive an indication of actions performed by the second computational agent ( 710 ). For instance, the first computational agent may receive, from the second computational agent, a confirmation that the large cheese pizza has been ordered and is expected to be delivered to the provided address by a specified time. Where the first computational agent is a first party agent, the first computational agent may utilize the indication of the actions performed by the second computational agent to monitor the performance of the second computational agent (e.g., to modify an agent quality score of the second computational agent). Determining that a task is a multi-task and splitting each element of the task between different agents allows the most appropriate agent to perform any given step of the task. It may additionally allow the tasks of the multi-task to be carried in parallel. Additionally, user interaction with the computing device 110 is improved. For example, the user may be guided through the process of ordering a pizza, as described above.

In the example where the utterance is “ask Food Agent what I can substitute for baking powder” and “Food Agent” is a third party agent, the assistant may select the Food Agent to satisfy the utterance.
- the selected agent may respond to the utterance by causing computing device 110 to output synthesized audio data.
- the selected agent may provide text on-which computing device 110 may perform text-to-speech (TTS) to generate synthesized audio data.
- TTS text-to-speech
- first party agents may output synthesized audio data using a reserved voice of a plurality of voices whereas third party agents may output synthesized audio data using voices of the plurality of voices other than the reserved voice.
- the techniques of this disclosure enable a first 3P agent may output synthesized audio data using a different voice than a second 3P agent while still providing users an indication of when they are interacting with a 1P agent (i.e., synthesized audio data using the reserved voice). Therefore, further information may be encoded in the audio data when output to the user. The further information may relate to the agent with which the user is interacting which may be encoded by way of the voice used for the output. An example of these voice selection techniques is illustrated in FIG. 8 and described below.
- the assistant may determine whether the selected agent is a first party agent ( 806 ). In the example where the utterance is “ask Food Agent what I can substitute for baking powder” and the Food Agent is selected to satisfy the utterance, the assistant may determine that the selected agent is not a first party agent.
- the selected agent may select a reserved voice from a plurality of voices ( 808 ) and output, using the selected voice, synthesized audio data ( 812 ). For instance, where the utterance is “set my downstairs thermostat to 71” and the selected agent is a 1P agent, the 1P agent may cause computing device 110 to output, using the reserved voice, synthesized audio data saying “setting your downstairs thermostat to seventy-one degrees.”
- the selected agent may a non-reserved voice from the plurality of voices ( 810 ) and output, using the selected voice, synthesized audio data ( 812 ). For instance, where the utterance is “ask Food Agent what I can substitute for baking powder” and the selected agent is the Food Agent 3P agent, the Food Agent may cause computing device 110 to output, using a voice from the plurality of voices other than the reserved voice, synthesized audio data saying “you can substitute one-quarter teaspoon baking soda plus five-eighths teaspoon cream of tartar for one teaspoon.”
- the utterance may be satisfied by outputting synthesized audio data to read a list. For instance, where a task identified based on the utterance is a search, satisfaction of the utterance may include outputting synthesized audio data to read a list of search results.
- a single agent may read all of the elements of a list using a single voice. For instance, the first party agent may read a full list of search results using the reserved voice. In some examples, a single agent may use different voices when reading different sub-sets of elements of a list.
- the first party agent may use a non-reserved voice when outputting synthesized audio data that represents a first sub-set of search results and use the reserved voice when outputting synthesized audio data that represents a second sub-set of search results.
- multiple agents may read different portions of a list using different voices. For instance, a first agent may use a first voice when outputting synthesized audio data that represents a first sub-set of search results and a second agent use a second voice when outputting synthesized audio data that represents a second sub-set of search results.
- An adaptive interface is therefore provided, where the output of the data is adapted based upon the data itself.
- the assistant may cause an agent to perform a task (or at least some elements of a task).
- the assistant may cause a selected agent to perform a task by invoking the selected agent.
- the assistant may send the selected agent (e.g., at an entry point of the selected agent, which may be identified from an agent index) a request to perform the task.
- the selected agent may perform the task locally. For instance, when a 3P agent provided by a local 3P agent module of local 3P agent modules 228 of FIG. 2 is invoked to perform a task, the local 3P agent module of local 3P agent modules 228 may execute at processors 240 to perform the task.
- the selected agent when a selected agent is caused to perform a task, the selected agent may perform the task locally. For instance, when a 3P agent provided by 3P agent module 428 of FIG. 4 is invoked to perform a task, 3P agent module 428 may execute at processors 440 to perform the task. In some examples, when a selected agent is caused to perform a task, the selected agent may perform the task mixed between local and remote environments. For instance, a 3P agent provided by a local 3P agent module of local 3P agent modules 228 of FIG.
- the agent may execute at one or both of processors of computing device 110 and processors of a 3P agent server system that includes the corresponding remote 3P agent module of remote 3P agent modules 128 .
- a method comprising: receiving, by one or more processors, a representation of an utterance spoken at a computing device; identifying, by a first computational agent from a plurality of computational agents and based on the utterance, a multi-element task to be performed; and performing, by the first computational agent, a first sub-set of elements of the multi-element task, wherein performing the first sub-set of elements comprises selecting a second computational agent from the plurality of computational agents to perform a second sub-set of elements of the multi-element task, wherein: the first computational agent is a first party computational agent and the second computational agent is a third party computational agent, or the first computational agent is a third party computational agent and the second computational agent is a first party computational agent.
- performing the first sub-set of elements further comprises: determining, by the first computational agent, that additional information is needed to perform the second sub-set of elements; gathering, by the first computational agent, the additional information; and outputting, by the first computational agent, the gathered additional information to the selected second computational agent.
- outputting the gathered additional information to the selected second computational agent comprises: responsive to determining, by the first computational agent and based on an authorization data store, that the selected second computation agent is authorized to receive the gathered additional information, outputting, by the first computational agent, the gathered additional information to the selected second computational agent.
- selecting the second computational agent from the plurality of computational agents to perform the second sub-set of elements comprises: determining capability levels of respective computational agents of the plurality of agents to perform the second sub-set of elements; and responsive to determining that a capability level of a particular agent of the plurality of agents is a greatest of the determined capability levels, and that the capability level of the particular agent satisfies a threshold capability level, selecting the particular agent as the second computational agent.
