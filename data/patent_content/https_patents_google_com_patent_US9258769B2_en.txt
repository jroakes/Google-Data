- FIG. 1 a wireless network 100 is adapted for communication with a UE 110 via a Node B (base station) 120 .
- the network 100 may include a network control element (NCE) 140 .
- NCE network control element
- the UE 110 includes a data processor (DP) 112 , a memory (MEM) 114 that stores a program (PROG) 116 , and a suitable radio frequency (RF) transceiver 118 for bidirectional wireless communications with the Node B 120 , which also includes a DP 122 , a MEM 124 that stores a PROG 126 , and a suitable RF transceiver 128 .
- the Node B 120 is coupled via a data path 130 to the NCE 140 that also includes a DP 142 and a MEM 144 storing an associated PROG 146 .
- At least one of the PROGs 116 and 126 is assumed to include program instructions that, when executed by the associated DP, enable the electronic device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as will be discussed below in greater detail.
- Base stations 150 and 160 may be coupled to the same NCE 140 as the EUTRAN Node B 120 , as shown.
- the base stations 150 and 10 may be constructed in a manner similar to the EUTRAN Node B 120 .
- the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented at least in part by computer software executable by the DP 112 of the UE 110 and by the DP 122 of the Node B 120 (and corresponding DPs of the base stations 150 and 160 ), or by hardware, or by a combination of software and hardware.

- image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities
- gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities
- music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities
- Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions.
- the MEMs 114 , 124 and 144 may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor-based memory devices, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory.
- the DPs 112 , 122 and 142 may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on a multi-core processor architecture, as non-limiting examples.
- the exemplary embodiments of this invention provide for the use of priority indicators by which a network operator, such as the operator of the network 100 in FIG. 1 , can inform the UE 110 of priorities between UE 110 allowed access technologies.
- allowed access technologies may either be all the access technologies/frequency bands that the UE 110 supports based on its capabilities, or a subset of the supported access technologies based on operator limitations.
- the UE 110 stores in the memory 114 the list of priorities (shown as Priority List 115 in FIG. 1 ) and uses them to move to an access technology with the highest possible priority in the case of a network command (or a UE-determination) to abandon a current access technology.
- the priorities may be signaled to the UE 110 in any of a number of ways.
- the UE 110 may be requested to update its priorities based on system information (SI) changes, and/or only when explicitly requested by the network to update the priorities.
- SI system information
- the priorities are typically semi-static in nature.
- the exemplary embodiments of this invention differ from the HCS approach discussed previously in several important aspects.
- the HCS approach establishes some type of priorities during the idle mode, whereas the priorities established in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention pertain to both the idle mode and to the dedicated mode.
- HCS operates based on a comparison of signal levels between serving and target cells.
- the exemplary embodiments of this invention do not rely on or compare power levels between different cells, but instead promote access to higher priority access technologies only if the higher priority access technology meets certain radio conditions.
- the UE 110 is informed of a given priority for a given access technology (including frequency band/carrier) that the UE 110 is allowed to access.
- a given access technology including frequency band/carrier
- the following non-limiting examples illustrate this principle, where the number in parentheses (indicates the priority level, and fx indicates a frequency band:
- Example 1 EUTRAN (1), UTRAN (2), GERAN (3);
- Example 2 EUTRAN f 3 (1), EUTRAN f 4 (2), EUTRAN f 5 (3);
- EXAMPLE 3 EUTRAN f 3 (1), UTRAN f 6 (2), GERAN f 7 (3).
- Example 2 all of the radio access technologies are EUTRAN, and differ by frequency carrier/band.
- the different frequency carriers f 3 , f 4 and f 5 associated with a single access technology are prioritized by the network for the UE 110 .
- two frequency carriers/bands may overlap one another, or they may be entirely distinct from one another.
- the priorities may be broadcast to the UE 110 (via System Information signaling), and/or they may be provided during special RRC signaling or by UE-core network signaling.
- the UE 110 may keep the priority list 115 in the memory 114 even after abandoning the current network.
- the priorities may be given to the UE 110 in each access network where the UE 110 is located.
- the UE 110 utilizes the priorities as follows. If the UE 110 is commanded by the network 100 to abandon the current network (e.g., due to load reasons), the UE 110 accesses the priority list 115 in order to determine which radio access technology the UE 110 should go/reselect to. In a case where the UE 110 is connected the UE 110 re-establishes the connection using the newly selected access technology.
- the UE 110 attempts to search, measure and reselect to a suitable cell in a higher priority access technology, based on the priority list 115 and on certain minimum signal strength and signal quality thresholds. These minimum signal strength and/or quality threshold(s) may be different from the normal suitability thresholds (e.g., those known as S criteria in UTRA, 3GPP TS 25.304) in order to allow additional hysteresis during cell reselection, as well as to better control the acceptable quality/signal level in a newly selected access technology and selected cell.
- the normal suitability thresholds e.g., those known as S criteria in UTRA, 3GPP TS 25.304
- a change of access technology may occur after a command from the network 100 (in the current access technology) wherein the UE 110 may be enabled to initiate certain inter-RAT/inter-frequency measurements.
- the change of access technology may occur after the UE 110 has autonomously initiated inter-RAT/inter-frequency measurements based on priority knowledge obtained from the priority list 115 .
- the inter-RAT/inter-frequency measurements may also be performed in a periodic manner regardless of the priorities. Certain of the UE 110 measurement details are implementation dependent, although some minimum requirements are defined in the performance specifications and through (RAN2) specifications (e.g., for power saving purposes the UE 110 may reduce the number of measurements made, such as inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements, during DRX).
- the number of measurements may also be minimized during a limited DRX period for performing inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.
- the UE 110 may utilize the priority list 115 and the fact that a predefined minimum signal strength and/or quality threshold(s) is met at least for one cell in at least one of the higher priority access technologies. As opposed to using certain predefined minimum signal strength and/or quality threshold(s) it may be sufficient that the UE 110 has identified at least one cell in at least one of the higher priority access technologies.
- the establishment and use of the priority list 10 E may be included in cell reselection criteria defined for use in E-UTRAN specifications, and possibly also may be included by changes to UTRAN and GERAN specifications. Additionally, the priorities may be utilized for minimizing UE 110 measurements, and changing access technology based on a network command, in current access technologies.
- the UE 110 may abandon the current access technology and selects a cell in another access technology (according to the priority list 115 and corresponding cell reselection criteria where relevant). Before abandoning the current network, the UE 110 may be requested to verify if the conditions to access the target access technology (target cell) meet certain predefined criteria. These predefined criteria may be based on a certain minimum reference signal strength or quality levels, e.g., minimum power level to access a cell. If none of the cells in the highest priority access technology meet the set of predefined criteria, the UE 110 may search for another cell associated with a next highest priority access technology.
- One clear advantage that is gained by the use of the exemplary embodiments of this invention is that the allocation of priorities to the UEs 110 gives the operator an important tool to maintain the UEs 110 in the best access technology (and on a preferred frequency carrier/band), while at the same time providing the UE with access to different access technologies.
- Another clear advantage that is gained by the use of the exemplary embodiments of this invention is that user satisfaction is enhanced, since the probability is increased of operating in the “best” network, and on a “best” frequency carrier/band within the “best network”.
